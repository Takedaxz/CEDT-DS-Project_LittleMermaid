3D printed braille maps - Texas A&M,"This report explores the practical application of 3D printing as a medium for large and small scale braille maps. In October 2016 the Engineering Innovation Center located at Texas A&M University completed a draft run of braille maps printed in a desktop ABS printer. This project resulted when one mechanical engineering freshman took a 3D printing class at the Engineering Innovation Center and reflected on how they could use 3D printed parts to help a vision impaired student find locations across campus. Further collaboration with the Engineering Innovation Center manager resulted in these maps being installed in several local community colleges and a large two foot square map developed for the Texas A&M campus. These maps are printed with topographic details, including a representation of the building, road and walkways, all highlighted with a surface extruded braille header. The project is currently experimenting with various materials including UV and weather resistant plastics and coatings. The ultimate goals is provide all major arteries of the main campus with a sustainable, reliable braille map of the university. This project will conclude with standardized snap together format to make large scale maps from any CAD file to be distributed to any public domain service. Author's Note - This report will highlight the unique perspectives of Tyler Wooten and Jim Wilson. Tyler Wooten is an engineering undergraduate student who created the project concept, developed the prototypes and has generated a working model for presentation to the student body. Jim Wilson manages a large academic maker space for the Texas A&M College of Engineering.

Emerging Scientific and Engineering Opportunities within the Water-Energy Nexus,"Energy and water resources are deeply interconnected. In the United States, the water sector consumes ∼4% of primary energy, and energy generation is the sector where the most water is withdrawn. These competing water-energy demands are global and not unique to the U.S.; this highlights an urgent role for first-principles scientific innovation. The goal of this perspective is to define the scientific context of the water-energy nexus and examine ways in which developing technologies could have an impact on the future of deriving energy from water and, in turn, water from energy. Scientists, perched upon the steep slopes of demand curves for water and energy, are charged with developing enhanced techniques to enable a sustainable water and energy future. Inevitably though, for sustainability to be achieved, there must be a pairing of these innovative new technologies with a more cognizant public perception surrounding water use and reuse. Fundamentally, energy and water resources are deeply interconnected. This presents urgent demands for impactful innovation in light of trends in population and energy consumption. Appropriate technologies can substitute for water in two of its three main roles (thermal medium, solvent, and biological medium); however, innovation is needed as these technologies have evolved over time from engineering needs, and not first-principles scientific thought. Central research priorities in the water-energy nexus are water-free energy generation, CO2 sequestration, low-energy separations, and enhanced fluids. Above all else discussed in the article, water pretreatment is presently a mystery and could transform future water and energy landscapes on an ultimate path to sustainable energy generation with no water waste. Energy and water comprise a fundamental “double helix” of resource consumption. As developing nations industrialize and populations expand, there is an inevitable tension between these two resources. Current approaches to the production and use of water are unlikely to satisfy these increasing (and competing) demands, particularly in light of global climate change. This article describes the scientific context of the water-energy nexus and highlights the prominent role that innovation can have on the future of deriving energy from water and, in turn, water from energy.",Urban J.,Journal,Joule,2017-12-20,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,energy ;  membranes ;  pretreatment ;  thermal ;  thermoelectric ;  wastewater ;  water

A user-friendly college recommending system using user-profiling and matrix factorization technique,"Currently in India college ranking is the issue that is discussed a lot. In this paper, a common forum where students can get information about various engineering colleges and their ranking. There are many websites that give information about various engineering colleges but when it comes to students, for them it is important to know certain insights to parameters like faculty, campus life, hostel facility, placement etc. Students from small cities and villages have less exposure to various Colleges which are funded by state and central government for studies, Research and Innovation. If these students will have sufficient exposure then the young talent will be properly channelized as per their interest. In this we have developed a recommender system that understands information seeker need and accordingly generates recommendations for him/her through simple interface, which provides information to the students and advisors to improve the choice of courses. In our methodology we have opted for hybrid approach which combines advantages of Collaborative filtering algorithm and Content based filtering algorithm to improve our recommendations. The system consists of an interactive User Profiling [9] process in order to construct profile of the User. As the sample datasets that are used for experiments are large and also contain more number of feature sets, it is essential to understand dataset beforehand. Recommending items based on the users interest requires processing of these large datasets, thus if this information is properly profiled then the task of recommending would get a lot easier. Also when results are shown to the user, big challenge is how well data can be ranked so that user satisfaction is guaranteed.",Girase S.; Powar V.; Mukhopadhyay D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceeding - IEEE International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation, ICCCA 2017",2017-12-19,Dr. Vishwanath Karad MIT World Peace University,Matrix Factorization ;  Recommendation System ;  SVD ;  User profiling

Development status and future research emphase on greenhouse horticultural equipment and its relative technology in China,"With the fast increasing of greenhouse scale, the Chinese greenhouse horticultural equipment industry also developed rapidly in recent years. A complete technology system would be establishing gradually. On account of shortage for influencing mechanism between greenhouse environment and plant demand, poor matching of greenhouse with equipment and low level of the whole equipment manufacturing industry, the level of greenhouse horticultural equipment in China is lower than that in developed country in the aspects of technical content, stability, information and intelligent level. The mechanization rate of greenhouse horticulture in China is only 32.45% in 2012, and there was imbalance of mechanization rate among the processes of greenhouse horticulture such as plough, cultivate, harvest, environmental control and so on. These situation limiting the improvement of effectiveness level and labor productivity of greenhouse horticulture industry in China. After the announcement of Made in China 2025 Action Plan, it is necessary to make a systematic summary for equipment and relative technology of greenhouse horticulture in China, and to point out the research main points of the greenhouse horticultural equipment which play the real supporting function roles in greenhouse horticulture. Based on obtaining the present status of Chinese greenhouse horticulture equipment technology exactly, the level of greenhouse horticulture equipment in China was compared with that in the developed country from the aspects of seeding breeding equipment, cultivation producing equipment, logistics transporting equipment, plant management equipment, and the relative gap between countries was found. Meanwhile, the problems existing in the development of Chinese greenhouse horticulture equipment technology were point out, such as: lacking of systematic and constant research and innovation, shortage of accumulation in agronomic technique matching with equipment, absence of systematic research for future technology, insufficiency of integrity and engineering for equipment. The future key research tasks in Chinese greenhouse horticulture equipment were formulated, such as: 1)long-term collaborative research for regional greenhouse horticultural crop growth mechanism, which conducted the continues monitoring for equipment, environment and crop physiology in multi-span greenhouse, Chinese solar greenhouse in the north of China and plastic film greenhouse in the south of China, and established the relation model between mainly environment parameters and crop yield under different greenhouse equipment conditions in different region; 2)technology research for upgrade and update of Chinese solar greenhouse, which developed the new greenhouse structure and cultivation model to achieve whole year planting, labor force saving, land saving and energy saving; 3) whole industrial chain automatic production technology and equipment research, which developed the equipment for seed breeding, cultivation, harvesting and logistics, to archived vegetable automatic production in greenhouse; 4) research for greenhouse horticulture intelligent management equipment, which developed the information management software for large greenhouse production and established regional greenhouse horticulture cloud computing database; 5) research for non-cultivated land greenhouse equipment, which integrated the water saving irrigation technology and soilless cultivation technology to archive planting in greenhouse in non-cultivated land. The policy suggestions were also put forward such as making greenhouse horticultural equipment technology innovation plan, establishing technology promotion service system and so on. This article should provide an important reference for making future planning and policy by government and scientific research institutions and for guiding the innovation of Chinese greenhouse horticulture equipment technology.",Qi F.; Wei X.; Zhang Y.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2017-12-15,Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China;Chinese Academy of Agricultural Engineering,Development status ;  Equipment ;  Greenhouse horticulture ;  Greenhouses ;  Research emphasis ;  Technology

"Co-benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation: A review and classification by type, mitigation sector, and geography","The perceived inability of climate change mitigation goals alone to mobilize sufficient climate change mitigation efforts has, among other factors, led to growing research on the co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study conducts a systematic review (SR) of the literature on the co-benefits of mitigating GHG emissions resulting in 1554 papers. We analyze these papers using bibliometric analysis, including a keyword co-occurrence analysis. We then iteratively develop and present a typology of co-benefits, mitigation sectors, geographic scope, and methods based on the manual double coding of the papers resulting from the SR. We find that the co-benefits from GHG mitigation that have received the largest attention of researchers are impacts on ecosystems, economic activity, health, air pollution, and resource efficiency. The co-benefits that have received the least attention include the impacts on conflict and disaster resilience, poverty alleviation (or exacerbation), energy security, technological spillovers and innovation, and food security. Most research has investigated co-benefits from GHG mitigation in the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU), electricity, transport, and residential sectors, with the industrial sector being the subject of significantly less research. The largest number of co-benefits publications provide analysis at a global level, with relatively few studies providing local (city) level analysis or studying co-benefits in Oceanian or African contexts. Finally, science and engineering methods, in contrast to economic or social science methods, are the methods most commonly employed in co-benefits papers. We conclude that given the potential mobilizing power of understudied co-benefits (e.g. poverty alleviation) and local impacts, the magnitude of GHG emissions from the industrial sector, and the fact that Africa and South America are likely to be severely affected by climate change, there is an opportunity for the research community to fill these gaps.",Deng H.; Liang Q.; Liu L.; Anadon L.,Journal,Environmental Research Letters,2017-12-15,University of Cambridge;Beijing Institute of Technology,bibliometric analysis ;  co-benefits ;  co-occurrence analysis ;  geographic level ;  greenhouse gas mitigation ;  methods ;  sectors

Decentralised laboratories in the German energy transition. Why local renewable energy initiatives must reinvent themselves,"This study addresses research demands for a more critical empirical assessment of the innovation capacity of the decentralised, sub-national level. In Germany, the extensive involvement and contributions of new locally-rooted renewable energy initiatives have been one of the most striking features of the country's energy transition process. This study analyses the enabling conditions, current challenges and future prospects of decentralised experimentation in the German energy system. It finds that whereas the national support scheme has for a long period protected decentralised deployment of renewable energies by locally-rooted actors in the energy field, recent reforms of the scheme now threaten their further participation in the energy market. The paper observes that decentralised initiatives not only struggle to adjust to the new framework conditions. They have also not yet sufficiently addressed the new governance challenges arising from the fact that renewable energies have reached a stage of systemic importance for the whole power system, which requires decentralised initiatives to make their own efforts compatible with overall energy system transition needs. The study concludes that in order to remain an important innovator in the German energy transition, decentralised initiatives have to prove their ability to provide solutions to the systemic challenges of the energy transition process, such as horizontal and vertical multi-level coordination and decentralised contributions to the security of supply.",Beermann J.; Tews K.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2017-12-15,Freie Universität Berlin,Decentralised experimentation ;  Energy transition ;  Germany ;  Multi-level governance ;  Renewable energy support scheme
Human adenosine A<inf>2A</inf> receptor: Molecular mechanism of ligand binding and activation,"Adenosine receptors (ARs) comprise the P1 class of purinergic receptors and belong to the largest family of integral membrane proteins in the human genome, the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). ARs are classified into four subtypes, A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, which are all activated by extracellular adenosine, and play central roles in a broad range of physiological processes, including sleep regulation, angiogenesis and modulation of the immune system. ARs are potential therapeutic targets in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including sleep disorders, cancer, and dementia, which has made them important targets for structural biology. Over a decade of research and innovation has culminated with the publication of more than 30 crystal structures of the human adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), making it one of the best structurally characterized GPCRs at the atomic level. In this review we analyze the structural data reported for A2AR that described for the first time the binding of mode of antagonists, including newly developed drug candidates, synthetic and endogenous agonists, sodium ions and an engineered G protein. These structures have revealed the key conformational changes induced upon agonist and G protein binding that are central to signal transduction by A2AR, and have highlighted both similarities and differences in the activation mechanism of this receptor compared to other class A GPCRs. Finally, comparison of A2AR with the recently solved structures of A1R has provided the first structural insight into the molecular determinants of ligand binding specificity in different AR subtypes.",Carpenter B.; Lebon G.,Journal,Frontiers in Pharmacology,2017-12-14,"Faculty of Science, Engineering and Medicine;Université de Montpellier",Adenosine ;  Drugs ;  G protein ;  GPCR ;  Structural biology ;  X-ray diffraction
Practices of innovative technology and education for sustainability in Taiwan sustainable campus program,"Striving for sustainability has been adopted as a core value and guiding principle for development in the twenty-first century worldwide. Considering the learnings and changes of sustainability in society, especially the connection between software understanding and hardware construction was the key issue for the government. After the Earthquake 921 in 1999, the damages of school buildings started the rethinking of sustainable development in campus. Therefore, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan initiated a national project since 2002 to connect education and practice for sustainability, the Taiwan Sustainable Campus Program (TSCP), which adopt the practices integrated with environmental education and the sustainable renovation in school campuses to transform the sustainable sense from education to change the society. First of all, the Ministry of Education (MOE) organize a technical committee and a research project to set the program mechanism and processes of items with preliminary technical guidelines to guide the school review the problem of existing campus environment in 2002. An integrated process also by demonstration taken the pilot projects as tests to revise the items. In the year of 2003, the 16 items were set to start up the program. These 16 items were set as a step by step renovating processes to help the school working out their own sustainable campus by each unique living environment. Until 2017, more than 778 schools or colleges, about 15.4% of all institutes, have been subsidized by TSCP. At least one sustainable campus can be found in 68% of the smallest administrative units in Taiwan. Hundreds of teaching modules for various subjects, dissemination of sustainable concepts within neighboring communities, and extensive collaboration with grassroots resident for more sustainable societies have been generated and executed. Students learn about the sustainable concepts, ecological environment re-habilitation and green equipment from schools, and bring that home into community. In consideration of lacking the knowledge of adapting sustainable building technology, the Ministry setup the professional committee of sustainable campus to indicate the process of sustainable campus renovation, especially in technologies support and education. Upon the concepts of innovation and integration, ideas including campus rain water management, smart using energy, Bio-climatic control for thermal condition, and high endurance campus have been implemented. On the other hand, examples from higher institution, such as 'The Green Campus Program of NTUT' and 'Magic School of Green Technologies in NCKU', have also demonstrated the TSCP intention of sustainable development based on innovative technology and education. The success of TSCP for its implementation mechanisms and achievements is evident by the high involvements of number of institutions as well as voluntary and productive participation. This successful experience encourages all sectors involved who aims to construct sustainable living environment, and influences the industry changing attitude into sustainable product development. At the same time, the 15 years-long project make the new young generations can have the sense to change the society from now.",Li Y.; Chen H.; Shao W.; Jing S.; Chiu F.; Su H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2017 Pacific Neighborhood Consortium Annual Conference and Joint Meetings: Data Informed Society, PNC 2017",2017-12-13,Shu-Te University;National Cheng Kung University;National Taipei University of Technology;Chia-Nan University of Pharmacy and Science Taiwan;Ministry of Education;National Taitung Junior College,Campus Renovation ;  Ecological solution ;  Energy Consumption ;  Sustainable Campus
Studying the phenomenon of developing interest in learning how to code: What happens to the interest of brazilian undergraduates over an introductory experience,"In some CS0 settings, innovation and use of technology are not always an option due to costs, poor internet infrastructure and cultural aspects of teaching. It also happens that students are not familiar with CS since they are not educated about it at schools. These circumstances pose a more challenging situation in terms of encouraging beginners to become interested in this subject during an introductory course. In this study, we were motivated to study interest for learning coding in naturalistic contexts and from a dynamic point of view. To investigate it in this fashion, the Four-Phase Model of Interest Development was used. Based on an in-depth and a qualitative design, two groups of Brazilian beginners were observed. In this paper, we present how their interests have unfolded and why changes happened. Contextual factors, such as level of structure around the teaching process and tasks, and the educator's attitudes, emerged as positive influences. By understanding why beginners felt interested in engaging with coding, the role of some human factors in these learning experiences came up. Some students were not skilled at self-regulating. Also, when their beliefs of being able to learn coding dropped, willingness to engage was negatively affected. This study brings a non-fragmented view of the process of interest development in learning coding and its complexity. The findings highlight a need for educators to become more informed about how this process takes place and what individual characteristics are involved with it. To some students a motivational learning environment must be thought of not only in terms of a technical point of view, but also in terms of adjusting educators' expectations and discussing how to better manage human factors that play an important role in introductory experiences.",Scaico P.; De Queiroz R.; Dias J.; Scaico A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2017-12-12,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Universidade Federal da Paraíba,CS0 course ;  Interest development ;  Programming education ;  Qualitative research ;  Trajectories of interest
"Longitudinal analysis of instructor actions in an active, blended, and collaborative classroom environment","In recent years, there has been a call for Engineering Education to adopt innovative pedagogical techniques. One such innovation is Purdue University's Freeform environment for teaching undergraduate engineering courses. Freeform aims to enhance student learning with an Active, Blended, and Collaborative (ABC) learning environment. The majority of research into the Freeform environment thus far has focused on student outcomes and the tools Freeform uses rather than instructional practice [1-3]. However, with the growth of Freeform and other ABC environments, the lack of actionable feedback available to instructors about their role and practices is becoming increasingly apparent. Therefore, with the goal of building on the characterization of Freeform and ABC pedagogies in general, this paper presents a one-semester longitudinal analysis of two instructors and comparisons of their actions in this environment. The study concludes that these two instructors retain individuality in their pedagogical choices and adapt their instruction to the material presented while staying within the Freeform ABC ethos throughout the semester.",Zadoks A.; Stites N.; Evenhouse D.; Patel N.; Kandakatla R.; Berger E.; Rhoads J.; DeBoer J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2017-12-12,Purdue University,Active ;  Blended ;  Collaborative ;  Instructor ;  Learning environment ;  Video coding
Do engineering creativity/innovation courses impact engineering innovativeness?,"Through five years of previous NSF-sponsored research working with engineering education programs and major U.S. Corporations, we have identified the most important characteristics of engineering innovators (across and in each phase of the innovation process) and validated a new instrument (ABAKAS = Assessment of Behaviors, Attitudes, Knowledge, Attributes, and Skills) to assess them. In our context, an innovation is a product, process, or concept that has been discovered, developed, and implemented in a sustainable manner in a community. The innovation process is therefore defined to have a beginning (discovery), a middle (development) and a completion phase (implementation). Claims on how to create innovations or be more innovative are as popular as diet plans, but these claims are not connected by evidence to engineering student learning experiences and outcomes. Courses with titles like 'Innovation and Creativity for Engineers' have not provided assessment evidence that these courses positively impact or enable the characteristics that we now know comprise engineering innovativeness. Our key research question is: What is the impact of Creativity/Innovation courses and their ilk (individually or as a sequence) on the engineering innovativeness characteristics of engineering students?",Ferguson D.; Li W.; Weaver J.; Ochs J.; Jablokow K.; Bell-Huff C.; Newstetter W.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2017-12-12,Georgia Institute of Technology;Purdue University;Lawrence Tech.;Penn State;Mercy College of Detroit;Lehigh,Engineer ;  Engineering innovativeness ;  Innovation
Exploring meaning-making and innovation in makerspaces: An ethnographic study of student and faculty perspectives,"In academic makerspaces, students explore innovative practices. Whether they see these spaces as a means to pursue innovation, however, remains to be understood. This paper examines how makerspaces and innovation are connected by the meanings that students and faculty attribute to makerspaces. Ethnographic techniques were used as the methodology to uncover these meanings. The findings presented in this paper are from the Fall 2016 semester where one graduate researcher explored and observed the engineering makerspaces, an elite student group, and an interdisciplinary collaborative research team.

These foci require meaningful communication that elicits a desired response (e.g. adoption of innovation). Innovation advocates and change agents know that communication is critical to a project's success. Without expertise in rhetoric, communications present significant challenges, but they are known challenges in the organizational change literature. We view a focus on communication as a major empowerment tool for advocates and change agents, thereby positively impacting the reach of innovative practices and research into our engineering classrooms. This workshop centers on providing a framework for communication, allies in communication efforts, and best practices in communicating change. We request no more than 40 participants and require only projection capabilities for audio-visual equipment.",Ingram E.; Sukumaran B.; Forin T.; Litzler E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2017-12-12,Henry M.

How 5G wireless (and Concomitant Technologies) will revolutionize healthcare?,"The need to have equitable access to quality healthcare is enshrined in the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which defines the developmental agenda of the UN for the next 15 years. In particular, the third SDG focuses on the need to ""ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"". In this paper, we build the case that 5G wireless technology, along with concomitant emerging technologies (such as IoT, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning), will transform global healthcare systems in the near future. Our optimism around 5G-enabled healthcare stems from a confluence of significant technical pushes that are already at play: apart from the availability of high-throughput low-latency wireless connectivity, other significant factors include the democratization of computing through cloud computing; the democratization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing (e.g., IBMWatson); and the commoditization of data through crowdsourcing and digital exhaust. These technologies together can finally crack a dysfunctional healthcare system that has largely been impervious to technological innovations. We highlight the persistent deficiencies of the current healthcare system and then demonstrate how the 5G-enabled healthcare revolution can fix these deficiencies. We also highlight open technical research challenges, and potential pitfalls, that may hinder the development of such a 5G-enabled health revolution.",Latif S.; Qadir J.; Farooq S.; Imran M.,Journal,Future Internet,2017-12-11,School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science;Information Technology University;Nokia Networks;University of Glasgow,5G ;  Artificial intelligence and machine learning ;  Big data analytics ;  Healthcare ;  Internet of Things
"A Complete Review of Ultra-high Performance Concrete: Design and Preparation, Microstructure, Mechanics and Durability, Engineering Applications","As a new generation of construction material with superior mechanical properties and durability, ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) can be widely applied in various fields such as skyscrapers, ultra-long span bridges, offshore platforms, nuclear reactor containments and military fortifications. With over 20 years' development, considerable strides have been made in the aspects of design, preparation, properties and engineering application of UHPC. In order to promote the further application of UHPC in civil engineering and enable the technical and engineering community to deepen and systematize the perception on UHPC, we herein elaborately introduces the latest research progress and renders an overall summary of UHPC, from several facets including the development history, definition, design theory of mix proportion, preparation technology, microstructure formation mechanism, static mechanical properties, dynamic mechanical properties, durability, and engineering application.

"A ‘third culture’ in economics?: An essay on Smith, Confucius and the rise of China","Concomitant with China’s rise as an economic power, we observe an increasing impact of China on economic thinking. Currently, this happens mostly by the force of example. China’s rise questions some established standards in economic theory, especially in contrast to certain basic assumptions of the so-called Washington consensus in development economics (Rodrik 2006). China’s experience was an important input into the careful revision of certain ideas about strategies of development, summarized in the Growth Report (Commission on Growth and Development 2008), which has been also recognized by theWorld Bank, the major foreign adviser to Chinese economic policy after 1978. This special role of China was also reflected in the appointment of a Chinese economist asWorld Bank Chief Economist, Justin Lin Yifu, who is currently promoting a ‘New Structural Economics’ as an innovative framework for development economics (Lin 2010). Beyond this power of example, recently, China also has begun to submit proposals for reforms of the international economic order, especially with regard to the international monetary system. These observations raise the question of whether China can also emerge as a major source of ideas about economics and economic policy in the near future. This question can be framed in two different ways. One is to ask whether Chinese economists will contribute to the development of economic science, as it stands. This will necessarily happen, and certainly already happens, reflecting the increasing internationalization of Chinese scholarship as a result of the past history of the massive ‘studying abroad’ phenomenon, among other factors. The other perspective on the question refers to the deeper level of the underlying philosophy and ideology of economics. For a long time, this question would have been seen in the light of the traditional and now obsolete contrast between modern economics and Marxism. Today, the ideological foundations of modern Chinese economic development are obscure and mostly seen as non-existent, in the sense of the diagnosis of endemic pragmatism and, possibly, even political cynicism, since what seems compatible with maintaining the current political system also appears to be acceptable as economic policy, as long as the policy fosters economic growth. In this chapter, I wish to focus on this second perspective, yet at an even deeper level. This is the question how far Chinese culture could be a source of novelties in modern conceptions about the fundamentals of economics and economic policy (for my approach to Chinese culture in general, see Herrmann-Pillath 2006, 2009a). This inquiry is different from the search for specific economic ideas emerging from reflections on the rise of China, because it refers to both the domain of economic and philosophical thinking and the domain of general values and conceptions of economic life as embedded into society (for an anthropological view on this relation, see Gudeman 1986). The latter dimension is of interest in the context of economics, because one of the commonplaces of cultural analysis in economics is the assignment of China to the set of so-called ‘collectivist’ cultures in the world. The distinction between ‘individualism’ and ‘collectivism’ is standard lore in the management sciences (Hofstede 1991) but has been also introduced into economics, especially in the context of research into the long-run determinants of economic development (Greif 1994, Greif and Tabellini 2010). This notion does not refer to ideological components of Chinese culture but mainly to behavioral patterns, in the sense of a confluence of social-psychological tendencies and socialstructural facts. Behavioral patterns have been in the focus of many theories about economic development, such as Max Weber’s famous protestantism hypothesis. Very often, they are seen as building blocks of general sets of cultural values which ultimately also find expression in ideologies, such as economic liberalism, which emphasizes the importance of individual liberty and entrepreneurship. Recently, many economists are therefore inclined to highlight long-run legacies of past endowments with institutions, such as different patterns of colonial rule, and therefore tend towards a theory of cultural determinism in economic development (La Porta et al. 1997, Acemoglu et al. 2001, Acemoglu et al. 2002, Guiso et al. 2006; with reference to China: Landes 2006). There is no doubt that China is undergoing landslide social changes, which will also affect those behavioral patterns, and that there is a lively exchange of ideas between China and the world. In this chapter, I wish to explore the potential of these changes as far as China’s role as a source of inspiration in economic thinking is concerned, in the sense of basic conceptions of economic policy and the relation between the economy and society (that is, I do not talk about economics specifically as a scientific discipline). So, I do not venture to identify the existing impact of China but I explore the field in a creative way, as a project in transcultural communication and synthesis. My question is whether we can imagine a ‘third culture’ in economics, in the sense in which this term is used in the theory of crosscultural communication (Casmir 1999; for an earlier attempt, see Herrmann-Pillath 2010). However, this creative exploration builds on a series of facts about China that seem to be neglected especially in those approaches, which emphasize collectivism as a major cultural feature. I put together two perspectives on China. One is the behavioral perspective on collectivism. This mainly refers to fundamental conceptions about economic behavior and social interaction in Chinese popular culture, especially in the rural society; that is, the ‘little tradition’ in anthropological parlance. Considering social change in China today, the dominating force is urbanization and rural change, which will also increase the impact of traditional ways of life on the modern economy; for example, in the context of family business (and not just trigger the modernizing force of urbanization, to which rural society would passively adapt) (for a programmatic statement on this, seeYang 2008). The other perspective sheds light on the ‘great tradition’; that is, in a very broad sense, the meaning of Confucianism in the context of the economy. There is a revival of Confucianism in China today but this might mostly reflect political expedience and the search for national identity after Marxism lost its legitimacy. My interest in classical Chinese thinking flows from my project of creative interpretation: Can we imagine to make sense of certain Confucian principles in the modern world? This exercise is similar to Amartya Sen’s (2009) approach to employ terms from classical Indian philosophy to build a modern theory of justice. Such an approach aims at writing a de-centered intellectual history of the world that does not claim actual lines of impact in the history of ideas, but that reconstructs this history in search for commonalities, shared questions and the potential for future conceptual innovations that arise from those ideational discoveries. That being said, it is important to recognize that common views on ‘modernization as Westernization’ systematically misperceive the factual impact of flows of ideas from East to West throughout history (Hobson 2004). How can we succeed in both endeavours and establish a common framework? There are few theoretical approaches that fuse intellectual history and behavioral analysis, in the sense of historical anthropology and social history. One of them is the work by the sociologist Norbert Elias (1969), who argued that changing patterns of behavior in Western Europe eventually also resulted in principled ideological conceptions about the separating line between the individual and ‘society’ as an abstract idea. Once those conceptions were established, they also gave rise to corresponding narratives about large-scale social and intellectual changes, which have always come close to teleological ideas about progress towards modernity, liberty, individualism, and democracy. In this context, global intellectual history was also implicitely truncated to reflect this self-conception of the West. A foremost example is Adam Smith, whom I also put in the center of this chapter, for that very reason. In doing this, my argument is a companion to Arrighi’s (2007) book, provocatively entitled Adam Smith in Beijing. However, whereasArrighi emphasizes certain structural characteristics of China’s ‘Smithian’ economic system, past and present, I concentrate on the cultural dimension. Smith is regarded as the father of modern economic thinking, especially in terms of its ideological foundations of individualistic liberalism. At the same time, Smith was a behavioral scientist, and his ideas about the economy were rooted in empirical observations about human behavior, especially of the moral kind. Recently, economists have revived their interest in Smith as a behavioral scientist, and have therefore rediscovered his magisterial Theory of Moral Sentiments (Ashraf et al. 2005; Smith [1759] 1976). Indeed, in the history of economic thought, we notice a bias, if not a distortion in claiming Smith as the father of economics, as he was a moral philosopher in the first place. The complexity of his behavioral theory stays in stark contradiction with his reception in economics, and was perceived as the ‘Adam Smith problem’ for a long time (finally settled in the 1976 Glasgow edition; see Raphael and Macfie 1976). I interpret the history of the ‘Adam Smith problem’ as an indicator of the fundamental issue of how far the reception of past ideas is actually a part of the narrative that renders current developments meaningful. If that is the case, a new question looms large: How far can we reach a reassessment of Western intellectual history if we see it in the light of an entirely different and mostly autonomous culture? In other words, reading Smith through the lense of Confucius, what do we see? And how far can what we see contribute to conceptual innovation in the future? Especially, what are the implications for the idea of a liberal economy and society? Classical Chinese thinking was mainly moral philosophy, and so we may ask what are the commonalities and differences between Confucianism and Smith, the moral philosopher? The results of this inquiry are also important for analyzing the behavioral aspects of Chinese culture. As a first step, we can ask in which way Smith’s notions of morality were compatible with related conceptions in Chinese popular culture. In the second step, we have to notice the complex interaction between ‘little tradition’ and ‘great tradition’ in China. Here, the meanings of the term ‘Confucianism’ are ambivalent, reaching from certain elements of popular culture to the philosophical viewpoints of different groups of scholars and eventually to the official ideology of the Chinese empire. On all levels, Confucianism is a construct which in fact synthesizes different ideas stemming from Daoism, Buddhism or the ancient doctrine of Legism with different weights and emphasis, respectively. Official Confucianism adapted elements from popular culture, but often also stood in contrast to it, aiming at the moral transformation of society (for example, regarding the family, see Ebrey 1991). These tensions were part and parcel of Chinese folk religion and popular beliefs about society (see, for example, Feuchtwang 1992). At the same time, Confucian ‘social engineering’, especially with regard to the extended family and its underlying values, was a major force in shaping the homogeneity and resilience of traditional culture in China, ultimately showing the way to an indigenous, yet close to modern national identity already in Ming times (Faure 2007). In this chapter, owing to the limited space available, I can only sketch a rough argument. I begin with an inspiring, although controversial, recent contribution by a Chinese economist and intellectual, who argues that China’s rise may be linked with the global transition to cosmopolitanism, and that this has historical roots in classical Chinese thinking, which he sees as a direct precursor to modern economics as it has been seminally shaped by Adam Smith. In the next section, I put these reinterpretations of classical Chinese thought in the context of our current revisionist view on Chinese economic and social history, which describes Imperial China as a market economy and society sui generis. I then sketch the cultural legacy of this historical structure salient in the ‘little tradition’ of rural China today. Finally, I pull all the threads of the argument together in a synopsis of family resemblances between Confucianism and Adam Smith. I conclude with some observations about the emerging ‘third culture’ in economics that can be discerned from these observations.",Herrmann-Pillath C.,Book,The Adam Smith Review Volume 8,2017-12-06,Frankfurt School of Finance and Management;Frankfurt School,
Materials science and architecture,"Materiality - the use of various materials in architecture - has been fundamental to the design and construction of buildings, and materials science has traditionally responded to needs formulated by design, engineering and construction professionals. Material properties and processes are shaping buildings and influencing how they perform. The advent of technologies such as digital fabrication, robotics and 3D printing have not only accelerated the development of new construction solutions, but have also led to a renewed interest in materials as a catalyst for novel architectural design. In parallel, materials science has transformed from a field that explains materials to one that designs materials from the bottom up. The conflation of these two trends is giving rise to materials-based design research in which architects, engineers and materials scientists work as partners in the conception of new materials systems and their applications. This Review surveys this development for different material classes (wood, ceramics, metals, concrete, glass, synthetic composites and polymers), with an emphasis on recent trends and innovations.",Bechthold M.; Weaver J.,Journal,Nature Reviews Materials,2017-12-05,Harvard University;Harvard Graduate School of Design,
On the use of innovation arguments for getting gender research into STEM,"Recent international top-down initiatives invoke the integration of sex and gender into the governance of all fields of science and technology, from funding to research and development to publication policies, and to the assessment of the impact of scientific knowledge and technical products in society. But how can these initiatives be assessed relative to the call for a new governance of science and technology by inter-disciplinary research? The Gendered Innovations project is a main resource for these governmental actions. This article elaborates on contents and concepts of 'gendered innovations' in relation to the findings and scope of knowledge available from feminist science and technology studies. It contrasts the separation of sex and gender in this project with current changes in dialogue between feminist science and technology studies, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields that can guide transdisciplinary exchange and the acknowledgement of research for sex/gender interactions and intersectional categories. Finally, the strategic invocation of innovation is questioned and the article offers approaches to include feminist epistemologies and postcolonial perspectives in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",Schmitz S.,Book,"Gender Studies and the New Academic Governance: Global Challenges, Glocal Dynamics and Local Impacts",2017-12-04,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,Feminist epistemologies ;  Feminist science and technology studies ;  Gendered innovations project ;  Governance of STEM ;  Innovation ;  Intersectionality ;  Postcolonial perspectives ;  Sex/ Gender
"Work values, conflict, and team cooperation among engineering designers","Engineering designers are crucial for, and primarily drive, corporate research and development innovations. Therefore, this study explored the relationships among the work values, team conflicts, team relationships, loyalty, and team cooperation of engineering designers. A questionnaire survey was conducted to analyse cooperation- and conflict-related factors that affect team operation. In addition, a cooperation–conflict conceptual model was proposed to not only determine how and why the relationships between designers and hiring firms affect designer team cooperation, but also offer specific and practical suggestions. The major contributions and results of this study are as follows. First, this study analysed and explained why the values of designers and teams positively affect team cooperation. Second, this study categorised research and development teams according to the proposed model into four types, namely practical and rational, experienced and efficient, harmonious and trustful, and institutional and authoritative. Finally, strategies and measures for improving the effectiveness of team cooperation were proposed for each type of team.",Hsu Y.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Design,2017-12-02,Tatung University,engineering designer ;  team conflict ;  Team cooperation ;  work values
Research on splitting and alienation of split fault in technological innovation network,"After more than ten years' exploration, scholars have not yet reached a consensus on the formation and evolution mechanism of technological innovation network. Therefore, this paper introduces fault theory into this field. In this paper, the patent application of China's electronic information industry is used as a sample to construct the interorganizational technology innovation network, and explore the mechanism of the split fault on the subgroup polarization in network embedding. The results show that the intensity of the binary relationship embedded in the tissue can cause the potential splitting of the whole network when the distribution of the different members is not uniform. But the split fault has no direct effect on the subgroup polarization. When the structure is embedded and the level of embedding is high, the effect of split fault on subgroup polarization is improved.",Yang Y.; Dang X.; Cheng L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2017 International Conference on Computer Technology, Electronics and Communication, ICCTEC 2017",2017-12-01,Xi'an University of Technology,Common Goal ;  Fault ;  Resource Integration ;  Technology Innovation
Transdisciplinary innovation: Connecting ideas from professional and user networks,"Transdisciplinary innovation — what is it and how does it work?

"How personal, behavioral, and environmental factors predict working in STEMM vs non-STEMM middle-skill careers","Background: Much of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medical (STEMM) education policy and research centers around developing the upper levels of the STEMM workforce sector. However, there are many positions in this workforce, “middle-skill careers,” that are largely responsible for executing the innovations and are largely ignored in STEMM education research. Results: Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988, we found differences in what predicts STEMM-related vs. non-STEMM careers across skill-level. For instance, underrepresented minorities and those exhibiting school transgressions are more likely to be working in middle-skill STEMM fields than in middle-skill non-STEMM fields as adults; the same is not true of the high-skill workforce. Conclusions: One-size-fits-all policies for broadening participation in the STEMM workforce across skill-level are unlikely to be successful. Further, programs that are designed to generate wonder and fascination with STEMM content may be successful in attracting more girls. However, to promote greater participation of individuals from traditionally underrepresented ethnic minority groups in STEMM, programs that support choices toward higher educational attainment, specifically four-year college degree attainment, are more likely to be successful.",Cannady M.; Moore D.; Votruba-Drzal E.; Greenwald E.; Stites R.; Schunn C.,Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2017-12-01,"University of California, Berkeley;University of Pittsburgh;SRI International",Middle-skill ;  STEMM career ;  STEMM education ;  STEMM workforce
Materials and corrosion trends in offshore and subsea oil and gas production,"The ever-growing energy demand requires the exploration and the safe, profitable exploitation of unconventional reserves. The extreme environments of some of these unique prospects challenge the boundaries of traditional engineering alloys, as well as our understanding of the underlying degradation mechanisms that could lead to a failure.

"Student learning outcomes from a pilot medical innovations course with nursing, engineering, and biology undergraduate students","Background: Preparing today’s undergraduate students from science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and related health professions to solve wide-sweeping healthcare challenges is critical. Moreover, it is imperative that educators help students develop the capabilities needed to meet those challenges, including problem solving, collaboration, and an ability to work with rapidly evolving technologies. We piloted a multidisciplinary education (ME) course aimed at filling this gap, and subsequently assessed whether or not students identified achieving the course objectives. In the course, undergraduate students from engineering, pre-nursing (students not yet admitted to the nursing program), and pre-professional health (e.g., pre-med and pre-physician’s assistant) were grouped based on their diversity of background, major, and StrengthsFinder® proficiencies in a MakerSpace to create tangible solutions to health-related problems facing the community. We then used qualitative content analysis to assess the research question: what is the impact of undergraduate multidisciplinary education offered in a MakerSpace on student attitudes towards and perceptions of skills required in their own as well as others occupations? Results: We discovered these students were able to identify and learn capabilities that will be critical in their future work. For example, students appreciated the challenging problems they encountered and the ability to meet demands using cutting-edge technologies including 3D printers. Moreover, they learned the value of working in a multidisciplinary group. We expected some of these findings, such as an increased ability to work in teams. However, some themes were unexpected, including students explicitly appreciating the method of teaching that focused on experiential student learning through faculty mentoring. Conclusions: These findings can be used to guide additional research. Moreover, offering a variety of these courses is a necessary step to prepare students for the current and future workforce. Finally, these classes should include a focus on intentional team creation with the goal of allowing students to solve challenging real-world problems through ethical reasoning and collaboration.",Ludwig P.; Nagel J.; Lewis E.,Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2017-12-01,James Madison University,3D printing ;  Creativity ;  Healthcare ;  Innovative education ;  MakerSpace ;  Multidisciplinary education ;  Qualitative content analysis ;  STEM ;  Technology

Yeast still a beast: Diverse applications of CRISPR/CAS editing technology in S. cerevisiae,"The recent discovery and use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology has provided new opportunities for scientific research in many fields of study including agriculture, genetic disorders, human disease, biotechnology, and basic biological research. The ability to precisely target DNA sequences and either remove, modify, or replace genetic sequences provides a new level of control in nearly all eukaryotic organisms, including budding yeast. Given the many discoveries made in Saccharomyces cerevisiae over the past decades spanning genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry, as well as the development of new technologies that have allowed high throughput screening, robotic automation, and a platform for synthetic genome engineering, the yeast community has also started to recognize the utility and complementary nature of CRISPR-based methodologies. Here we present and review a variety of recent uses of Cas9 in budding yeast—both nuclease dependent and independent applications spanning traditional gene editing and replacement, to transcriptional modulation, to novel uses including the development of living circuitry or robotic platforms for synthetic genome construction.

"""openness"" with and without Information Technology: A framework and a brief history","Over the past two decades, openness (e.g. 'open' innovation, 'open' education and 'open' strategy) has been of increasing interest for researchers and of increasing relevance to practitioners. Openness is often deeply embedded in information technology (IT) and can be both a driver for and a result of innovative IT. To clarify the concept of ""openness"", we provide an overview of the scope of cross-disciplinary research on openness. Based on this overview, we develop a framework of openness, which proposes a higher-order concept of ""openness"" characterised by transparency, access, participation and democracy.

To provide the historical context and to appreciate the role of IT in openness, we discuss two historical examples of openness: the introduction of an open science model in academia (openness without IT) and the emergence of open source software development (openness with IT).

E=mc<sup>2</sup>: Material and energy innovation as a basis for economic growth – Thoughts for scientists and engineers,"Theories that consider technology as the basis for economic growth focus on products – fundamental innovations. These theories have created much interest due to their ability to explain many economic events. However, technology-based long wave theories have been the subject of much criticism by traditional economists. Many of these concerns are addressed by changing a focus on products to engineering materials and forms of energy that are critical for the success of the fundamental innovations. Changing the focus from product to materials and energy not only addresses concerns of economists, but provides insights to scientists and engineers on the development of materials and energy and the management of research throughout the lifecycle of engineered materials and forms of energy.",Linton J.,Journal,Technovation,2017-12-01,Sheffield University Management School;HSE University,

Exploring preferences for impact versus publications among UK business and management academics,"Academics are under increasing pressure to demonstrate the impact of their research with external actors. Some national research assessment systems have mandated academics to document their impact on non-academic actors, and linked research funding to assessments of these impacts. Although there has been considerable debate around the design of these systems, little is known about how academics perceive the value of impact against more conventional academic outputs, such as publications. Using multisource data, including a large-scale survey of UK business and management academics, this paper explores the individual and institutional factors that explain an individual's preference for impact versus publication. The results show that academics display a preference for impact over publications, even when that impact is not associated with requirements of the assessment system in terms of rigour of the underpinning research. The preference for impact over publications is heightened by organization tenure, non-academic work experience, intrinsic career motivations and research-intensive contexts, while it is weakened by academic influence, extrinsic career motives and academic rank. We explore the implications of these findings for the design of research assessment systems and academics’ reactions to them.",Salter A.; Salandra R.; Walker J.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-12-01,"University of Bath, School of Management;Imperial College Business School;Henley Business School",Academic engagement ;  Impact ;  Publications ;  Research assessment systems ;  Research excellence framework
Ideas production and international knowledge spillovers: Digging deeper into emerging countries,"Research and Development (R&D) activities of emerging countries (EMEs) have increased considerably in recent years. Recent micro studies and anecdotal evidence points to industrialized countries as the sources of knowledge in EMEs. In this context, we examine ideas production and international knowledge spillovers in a panel of 31 EMEs by accounting for six diffusion channels and two types (national versus USPTO) of patent filings. Knowledge spillovers to EMEs accruing from (i) the industrialized world, (ii) the emerging world, (iii) different country and regional groups, (iv) selected bilateral cases, and (v) those within the regional clusters of EMEs, are modeled. Spillovers from the industrialized world appear robust via geographical proximity and disembodied channels only. Other conduits, including trade flows, are either insignificant or not robust. Spillovers from the emerging world are virtually non-existent. Analyses of regional clusters of EMEs do not support any role of language, culture or geographical characteristics in knowledge diffusion. Overall, the breadth and depth of knowledge spillovers to EMEs appear extremely moderate; however, we find pockets (specific countries and certain groups) generating positive spillovers. A carefully choreographed policy focusing on such pockets might be fruitful. We hope that this study (i) complements the micro literature, (ii) furthers the existing macro literature and (iii) provides some new policy insights. Our results are robust to a range of robustness checks, including the estimators – a cointegration approach versus a simple fixed effects OLS estimator.",Luintel K.; Khan M.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-12-01,Cardiff Business School;World Intellectual Property Organization,Diffusion ;  Fixed effects ;  Knowledge production ;  Panel integration and cointegration
Invisible transportation infrastructure technology to mitigate energy and environment,"Background: Traditional transportation infrastructure built by heat trapping products and the transportation vehiles run by fossil fuel, both causing deadly climate change. Thus, a new technology of invisible Flying Transportation system has been proposed to mitigate energy and environmental crisis caused by traditional infrastructure system. Methods: Underground Maglev system has been modeled to be constructed for all transportation systems to run the vehicle smoothly just over two feet over the earth surface by propulsive and impulsive force at flying stage. A wind energy modeling has also been added to meet the vehicle’s energy demand when it runs on a non-maglev area. Naturally, all maglev infrastructures network to be covered by evergreen herb except pedestrian walkways to absorb CO2, ambient heat, and moisture (vapor) from the surrounding environment to make it cool. Results: The research revealed that the vehicle will not require any energy since it will run by superconducting electromagnetic force while it runs on a maglev infrastructure area and directed by wind energy while it runs on non-maglev area. Conclusions: The proposed maglev transportation infrastructure technology will indeed be an innovative discovery in modern engineering science which will reduce fossil fuel energy consumption and climate change dramatically.",Hossain M.,Journal,"Energy, Sustainability and Society",2017-12-01,NYU Tandon School of Engineering;Green Globe Technology,Cost reduction ;  Flying transportation ;  Maglev technology ;  Transportation innovation ;  Wind energy for vehicle
From surface science research to high-impact knowhows—Exemplars of Surface Science Western,"Surface Science Western (SSW) is a Canadian center of excellence bearing a mandate to facilitate both interdisciplinary research in surface science and subsequent knowledge/technology transfer. Three exemplars of SSW's accomplishments in this context are here highlighted. The first exemplar began with fundamental studies of nucleation and growth of diamond via chemical vapor deposition. This yielded 2 US patents and the startup of CVD Diamond Corporation which supplies the best diamond-coated cutting tools in the market. The second exemplar started with basic research on colliding weakly adsorbed organic molecules with seemingly unreactive H2 having controllable kinetic energy. While collision-induced dissociation is well known, the outcome from this method in breaking C―H bonds but not other bonds is innovative. With such innovation, weakly adsorbed organic molecules are cross-linked to a well-anchored molecular ultrathin layer with absolute control of chemical functionality. The technology was recently licensed to a jewelry manufacturer for anchoring antimicrobial molecules covalently to the surface of jewelry. The license promises 2 breakthroughs: product safety to human is assured with no unknown chemical functional groups unintentionally formed in the cross-linking process; and the antimicrobial overlayer is thin enough not to compromise the visual appearance of the jewelry. In the third exemplar, results from surface analysis with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were translated to protocols for peak-fitting/assignment of important transition-metal compounds. Such published protocols have been widely cited and now become practical standards in the field. This exemplar best showcases SSW's mission of translating research to high-value-added knowhows.

"Everything in moderation, even hype: Learning from vaccine controversies to strike a balance with CRISPR","The ease and applicability of CRISPR/Cas9 - a new and precise gene editing and reproductive technology - have garnered hype and heightened concern about its potential 'unprecedented and horrific consequences' and have led many scientific leaders to call for a moratorium on its research and use. CRISPR appears distinctly more controversial than previous technological innovations (genetic or otherwise), with a greater reach and speed of human treatment and enhancement; however, we have seen similarly inflated hopes and fears in response to other medical innovations for well over a century. One intervention that has both historically and recently incited alarm - vaccines - serves as a pertinent example of what could go wrong if a technology's reach is shortened due to inflated fears. By comparing the vaccine controversy and the CRISPR debate, we can help separate the hype from the realistic potential of these technologies. How our society grapples with such innovations will determine the extent to which their impact on our individual and collective health will be beneficial. We must recognise the need for a tempered approach to CRISPR conversation leading to regulation and ethical application. Although CRISPR's reach will continue expanding with ongoing research, thus requiring continuous evaluation, the lessons we have learned from the vaccine controversy demonstrate that our approach must not be to shut down regulation and application now, but to thoughtfully conjoin productive debate and action so that therapeutic gene editing can alleviate suffering as soon as possible without precipitating social outcomes we would belatedly deplore.",Benston S.,Journal,Journal of Medical Ethics,2017-12-01,Columbia University,Enhancement ;  Genethics ;  Genetic Engineering ;  Reproductive Medicine
"Science Production in Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg: Comparing the Contributions of Research Universities and Institutes to Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Health","Charting significant growth in science production over the 20th century in four European Union member states, this neo-institutional analysis describes the development and current state of universities and research institutes that bolster Europe’s position as a key region in global science. On-going internationalization and Europeanization of higher education and science has been accompanied by increasing competition as well as collaboration. Despite the policy goals to foster innovation and further expand research capacity, in cross-national and historical comparison neither the level of R&D investments nor country size accounts completely for the differential growth of scientific productivity. Based on a comprehensive historical database from 1900 to 2010, this analysis uncovers both stable and dynamic patterns of production and productivity in Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Measured in peer-reviewed research articles collected in Thomson Reuters’ Science Citation Index Expanded, which includes journals in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Health, we show the varying contributions of different organizational forms, especially research universities and research institutes. Comparing the institutionalization pathways that created the conditions necessary for continuous and strong growth in scientific productivity in the European center of global science emphasizes that the research university is the key organizational form across countries.",Powell J.; Dusdal J.,Journal,Minerva,2017-12-01,University of Luxembourg,"Belgium ;  France ;  Germany ;  Institutionalization ;  Luxembourg ;  Research institute ;  Science Citation Index Expanded ;  Science production ;  Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Health ;  University"
Variety in external knowledge sourcing and innovation novelty: Evidence from the KIBS sector in Spain,"This study explores variety in knowledge sourcing and its impact on the degree of novelty in KIBS innovation. The data analysed are part of the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC) 2013, Spain's contribution to the European-wide Community Innovation Survey (CIS). Some evidence is found of a positive relationship between variety of market sources used and innovations new to the firm, and of a negative relationship between variety of research sources used and new-to-market innovations. R&D is negatively associated with innovation, whereas other internal information sources are positively associated, suggesting that the definition of R&D in KIBS should be broadened. Results differ between t-KIBS and p-KIBS – in particular cooperation is only associated with t-KIBS innovation.",Rodriguez M.; Doloreux D.; Shearmur R.,Journal,Technovation,2017-12-01,KEDGE Business School;Universidad de Granada;HEC Montréal;Université McGill,Innovation ;  KIBS ;  Knowledge sources ;  Novelty ;  R&D ;  Spain
Progress and challenges in incorporating climate change information into transportation research and design,"The vulnerability of our nation's transportation infrastructure to climate change and extreme weather is now well documented and the transportation community has identified numerous strategies to potentially mitigate these vulnerabilities. The challenges to the infrastructure sector presented by climate change can only be met through collaboration between the climate science community, who evaluate what the future will likely look like, and the engineering community, who implement our societal response. To facilitate this process, the authors asked: what progress has been made and what needs to be done now in order to allow for the graceful convergence of these two disciplines? In late 2012, the Infrastructure and Climate Network (ICNet), a National Science Foundation-supported research collaboration network, was established to answer that question. This article presents examples of how the ICNet experience has shown the way toward a new generation of innovation and cross-disciplinary research, challenges that can be address by such collaboration, and specific guidance for partnerships and methods to effectively address complex questions requiring a cogeneration of knowledge.",Douglas E.; Jacobs J.; Hayhoe K.; Silka L.; Daniel J.; Collins M.; Alipour A.; Anderson B.; Hebson C.; Mecray E.; Mallick R.; Zou Q.; Kirshen P.; Miller H.; Kartez J.; Friess L.; Stoner A.; Bell E.; Schwartz C.; Thomas N.; Miller S.; Eckstrom B.; Wake C.,Journal,Journal of Infrastructure Systems,2017-12-01,"College of Engineering and Physical Sciences;College of Engineering at UMass Dartmouth;Maine College of Engineering and Computing;School of Engineering;College of Engineering;University of Rhode Island’s College of Engineering;A.

Mitigating diminishing returns to R&D: The role of information technology in innovation,"Increasingly, firms across many industries are grappling with the challenge of declining returns to research and development (R&D). In this study, we investigate if and how information technology (IT) can help firms deal with this problem. We theorize that IT systems can help firms to cope with the complexity and inefficiency in managing innovation when R&D investments scale. We explicate the mechanisms through which IT enables firms to cope with the challenges they face when scaling their R&D and we posit that IT will mitigate the diminishing returns to R&D. Using archival data for 161 firms from 1991 to 2003 we find support for our conjecture that IT mitigates the diminishing returns to R&D. The mitigating effect of IT is stronger for firms facing greater complexity in their R&D activities, as measured by inventor intensity and geographical and technological complexity. We interpret and discuss these findings and their practical and theoretical implications.",Ravichandran T.; Han S.; Mithas S.,Journal,Information Systems Research,2017-12-01,Lally School of Management;Robert H.

The state-of-play and future of antibody therapeutics,"It has been over four decades since the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using a hybridoma cell line was first reported. Since then more than thirty therapeutic antibodies have been marketed, mostly as oncology, autoimmune and inflammatory therapeutics. While antibodies are very efficient, their cost-effectiveness has always been discussed owing to their high costs, accumulating to more than one billion dollars from preclinical development through to market approval. Because of this, therapeutic antibodies are inaccessible to some patients in both developed and developing countries. The growing interest in biosimilar antibodies as affordable versions of therapeutic antibodies may provide alternative treatment options as well potentially decreasing costs. As certain markets begin to capitalize on this opportunity, regulatory authorities continue to refine the requirements for demonstrating quality, efficacy and safety of biosimilar compared to originator products. In addition to biosimilars, innovations in antibody engineering are providing the opportunity to design biobetter antibodies with improved properties to maximize efficacy. Enhancing effector function, antibody drug conjugates (ADC) or targeting multiple disease pathways via multi-specific antibodies are being explored. The manufacturing process of antibodies is also moving forward with advancements relating to host cell production and purification processes. Studies into the physical and chemical degradation pathways of antibodies are contributing to the design of more stable proteins guided by computational tools. Moreover, the delivery and pharmacokinetics of antibody-based therapeutics are improving as optimized formulations are pursued through the implementation of recent innovations in the field.",Elgundi Z.; Reslan M.; Cruz E.; Sifniotis V.; Kayser V.,Journal,Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,2017-12-01,The University of Sydney,Antibody drug conjugates (ADC) ;  Antibody engineering ;  Biobetters ;  Biologicals ;  Biosimilars ;  Bispecific antibodies ;  Degradation ;  Formulation ;  Manufacture ;  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ;  Stability ;  Therapeutic antibodies
Impacts of innovativeness and attitude on entrepreneurial intention: among engineering and non-engineering students,"This study attempted to explore the impacts of attitudinal antecedents on students’ entrepreneurial intention. Comparisons between students of engineering and non-engineering backgrounds and gender groups were made. Total of 998 students from universities in Hong Kong were surveyed, leading to a number of highlights in the study. First, it is found that the learning motivation strongly correlates with innovativeness, which in return affects the entrepreneurship intention. Second, the educational measures designed for senior year students would be slightly different from those for junior year students, whilst the junior year students may need more facilitation to motivate their learning. Thirdly, the ‘innovativeness’ of engineering students is found significantly and strongly correlated to ‘self-efficacy’ and significantly to ‘attitude’. The ‘attitude’ of engineering students is found more significantly contributing to their ‘entrepreneurial intention’. The interesting results show that for engineering students, though perceiving higher levels of innovativeness, ‘attitudes’ and ‘entrepreneurial intention’, the critical attributes in determining ‘entrepreneurial intention’ are ‘attitudes’ and ‘self-efficacy’. Fourthly, attitudes seem a lot more influencing to the entrepreneurial intention among female students, whilst ‘innovation’ is the a lot more influencing among male students. There are some limitations in this study, such as the sample size and survey design. In order to secure a high level of content validity, some items of the constructs are excluded possibly due to the sample size and the uneven numbers of the different sample groups. Future study is recommended to include students from different countries in order to have more representative results, and the research model could be further extended to explore the effects of other demographic parameters.",Law K.; Breznik K.,Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2017-12-01,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University;International School for Social and Business Studies,Attitude ;  Engineering education ;  Engineering students ;  Entrepreneurial intention ;  Innovativeness
Industry–academia collaborations in software testing: experience and success stories from Canada and Turkey,"Collaboration between industry and academia supports improvement and innovation in industry and helps to ensure industrial relevance in academic research. However, many researchers and practitioners believe that the level of joint industry–academia collaborations (IAC) in software engineering (SE) is still relatively very low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. The goal of the empirical study reported in this paper is to characterize a set of collaborative industry–academia R&D projects in the area of software testing conducted by the authors (based in Canada and Turkey) with respect to a set of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns identified by a recent Systematic Literature Review study, with the aim of contributing to the body of evidence in the area of IAC, for the benefit of SE researchers and practitioners in conducting successful IAC projects in software testing and in software engineering in general. To address the above goal, a pool of ten IAC projects (six completed, two failed and two ongoing) all in the area of software testing, which the authors have led or have had active roles in, were selected as objects of study and were analyzed (both quantitatively and qualitatively) with respect to the set of selected challenges, patterns and anti-patterns. As outputs, the study presents a set of empirical findings and evidence-based recommendations, e.g.: it has been observed that even if an IAC project may seem perfect from many aspects, one single major challenge (e.g., disagreement in confidentiality agreements) can lead to its failure. Thus, we recommend that both parties (academics and practitioners) consider all the challenges early on and proactively work together to eliminate the risk of challenges in IAC projects. We furthermore report correlation and interrelationship of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns with project success measures. This study hopes to encourage and benefit other SE researchers and practitioners in conducting successful IAC projects in software testing and in software engineering in general in the future.",Garousi V.; Eskandar M.; Herkiloğlu K.,Journal,Software Quality Journal,2017-12-01,Havelsan A.S.;Hacettepe Üniversitesi;Maral Software Engineering Consulting Corporation;MR Control Systems International Inc.,Anti-patterns ;  Challenges ;  Empirical study ;  Evidence ;  Experience report ;  Industry–academia collaborations ;  Software engineering ;  Software testing ;  Success factors (patterns)
An empirical approach for optimizing globally distributed software product engineering,"A distributed software product engineering team has to deal with the additional issue of distribution apart from the usual expectations around cost, quality, time to market and innovation. Distribution of work brings in the issues of temporal, geographical and cultural separation. In spite of individually following the prescribed software engineering processes, often the distributed teams fail to act as a single product team. It is also a well accepted truth that misaligned distributed teams rarely produce satisfactory outcome. The short life cycle for Internet based products adds to these challenges. As a result, global software product engineering is still somewhat immature. In this paper we describe an empirical study to diagnose, detect and cure the health issues in a distributed software product engineering program. This consists of steps such as problem identification, research review, study design, validity consideration, data analysis and conclusion. The key hypothesis in this approach is the assumption that most distributed software product engineering teams in the same organization require alignment rather than bottom up retooling in the form of an elaborate software engineering initiative and this alignment can be achieved in a fast and effective manner by aligning the key interface leaders. By focusing first on causes of misalignment between different parts of distributed team, the root causes behind lack of satisfactory outcome can be quickly surfaced. This top down method is a departure from the usual bottom up approach of starting from process adherence. This approach allows the distributed teams to retain their cultural idiosyncrasies that are hard to remove. This paper shares the experience from such an initiative undertaken in an Internet based product company doing software product engineering across India and USA.",Das B.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics, ICACCI 2017",2017-11-30,PES University,Change program ;  Collaboration maturity ;  Empirical ;  Globally distributed ;  Key interface pair ;  Optimization ;  Role ;  Skill ;  Work partitioning

Innovation management: A need-centered optimal joint investment approach,"With exponential advances in technology innovations, effective management of innovation has become imperative. Existing literature on innovation management has largely focused on managing product, project, and operations or on motivating creativity in the innovation process. This paper presents an alternative integrated and systematic approach that focuses on managing the needs of all major participants of the innovation process: The idea generator, the core team, the supporter, and the adopter, to achieve an optimal joint investment in the development and implementation of a creative idea. Based on this approach, innovation management consists of three key elements: (1) productive creativity that uses the understanding of needs to motivate idea generation that will effectively respond to the needs of the other major participants; (2) impactful marketing that uses the understanding of the needs to effectively communicate and persuade the acceptance of the creative idea by the other major participants; and (3) adaptive organization that uses the understanding of the needs to develop flexible and sustainable structure and culture of the organization to effectively adapt to changes in the environment as well as challenges to the organization as it grows and matures with time. For each key element, the paper outlines the basic concepts, specific tools, and case examples for its successful accomplishment, and explores future areas of research.",Yu O.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2017 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management for the Interconnected World, Proceedings",2017-11-29,San Jose State University,
Requirements engineering principles applicable to technology and innovation management,"In the field of Technology and Innovation Management, several key principles have been identified in literature. These include technology development, technology improvement, technology leadership, technology partnerships and supplier participation, technology pioneering, technological integration, technological value and technology standards. Many of these key principles are based on actions that are intended to provide a new or enhanced technology, product or service to the consumer market. It is however important that this new or enhanced product or service that results for the innovation process, does indeed address a market or user need. This is the focus of the field of Requirements Engineering in the determination of market and user need. Research in this field have identified various challenges and pitfalls that exist that may hinder the determination of the actual need and the consequential acceptance of the new or enhanced technology by the market or user. The purpose of this paper is to explore areas of commonality within the requirements engineering domain that may be applicable to technology and innovation management and that can be exploited to add value and reduce risk.",Scribante N.; Pretorius L.; Benade S.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2017 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management for the Interconnected World, Proceedings",2017-11-29,University of Pretoria,
Contextual differentiation of absorptive capacity: Empirical and conceptual development,"This paper is focused on the research and operationalization of the absorption capacity in technology driven firms with a particular focus on their technology based innovation performances, which is widely recognised as a means of achieving and maintaining the firms' competitive advantage. Although research in the field of absorption capacity was globally initiated more than two and a half decades ago, the same was not at all the case with Eastern European firms. Considering that, the research objective of this paper arises: what is the level of the absorptive capacity in technology driven Croatian firms and how does it catalyse their innovation outputs? Our specific objectives are to measure the integrated level of the absorptive capacity (ACAP) with respect to all its constituent components; assimilation, acquisition, transformation and exploitation. Such an ACAP measured value will be tabulated against the innovation outputs of firms and their business performances. To achieve these objectives a selected population of more than 200 Croatian firms that are dealing technology development was defined as a sample and asked to fill the questionnaire. Forty five of them that have fully responded were tested against formulated hypothesis ultimately proving that the higher level of ACAP is somehow positively driving their innovation performances.",Dabic M.; Vlačić E.; Daim T.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2017 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management for the Interconnected World, Proceedings",2017-11-29,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business;Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science;Nottingham Trent University;NOVAMINA CIT",

Dynamic network analysis of inter-firm R&D cooperation based on Internet information: A case study of Google,"With the implementation of China's innovative national development strategy, R & D cooperation has become an important way to enhance technological innovation capability of enterprises. Inter-firm R&D cooperation promote enterprises to obtain complementary knowledge and ability, and has an important impact on technological innovation and development of enterprises. However, as a result of the variability of enterprise strategies and external environment, inter-firm R&D cooperation network presents the dynamic change. The purpose of this paper is to examine the evolutionary dynamics of inter-firm R&D cooperation network. This paper takes Google as a focal firm, using Internet information to construct R&D cooperation network. Then we use Dynamic Network Analysis to explore the characteristics of network structure including time, scale, pattern and technology. Firstly, clustering of partners with the same cooperative content in three different stages. Secondly, we try to take Standard Industrial Classification to conduct industrial division of cooperative enterprises. Thirdly, the establishment time of the cooperative enterprise is analyzed statistically. Finally, we summarize and analyze the overall evolutionary features of Google R&D cooperative network according to the research. The results suggest that Google R&D cooperation is based on its technological innovation advantages, the R&D cooperation between Google and Google partners enable both of them to take advantage of complementary capabilities, facilitate product development and technology integration for an enhanced market share. In addition, at the different stages of development of Google, the selection of cooperative enterprises is changing and it reflects there is a certain cooperation standard when Google initially chooses a partner.",Wu F.; Li Q.; Li X.; Huang L.; Wang X.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2017 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management for the Interconnected World, Proceedings",2017-11-29,Beijing University of Technology;Research Base of Beijing Modern Manufacturing Development,
Producing and communicating an interactive popular science video for New Media: Using as an example the theme of marine microplastics spelling big problems for future generations,"Science is an important part of human life. It is the application process and the construction of knowledge regarding a phenomenon of nature. Scientific development and technology management are the basis for national development, social progress, and an important indicator of overall competitiveness of a country. Therefore it relies on education to improve people's scientific literacy. Using media to convey scientific knowledge to the community is one of the best approaches, using diverse channels and platforms to pass on scientific information and knowledge, and thus enhance the public's scientific literacy and help with new technology or innovation diffusion. To communicate scientific information adequately, the mass media need to provide suitable information and channels so the community can acquire new information, and thus innovations can be generated. In addition, new media have become quite important and convenient for a new generation. The purpose of this study is to illustrate ways to plan and produce an interactive short film regarding environmental science or technology issues for new media so as to increase audience learning retention and involvement with regards to scientific topics and to do so at a lower cost and higher efficiency.

Requirements-Based matching approach to configurate cyber-physical systems for SMEs,"This paper addresses the challenge of modelling individual cyber-physical systems (CPS) for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing industries. CPS are key technology building blocks for the implementation of Industrie 4.0. Especially for SMEs the increase of production efficiency and reduction of manufacturing costs through CPS offer potential to maintain their competitiveness and innovation capacity. Although SMEs perceive the potential of CPS, they often lack financial and human resources to acquire the necessary CPS-competencies as well as an overview of all the currently available technological solutions. To overcome this issue a matching platform will offer SMEs support in finding suitable CPS-components by letting them express their functional and technical requirements. The matching logic is based on a set of morphologies that encompasses the functional and requirement spectrum of CPS-components. The matching algorithm analyses the input for congruence of requirements and available technologies and suggests suitable technology combinations. This paper describes the methodology of the matching platform, and introduces the research work to define and to develop the technology morphologies. The presented results facilitate the selection and configuration of CPS for SMEs.",Jordan F.; Bernardy A.; Stroh M.; Horeis J.; Stich V.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2017 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management for the Interconnected World, Proceedings",2017-11-29,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,
A framework for understanding convergence-based innovation: A study of canadian ventures,"Many entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, researchers, and policy makers view multidisciplinary convergence-based innovation as a primary source of competitive advantage in the globalized world of the 21st century. Convergence-based innovation is the integration of specialized knowledge from two or more fields or disciplines. The premise is that this type of innovation can lead to greater discovery and creativity which can result in new areas of knowledge, products with longer staying power, and more significant social benefits. This paper focuses on the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the entrepreneurial activity of convergence-based innovation. This framework is described as having three dimensions: content, process, and context. We report the findings in several of our research studies to provide further understanding of these three dimensions. The intent of this paper is to provide both descriptive and prescriptive perspectives that will be beneficial to those managing the entrepreneurial activities of knowledge creation and innovation - whether in small start-up high-tech firms or multi-national corporations. This can also assist faculty and researchers seeking to educate the next generation to live and work in an open-platform cross-disciplinary world.",Ensign P.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2017 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management for the Interconnected World, Proceedings",2017-11-29,Lazaridis School of Business and Economics,

Why is Korea lagging behind in electric vehicle technology innovation?: Analysis of Korea's electric vehicle technology innovation policy through the lens of systems of innovation approach,"This study analyzes the electric vehicle (EV) innovation policy in Korea. Korea has a number of good preconditions and indigenous capabilities that can create a new EV market and deploy EVs fast across a nation. Korea also has urgent needs to adopt EVs and develop advanced EV technologies as it is vulnerable to energy supply disruptions. Despite these pre-conditions and urgent needs, however, none of the domestic automobile makers so far have sold its own EV to the global market, and the adoption of EVs is very low domestically. Consequently, technological innovation of EVs in Korea lags behind. This cannot be solely explained by the neoclassical view of 'market failures' in an increasingly interdependent and interconnected system, it, instead, can be explained by systemic failures. Based on the problems and evidences, this paper reveals some distinctive features answering the following questions:; (i) why such advanced technologies are not introduced in the market place when they delivers a variety of benefits to society when the society has urgent needs:, (ii) if there is no market, what are the role of actors and institutions, in introducing and deploying these technologies:, (iii) what is the society's particular character in technological innovation and what are the barriers, (iv) How can the new technological innovation be introduced and sustained in the current system?.",Lee M.; He G.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2017 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management for the Interconnected World, Proceedings",2017-11-29,"The State University of New York, Korea;College of Engineering and Applied Sciences",

Rebooting the data access hierarchy of computing systems,"We have been experiencing two very important movements in computing. On the one hand, a tremendous amount of resource has been invested into innovative applications such as first-principle-based methods, deep learning and cognitive computing. On the other hand, the industry has been taking a technological path where application performance and energy efficiency vary by more than two orders of magnitude depending on their parallelism, heterogeneity, and locality. We envision that a “perfect storm” is coming because of the interaction between these two movements. Many of these new and high-valued applications need to touch a very large amount of data with little data reuse and data movement has become the dominating factor for both power and performance of these applications. It will be critical to match the compute throughput to the data access bandwidth and to locate the compute near data. Much has been and continuously needs to be learned about algorithms, languages, compilers and hardware architecture in this movement. What are the killer applications that may become the new driver for future technology development? How hard is it to program existing systems to address the data movement issues today? How will we program these systems in the future? How will innovations in memory devices present further opportunities and challenges in designing new systems?

Enterprise management and systems engineering for a mobile power grid,"Coordinated mobility of people, goods, and energy is a foremost concern of infrastructure development. For example, deployment of advanced chargers and the associated communications networks will enable electric-vehicle fleets to serve particular needs of the power grid and microgrids. Incorporating plug-in electric vehicles as agents of energy storage in the grid can provide services to ancillary markets including frequency regulation. To prioritize research and development (RandD), this paper quantifies the sensitivity of vehicle-to-grid enterprise initiatives and milestones subject to a variety of emergent and future conditions, and demonstrates how the results of the analysis can be used for further investigation of initiatives. These conditions involve technology innovation (fast bi-directional chargers and related information technologies), environment, market prices, regulations, organizations, behaviors, workforce, etc. The results identify combinations of conditions for which research and development (RandD) are most beneficial. The approach includes scenario-based preferences to inform decision makers which initiatives are robust to variety of emergent and future conditions, thus supporting resilience of plans for electric vehicle fleets in logistics systems. An RandD initiative of particular concern is regional resource planning.

A preliminary study on the suitability of stack overflow for open innovation in requirements engineering,"Due to lack of resources (funds, social influence, user feedback etc.), small companies, in particular, start-up companies, almost exclusively must rely on their own expertise with regards to technological innovation. Therefore, it could be beneficial for them to analyze big companies or competitors? products in order to get a better understanding of what users think about them. The core idea of my research project is to use opinions voiced by users about strengths and weaknesses of competitors? products to improve the understanding of actual user needs and thus help focus the requirements definition of the small, especially start-up company?s own product. In order to lower the cost of analysis, we investigate how user needs can be distilled from online open sources. Since there are different types of online open sources, as a starting point of our current stage of research, we focused on one type of online open sources - question and answer (Q&A) sites such as Stack Overflow. As a showcase, we used the IDE project Eclipse. In our exploratory study, we analyzed the popularity of Eclipse, the amount of questions asked, the amount of questions asked that received an accepted answer, as well as the contents of questions asked about Eclipse. We also analyzed the emotional polarity of the posted questions. We found that the Stack Overflow timely updates, and the emotions reflected is more objective according to the result shown by sentiment analysis that 82% questions show neutral emotion.",Yin H.; Pfahl D.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017-11-24,Tartu Ülikool,Data mining ;  Eclipse ;  Open Innovation ;  Requirements Engineering ;  Stack Overflow
The influence of knowledge sharing behavior and transactive memory systems on innovative work behavior: A conceptual model,"Although knowledge sharing (KS), the key to creativity and innovation, are increasingly common in organisations, research on the relationship between knowledge sharing behaviour (KSB) and transactive memory system (TMS) and its effect on innovative work behaviour (IWB) is relatively rare. Prior studies have reported that KS influences IWB in organisations. However, the effect of KSB on IWB and the join influence between TMS on KS and IWB have not been adequately investigated in past research. Therefore, the goal of this research-in-progress is to propose a conceptual model comprising three construct domains including KSB, TMS quality and IWB to examine the impact of the KS practices of employees on their IWB in organisations. We advance to conduct a survey to examine our discussion of the proposed conceptual model.

Drivers of innovation success in sustainable businesses,"Based on Stevenson's (1983) modified conceptualisation of entrepreneurship, this study illuminates the set of opportunity-based management practices across organisational levels. This empirical study of 301 employees from four sustainable-oriented organisations contributes to an understanding of the harmonising nature of sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation. Overall, Stevenson's construct dimensions include strategic orientation, resource orientation, management structure, reward philosophy, growth orientation and entrepreneurial culture to determine a firm's level of entrepreneurial orientation. The present study confirms the widespread perception that these constructs have a significant, positive impact on a firm's innovation success. The results indicate that these dimensions are significant and positive predictors of perceived innovation success within sustainable businesses, thus expanding entrepreneurial theory with findings of significant impact on the success of innovation. This study's results also add to the research on entrepreneurship–innovation interplays. From a practical perspective, Stevenson's multilevel entrepreneurial approach offers drivers of innovation success in sustainable businesses. Thus, Stevenson's concept of entrepreneurship could be used as a predicting indicator to promote sustainable innovation success throughout different company levels.

He received his PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Illinois, performed postdoctoral work at U.C. Berkeley, and was a Lawrence Fellow at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Dr. Grossman's group uses a combination of modeling and experiment to gain fundamental understanding, develop new insights based on this understanding, then use these insights to develop new materials with improved properties for energy conversion, energy storage, and membrane-based separation technologies. There exists a gap between applied academic research and commercial viability illustrated here through a case study in membrane technologies. Despite hundreds of new proposals for materials, commercially available membranes for water filtration and other applications have largely remained unchanged. Yet the potential benefits of new membrane materials are enormous.

A support approach for the conceptual design of energy-efficient cooker hoods,"In Europe, kitchen hoods currently come with an energy label showing their energy efficiency class and other information regarding the energy consumption and noise level, as established by the European Energy Labelling Directive. Because of recent regulations, designs of cooker hoods must consider new issues, such as the evaluation of the energy efficiency, analysis of the energy consumption, and product lifecycle impact. Therefore, the development of eco-driven products requires Ecodesign tools to support eco-innovation and related sustainability improvements. The scope of the proposed research is to define a method and an agile and affordable platform tool that can support designers in the early estimation of product energy performance, including the calculation of energy efficiency indexes. The approach also considers the use of genetic algorithm methods to optimize the product configuration in terms of energy efficiency. The research context concerns large and small productions of kitchen hoods. The paper describes the methodological approach within the developed tool. The results show a good correlation between real efficiency values and calculated ones. A validation activity has been described, and a test case shows how to apply the proposed approach for the design of a new efficient product with an A-class Energy Efficiency Index.",Cicconi P.; Landi D.; Germani M.; Russo A.,Journal,Applied Energy,2017-11-15,Università Politecnica delle Marche,Ecodesign ;  Energy label ;  Knowledge-based engineering ;  Optimization ;  Product configuration ;  Virtual prototyping
Improving building performance using smart building concept: Benefit cost ratio comparison,"Smart building concept is an implementation of technology developed in the construction industry throughout the world. However, the implementation of this concept is still below expectations due to various obstacles such as higher initial cost than a conventional concept and existing regulation siding with the lowest cost in the tender process. This research aims to develop intelligent building concept using value engineering approach to obtain added value regarding quality, efficiency, and innovation. The research combined quantitative and qualitative approach using questionnaire survey and value engineering method to achieve the research objectives. The research output will show additional functions regarding technology innovation that may increase the value of a building. This study shows that smart building concept requires higher initial cost, but produces lower operational and maintenance costs. Furthermore, it also confirms that benefit-cost ratio on the smart building was much higher than a conventional building, that is 1.99 to 0.88.",Berawi M.; Miraj P.; Sayuti M.; Berawi A.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2017-11-14,Universitas Pancasila;Universitas Indonesia,
Research on the sustainable development in the desertification prevention in Northwest China: Innovative management of vegetation planting sequence along the southwest margin of Mu Us Sandy Land,"Vegetation planting along the southwest margin of Mu Us Sandy Land is an effective way of desertification prevention. The traditional solutions were not fully effective, because the climate and human behaviors in modern China have been full of uncertainties and it was infeasible to pre-evaluate whether the vegetation planting results are truly scientific. Therefore, it' s urgent to find a way of planting to prevent desertification scientifically and effectively, with the strategy of sustainable development as a core in desertification prevention in farms and pasturing areas. The objects of the study are 18 kinds of plants that are usually planted for restoration of ecology in the southwest margin of Mu Us Sandy Land. According to the afforestation experiment and the survey on the growth status, the paper finds that the proper sequence for planting is as follows: Caragana Korshinskii Kom, Hedysarum fruticosum Pall. var. mongolicum (Turcz.) Turcz., Hedysarum scoparium Fisch. et Mey., Artemisia desterorum Spreng Syst. Veg., Sabina vulgaris, Amorpha fruticosa Linn., Populus alba var. pyramidalis Bge, Elaeagnus angustifolia Linn., Caryopteris clandonensis, Pinus sylvestris L. var. mongolica Litv., Platycladus orientalis (L.)

Training of Engineering Personnel for the Innovative Coal Industry: Problems and Ways of Solution,"The article is written based on some results of the long-term scientific research of the problem related to the urgent need to find the ways of training personnel for the innovative coal industry in the higher education system. This is due to the fundamental changes in the Russian social and economic conditions: the change in the social system and the owner of the coal industry, the emergence of new technologies in the field of coal mining and processing, and in the management of these processes. At the same time, the system of training specialists for the coal industry in the higher education institutions has largely remained unchanged: technologies and principles of training, scientific approaches and concepts take little account of the changed situation, traditional views of specialists work-ing in the university continue to dominate innovative ideas. Many innovations, especially related to technology and the principles of education, struggle to make their way into the higher education system. The article substantiates the urgency of the problem of training personnel for the innovative coal industry in the higher education system, as well as the importance of scientific analysis of the problem in order to find the ways to solve it.",Zaruba N.; Fraltsova T.; Snegireva T.,Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2017-11-10,T.

A MDE-based framework to improve the process management: The EMPOWER project,"Today's world economic situation is ruled by issues such as reducing cost, improving quality, maximizing profit and improving and optimizing production processes at any kind of organization. In this context, BPM (Business Processes Management) can be an essential strategy. However, there are business situations where is necessary to define innovation solutions to apply BPM in a proper way (e.g., needs of interoperability between process modeling languages, mechanisms to generate the executable model of the process maintaining the traceability with the definition model of the process, mechanisms to manage the measurement of processes from early stages, etc.). This paper describes and analysis some of these situations and proposes a framework based on MDE (Model-Driven Engineering) to support these needs. This MDE-based framework is also supported by the EMPOWER platform which has been developed in an innovation project carried out by Servinform Company and our research group (IWT2, University of Seville, Spain). This platform allows applying advanced MDE techniques to improve the application of BPM in business environments.",Garcia-Garcia J.; Enriquez J.; Garcia-Borgonon L.; Arevalo C.; Morillo E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2017 IEEE 15th International Conference on Industrial Informatics, INDIN 2017",2017-11-10,Universidad de Sevilla;Servinform,business processes management ;  innovation project in enterprise ;  model-driven paradigm
Gene editing and crop improvement using CRISPR-cas9 system,"Advancements in Genome editing technologies have revolutionized the fields of functional genomics and crop improvement. CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 is a multipurpose technology for genetic engineering that relies on the complementarity of the guideRNA (gRNA) to a specific sequence and the Cas9 endonuclease activity. It has broadened the agricultural research area, bringing in new opportunities to develop novel plant varieties with deletion of detrimental traits or addition of significant characters. This RNA guided genome editing technology is turning out to be a groundbreaking innovation in distinct branches of plant biology. CRISPR technology is constantly advancing including options for various genetic manipulations like generating knockouts; making precise modifications, multiplex genome engineering, and activation and repression of target genes. The review highlights the progression throughout the CRISPR legacy. We have studied the rapid evolution of CRISPR/Cas9 tools with myriad functionalities, capabilities, and specialized applications. Among varied diligences, plant nutritional improvement, enhancement of plant disease resistance and production of drought tolerant plants are reviewed.

How a diverse research ecosystem has generated new rehabilitation technologies: Review of NIDILRR's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers,"Over 50 million United States citizens (1 in 6 people in the US) have a developmental, acquired, or degenerative disability. The average US citizen can expect to live 20% of his or her life with a disability. Rehabilitation technologies play a major role in improving the quality of life for people with a disability, yet widespread and highly challenging needs remain. Within the US, a major effort aimed at the creation and evaluation of rehabilitation technology has been the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers (RERCs) sponsored by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research. As envisioned at their conception by a panel of the National Academy of Science in 1970, these centers were intended to take a ""total approach to rehabilitation"", combining medicine, engineering, and related science, to improve the quality of life of individuals with a disability. Here, we review the scope, achievements, and ongoing projects of an unbiased sample of 19 currently active or recently terminated RERCs. Specifically, for each center, we briefly explain the needs it targets, summarize key historical advances, identify emerging innovations, and consider future directions. Our assessment from this review is that the RERC program indeed involves a multidisciplinary approach, with 36 professional fields involved, although 70% of research and development staff are in engineering fields, 23% in clinical fields, and only 7% in basic science fields; significantly, 11% of the professional staff have a disability related to their research. We observe that the RERC program has substantially diversified the scope of its work since the 1970's, addressing more types of disabilities using more technologies, and, in particular, often now focusing on information technologies. RERC work also now often views users as integrated into an interdependent society through technologies that both people with and without disabilities co-use (such as the internet, wireless communication, and architecture). In addition, RERC research has evolved to view users as able at improving outcomes through learning, exercise, and plasticity (rather than being static), which can be optimally timed. We provide examples of rehabilitation technology innovation produced by the RERCs that illustrate this increasingly diversifying scope and evolving perspective. We conclude by discussing growth opportunities and possible future directions of the RERC program.",Reinkensmeyer D.; Blackstone S.; Bodine C.; Brabyn J.; Brienza D.; Caves K.; DeRuyter F.; Durfee E.; Fatone S.; Fernie G.; Gard S.; Karg P.; Kuiken T.; Harris G.; Jones M.; Li Y.; Maisel J.; McCue M.; Meade M.; Mitchell H.; Mitzner T.; Patton J.; Requejo P.; Rimmer J.; Rogers W.; Zev Rymer W.; Sanford J.; Schneider L.; Sliker L.; Sprigle S.; Steinfeld A.; Steinfeld E.; Vanderheiden G.; Winstein C.; Zhang L.; Corfman T.,Journal,Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation,2017-11-06,"National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research;Duke University Medical Center;The Robotics Institute;Augmentative Communication, Inc.;University at Buffalo, The State University of New York;Toronto Rehabilitation Institute;University of Southern California;University of Illinois at Chicago;The University of Alabama at Birmingham;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Smith Kettlewell Eye Research Institute;Georgia Institute of Technology;Shepherd Center;Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center;Marquette University;University of Pittsburgh;University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB);University of Colorado Denver;Northwestern University;University of California, Irvine;Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago",Disability ;  Rehabilitation engineering ;  Technology
Systems engineering for metropolitan energy systems- Ruhrvalley,"Cities and metropolitan region are becoming the main pattern of organization for civilizations. Therefore, they form socio-economic systems of growing importance. These systems show a high complexity and lack a centralized hierarchical structure. Therefore, de-central, distributed approaches for the management and patterns of self-organization are required. On a technical level, smart system approaches like the smart city or smart grid are applied using the advances in IT, e.g. the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Relevant fields of application are metropolitan mobility and renewable energy systems. Specifically in the energy sector- apart from smart electricity grids- the heating grids are an important topic for 'smartification'. This paper describes a holistic systems engineering approach for the future energy (and mobility) systems of metropolitan regions. The industry-university cluster ruhrvalley formed by more than 50 partners in one of the largest European metropolitan regions- the German Ruhr Valley- has set out the target to develop such a systems engineering methodology. It is based on the combination of innovation management approaches with a structured process for the development of intelligent technical systems. The resulting 'smartification process' is applied to the design of a flexible and controllable organic rankine cycle (ORC) turbine as a component for such systems. The overall approach described in this paper is a generic concept of a development process with an outlook on the upcoming steps of research and implementation.",Wolff C.; Lippmann T.; Lauschner U.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications, IDAACS 2017",2017-11-03,Fachhochschule Dortmund;WESTFALISCHE HOCHSCHULE GELSENKIRCHEN,Energy and mobility systems ;  Organic rankine cycle (ORC) ;  Smart heating grid ;  Smartification process ;  Systems engineering

The ‘Enterprise of Innovation’ in hard times: corporate culture and performance in Italian high-tech companies,"This article deals with the strategies that Italian innovative manufacturing companies have deployed in recent years. Italy has, in fact, been hit particularly severely by the international crisis, which has induced a sharp decline in employment and a narrowing of the productive base. That said, we know very little about the strategies used by Italian entrepreneurs to cope with the economic downturn, especially the more innovative ones. To address this topic, the author has used a sample of over 400 Italian companies with European patents in the sectors of mechanical engineering and high technology (European Patent Office (EPO) companies), which were investigated by means of a panel survey: a longitudinal study carried out on the same companies at different times (2010 and 2012). The analysis conducted in this article has two main goals: (1) to describe the socio-economic and territorial characteristics of EPO companies and their strategies in the years of the crisis and (2) to examine the influence of a ‘collaborative corporate culture’ on company performance. What emerges from the research into EPO companies is the complementarity of resources useful for innovation and economic performance among (a) the internal and external relations of the organization; (b) the variety of knowledge and the cohesion of relationships and (c) the short and long networks of collaboration. In conclusion, successful company strategies are those which–thanks to a collaborative company culture–are able to exploit the ‘embedded complementarity of innovative resources’.",Ramella F.,Journal,European Planning Studies,2017-11-02,Università degli Studi di Torino,collaborative corporate culture ;  company’s strategies during the economic crisis ;  Innovative companies ;  Italy
Open the ‘black box’ creativity and innovation: a study of activities in R&D departments. Some prospects for engineering education,"Innovation is a key component to the success and longevity of companies. Our research opens the ‘black box’ of creativity and innovation in R&D teams. We argue that understanding the nature of R&D projects in terms of creativity/innovation, efficiency/inefficiency, is important for designing education policies and improving engineering curriculum. Our research addresses the inventive design process, a lesser known aspect of the innovation process, in 197 R&D departments of industrial sector companies in France. One fundamental issue facing companies is to evaluate processes and results of innovation. Results show that the evaluation of innovation is confined by a lack of methodology of inventive projects.

Tinkering with governance: Technopolitics and the economization of citizenship,"From statistics and mapping to engineering and medicine, technology has long been a tool of governance, shaping how nation states control their own and other regions' populations and natural resources. More recently, a nation's capacity to cultivate citizens as tech innovators and entrepreneurs is considered an indicator of its economic prosperity and global power. We show how this turn towards innovation and entrepreneurship is central to how technological and political elites tinker with modes of governance and define the relationship between the future of the nation and its citizenry in economic terms. Drawing from long-term multi-sited ethnographic research in the United States, China, and Africa, we present a subset of findings to show how these shifts in governance are being enacted through interconnections between politicians and technologists, and the products, spaces, and educational ideals they fund and create. We argue that making sense of these shifts in governance is essential for current and future CSCW scholarship as they intersect with issues of power within social computing.",Lindtner S.; Avle S.,Journal,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,2017-11-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor","Entrepreneurship ;  Governance ;  Innovation ;  Policy ;  Social computing, maker ;  Technopolitics"
Development and innovations in the human geography discipline at Peking University,"The Human Geography Discipline at Peking University (PKU) originated from the Economic Geography Discipline at the Geology and Geography Department which was established in 1955. The department is the first comprehensive teaching and research institute which has teaching, research, and practice activities in the Human Geography Discipline in China. Over the past 60 years, the Human Geography Discipline at PKU has been emphasizing the importance of both teaching and research, and giving priority to practice over theory. It has been experiencing a shift from focusing on the basic theory of the Human Geography Discipline to integrating both basic and applied research. Both an interdisciplinary way of research thinking and an interdisciplinary subject of human geography have been formed with a coordination between liberal arts, sciences and engineering. The Human Geography Discipline is operated together by the Department of Urban and Economic Geography, the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, and the Research Institute of Historical Geography. In the past 60 years, the Human Geography Discipline at PKU has achieved a series of well-recognized, innovative and high impact research outputs in both domestic and overseas in the fields of urbanization, urban system, urban and regional planning, land use assessment and planning, industrial location and regional industry evolvement, industrial clusters and innovation network, housing and real estate economy, scenic areas and world heritage, village and township development planning, urban social geography, time geography and behavior geography, historical geography, tourism geography research and planning, quantitative geography, transport geography and transport planning.

Experiments in systems engineering and design research,"Controlled experiments ranging from laboratory experiments to field experiments are becoming increasingly important within systems engineering and design (SE&D) research. Controlled experiments provide unique capabilities for testing hypotheses, and guiding the development of scientific theories, but their potential is not being fully exploited. As the systems engineering research community embraces different research methods commonly adopted in other domains, there is a need for understanding the role and appropriateness of those methods within the research process. While the design of experiments in SE&D research is not unique per se, we contend that aspects of representativeness in the SE&D context pose different experimental design challenges than do the problems typically studied by experimental social scientists. There is therefore a need to translate established practices to the SE&D context, and also belay widely held concerns about the value of experiments in SE&D research. To address this need, the goals of the paper are to discuss the potential role of controlled experiments in systems engineering and design research, to review the benefits and limitations of different types of experiments, and to highlight the key issues in validating experimental studies. The taxonomy and the discussion on validation build on the rich history in social and behavioral sciences, with specific adaptation to the SE&D context. The discussion is anchored in specific examples from the authors’ own research on open innovation in systems engineering.",Panchal J.; Szajnfarber Z.,Journal,Systems Engineering,2017-11-01,The George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science;Purdue University,engineering design ;  experiments ;  systems engineering
Opportunities for strengthening methods of evaluating economic performance of the innovative projects,"Innovations management, development of R&D effectiveness valuation instruments, innovative projects portfolio optimization is one of the priorities in oil&gas companies. In this context authors have analyzed approaches to economic performance valuation of innovative projects, employed in Rosneft Oil Company. The currently employed valuation procedure is focused on the calculation of expected net present value (NPV) with valuation of success optionality of the innovation project's different stages as well as drawing of project's decision tree, showing key milestones in the management's decision making process with regard to project's financing or closure. Optionality allows a more precise project's NPV valuation, considering risks of each stage fulfillment: research and development stage, engineering stage, including pilot implementation, and final implementation of a technology. Analysis has shown that the current methodology may be enhanced by adding negative results valuation, as well as by including R&D in production costs or increasing R&D costs by coefficient .5. Application of the methods analyzed in the article will allow improving the quality of the innovative projects valuation and raising the projects' economic effectiveness to an acceptable level, including projects with negative economic effectiveness at different stages of realization. Innovative projects portfolio becomes more flexible to the external and internal factors, as it includes projects valuated with NPV optionality methodology and includes the whole economic potential of the innovations.",Alparov R.; Khasanov I.; Meshkov I.,Journal,Neftyanoe Khozyaystvo - Oil Industry,2017-11-01,Rosneft Oil,Innovations ;  Performance evaluation ;  Research and development
"Promoting professional identity, motivation, and persistence: Benefits of an informal mentoring program for female undergraduate students","Women are underrepresented in a number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Limited diversity in the development of the STEM workforce has negative implications for scientific innovation, creativity, and social relevance. The current study reports the first-year results of the PROmoting Geoscience Research, Education, and SuccesS (PROGRESS) program, a novel theory-driven informal mentoring program aimed at supporting first- and second-year female STEM majors. Using a prospective, longitudinal, multi-site (i.e., 7 universities in Colorado/Wyoming Front Range & Carolinas), propensity score matched design, we compare mentoring and persistence outcomes for women in and out of PROGRESS (N = 116). Women in PROGRESS attended an off-site weekend workshop and gained access to a network of volunteer female scientific mentors from on- and off-campus (i.e., university faculty, graduate students, and outside scientific professionals). The results indicate that women in PROGRESS had larger networks of developmental mentoring relationships and were more likely to be mentored by faculty members and peers than matched controls. Mentoring support from a faculty member benefited early-undergraduate women by strengthening their scientific identity and their interest in earth and environmental science career pathways. Further, support from a faculty mentor had a positive indirect impact on women’s scientific persistence intentions, through strengthened scientific identity development. These results imply that first- and second- year undergraduate women’s mentoring support networks can be enhanced through provision of protégé training and access to more senior women in the sciences willing to provide mentoring support.",Hernandez P.; Bloodhart B.; Barnes R.; Adams A.; Clinton S.; Pollack I.; Godfrey E.; Burt M.; Fischer E.,Journal,PLoS ONE,2017-11-01,"Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering;Colorado College;West Virginia University;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte",

Institutionalization of international university research ventures,"International research collaborations are widespread, but few have studied those that reach the scale and scope of what we call international university research ventures (IURVs). In an IURV, a university sets up a formal and organizationally consolidated research relationship in a foreign country. This paper puts forward an institutionalization framework to explain the development of IURVs with different forms. Five case studies are presented of IURVs in the countries with the largest number of IURVs involving US universities: China and Singapore. The five cases are examined relative to the elements of the institutionalization framework: nominal, leadership, administrative support, multi-year funding, research targets, formal researcher-to-researcher exchange, visibility, evaluation, and supporting characteristics. The results show that the emergence of IURVs depends on the specific connections between the role of government and the availability of resources with the realization of mutual benefits, leading to different patterns of institutionalization. This variation is in part a function of the degree of involvement of the government agency or department providing the funding for the IURV, which influences retention of the knowledge produced by the IURV in the region through institutionalized mechanisms as well as the development of scientific and technical human capital in the host country. Institutionalization is not a benefit without limits; nevertheless, an institutionalized structure may be necessary if ambitious research-driven goals are to be achieved.",Youtie J.; Li Y.; Rogers J.; Shapira P.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-11-01,Alliance Manchester Business School;Georgia Institute of Technology,Academic research ;  China ;  Institutionalization ;  International university research ventures ;  R&D globalization ;  Singapore ;  University internationalization
An Approach to Integrating Health Disparities within Undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Education,"Health disparities are preventable differences in the incidence, prevalence and burden of disease among communities targeted by gender, geographic location, ethnicity and/or socio-economic status. While biomedical research has identified partial origin(s) of divergent burden and impact of disease, the innovation needed to eradicate health disparities in the United States requires unique engagement from biomedical engineers. Increasing awareness of the prevalence and consequences of health disparities is particularly attractive to today’s undergraduates, who have undauntedly challenged paradigms believed to foster inequality. Here, the Department of Biomedical Engineering at The City College of New York (CCNY) has leveraged its historical mission of access-and-excellence to integrate the study of health disparities into undergraduate BME curricula. This article describes our novel approach in a multiyear study that: (i) Integrated health disparities modules at all levels of the required undergraduate BME curriculum; (ii) Developed opportunities to include impacts of health disparities into undergraduate BME research projects and mentored High School summer STEM training; and (iii) Established health disparities-based challenges as BME capstone design and/or independent entrepreneurship projects. Results illustrate the rising awareness of health disparities among the youngest BMEs-to-be, as well as abundant undergraduate desire to integrate health disparities within BME education and training.",Vazquez M.; Marte O.; Barba J.; Hubbard K.,Journal,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,2017-11-01,The Grove School of Engineering;City College of New York;Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,Capstone design ;  Curricular modules ;  Entrepreneurship ;  High school mentoring ;  Minority Serving Institution (MSI) ;  Undergraduate research
Multi-Life Cycle Assessment for sustainable products: A systematic review,"Due to advancements in product design and technology, products in the market today are capable of an extended life cycle by undergoing end-of-life treatments. To enable this, products have to be designed for multiple life cycle (MLC) purposes. Besides that, the presence of technology innovation has led to the generation of multiple products. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the life cycle of products in a wider scope. Currently, an existing method that approximately accommodates this objective is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, the current LCA guidelines and standards are still insufficient to assess the environmental impacts of MLC products due to the limitation of the conventional LCA procedure, which only focuses on a single life cycle. Therefore, it is highly important to extend the current concept of the LCA to a Multi-Life Cycle Assessment (MLCA). It is possible for an MLCA to quantify the environmental impacts of MLC products and to evaluate the flow of materials among the generated products. To date, only two studies have explicitly mentioned the term ‘MLCA’, but both had different perspectives and methodologies. Moreover, previous LCA studies focused on evaluating the environmental performance of MLC products, such as remanufactured and recycled products. Therefore, this paper was aimed at proposing MLCA perspectives for assessing the environmental impacts on the MLC product system. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive and systematic review of previous LCA and MLCA studies that dealt with MLC problems was conducted. From the review, the knowledge gaps in the field of study were identified so as to contribute to an understanding of how the LCA can be extended to the MLCA for environmental sustainability.",Suhariyanto T.; Wahab D.; Rahman M.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2017-11-01,Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,A systematic literature review ;  Design innovation ;  Multi-Life Cycle Assessment ;  Technology innovation
Organizational culture and innovation performance in Pakistan's software industry,"Rapid transformation in technological innovation requires organizations to develop a culture that fosters innovation performance for sustainable development amidst global competition. The core aim of this empirical investigation is to explore the role of organizational culture, particularly an inclusive culture, in the innovation performance of the software industry in Pakistan. To achieve the objective of this study, research was conducted to collect the required information by using a structured questionnaire from software firms in Pakistan via an online data collection system using Google Forms. The sample size is (n = 215) therefore, descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression models are used to determine the association between explanatory factors of organizational culture and innovation performance. The results propose that organizational innovation performance is backed and affected by organizational culture. Flexibility/support to change and organizational climate are the comparatively significant factors for creativity and innovation performance. This study focuses on the cultural influence of innovation performance in a specific industry where measurable performance is critical for competitive survival: the software industry. It is critical to understand this relationship, particularly in the context of a developing economy, because of the status of the software industry in the rapid technological innovation and economic progress of the country.",Shahzad F.; Xiu G.; Shahbaz M.,Journal,Technology in Society,2017-11-01,Harbin University of Science and Technology,Culture ;  Innovation ;  Innovation performance ;  Organizational culture ;  Organizational innovation ;  Software industry
What makes a manufacturing firm effective for service innovation? The role of intangible capital under strategic and environmental conditions,"While an increasing body of research addresses the importance of service innovation to manufacturing firms, little work has examined what makes a manufacturing firm effective for service innovation, and under what strategic and environmental conditions. This article investigates (1) what types of intangible capital are necessary for a manufacturing firm to develop new services, (2) whether a focus on an intangible capital will have the greatest effect on new service success, and (3) whether the effectiveness of a specific intangible capital varies from the combined conditions of strategic flexibility and environmental uncertainty. Building on service-dominant logic, this study theorizes that the four types of intangible capital (market, service delivery, interaction, and learning) are necessary for manufacturing firms to create superior new services. The authors test their hypotheses with a sample of 293 matched responses collected from leading manufacturing firms. The results indicate that all four types of intangible capital have significant positive relationships with new service success. However, not all intangible capital is equally effective as to which learning capital has the strongest effect across four combined conditions of both high and low levels of strategic flexibility and environmental uncertainty. This study contributes to the manufacturing literature by shedding light on a neglected construct (intangible capital), and offering valuable insights for manufacturing managers seeking to determine when (high/low environmental uncertainty) and how (high/low strategic flexibility) firms' intangible capital should be emphasized, in order to achieve the greatest effectiveness of service innovation.",Cheng C.; Krumwiede D.,Journal,International Journal of Production Economics,2017-11-01,National Yunlin University of Science and Technology;Idaho State University,Environmental uncertainty ;  Manufacturing firm ;  Service innovation ;  Strategic flexibility
Teachers in school-based technology innovations: A typology of their beliefs on teaching and technology,"In many innovations in technology and education in secondary schools, teachers are the crucial agents of these innovations. To select, match and support groups of teachers for particular school projects, school principals could be supported with insights into teachers’ beliefs about teaching, learning and technology. A teacher typology has been developed based on an online questionnaire completed by 1602 teachers from 59 Dutch secondary schools. Teachers are grouped on the basis of their beliefs about learned-centered teaching and attitudes towards technology, which underlie the school innovations that form the context of the current research. Five teacher types are distinguished: 1) Learner-centered teachers with technology, 2) Teachers critical of technology use in school, 3) Teachers uncomfortable with technology, 4) Teachers uneasy with learned-centered teaching and 5) Teachers critical of a clear-cut stance. This classification of teachers into these five types could be used to select or match the right group of teachers to a particular intervention or to organize different professional development activities for different types of school teachers.",Admiraal W.; Louws M.; Lockhorst D.; Paas T.; Buynsters M.; Cviko A.; Janssen C.; de Jonge M.; Nouwens S.; Post L.; van der Ven F.; Kester L.,Journal,Computers and Education,2017-11-01,Universiteit Leiden;Universiteit Utrecht;Oberon Research and Consultancy,Improving classroom teaching ;  Pedagogical issues ;  Secondary education
Understanding behavioural intention to use information technology: Insights from humanitarian practitioners,"The contemporary research in the area of individual technology adoption mainly focuses on commercial supply chains. However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed.",Kabra G.; Ramesh A.; Akhtar P.; Dash M.,Journal,Telematics and Informatics,2017-11-01,Hull University Business School;Institute of Information Technology and Management;Xavier Institute of Management;Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,Humanitarian logistics ;  Humanitarian supply chain management ;  Information technology ;  Supply chain management ;  Technology adoption ;  Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology
Promise of adeno-associated virus as a gene therapy vector for cardiovascular diseases,"Cardiovascular diseases pose a unique threat to global mortality because it presents as one of the most diverse conglomerations of pathophysiological conditions that can create significant casualty even without straying into its collateral damage. This puts them right beside obesity and cancer in terms of severity. Their pervasive nature and high prevalence prompted biologists to seek newer prophylactic avenues of addressing this global hazard, among which adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy rose to significant prominence. By virtue of its unrivaled clinical safety quotient, AAVs have been used to rectify various subtypes of cardiovascular ailments, beginning from commonly occurring heart failure to vascular diseases. The review focuses on the history of AAV-mediated gene therapy and contemporary breakthroughs in terms of novel innovations in vector engineering to reduce detargeting, immune response, untimely expression, and so on. We have also focused on the molecular world of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells but interpreted the therapies in a broader context of cardiovascular pathology. The advances made in each mode of intervention as well as the ones that are beyond the scope of AAV gene therapy or has not been approached through AAV gene therapy as of now have been provided in detail to illustrate the bigger picture of where we stand to combat cardiovascular diseases most efficiently.",Bera A.; Sen D.,Journal,Heart Failure Reviews,2017-11-01,Vellore Institute of Technology,AAV therapy ;  Adeno-associated virus ;  Cardiovascular disease ;  Gene therapy ;  Heart failure ;  Viral vector
Mistranslation: from adaptations to applications,"Background The conservation of the genetic code indicates that there was a single origin, but like all genetic material, the cell's interpretation of the code is subject to evolutionary pressure. Single nucleotide variations in tRNA sequences can modulate codon assignments by altering codon-anticodon pairing or tRNA charging. Either can increase translation errors and even change the code. The frozen accident hypothesis argued that changes to the code would destabilize the proteome and reduce fitness. In studies of model organisms, mistranslation often acts as an adaptive response. These studies reveal evolutionary conserved mechanisms to maintain proteostasis even during high rates of mistranslation. Scope of review This review discusses the evolutionary basis of altered genetic codes, how mistranslation is identified, and how deviations to the genetic code are exploited. We revisit early discoveries of genetic code deviations and provide examples of adaptive mistranslation events in nature. Lastly, we highlight innovations in synthetic biology to expand the genetic code. Major conclusions The genetic code is still evolving. Mistranslation increases proteomic diversity that enables cells to survive stress conditions or suppress a deleterious allele. Genetic code variants have been identified by genome and metagenome sequence analyses, suppressor genetics, and biochemical characterization. General significance Understanding the mechanisms of translation and genetic code deviations enables the design of new codes to produce novel proteins. Engineering the translation machinery and expanding the genetic code to incorporate non-canonical amino acids are valuable tools in synthetic biology that are impacting biomedical research.

Configurations of Innovations across Domains: An Organizational Ambidexterity View,"How do firms balance explorative and exploitative innovation for superior firm performance? While most prior studies have approached this issue by focusing on technology-related innovation, the role of balancing exploration and exploitation in other important organizational domains, i.e., marketing, and the interaction effect of ambidexterity across different domains have been overlooked. This study contributes to this line of research by investigating how firms simultaneously balance exploration and exploitation across two critical domains, namely technology innovation and market innovation. The study distinguishes four types of configurations: market leveraging (technology exploration and market exploitation), technology leveraging (technology exploitation and market exploration), pure exploitation (technology exploitation and market exploitation), and pure exploration (technology exploration and market exploration). From an organizational ambidexterity perspective, the current work investigates whether and how these different combinations exert distinctive effects on firm performance. Specifically, the article posits that (a) technology exploration and market exploitation complement each other, and (b) technology exploitation and market exploration also complement each other, such that both market leveraging and technology leveraging strategies have positive effects on firm performance. The article also maintains that such positive relationships are fully mediated by differentiation and low cost advantages. Conversely, it is argued that (c) technology exploration and market exploration conflict with each other, and (d) so do technology exploitation and market exploitation, such that both pure exploration and pure exploitation have negative effects on firm performance. Hypotheses were tested using survey data collected from 292 manufacturing and service firms in China. The results supported most of the hypotheses, except that pure exploration demonstrated no significant relationship with firm performance.",Zhang F.; Wang Y.; Li D.; Cui V.,Journal,Journal of Product Innovation Management,2017-11-01,Nankai University;University of International Business and Economics;University of Minnesota Duluth;University of Manitoba,differentiation ;  exploitation ;  exploration ;  low cost ;  market ;  technology

Renovated learning: Curriculum acquaintances into makerspace,"Maker space is a powerful form of renovated learning which ethos is based on invents to learn. It creates, collaborates and innovates to engage students in hands-on projects and develop a large range of skills. In other words makerspace is place to make choice, create and connect. Community based workshops and DIY (Do It Yourself) projects are promoting the practice of peer production and fabrication. Existent science and multimedia applications are done by tinkering, the idea of university maker space is infantile and young but getting well-liked in global world. Universities are working a lot in terms to make their undergraduates and graduating engineers able to harness innovation and creativeness to stay competent and applicable in market or industry with increasingly growing requirements. This paper delves into a case study where multimedia lab is converted into a Makerspace SMMS (Space to Make Multimedia Systems) by assigning real time projects, related to the curriculum needs, and making them able to identify problem, construct model, become skilled at to apply, rework ideas, and share acquaintance with others.

Approach for model-based change impact analysis in factory systems,"Due to shortened product innovation cycles, high variant products, demand fluctuation, equipment life cycles, and technology life cycles, regular changes in manufacturing systems are necessary. As elements of a factory are connected via a complex network of relations and flows, single changes can have an impact on the entire manufacturing system. In order to enable a successful change management, companies need to understand and consider all possible change impacts. For this purpose, this paper presents a method for change impact analysis in factory systems. By combination of manufacturing system modeling and a network of manufacturing metrics, change impacts on arbitrary metrics can be estimated. The definition of constraints between factory element properties improves the certainty of the analysis' results. Consecutive required changes are applied directly to the model and are equally considered in the change impact analysis. In an exemplary scenario, the applicability in principle of the approach is demonstrated, but also, current limitations and further research activities are identified.",Bauer H.; Schoonmann A.; Reinhart G.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering, ISSE 2017 - Proceedings",2017-10-26,Technische Universität München,
Modeling as the basis for innovation cycle management of PSS: Making use of interdisciplinary models,"Common modeling in interdisciplinary contexts, such as innovation management, is a challenge, given that different disciplines often do not fully understand each other's models and paradigms. Building on the work of an interdisciplinary research collaboration, we explore, in which way interdisciplinary modeling can enrich innovation management. We show that models can be described on a general level by delineating what a model generally is in these disciplines, what types of models exist, the object which is modeled by the model and how the model can be tested. We present a use case to demonstrate how different models can be applied. Finally, we derive four fields of application, which are especially fruitful for and can benefit from interdisciplinary modeling: change management, knowledge management, inconsistency management, and user integration. Our next step will be the development of a 'designing platform', which will provide scientific results and practical tools regarding interdisciplinary cooperation in the context of innovation cycle management of product-service-systems (PSS).",Reift J.; Koltun G.; Drewlani T.; Zaggl M.; Kattner N.; Dengler C.; Basirati M.; Bauer H.; Krcmar H.; Kugler K.; Brodbeck F.; Lindemann U.; Lohmann B.; Meyer U.; Reinhart G.; Vogel-Heuser B.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering, ISSE 2017 - Proceedings",2017-10-26,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München;Technische Universität München,

Facile and Effective Coloration of Dye-Inert Carbon Fiber Fabrics with Tunable Colors and Excellent Laundering Durability,"Carbon fiber is a good candidate in various applications, including in the military, structural, sports equipment, energy storage, and infrastructure. Coloring of carbon fiber has been a big challenge for decades due to their high degrees of crystallization and insufficient chemical affinity to dyes. Here, multicolored carbon fiber fabrics are fabricated using a feasible and effective atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The vibrant and uniform structural colors originating from thin-film interference is simply regulated by controlling the thickness of conformal TiO2 coatings on the surface of black carbon fibers. Impressively, the colorful coatings show excellent laundering durability, which can endure 50 cycles of domestic launderings. Moreover, the mechanical properties only drop off slightly after coloring. Overall, these results open an alternative avenue for development of TiO2 nanostructured films with multifunctional features grown using ALD technologies.

Beyond physical mashups: Autonomous systems for the Web of Things,"By abstracting devices to Web resources, the Web of Things (WoT) fosters innovation and rapid prototyping in the Internet of Things (IoT): it enables developers to use standard Web technologies for creating mashups of Web services that perceive and act on the physical world (a.k.a. physical mashups). In recent years, however, it has become apparent that current programming paradigms for Web development have important shortcomings when it comes to engineering IoT systems: static Web mashups cannot adapt to dynamic IoT environments, and manually mashing-up the IoT does not scale. To address these limitations, WoT researchers started to look for means to engineerWoT systems that are more autonomous in pursuit of their design objectives. The engineering of autonomous systems has already been explored to a large extent in the scientific literature on artificial intelligence. In this position paper, we distill that large body of research into a coherent set of abstractions for engineering autonomous WoT systems.",Ciortea A.; Boissier O.; Ricci A.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017-10-22,"Laboratoire Hubert Curien UMR CNRS 5516;Siemens AG;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna, Cesena",Autonomous agents ;  Multi-agent systems ;  Web of Things
Application in powder metallurgy of CVD carbon nanofibres: microstructure and mechanical properties CNF reinforced Distaloy AQ,"Powder metallurgy technique has been extended in automobile industry and other engineering applications. Competitive manufacturing costs have led to important innovations in different fields of powder metallurgy. Recently, research has been focused on reaching higher performance at a lower cost. Carbon nanostructures as carbon nanofibres (CNF) have also entered in the material science as reinforcing composites. In this study, different materials formed by low alloy steel Fe-Ni-Mo powder (Distaloy AQ) with 0.4% of graphite and 0.5% CNFs (carbon nanofibres) synthesised at 723, 773, 823 and 873 K have been studied. All the materials were compacted at 700 MPa and sintered at 1393 K and 90N2–10H2 atmosphere. The influence of CNFs synthesis temperature has been analysed for its application in powder metallurgy.

Profit distribution mechanism of industrial innovation platform research,"Industrial innovation platform is the engine of China's industrial structure transformation and upgrading in the new era and how to protect the interests of the cooperative units in the platform is an important factor to ensure the stable operation of the entire platform. Cooperative interest distribution is a complete and complex system engineering, which needs to consider the input, output, risk, brand and other factors. However, the constraints are often fuzzy constraint, coefficient is grey number. Therefore, this paper constructs the Shapley value model for profit distribution based on grey system theory.

Test and process research of poor geological dynamic water plugging reinforcement material,"Traditional dynamic water grouting materials have the shortcomings of water content, volume shrinkage, poor of the late hydrodynamic dispersion resistance and higher cost. Based on the demand of dynamic water grouting treatment project, we propose a two-component water grouting material(FS), which is mainly composed of fly ash and additives, and the performance of the slurry was studied. Then, the parameters, such as final setting time, stone rate after 1 h, compressive strength and pumpability of material under the condition of the different water contents and dosage of additives were tested. Experimental results show that new dynamic water grouting material(FS) with the characteristics of rapid setting, early strength, micro expansion, high rate of stone, smaller strength is affected by water content, strong erosion resistance resisting dynamic water. And we put forward hierarchically combined grouting reinforcement technology by using material to dynamic water grouting treatment, and expound the principle and method of the technology.

The influence of university-firm cooperation on firm value chain,"Value chain analysis can expose strategic and operational misalignments within chains, and the consequential misallocation of resources, and hence opportunities for improvements which create value and economic sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to study how strong is the university-firm cooperation influence on firm value chains and how can this cooperation influence firm and university innovation and performance. The empirical analysis is based on data gathered through a questionnaire administered to a sample of Slovak SMEs operated in the area of ICT. The findings show that only contractual university-firm relationships have a direct and significant effect on innovation, whereas relational activities promote and support contractual activities. The findings have managerial implications not just for firms, but also for universities. University-firm relationships contribute to regional and global development, because they foster innovation processes regarding firms' strategies at those. In this liaison, universities' role usually is to promote knowledge-based economic development, which is basic for sustainable economic growt. The higher education institutions are facing an increasingly competitive environment with growing financial constraints, universities are strongly motivated to engage more actively with the firm, so as to establish new funding streams and secure additional research investment. This relationship should be beneficial for both firms and universities. Innovative firms are constantly searching for new ways to internalize external knowledge into their production function. With this aim, firms have found that the university-firm cooperation is a valuable mechanism to access to new technological resources, which can contribute to faster development of innovation, improved market access, economies of scale and scope, and cost sharing and risk spreading In this context, universities have been recognized as a capable research partner for solving R&D problems and as advisers on technology strategies and by supporting the technology generation and/or the adoption of a new technology. Moreover, the cooperation with universities has been characterized by the timely appropriation of very-new technological opportunities and by the increment on the innovation sales, as well as the increase in the propensity to apply for patents. Several empirical studies have attempted to identify the factors determining the university-firm cooperation in innovation activities, concluding that this type of cooperation is based on the complementarity on the innovation processes, and on the uncertainty level of the innovation results. On the other hand, and based on a firm level analysis, some authors concluded that university-firm cooperation depends on the firm's absorptive capacity, on its innovative capacity, on its proximity to fundamental research, and in some firm-specific characteristics, like size and industrial affiliation.",Madudova E.; Majercakova M.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 16th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training, ITHET 2017",2017-10-13,University of Žilina,ICT firm ;  university-firm cooperation ;  value chain analysis
Research on multi-layer risk management method in complex product development,"The development of complex products is a complicated multidisciplinary concurrent engineering with complicated task structure and strong technical innovation. The distributed development environment and networked collaborative design model not only bring great challenges to the modeling of complex product development, but also increase the need for risk assessment of the development process. In consideration of the shortcomings that existing risk modeling methods rarely take into account that the multi-layer quality of complex product development structure, the coupling characteristic of concurrent engineering, the simulation involving too many subjective factors and not making joint evaluation for cost risk and schedule risk this paper proposes a multi-layer cost schedule joint risk assessment model based on DSM. Combining with artificial neural networks and the Cholesky factor which can join two independently distributed variables, a DSM-based cost schedule joint simulation method is designed.

Biochemical engineering's grand adventure,"Building on the recent revolution in molecular biology, enabling a wealth of bio-product innovations made from renewable feedstocks, the biotechnology field is in a transition phase to bring the products to the market. This requires a shift from natural sciences to engineering sciences with first conception of new, efficient large-scale bioprocess designs, followed by implementation of the most promising design in practice. Inspired by a former publication by O. Levenspiel in 1988, an outline is presented of main challenges that the field of biochemical engineering is currently facing, in a context of major global sustainability trends. The critical stage is the conceptual design phase. Issues can best be addressed and overcome by adopting an attitude where one begins with the end in mind. This applies to three principal components: 1. the bioprocess value chain, where the product specifications and downstream purification schemes should be set before defining the upstream sections, 2. the time perspective, starting in the future assuming that feedstock and product-market combinations are already in place and then going back to today, and 3. the scale of operation, where the industrial operation sets the boundaries for all labscale research and development, and not vice versa. In this way, and ideal process is defined taking constraints from anticipated manufacturing into account. For illustration, three bioprocess design examples are provided, that show how new, ideal conceptual designs can be generated. These also make clear that the engineering sciences are undergoing a revolution, where bio-based approaches replace fossil routes, and gross simplification is replaced by highly detailed computational methods. For biochemical processes, lifeline modeling frameworks are highlighted as powerful means to reconcile the competing needs for high speed and high quality in biochemical engineering, both in the design and implementation stages, thereby enabling significant growth of the bio-based economy.",Noorman H.; Heijnen J.,Journal,Chemical Engineering Science,2017-10-12,DSM Biotechnology Center;Delft University of Technology,Bio-economy ;  Bio-products ;  Bioprocess design ;  Lifeline modeling ;  Renewable feedstocks ;  Scale-down

She has worked extensively on characterizing the stability of adsorbent materials, including metal-organic frameworks and porous carbons and developing these materials for practical applications.

His research focuses on using materials modeling to accelerate development of materials for large-scale chemical separations. Many future large-scale innovations in energy-intensive industries will require development or implementation of new materials. Unfortunately, much academic research is poorly suited to navigating the challenges of moving materials from lab-based discovery to their ultimate application. We highlight three issues that frequently become “showstoppers” on the path to real-world applications. These showstoppers can not only delay the progress of a new technology, they can also frequently lead to failure and abandonment of what might at first be considered promising technologies.",Walton K.; Sholl D.,Journal,Joule,2017-10-11,College of Engineering,

Understanding Customer Opinions From Online Discussion Forums: A Design Science Framework,"Online discussion forums, which are full of user-generated content including user opinions and comments, are a potential gold mine for exploring new and useful ideas to augment competence in innovation. Companies need to systematically analyze and interpret online commentaries to enhance in-house research and design activities. To this end, a framework is proposed using a design science approach to enable automatic analysis of the content of online opinions and comments in connection with specific products, using a web lexicon established for this purpose. Furthermore, this framework is applied to an automobile as a proof-of-concept. Several nicknames for the car brand studied were created by web users, some with irony and sarcasm. A few metaphorical expressions were also used to describe product features. Engineering practitioners should recognize the importance of stylized online expressions in order to have a better understanding of customer needs and expectations through the application of this framework, which incorporates an evolutionary web lexicon.",Lee J.; Yang C.; Chen S.,Journal,EMJ - Engineering Management Journal,2017-10-02,Yuan Ze University,Content Analysis ;  Design Science Approach ;  Online Discussion Forum ;  Product Innovation ;  Social Media ;  User-Generated Content

3D printing becomes concrete: exploring the structural potential of concrete 3D printing,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing is celebrated as part of the next Industrial Revolution, in which automation and artificial intelligence will transform the construction industry. It is at the forefront of building innovation and has the potential to have a revolutionary effect on how structures are built. We are not the first industry to seek the benefits of robotically controlled, free-form manufacture: the medical, automotive and aeronautical industries are just some areas where 3D printed parts are now offered as standard products or component parts. 3D printing has proved particularly successful where rapidly produced, low-cost, unique products are needed. A recent surge in mass customisation has enabled industry to produce custom-made shoes printed to the form of one’s foot or to tailor a life-changing prosthesis adapted to one’s individual shape and size.

Generalized fractional programming,"This monograph is aimed at presenting smooth and unified generalized fractional programming (or a program with a finite number of constraints). Under the current interdisciplinary computer-oriented research environment, these programs are among the most rapidly expanding research areas in terms of its multi-facet applications and empowerment for real world problems that can be handled by transforming them into generalized fractional programming problems. Problems of this type have been applied for the modeling and analysis of a wide range of theoretical as well as concrete, real world, practical problems. More specifically, generalized fractional programming concepts and techniques have found relevance and worldwide applications in approximation theory, statistics, game theory, engineering design (earthquake-resistant design of structures, design of control systems, digital filters, electronic circuits, etc.), boundary value problems, defect minimization for operator equations, geometry, random graphs, graphs related to Newton flows, wavelet analysis, reliability testing, environmental protection planning, decision making under uncertainty, geometric programming, disjunctive programming, optimal control problems, robotics, and continuum mechanics, among others. It is highly probable that among all industries, especially for the automobile industry, robots are about to revolutionize the assembly plants forever. That would change the face of other industries toward rapid technical innovation as well. The main focus of this monograph is to empower graduate students, faculty and other research enthusiasts for more accelerated research advances with significant applications in the interdisciplinary sense without borders. The generalized fractional programming problems have a wide range of real-world problems, which can be transformed in some sort of a generalized fractional programming problem. Consider fractional programs that arise from management decision science; by analyzing system efficiency in an economical sense, it is equivalent to maximizing system efficiency leading to fractional programs with occurring objectives: Maximizing productivity Maximizing return on investment Maximizing return/ risk Minimizing cost/time Minimizing output/input The authors envision that this monograph will uniquely present the interdisciplinary research for the global scientific community (including graduate students, faculty, and general readers). Furthermore, some of the new concepts can be applied to duality theorems based on the use of a new class of multi-time, multi-objective, variational problems as well.",N'Guérékata G.; Verma R.,Book,Generalized Fractional Programming,2017-10-01,Morgan State University,
Market Demands on Construction Management: View from Graduate Students,"The construction industry demands managerial skills for professionals working within it, especially from those having an undergraduate civil engineering degree, which is generally pursued through graduate programs [master of science (M.Sc.) degrees] in the construction management field. This paper checks how graduate students' views are relevant in order to assess and improve these M.Sc. programs. The research is performed through a survey based on a sample of 534 graduate students from several American and European universities. Using confirmatory factor analysis with the survey data, it has been corroborated that the construction management field can be mapped according to two dimensions: infrastructure lifecycle and organizational breakdown. Furthermore, by means of an exploratory factor analysis, six components or approaches for a graduate program in the construction management field are highlighted as important by the respondents: leadership, built environment stakeholders, innovation and quality, economics, business management, and project management. The organizational point of view is clearly identified by the students: its four variables are highlighted as principal components. However, regarding the infrastructure lifecycle, certain important facets, such as feasibility analysis and operation and maintenance of infrastructure, are considered by graduate students less important than classical design and construction.

Determinants of grant decisions in R&D subsidy programmes: Evidence from firms and S & T organisations in Portugal,"While public intervention in Research and Development (R & D) is generally supported by economic theory and R & D subsidies are being implemented in most OECD countries, evidence on their effectiveness fails to reveal conclusive results. Exploring data from approved and rejected applicants to two R & D funding instruments in Portugal, we provide further evidence on R & D subsidy programmes directed to firms and S & T organisations, by identifying the determinants of grant decisions by the public agency. The results show that subsidies to firms are mainly aimed at large R & D projects by manufacturing firms, in both high- and low-technology sectors. Subsidies to S & T organisations show a higher degree of selectivity, targeting mainly universities and premium public research centres, and favouring R & D projects in exact sciences and engineering and cooperation projects.

Virotherapy Research in Germany: From Engineering to Translation,"Virotherapy is a unique modality for the treatment of cancer with oncolytic viruses (OVs) that selectively infect and lyse tumor cells, spread within tumors, and activate anti-tumor immunity. Various viruses are being developed as OVs preclinically and clinically, several of them engineered to encode therapeutic proteins for tumor-targeted gene therapy. Scientists and clinicians in German academia have made significant contributions to OV research and development, which are highlighted in this review paper. Innovative strategies for ""shielding,"" entry or postentry targeting, and ""arming"" of OVs have been established, focusing on adenovirus, measles virus, parvovirus, and vaccinia virus platforms. Thereby, new-generation virotherapeutics have been derived. Moreover, immunotherapeutic properties of OVs and combination therapies with pharmacotherapy, radiotherapy, and especially immunotherapy have been investigated and optimized. German investigators are increasingly assessing their OV innovations in investigator-initiated and sponsored clinical trials. As a prototype, parvovirus has been tested as an OV from preclinical proof-of-concept up to first-in-human clinical studies. The approval of the first OV in the Western world, T-VEC (Imlygic), has further spurred the involvement of investigators in Germany in international multicenter studies.

Societal challenges of precision medicine: Bringing order to chaos,"The increasing number of drugs targeting specific proteins implicated in tumourigenesis and the commercial promotion of relatively affordable genome-wide analyses has led to an increasing expectation among patients with cancer that they can now receive effective personalised treatment based on the often complex genomic signature of their tumour. For such approaches to work in routine practice, the development of correspondingly complex biomarker assays through an appropriate and rigorous regulatory framework will be required. It is becoming increasingly evident that a re-engineering of clinical research is necessary so that regulatory considerations and procedures facilitate the efficient translation of these required biomarker assays from the discovery setting through to clinical application. This article discusses the practical requirements and challenges of developing such new precision medicine strategies, based on leveraging complex genomic profiles, as discussed at the Innovation and Biomarkers in Cancer Drug Development meeting (8th–9th September 2016, Brussels, Belgium).",Salgado R.; Moore H.; Martens J.; Lively T.; Malik S.; McDermott U.; Michiels S.; Moscow J.; Tejpar S.; McKee T.; Lacombe D.; Becker R.; Beer P.; Bergh J.; Bogaerts J.; Dovedi S.; Fojo A.; Gerstung M.; Golfinopoulos V.; Hewitt S.; Hochhauser D.; Juhl H.; Kinders R.; Lillie T.; Herbert K.; Maheswaran S.; Mesri M.; Nagai S.; Norstedt I.; O'Connor D.; Oliver K.; Oyen W.; Pignatti F.; Polley E.; Rosenfeld N.; Schellens J.; Schilsky R.; Schneider E.; Senderowicz A.; Tenhunen O.; van Dongen A.; Vietz C.; Wilking N.,Journal,European Journal of Cancer,2017-10-01,"Foundation Medicine, Inc.;Duke University Medical Center;European Medicines Agency;Erasmus MC Cancer Institute;Leidos Inc.;UCL Cancer Institute;Centre de Recherche en Épidémiologie et Santé des Populations;MedImmune Limited, Cambridge;Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis;University of Cambridge;KU Leuven– University Hospital Leuven;Massachusetts General Hospital;European Commission;Institut Jules Bordet;Columbia University Irving Medical Center;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency;EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute;Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency;Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited;Skånes Universitetssjukhus;National Cancer Institute (NCI);Karolinska Institutet;Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research;The Institute of Cancer Research;Food and Drug Administration;European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer;Mayo Clinic;Wellcome Sanger Institute;American Society of Clinical Oncology;Amsterdam UMC - Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;EORTC Pathobiology Group;Chair and Co-Director;Finnish Medicines Agency;Cerulean Pharma Inc.;Indivumed GmbH",Assay validation ;  Biomarkers ;  Drug development ;  Preanalytical and analytical validation ;  Precision oncology ;  Regulatory sciences
The growing complexity in invention process,"Technological and design process complexities may pose challenges to engineering design and related outcomes through invention. Understanding the trends related to the complexity of inventions and invention processes is crucial for informing engineering design research and education for invention, but has not been formally developed in the design literature. Herein, we utilize a set of patent-based metrics, drawn from complex systems research and engineering design research, to detect various aspects of the complexity in invention processes. By an analysis of U.S. patents from 1975 to 2011, our results suggest that technology inventions have been increasingly (1) requiring larger teams and more distant collaboration, (2) integrating a growing base of prior technologies, and (3) delivering more systemic and integrative new technologies. These trends may positively reinforce each other so as to contribute to a continual growth of the complexity in invention processes. Individual productivity for invention is also in decline, as we measured from the patent data. These findings suggest the increasing importance of research, education and application of complex system analysis methods and tools to control and manage the complexity in invention processes.",Luo J.; Wood K.,Journal,Research in Engineering Design,2017-10-01,Singapore University of Technology and Design,Collaboration ;  Complexity ;  Design ;  Innovation ;  Invention ;  System
Bias against novelty in science: A cautionary tale for users of bibliometric indicators,"Research which explores unchartered waters has a high potential for major impact but also carries a higher uncertainty of having impact. Such explorative research is often described as taking a novel approach. This study examines the complex relationship between pursuing a novel approach and impact. Viewing scientific research as a combinatorial process, we measure novelty in science by examining whether a published paper makes first-time-ever combinations of referenced journals, taking into account the difficulty of making such combinations. We apply this newly developed measure of novelty to all Web of Science research articles published in 2001 across all scientific disciplines. We find that highly novel papers, defined to be those that make more (distant) new combinations, deliver high gains to science: they are more likely to be a top 1% highly cited paper in the long run, to inspire follow-on highly cited research, and to be cited in a broader set of disciplines and in disciplines that are more distant from their “home” field. At the same time, novel research is also more risky, reflected by a higher variance in its citation performance. We also find strong evidence of delayed recognition of novel papers as novel papers are less likely to be top cited when using short time-windows. In addition, we find that novel research is significantly more highly cited in “foreign” fields but not in their “home” field. Finally, novel papers are published in journals with a lower Impact Factor, compared with non-novel papers, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that science policy, in particular funding decisions which rely on bibliometric indicators based on short-term citation counts and Journal Impact Factors, may be biased against “high risk/high gain” novel research. The findings also caution against a mono-disciplinary approach in peer review to assess the true value of novel research.",Wang J.; Veugelers R.; Stephan P.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-10-01,"Bruegel, Belgium;KU Leuven;National Bureau of Economic Research;Harvard Law School;Centre for Economic Policy Research, London;Georgia State University",Bibliometrics ;  Breakthrough research ;  Evaluation ;  Impact ;  Novelty
Reducing front end uncertainties: How organisational characteristics influence the intensity of front end analysis,"Front-end (FE) of innovation is crucial for the success of companies' new products. In this research stream, the concept of FE activities has become central to the whole discipline. It describes how the process of finding new product opportunities, as well as enhancing and assessing them, can be implemented. This paper builds on results that FE processes should be flexible and context-specific. It addresses the current need to understand how organisations can influence FE activities so as be more efficient. By conducting semi-structured interviews with 24 FE experts from German material science and engineering (MSE) companies, we identified three organisational factors that impact on FE activities: organisational capabilities, strategic orientation, and organisational culture. Findings indicate that organisational capabilities and strategic orientation could directly reduce the uncertainty rate in the analysis of FE activities. Further, organisational culture and soft skills have moderating effects, and the initial extent of uncertainty has a mediating effect on this rate. Overall, our research contributes to the discussion about FE proficiency, which refrains from the FE life-cycle perspective and demands project-specific and complete execution of FE activities.",Spieth P.; Joachim V.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2017-10-01,Universität Kassel,Front end of innovation ;  New product development ;  Organisational characteristics ;  Qualitative research ;  Uncertainty
Bridging the design-science gap with tools: Science learning and design behaviors in a simulated environment for engineering design,"Many pedagogical innovations aim to integrate engineering design and science learning. However, students frequently show little attempt or have difficulties in connecting their design projects with the underlying science. Drawing upon the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory, we argue that the design tools available in a learning environment implicitly shape knowledge development as they mediate students’ design actions. To explore the roles of tools in design-science integrated learning environments, this study investigated how secondary students’ tool-mediated design actions were linked with their science learning in a tool-rich design environment with minimal explicit guidance. Eighty-three ninth-grade students completed an energy-efficient home design challenge in a simulated environment for engineering design supported by rich design tools. Results showed that students substantially improved their knowledge as a result of designing with the tools. Further, their learning gains were positively associated with three types of design actions—representation, analysis, and reflection—measured by the cumulative counts of relevant computer logs. In addition, these design actions were linked with learning gains in ways that were consistent with their theoretical impacts on knowledge development. These findings suggest that, instead of being passive components in a learning environment, tools considerably shape design processes, and learning paths. As such, tools offer possibilities to help bridge the design-science gap. © 2017 The Authors. Journal of Research in Science Teaching Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Secure Persuasive Business Models and Business Model Innovation in a World of 5G,"How will a promising world of 5G influence business model innovation and what are the strings attached? The development and innovation of business models in a world of 5G is an under-researched field. In the ‘slip stream’ of new technologies, which are about to be developed, it becomes more and more important to understand how business models embedded with persuasive technologies—persuasive business models—are going to be innovated and operated. The development of persuasive technologies will lead to the exponential increase of persuasive business models in the global market. This paper will focus on how to overcome security concerns linked to persuasive business models. On behalf of the inputs from SW2010–SW2016 (Strategic Workshops held by the Centre for Tele-infrastructure, Aalborg University), lab experiments in the MBIT (Multi Business Model Innovation and Technology Research Group, Aarhus University) and Stanford Peace Innovation Lab Denmark, together with state of the art persuasive business model and technology research, we give a conceptual outlook on what to expect from persuasive business models and persuasive business model innovation in a future world of 5G.",Lindgren P.; Wuropulos K.,Journal,Wireless Personal Communications,2017-10-01,Aarhus Universitet,5G ;  Business model innovation ;  Persuasive business models ;  Persuasive technology
From RELAW research to practice: Reflections on an ongoing technology transfer project,"Over the past years, we have been studying the topic of automated metadata extraction from legal texts. While our research has been motivated primarily by RE problems, we have observed that the interdisciplinarity of the research on legal metadata, and indeed on several other topics considered by the RELAW community, has the potential to trigger innovation beyond the traditional RE. In particular, legal metadata is a key enabler for the rapidly-expanding field of Legal Technology (LegalTech). In this short paper, we describe the preliminary steps we have taken toward transitioning a prototype tool for legal metadata extraction (developed in our previous work) into a platform that is palatable to the LegalTech market. We hope that our findings would provide useful insights about the value chain for legal metadata and further offer a concrete example of a technology transfer attempt that is rooted in RELAW research.",Sannier N.; Sabetzadeh M.; Briand L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference Workshops, REW 2017",2017-09-29,University of Luxembourg,Legal metadata ;  Technology transfer
How to Assess Creative Thinking Skill in Making Products of Liquid Pressure?,"The primary skills that must be possessed in the 21st century curriculum are learning and innovation skills. One of the learning strategies that can train students to innovate and improve creative thinking skills is by applying Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in learning. Based on an interview to one of the science teachers that learning that aims to train learning and innovation skills has not been applied to learning in the classroom because there is not enough time, learning materials and assessment instruments used. This study aims to determine the results of the implementation of performance assessment of creative thinking skills on STEM-based learning in junior high school for the material of liquid pressure. This research uses descriptive method. Participants in this study were junior high school students 8th in Kudus area. The research instrument consists of observation sheet, performance assessment and documentation. The result showed that creative thinking skills performance assessment can assess student's creativity in making products of STEM-based learning for junior high school.",Chasanah L.; Kaniawati I.; Hernani H.,Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2017-09-28,Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia,
Your system gets better every day you use it: Towards automated continuous experimentation,"Innovation and optimization in software systems can occur from pre-development to post-deployment stages. Companies are increasingly reporting the use of experiments with customers in their systems in the post-deployment stage. Experiments with customers and users are can lead to a significant learning and return-on-investment. Experiments are used for both validation of manual hypothesis testing and feature optimization, linked to business goals. Automated experimentation refers to having the system controlling and running the experiments, opposed to having the R&D organization in control. Currently, there are no systematic approaches that combine manual hypothesis validation and optimization in automated experiments. This paper presents concepts related to automated experimentation, as controlled experiments, machine learning and software architectures for adaptation. However, this paper focuses on how architectural aspects that can contribute to support automated experimentation. A case study using an autonomous system is used to demonstrate the developed initial architecture framework. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, it identifies software architecture qualities to support automated experimentation. Second, it develops an initial architecture framework that supports automated experiments and validates the framework with an autonomous mobile robot. Third, it identifies key research challenges that need to be addressed to support further development of automated experimentation.",Mattos D.; Bosch J.; Olsson H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 43rd Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2017",2017-09-26,Malmö Universitet;Chalmers University of Technology,Automated experimentation ;  Autonomous systems ;  Controlled Experiments ;  Software architecture
Agile and hackathons: A case study of emergent practices at the FNB codefest,"Hackathons and similar innovation contests can accelerate the development of software prototypes to help large corporates such as banks experiment with new technology. These companies may also be adopting Agile in their existing software development practices and it is worth exploring the usage of Agile principles at such events and whether hackathons can assist overall Agile adoption. FNB is one of the largest and most innovative banks in South Africa and runs an internal hackathon called Codefest to enhance IT innovation in product design and internal operations. The event attracts over 200 internal developers who compete in teams during a 48-hour coding marathon. South African banks, including FNB, are also adopting Agile practices to improve speed and quality in their software development lifecycle. Codefest was not intended to help drive FNB’s Agile journey, however some of its principles and practices were observed as having naturally occurred during the event. This article explores the emergence of Agile practices at FNB Codefest as observed during publicly broadcast interviews with various participants and stakeholders. The spoken words of the interviewees were analysed for dominant concepts using the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto as a coding framework. The interviews provided practical observations of the environment at Codefest which was found to encourage certain Agile principles and practices. Adoption of Agile by teams also correlated with their level of success in the Codefest competition however more research would be needed to determine whether Codefest accelerated the bank’s overall Agile journey. Three main Agile concepts were found to be naturally cultivated by the environment of Codefest; collaboration, motivation and elements of technical excellence. Collaboration was observed between IT teams, between business and IT teams and between business teams, while also creating a model of conditions for how teams could operate during business as usual. Intrinsic motivators such as autonomy, mastery and purpose were also observed at codefest, supporting the notion of knowledge worker motivation as being crucial in setting up successful software development teams. Elements of technical excellence correlated to Agile through methodologies such as Extreme Programming or Scrum while quality practices were enabled by team practices such as communication and planning. Codefest was also mapped to a proposed model of Agile environments while considerations for such contests and suggestions for next steps are also presented. These include (1) using Codefest to raise awareness of Agile, (2) understanding how extrinsic motivators affect Codefest and Agile, (3) using Codefest participants to share and drive technical excellence and (4) Agile training before Codefest.",John Alkema P.; Phillip Levitt S.; Chen J.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017-09-26,"Gordon Institute of Business Science;University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg",Agile ;  Collaboration ;  Hackathon ;  Innovation ;  Motivation ;  Prototypes ;  Software development ;  Technical excellence
Software development in the western cape - the role of higher education,"The Western Cape in South Africa has been earmarked by the government and industry, as a digital hub for Africa. The region has a number of institutions, enterprises and initiatives in place to realise this goal. A study-taking into account the information technology practitioner’s perspective-was undertaken within the Cape Town region to determine the promotion of software development within the Western Cape and the role which universities can play in the support thereof. A grounded theory research approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methods was used. This study found that the main stakeholders do not promote the software industry enough. Key initiatives that should be considered include: universities need to configure their curriculum appropriately for industry needs; more awareness around software development should be created particularly at school level in order to attract more students; and universities should build partnerships with industry. At the macro level, government, through policies and funding mechanisms for education and innovation in general, should create an enabling environment to foster these initiatives. Potential hindrances to achieving these initiatives are poor management of academic programmes, underfunding of the sector and a shortage of staff.",Norman M.; Venter I.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017-09-26,University of the Western Cape,Content analysis ;  Information technology ;  Policy ;  Software development ;  Software engineering ;  Software industry
Improving the Elicitation of Delightful Context-Aware Features: A Data-Based Approach,"The pursuit of innovation in the mobile software industry frequently requires coming up with new features-A nd not just any feature, but startling and unexpected delightful features. Despite the potential of context awareness to provide a system with delightfulness, current requirements elicitation techniques do not cope with an essential aspect: Comprehension of the relationships among the numerous contextual elements of a certain domain and how they can positively influence the user task. As a result, solution providers continuously miss the opportunity to add more value to their software solutions by identifying context-aware behaviors that will lead to better recommendations or adaptations. This paper discusses this problem and proposes a process for tackling it by taking the task to be improved as input and semi-automatically generating (1) a conceptual context model that reveals and represents both the relevance of contextual elements and the relationships among them, and (2) candidate requirements. The expected scientific contributions of the ongoing research are delineated as well.",Falcao R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference, RE 2017",2017-09-22,Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering IESE,context awareness ;  context meta-modeling ;  context modeling ;  requirements elicitation ;  requirements engineering ;  software engineering

Intelligent Data-Centric Critical Systems: Security and Resilience Key Challenges,"Intelligent data-centric critical systems are considered large-scale, spatially distributed, complex systems, composed by a huge number of heterogeneous physical hardware and software components. Such systems are not isolated, but interconnected through complex network infrastructures and interdependent at multiple levels. In modern society the continuous operation of these critical systems is pivotal for providing essential public utilities and services across national and international boundaries. Malicious attacks and deliberate system failures may produce significant effects perceivable on a regional or national scale. This poses new implications and challenges to systems security engineering. Therefore this book explores current advances in the field and disseminates recent research efforts in the security and resilience of intelligent data-centric critical systems. Its goal is to support innovations in this area and feature the latest advances and directions in this amazing scenario by exploring the potential of new architectures, applications and services, as well as understanding their weaknesses and the most common threats against them. It presents approaches, techniques, and tools to detect and prevent malicious behaviors and attacks against such complex systems and communication networks.",Ficco M.; Palmieri F.,Book,Security and Resilience in Intelligent Data-Centric Systems and Communication Networks,2017-09-20,Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli;Università degli Studi di Salerno,Big Data ;  Data-centric critical systems ;  Internet of Things ;  Intrusion detection ;  Resilience ;  Security monitoring ;  Smart sensors ;  System of system
Programming Language Adoption as an Epidemiological Phenomenon,"In Software Engineering, technology transfer has been faced as a peer to peer problem, concerning only the adoption and innovation agents. This approach works well when one is just seeking the adoption of a technology by a specific client, but it can not solve a common problem that is the adoption of new technologies by a large mass of potential new users. In wider context, it no longer makes sense to focus on peer to peer transfer. A new way of looking at the problem is necessary. The diffusion of innovations is more natural when it is treated as a spread of information in a community, similar to that observed in epidemics. This work proposes a paradigm shift to show that the adoption of programming languages can be formally treated as an epidemic. This shift of focus allows the dynamics of adoption of programming languages to be mathematically modeled as such, defining models that explain the communities' behavior when adopting programming languages, and allows some forecast to be made.",Barreiros E.; Albuquerque J.; De Oliveira J.; Lins H.; Soares S.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017-09-20,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Universidade de Pernambuco;Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco;SENAI Innovation Institute for ICT,Computational Epidemiology ;  Genetics ;  Programming Languages ;  Software Engineering
Software Knowledge Registration Practices at Software Innovation Startups: Results of an Exploratory Study,"The development of innovative software usually happens in an environment of high uncertainty conditions regarding the problem, the solution, and business issues. Thus, the software needs to be delivered fast and iteratively to the intended customers, which can quickly experiment the ideas developed for the product and give adequate feedback regarding the new features. This development configuration can lead software innovation Startups to avoid activities regarding the creation and updating of documentation and models about the software ideas and features, which raise the risk of losing software knowledge that can support successive software development iterations. Aiming at contributing to supporting software knowledge registering, we conducted an exploratory study to characterize knowledge registration practices used in innovative software projects to make clear software ideas and features. Moreover, we want to observe what influence practitioners when making decisions on using one or another registration practice. The data collected from six experts from six different software innovation Startups through semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire supported the identification of registration practices and factors influencing the decision making on using such practices. The results provide an indication in the context of software innovation Startups that can contribute to future research and proposals to support the engineering of innovative software.",Nascimento L.; Travassos G.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017-09-20,Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,Innovation ;  Software Engineering ;  Startups

Researching quality in care transitions: International perspectives,"This book is concerned with the complexities of achieving quality in care transitions. The organization and accomplishment of high quality care transitions relies upon the coordination of multiple professionals, working within and across multiple care processes, settings and organizations, each with their own distinct ways of working, profile of resources, and modes of organizing. In short, care transitions might easily be regarded as complex activities that take place within complex systems, which can make accomplishing high quality care challenging. As a subject of enquiry, care transitions are approached from many research, improvement and policy perspectives: from group psychology and human factors to social and political theory; from applied process re-engineering projects to exploratory ethnographic studies; from large-scale policy innovations to local improvements initiatives. This collection will provide a unique cross-disciplinary and multi-level analysis, where each chapter presents a particular depth of insight and analysis, and together offer a holistic and detail understand of care transitions.",Aase K.; Schibevaag L.; Waring J.,Book,Researching Quality in Care Transitions: International Perspectives,2017-09-15,University of Nottingham;Universitetet i Stavanger,
Engineering Technologies for Journalism In the Digital Age: A case study,"Although technological innovations in journalism have recently received growing scholarly attention, studies have hardly questioned or explored the naturalised dominance of technology over newswork. By drawing on critical scholarship, the study aims to explore how articulations between technology and journalism are negotiated by actors engineering technological innovations for and implementing them as part of newswork.

Research at VMware,"VMware has its roots in the academic research community, starting with the commercialization of the work on x86 virtualization of Prof. Mendel Rosenblum and his team at Stanford University [1]. Developers embraced VMware's original workstation product and the ensuing work on server virtualization led to today's vSphere platform, which has enabled significant server consolidation, numerous operational benefits, and isolation-based security. In addition, the vast improvements in server utilization provide VMware's customers with significant cost savings and is a key contributor to the environmental sustainability of modern data centers [2]. VMware has remained true to its research roots, with a strong engineering culture that emphasizes grassroots innovation through hackathons, incubation projects, open source activities, seminars and RADIO, an annual R&D innovation offsite that brings together a substantial fraction of the company's developers. Just a few examples of current activities are open vSwitch (OVS), the virtualization and exploration of non-volatile memory (NVM), securing and managing the Internet of Things (IoT), and support for Containers. Over time, there has been a dramatic increase in the scope for innovation at VMware.

Shine a light,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report the grounded theory empirical validation on key categories within a design-led methodology to envision urban futures. The paper focuses on the editorial products and the design concepts that constitute the heart of the approach. An original elaboration of trend clusters is presented as an exemplification of the outcome of this trend research approach. Although the approach was not created from the viewpoint of tourism and leisure, bibliographic notes on place-making complement it for this journal. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents empirical findings extracted by the means of the grounded theory, with the purpose to empirically validate two key categories (product and process) of a urban futures methodology. The methodology is an application of High Design, the process in use at Royal Philips BV for two decades. This methodology is contextualized within the constructivist episteme, as defined by the editors of this journal in a separate publication. Bibliographic references to place-making complete the paper. Findings: The following findings are provided: empirical validation of the city.people.light communication platform (qualitative research); empirical validation of the city.people.light workshop practice (qualitative research); and bibliographic descriptions of the design process governing city.people.light and newly developed urban futures trend clusters, at European level, as an exemplification of the program/approach outcome. Research limitations/implications: The paper is structured according to a multi-layered editorial focus. Empirical findings were generated at primary research level in a 2013-2015 grounded theory projected by the author. Furthermore, the author directed the research processes and products that are the object of empirical validation. Newly defined elaborations and a discussion thereof is offered, taking into account contemporary place-making issues. Practical implications: The original design-based methodology is a structured practice in urban futures from applied sciences and corporate innovation viewpoint. In this paper, its key categories are empirically validated through the grounded theory. Additionally, outcome from the original foresight programs is presented and a bibliographic review is provided from the viewpoint of place-making. Social implications: The co-creative methodology herein empirically validated is socio-cultural centered, with a strong drive to coutnerbalance the positivist and engineering corporate mindset through a humanistic concern for people. The framework in terms of place-making takes into account postmodern evolutions of the field. Originality/value: The paper benefits from a unique mix of: epistemic note on tourism, leisure, and the future; original urban futures scenarios and design concepts from a world class corporate innovation program; and the actual empirical core of the grounded theory validation as performed in a dedicated research project. These three separate streams are mutually related.",Bevolo M.,Journal,Journal of Tourism Futures,2017-09-11,Breda University of Applied Sciences;Marco Bevolo Consulting,Design concepts ;  Grounded theory ;  Lighting innovation ;  Multipurpose strategy ;  Strategic design ;  Urban futures

Assessing the operational performance and maturity of the carbon trading pilot program: The case study of Beijing's carbon market,"On November 28, 2013, Beijing's carbon emissions trading opened on Beijing's Environmental Exchange. As one of the pilot cities, Beijing has been pursuing low-carbon development strategies under state intervention and market regulation. This paper chooses the carbon market, a medium through which Beijing manages emission reduction, as the object of study. Firstly, we compare the basic construction circumstances of Beijing with other pilot cities. Then we qualitatively analyze the development of Beijing's carbon market from the perspective of transaction status, execution of the contract, and improvement of the policies and regulations. Finally, we use the TOPSIS model to develop a comprehensive evaluation system of Beijing's carbon market. It is used to quantitatively evaluate the operational performance and maturity of the mechanism. The results show that: Beijing's carbon market has good comprehensive capabilities, ranking second place among seven pilot markets; but the maturity of Beijing's carbon market is relatively poor for insufficient market liquidity; its operations are well managed, but economic efficiency still need to be improved; the depth of transaction and the effect of reduction in emissions make it meaningful. Therefore, in order to improve the construction of Beijing's carbon market, measures should be taken as follows:(1) strengthening the quota management, and increasing carbon trading activity to avoid poor market liquidity; (2) accelerating emission reduction actions and encouraging technology innovation, such as: carrying out several policies and measures supporting new energy and energy saving & emission reduction, and increasing investment and subsidy in research and development for the technology innovation of firms etc.; (3) improving regulatory mechanism and enhancing the disclosure of carbon trading, such as: drawing lessons from the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) about measuring, reporting and verification system (MRV).",Hu Y.; Li X.; Tang B.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2017-09-10,Beijing Institute of Technology,Beijing ;  ETS pilot ;  Maturity ;  Performance ;  TOPSIS model
"Synthetic biology: Science, business, and policy","For nearly forty years, using recombinant DNA tools, researchers, and then businesses, have genetically engineered organisms by transferring naturally occurring genes from one organism into another. Doing so modifies the genetic code of living cells, imparting new traits and achieving desired results; this is done in the production of proteins, pharmaceuticals, and seeds. Synthetic biology, argues Solomon, could free scientists from the need to find natural genes to make such desired modifications.Synthetic biology permits more complex and sophisticated bioengineering than what can be achieved through previous genetic modification techniques. Drawing on non-biological scientific and engineering disciplines, including information technology and nanotechnology, synthetic biology strives to rearrange an organism's genes on a far wider scale by rewriting its genetic code, the chemical instructions need to design, assemble, and operate a species. By allowing the writing of artificial genetic codes, synthetic biology can transform existing industries and spawn new ones, creating new products as well as radically reshaping existing items.Arguing for self-regulation by the scientific and business communities, Lewis D. Solomon recommends a policy framework that would guard against governmental overregulation, which could create a barrier to innovation. Although synthetic biotechnology holds considerable social and economic potential, absent a nurturing regulatory climate, it may prove difficult to translate research discoveries into commercially viable applications.",Solomon L.,Book,"Synthetic Biology: Science, Business, and Policy",2017-09-08,,

Reliability assessment for engine driven pump of civil aircraft based on in-service data,"Reliability assessment methods for engine driven pump were studied using field failure/maintenance records including left censored and right censored data, and confidence limits of reliability measures were given. Engineering assumptions were established according to the background of commercial airline operating process and EDP maintenance, then lifetime data of EDP were obtained from the field failure/maintenance records. Furthermore, the parameters of life distributions were computed based on the weibull distribution and lognormal distribution, the best life distribution was identified by likelihood ratio test, and point estimates and confidence limits of reliability measures were obtained. The main innovation of this research is that the proposed method could deal with left censored and right censored data simultaneously to conduct product reliability assessment. Feasibility of this method is validated by a case study of EDP reliability assessment, which would provide theoretical reference for establishment of domestic civil aircraft maintenance program.",Jin Y.; Sun Y.; Sun T.; Hao X.; Qi J.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 2nd International Conference on Reliability Systems Engineering, ICRSE 2017",2017-09-08,"Harbin University of Science and Technology;Shanghai Aircraft Customer Service Co., Ltd.",EDP ;  Field failure data ;  Likelihood ratio test Reliability
Terminal Accuracy of the Feed Support System in FAST,"The main project of the five-hundred-meter aperture spherical radio telescope (FAST) has been successfully completed, under the dependent design and construction of China. Further, the telescope will experience control system debugging and test runs. The integrated innovation of optics and mechatronics endows the feed support system with lightweight and low cost. However, adoption of large-span cable parallel mechanism could introduce the vibration problem under wind disturbances. Since terminal trajectory accuracy of the feed support system is the key to realize the observation ability of the FAST, research on the vibration suppression control is urgently required to carry out, to ensure system stability and terminal accuracy. To solve the problem, vibration control methods based on trajectory compensation and inertial force are proposed. Experimental study of the trajectory compensation method is carried out with the scale model of the feed support system. Then, the dynamic simulation model of the FAST feed support system is established, and the simulation research of the inertial force method is finished. Characteristics and applicability of these vibration control methods are analyzed and discussed. Vibration control methods and application analysis illustrated in this study provide theoretical guidance and experimental support for the FAST engineering practice, and could be further adopted to the control research of other mechanism with flexible support.",Liu Z.; Chen L.; Shao Z.; Wang L.; Tang X.,Journal,Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering,2017-09-05,Tsinghua University;University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Dynamics ;  Parallel mechanism ;  Rigid-flexible coupling ;  Vibration suppression

Circular Makerspaces: the founder’s view,"Makerspaces–open access design and fabrication workshops–provide new contexts for design practice through ‘distributed production’. The global community of makerspaces has evolved quickly and in turn, substantial hype is attributed to its potential for radical sustainable innovation. In this article, we explore this potential in the context of the new ‘circular economy’ agenda. We focus the research on the critical role of makerspace managers/founders who are recognised as gatekeepers to circular practices. The research method is action-led including expert interviews (academics and founders/managers) as well as two generative context-mapping workshops, run at selected makerspaces in collaboration with their founders/managers. We unearth everyday ‘how-to’ guidance to interweave circular practices within makerspaces from the outset by: fostering an enabling culture; building local connections; nurturing individual/community capacities; and stimulating practical know-how. However, while the research reveals immense opportunities to cultivate circular literacy from within makerspaces, the prospects to ask more profound questions about our economy, through makerspace practices, are found to be compromised by day-to-day concerns. The insights from this research can act as a starting point for future work in this emerging research area.",Prendeville S.; Hartung G.; Brass C.; Purvis E.; Hall A.,Journal,International Journal of Sustainable Engineering,2017-09-03,Loughborough University London;Royal College of Art;Technical Nature,circular economy ;  design ;  distributed production ;  makers ;  Makerspaces ;  sustainability

INNOLAB- image guided surgery and therapy lab,"Incremental innovation, something better or cheaper or more effective, is the standard innovation process for medical product development. Disruptive innovation is often not recognized as disruptive, because it very often starts as a simple and easy alternative to existing products with much reduced features and bad performance. Innovation is the invention multiplied with a commercial use, or in other words something that eventually provides a value to a clinical user or patient. To create such innovation not a technology push (technology delivered from a technical need perspective) but rather a pull (by learning and working with the clinical users) is required. Medical technology students need to understand that only through proper observation, procedure know-how and subsequent analysis and evaluation, clinically relevant and affordable innovation can be generated and possibly subsequently used for entrepreneurial ventures. The dedicated laboratory for innovation, research and entrepreneurship- INNOLAB ego.-INKUBATOR IGT (Image Guided Therapies) is financed by the state of Sachsen-Anhalt as part of the European ego.-INKUBATOR program with (EFRE funds) at the university clinic operated by the technical chair for catheter technologies and image guided surgeries.

Research on Efficiency of Toll Road Dual-track Operation System Based on Three Stage DEA and Tobit Regression Model,"Aiming at the choice of the dual-track operation model of toll road industry, an empirical research was conducted to explore the operational efficiency differences between the government loan-repayment road and the operating road. On the basis of the pooled cross-section data from 2014 to 2015, three stage DEA was adopted to measure the operational efficiency of toll roads of 29 provinces in China, whilst Tobit regression model was adopted to analyze the effect of government loan-repayment road on overall operation efficiency. In this way, the differences of the efficiency between government loan-repayment road and operating road were compared. The results indicate that the overall operation efficiency of toll road industry under the dual-track system is just 0.717, far less than that of the railroad transport enterprises and highway listed companies. The differences between the first stage DEA results and third stage DEA results are not obvious, that is to say, operation inefficiency mainly results from the inner management system rather than exogenous environmental factors. The increasing proportion of the government loan-repayment road has a significantly negative impact on the operation efficiency of the whole industry. In other words, the operation efficiency of the government loan-repayment road is lower than that of the operating road. The key point of the reform in the short term is to realize system innovation by redefining the function and role of competent authority of the industry. What's more, it is necessary to improve the franchise system and enforce the PPP model to ensure the ordering transition from government loan-repayment road to operating road in the long-term reform.",Xu H.; Wang Y.; Jia R.,Journal,Zhongguo Gonglu Xuebao/China Journal of Highway and Transport,2017-09-01,Chang'an University;Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department,Operation efficiency ;  Operation model ;  Three stage DEA ;  Toll road ;  Traffic engineering
Clinical Development and Commercialization of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products in the European Union: How Are the Product Pipeline and Regulatory Framework Evolving?,"The research and development of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) has been active in Europe and worldwide during recent years. Yet, the number of licensed products remains low. The main expected legal change in the near future in the European Union (EU) concerns the regulation on clinical trials (536/2014), which will come into force in 2018. With this new framework, a more harmonized and swift process for approval of clinical trials is anticipated, which is expected to support the entry of new innovations into the EU market. A survey on ATMPs in clinical trials during 2010-2015 in the EU was conducted in order to study the trends of ATMP development since the earlier survey published in 2012. According to the results, the number of clinical trials using ATMPs is slowly increasing in the EU. Yet, the focus is still in early development, and the projects are mainly carried out by small and medium-sized enterprises, academia, and hospitals. Oncology is the main area of clinical development. Yet, the balance between cell-based products and gene therapy medicinal products in this area may be changing in the future due to the new T-cell technologies. Many limitations and challenges are identified for ATMP development, requiring proportionate regulatory requirements. On the other hand, for such a novel field, the developers should be active in considering possible constraints and actively engage with authorities to look for solutions.

Exploiting the Implementation Gap: Policy Divergence and Industrial Upgrading in China's Wind and Solar Sectors,"This article argues that manufacturing policies of Chinese local governments have provided an important corrective to some of the weaknesses inherent in the central government's indigenous innovation framework, most importantly its inattention to the importance of advanced manufacturing capabilities for innovation. Based on an original dataset of over one hundred executive interviews conducted with 43 Chinese wind and solar firms, I identify both central government R&D funding and continued local government support for manufacturing as critical factors in enabling innovation among China's renewable energy firms. In particular, this article shows that firms have utilized a combination of both central and local government policies to establish unique engineering capabilities required for innovation in commercialization and scale-up to mass production. The findings suggest that continued local government support for the manufacturing economy has not undermined central government innovation policies, but has (1) broadened the range of resources available to entrepreneurial firms and (2) enabled new options for industrial upgrading that are outside the conceptualization of innovation underlying the central government's indigenous innovation framework.",Nahm J.,Journal,China Quarterly,2017-09-01,Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies,industrial upgrading ;  innovation policy ;  manufacturing ;  solar energy ;  Wind energy

"Bioinspiration from flexible propulsors: Organismal design, mechanical properties, kinematics and neurobiology of pectoral fins in labrid fishes","Labrid fishes use their pectoral fins for efficient high-speed cruising behavior, as well as for precision maneuvering in complex environments, making them good models for biomimicry applications in propulsor technology for aquatic vehicles. Lift-based labriform locomotion is a form of aquatic flight used by many species and is the sole mode of transport across most speeds by some of the largest wrasses and parrotfishes on coral reefs. Although basic and applied research has explored fin design in several species utilizing labriform propulsion, a detailed analysis of fin anatomy, fin mechanical properties, and well-resolved three-dimensional (3D) kinematics in high-performance aquatic flyers has not yet been attained. Here, we present recent research on fin structure, fin flexural stiffness, sensory abilities of fins, and a novel 3D approach to flexible fin kinematics. Our aims are to outline important future directions for this field and to assist engineers attempting biomimicry of maneuverable fin-based locomotion for applications in robotics. First, we illustrate the anatomical structure and branching patterns of the pectoral fin skeleton and the muscles that drive fin motion. Second, we present data on the flexural stiffness of pectoral fins in the parrotfish (Scarus quoyi), setting up a stiffness field that gives the fin propulsor its passive mechanical properties and enables hydrodynamically advantageous fin deformations during swimming. Third, we present 3D reconstructions of the kinematics of high-performance Scarus fins that greatly enhance our ability to reproduce fin motions for engineering applications and also yield insight into the functional role of the fin stiffness field. Lastly, recent work on mechanosensation is illustrated as key to understanding sensorimotor control of labriform locomotion. Research on pectoral fin structure, function, and neural control in large marine species with high-performance wing-like fins is important to the comparative biology of locomotion in fishes, and we suggest it is a productive area of research on fin function for applications in the design of quiet, efficient propulsors.",Westneat M.; Aiello B.; Olsen A.; Hale M.,Journal,Marine Technology Society Journal,2017-09-01,"Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, The University of Chicago",Biomimicry ;  Flexural stiffness ;  Locomotion ;  Pectoral fin ;  Swimming

"National study of excellence and innovation in physical therapist education: Part 1-design, method, and results","Background. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching commissioned the Preparation for the Professions Program, a qualitative study of professional education in 5 professions: medicine, nursing, law, engineering, and clergy. These studies identified curricular structures, instructional practices, assessment approaches, and environmental characteristics that support the preparation of professionals and led to educational reforms. The physical therapy profession has not had any in-depth, national investigation of physical therapist education since the Catherine Worthingham studies conducted more than 50 years ago. Objectives. This research was a Carnegie-type study, investigating elements of excellence and innovation in academic and clinical physical therapist education in the United States. Design. Five physical therapist education researchers from across the United States used a qualitative multiple-case study design. Methods. Six academic and 5 clinical programs were selected for the study. The academic institutions and clinical agencies studied were diverse in size, institutional setting, geography, and role in residency education. Qualitative case studies were generated from review of artifacts, field observations, and interviews (individual and focus group), and they provided the data for the study. Results. A conceptual framework grounded in 3 major dimensions was generated, with 8 supporting elements: (1) culture of excellence (shared beliefs and values, leadership and vision, drive for excellence, and partnerships), (2) praxis of learning (signature pedagogy, practice-based learning, creating adaptive learners, and professional formation), and (3) organizational structures and resources. Conclusion. Building on the work of the Carnegie Foundation's Preparation for the Professions Program, a conceptual model was developed, representing the dimensions and elements of excellence in physical therapist education that is centered on the foundational importance of a nexus of linked and highly valued aims of being learner centered and patient centered in all learning environments, both academic and clinical.",Jensen G.; Nordstrom T.; Mostrom E.; Hack L.; Gwyer J.,Journal,Physical Therapy,2017-09-01,Temple University;Creighton University;Central Michigan University;Duke University;Samuel Merritt University,
Modelling of a Hybrid-Electric Light Aircraft,"The European Research and Innovation Agenda as well as the NASA long-term programs have set ambitious targets in terms of emission reduction for the aviation industry. Continuous improvements of conventional technologies will not be enough to fulfil these ambitious requirements; there is a need for revolutionary aircraft concepts and/or radical innovative systems. One such concept is to use a hybrid-electric propulsion system. The CIRA and the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Naples ""Federico II"" have started a joint program in order to develop models and technologies related to the electrification of propulsive system in aviation. The aim of this work is, then, the exploration of possible benefits of hybrid-electric propulsion with a focus on general aviation and selecting appropriate missions. The hybrid-electric system has been designed assembling elements/systems all commercially available, realizing a very simple parallel layout, classifiable as ""minimal hybrid"". Furthermore, such hybrid-electric system, -inclusive of energy storage system, transmission system, power management system, etc.- has been conceived to fit the original ICE requirements in term of weight, volume and max power at take-off. In this study, a simple model to evaluate the performances of a light aircraft equipped with a hybrid-electric propulsive system has been developed. The approach adopted combine the so-called 0D/1D simulation to evaluate the ""single"" ICE performances with a simple engineering modeling which allows the performances evaluation of the integrated power plant. The application of model for a simple transfer mission leads to fuel saving up to 20% while for classical training mission, where pilots make numerous run(lap) ""touch -and-go"", the fuel saving can reach a significative 30%.",Frosina E.; Caputo C.; Marinaro G.; Senatore A.; Pascarella C.; Di Lorenzo G.,Conference Proceeding,Energy Procedia,2017-09-01,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II;Centro Italiano di Ricerche Aerospaziali,1D modeling approach ;  Hybrid-Electric Light Aircraft
Multimodal route and tour planning in urban environments,"The environmental impact of the steadily increasing demand for mobility of people and goods, especially in urban environments, raises public concern and presents challenges that need to be addressed in the interest of long-term sustainability. Along this line, the inherently eco-friendly human mobility which involves the use of urban public transit networks must be encouraged and eased. This necessitates the development of context-aware services that hide the complexity of public transit networks while considering all available transportation modalities (e.g. bus, metro, tram, walking and cycling) in order to provide sophisticated route planning tailored to both residents and visitors of urban areas. The EU-funded eCOMPASS research project has addressed this challenge through establishing a methodological framework for route planning optimization. A core objective of the project has been to employ novel algorithm engineering approaches for delivering a comprehensive set of tools and services (accessible from web/mobile application interfaces) for mobile end users to enable eco-awareness in urban multi-modal transfers. eCOMPASS delivered web and mobile services providing multimodal public transportation route planning, considering contextual information as well as various restrictions and/or user constraints.

Research and discovery science and the future of dental education and practice,"Dental graduates of 2040 will face new and complex challenges. If they are to meet these challenges, dental schools must develop a research and discovery mission that will equip graduates with the new knowledge required to function in a modern health care environment. The dental practitioner of 2040 will place greater emphasis on risk assessment, disease prevention, and health maintenance; and the emerging discipline of precision medicine and systems biology will revolutionize disease diagnosis and reveal new targeted therapies. The dental graduate of 2040 will be expected to function effectively in a collaborative, learning health care system and to understand the impact of health care policy on local, national, and global communities. Emerging scientific fields such as big data analytics, stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and advanced biomimetics will impact dental practice. Despite all the warning signs indicating how the changing scientific and heath care landscape will dramatically alter dental education and dental practice, dental schools have yet to reconsider their research and educational priorities and clinical practice objectives. Until dental schools and the practicing community come to grips with these challenges, this persistent attitude of complacency will likely be at the dental profession's peril.

Tracking the emergence of synthetic biology,"Synthetic biology is an emerging domain that combines biological and engineering concepts and which has seen rapid growth in research, innovation, and policy interest in recent years. This paper contributes to efforts to delineate this emerging domain by presenting a newly constructed bibliometric definition of synthetic biology. Our approach is dimensioned from a core set of papers in synthetic biology, using procedures to obtain benchmark synthetic biology publication records, extract keywords from these benchmark records, and refine the keywords, supplemented with articles published in dedicated synthetic biology journals. We compare our search strategy with other recent bibliometric approaches to define synthetic biology, using a common source of publication data for the period from 2000 to 2015. The paper details the rapid growth and international spread of research in synthetic biology in recent years, demonstrates that diverse research disciplines are contributing to the multidisciplinary development of synthetic biology research, and visualizes this by profiling synthetic biology research on the map of science. We further show the roles of a relatively concentrated set of research sponsors in funding the growth and trajectories of synthetic biology.

"Assessing the influence of supply chain collaboration value innovation, supply chain capability and competitive advantage in Taiwan's networking communication industry","Taiwan's networking communication industry has had a clustering scale and a good position for collaboration in the global networking communication manufacturing network. This study considers whether Taiwan's networking communication industry can enhance its competitive advantage through supply chain management activities. In order to examine the relationships of supply chain collaboration value innovation, supply chain capability and competitive advantage, this research selects 74 firms and 465 questionnaires from the upstream, middle and downstream manufactures of Taiwan networking communication industry for research subjects, and uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify the theoretical model. Results show that the relationships among supply chain collaboration value innovation, supply chain capacity and competitive advantage can have a positive impact, and that supply chain capability is a full mediator.

Nanotechnology and HFE: critically engaging human capital in small-scale robotics research,"The aim of this article is to extend the Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) engagements with nanotechnology (specifically, small-scale robotics) in university settings, in terms of a broader view of human capital. Nanotechnology as a novel technology presents challenges for HFE not only in terms of design and optimization but also in terms of the human aspects involved in the nanotechnology settings. Therefore, it is important to comprehend the knowledge production and work practices in nanotechnology settings. Correspondingly, this article presents two interrelated contributions. First, it presents one of the foremost studies conducted at the intersection of HFE and small-scale robotics. Second, it addresses a broader notion of human capital in nanotechnology settings in terms of knowledge and practices. Toward this end, this article presents an ethnographic case study of small-scale (micro- and nano-) robotics using the viewpoint of Symbolic Interactionism. This article characterizes three main facets of nanotechnology: nanotechnology as mode 2 knowledge; nanotechnology and university research; nanotechnology and innovation panarchy. Using these aspects as the overarching basis, the domain of nanorobotics is situated in university settings to capture a broader notion of human capital and work practices. The study revealed that the participants were constructing not only robots but also its ecology. The robot was best comprehended not as a technical artifact but as a sociotechnical endeavor. Thus, this research presents nanotechnology as a broader construct that goes beyond the limitations of size and scale and bridges the gap between teamwork, technical creations and the overarching ecology.",Kant V.,Journal,"Cognition, Technology and Work",2017-09-01,,Ethnography ;  Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) ;  Nanobots ;  Nanotechnology ;  Robot ecology ;  Small-scale robotics ;  Symbolic Interactionism
DUI mode learning and barriers to innovation—A case from Germany,"This paper aims to provide a better understanding of informal modes of learning based on Doing, Using and Interacting (DUI). Innovating firms from Germany are grouped according to the degree to which they combine DUI mode competencies with formal learning of science and technology (i.e. the Science, Technology and Innovation – STI – mode). To more deeply assess the practical relevance of this grouping for innovation policy, it is subsequently examined how a firm's learning mode relates to the relevance of different sets of innovation barriers. According to the empirical results, DUI mode learning is generally important in the field of innovation, since it occurs either in its pure form or in combination with formal processes of research and development (R&D). Moreover, the more dominant that the DUI mode of learning is at the company level, the more likely that the corresponding firm is small. In such a less R&D-oriented knowledge environment, innovating firms can exploit certain competitive advantages when they concentrate on their experience-based DUI mode competencies. On the other hand, firms trying to compensate for limited in-house R&D capabilities through collaboration with external partners have to overcome a number of knowledge and market barriers to innovation. The paper concludes with implications for policy and research.",Thomä J.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-09-01,Georg-August-Universität Göttingen,Barriers to innovation ;  Innovation without R&D ;  Modes of learning ;  Non-technological innovation ;  Small firms ;  Vocational education
"Assessing the relationships between human capital, innovation and technology adoption: Evidence from sub-Saharan Africa","In spite of growing body of research on human capital and innovation, our understanding of the effects and roles of human capital in enhancing innovation and technology adoption in the developing world particularly sub-Saharan Africa remains limited. Using a sample of 45 sub-Saharan African countries from 1960 and 2010, we measure innovation and technology adoption using the Malmquist productivity index approach, and examine the effects of human capital on innovation and technology adoption using different panel data techniques. The study uncovers that the overall mean estimates over the period shows a decline of 0.08% for innovation and a moderate increase of 1.7% for the adoption of technology. Indeed, many countries in the sample experienced technical regress or decline in innovation, but the estimates for most countries showed an improvement in adoption of technology. Human capital appears to exert a positive and statistically significant impact on adoption of technology whilst, its effect on innovation is found to be insignificant.",Danquah M.; Amankwah-Amoah J.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2017-09-01,Kent Business School;University of Ghana,Adoption of technology ;  Human capital ;  Innovation ;  Sub-Saharan Africa
Kirigami pattern design of mechanically driven formation of complex 3D structures through topology optimization,"Rapid, precise and controllable assembly of three-dimensional (3D) micro/nanostructures in advanced materials are attracting increasing interest in scientific research and engineering innovation due to its widespread applications. One of the notable approaches that can achieve mechanically driven assembly of 3D mesostructures is realized by applying compressive forces on two-dimensional (2D) micro/nanomembranes with strategically designed geometry and patterns of cuts. This approach is very effective to produce 3D mesostructures for prescribed cutting patterns, however, the inverse problem, that is finding the geometries and patterns of cuts which can lead to predefined desirable 3D morphologies, has not been well addressed yet. In this letter, a systematic approach that can solve the aforementioned inverse design problem is developed under the framework of topology optimization. Design examples provided demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Xue R.; Li R.; Du Z.; Zhang W.; Zhu Y.; Sun Z.; Guo X.,Journal,Extreme Mechanics Letters,2017-09-01,Dalian University of Technology,Genetic algorithm ;  Kirigami pattern ;  Moving Morphable Component (MMC) ;  Post-buckling morphology ;  Topology optimization
Process Modeling and Simulation of Biochar Usage in an Electric Arc Furnace as a Substitute for Fossil Coal,"Increasing demands on the electric arc furnace (EAF) with regard to sustainability and energy efficiency are leading to various technological innovations. To reduce the carbon footprint of the steel production in EAFs, fossil coal can be substituted by biochar as investigated within the GreenEAF research projects. Palm kernel shells (PKS) are used for industrial long-term trials and showed no negative impact on product quality or energy consumption and are technically feasible, but led to different reaction behavior. For further investigations on PKS usage in the EAF, the charging of biomass is implemented in a dynamic EAF process simulation model. As one of the biggest differences of PKS in comparison to fossil coal, the chemical energy of the higher volatile content is earlier available during the heat. The model considers the chemical composition of the type of coal and distinguishes between volatiles and fixed carbon. The simulation results and measurements of the averaged off-gas composition are showing the increased reaction rate of PKS. The results are obtained with the same model parameterization as for anthracite charging. In the future, the model will be applicable to analyze various modes of operation with regard to optimized energy and resource efficiency.",Meier T.; Hay T.; Echterhof T.; Pfeifer H.; Rekersdrees T.; Schlinge L.; Elsabagh S.; Schliephake H.,Journal,Steel Research International,2017-09-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Georgsmarienhütte GmbH,biomass ;  electric arc furnace ;  gas phase ;  process modeling ;  process simulation ;  simulation
Delay or forgo? A closer look at youth driver licensing trends in the United States and Australia,"In recent years a rapidly-expanding body of literature has attempted to understand reductions in the rate of driver licensing among young adults in developed countries. An unanswered question emerging from this literature has been whether young adults are truly turning their back on the car, or simply delaying the inevitable transition to a car-dependent lifestyle. This viewpoint paper will present some of the only evidence available that directly addresses this crucial question and discuss the implications of forgoing versus delaying car licensing. This discussion is couched within the theoretical framework of socio-technical transition research. Changes in youth driver licensing are putting pressure on the prevailing socio-technical regime of car dominance, providing a window of opportunity for niche innovations to destabilise and reform this regime. However, this trend must be supported by policy and planning if it is to continue.",Delbosc A.,Journal,Transportation,2017-09-01,Monash University,Car licensing ;  Generation Y ;  Millennials ;  Socio-technical transitions ;  Young adults
Technology roadmapping architecture based on technological learning: Case study of social banking in Iran,"Technology roadmapping is a planning tool that plays a key role in technology, innovation and R&D decisions in range of business, industry and national levels and shows the path for development of required skills. As technology development engine in late industrialized countries is technological learning rather than innovation, we observe that the considerations and requirements of technology development in developing countries have been neglected in current published literature on technology roadmaps. In this paper, by introducing technological learning as an appropriate analysis level for technology roadmapping in developing countries, the main components of technological learning including technological capabilities (TCs) and catch up strategy have been identified and efforts have been made to integrate these components in the ordinary technology roadmap architectures and thereby introduce an appropriate architecture for industries in developing countries.

The lives and deaths of open source code forges,"Code forges are third party software repositories that also provide various tools and facilities for distributed software development teams to use, including source code control systems, mailing lists and communication forums, bug tracking systems, web hosting space, and so on. The main contributions of this paper are to present some new data sets relating to the technology adoption lifecycles of a group of six free, libre, and open source software (FLOSS) code forges, and to compare the lifecycles of the forges to each other and to the model presented by classical Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory. We find that the observed adoption patterns of code forges rarely follow the DoI model, especially as larger code forges are beset by spam and abuse. The only forge exhibiting a DoI-like lifecycle was a smaller, community-managed, special-purpose forge whose demise was planned in advance.

Genetic engineering and genome editing in plants,"Since the success of the first genetically modified tobacco in 1983, great advances have been achieved in plant genetic transformation technology. Genetic engineering has become an important tool for plant functional gene research and crop germplasm innovation, which brings a revolution for crop production. Gene-gun-mediated transfer and use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a vector are the two common approaches for delivering the expression cassette of gene of interest into plant cells. Both DNA delivery methods insert foreign DNA into plant genome at random position, and thus have some limitations. The recent advent of genome-editing technologies has enabled to generate mutation, insertion and deletion of small fragments and other modifications at very precise locations within the genome. The new technology, named as ""gene editing"" or ""genome editing"", has broad prospects and application value for gene function research and genetic improvement.

A new vision for center-based engineering research,"The future security, economic growth, and competitiveness of the United States depend on its capacity to innovate. Major sources of innovative capacity are the new knowledge and trained students generated by U.S. research universities. However, many of the complex technical and societal problems the United States faces cannot be addressed by the traditional model of individual university research groups headed by a single principal investigator. Instead, they can only be solved if researchers from multiple institutions and with diverse expertise combine their efforts. The National Science Foundation (NSF), among other federal agencies, began to explore the potential of such center-scale research programs in the 1970s and 1980s; in many ways, the NSF Engineering Research Center (ERC) program is its flagship program in this regard.

Successful students - STEM program: Teacher learning through a multifaceted vision for STEM education,"The current STEM education agenda is driven by the belief that STEM skills are crucial to innovation and development in our contemporary, technological, knowledge-based, competitive global economy (Office of the Chief Scientist, Science, technology, engineering and mathematics: Australia's future. Australian Government, Canberra, 2014; Australia's STEM workforce: Science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Australian Government, Canberra, 2016). This chapter articulates a comprehensive, multifaceted and coherent STEM vision that addresses the subtle and complex challenge of preparing ""twenty-first-century"" citizens within the constraints of a traditional school system and curriculum. For STEM education to be incorporated effectively and sustainably in schools, a STEM vision needs to be inclusive of school-specific needs.

Training neural networks to approximate traffic simulation outcomes,"We present results of our research on training neural networks to approximate traffic simulation outcomes, such as total times of waiting on a red signal. We developed TensorTraffic software, based on a TensorFlow library, and trained neural networks on a dataset generated by simulating traffic on a realistic road network of Warsaw using Traffic Simulation Framework software. The goal of conducted experiments was to approximate the total times of waiting on a red signal on a region of Warsaw (Stara Ochota district), with the input to neural nets representing offsets of traffic signals on that region. In the presented research, we focused on investigating different neural network models and strategies of their training. We took into account different sizes of training sets, different numbers of neurons and layers, different parameters of dropout and learning rate, in order to reduce as much as possible time required to conduct experiments and apply this method in practice (e.g., time required to generate training and test sets for neural networks, time to train neural networks and time to make inferences on a new set), while preserving a sufficient accuracy of approximations, which may be especially important from a practical point of view Results show that it is possible to train neural networks able to approximate with a high accuracy (with an average error 1.18%) outcomes of traffic simulations. Moreover, TensorTraffic allows obtaining results of approximations a few orders of magnitude faster than by running simulations using microscopic traffic models and it is possible to achieve acceptable accuracy on a relatively small training set (consisting of 10240 elements). It means that the method can be potentially applied to different traffic analysis and transport planning tasks (e.g., to find suboptimal configurations of traffic signals) and time-consuming computer simulations applied nowadays for traffic analysis can be potentially replaced by neural nets supported by computations using graphical processing units (GPU). This innovation may significantly reduce time required to complete research and engineering tasks related to designing road infrastructure and analysing vehicular traffic, as well as enable developing better traffic management systems. As an example, we applied the method to the traffic signal setting problem and accelerated existing genetic algorithm, giving opportunity to evaluate much larger set of possible settings and find better traffic management strategies.",Gora P.; Bardonski M.,Conference Proceeding,"5th IEEE International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems, MT-ITS 2017 - Proceedings",2017-08-08,NVIDIA;University of Warsaw,approximation of traffic models ;  neural networks ;  traffic optimization ;  traffic prediction
50th Anniversary Perspective: Advanced Polymer Fibers: High Performance and Ultrafine,"As Macromolecules celebrates its 50th anniversary, we reflect on the impact of polymer chemistry and engineering on the advancement of synthetic polymer fibers. In this Perspective, we focus on two exemplary cases: (i) high performance fibers and (ii) ultrafine electrospun fibers. High performance in this context refers to fibers like Kevlar and Spectra, which emerged as a consequence of novel chemistry and processing innovations to convert synthetic polymers into fibers with exceptional specific stiffness and strength. More recently, the development of ""ultrafine"" (i.e., submicrometer diameter) fibers by technologies such as electrospinning has advanced dramatically, resulting in interesting, emergent structures and properties, such as surface and internal morphologies, electrical and mechanical properties, and growth applications like tissue engineering and sensors, which are subjects of current research. In both cases, challenges and opportunities exist in the development of polymer processes to advance the current state of these synthetic polymer fibers.",Park J.; Rutledge G.,Journal,Macromolecules,2017-08-08,MIT School of Engineering,

Metrology in electricity and magnetism: EURAMET activities today and tomorrow,"Metrology dedicated to electricity and magnetism has changed considerably in recent years. It encompasses almost all modern scientific, industrial, and societal challenges, e.g. the revision of the International System of Units, the profound transformation of industry, changes in energy use and generation, health, and environment, as well as nanotechnologies (including graphene and 2D materials) and quantum engineering. Over the same period, driven by the globalization of worldwide trade, the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (referred to as the CIPM MRA) was set up. As a result, the regional metrology organizations (RMOs) of national metrology institutes have grown in significance. EURAMET is the European RMO and has been very prominent in developing a strategic research agenda (SRA) and has established a comprehensive research programme. This paper reviews the highlights of EURAMET in electrical metrology within the European Metrology Research Programme and its main contributions to the CIPM MRA. In 2012 EURAMET undertook an extensive roadmapping exercise for proposed activities for the next decade which will also be discussed in this paper. This work has resulted in a new SRA of the second largest European funding programme: European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research.",Piquemal F.; Jeckelmann B.; Callegaro L.; Hällström J.; Janssen T.; Melcher J.; Rietveld G.; Siegner U.; Wright P.; Zeier M.,Journal,Metrologia,2017-08-04,Laboratoire National de Metrologie et d'Essais;Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica;NMi Van Swinden Laboratorium;Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT;Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt;National Physical Laboratory;Federal Institute of Metrology METAS,electricity and magnetism ;  EURAMET ;  fundamental and quantum metrology ;  low frequency ;  power and energy ;  radio frequency and microwave ;  SI units
Space research and extraterrestrial construction industry,"Advance of civilization has been realized through the ages by exploration of unknown parts of the Earth and by exploiting new resources thus acquired. There are currently practically no new areas on this planet to be explored and exploited. This is achieved by the completion of the period called globalization. As a natural continuation of this process, humans will now explore and exploit new areas beyond Earth, i.e. in space. Moon has already been explored partly, it awaits a complete exploration and colonization. The next step will be Mars and beyond. Habitation on these new space bodies will firstly necessitate construction of outposts on these bodies. Thus construction on the Moon, Mars, and other space bodies can be considered to be an important component of space research. In the present article, an overview of space research is presented together with the innovations awaited in space construction industry and the importance of feedback of these studies to construction industry in general.",Toklu Y.; Çerçevik A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies, RAST 2017",2017-08-04,Bilecik Şeyh Edebali Üniversitesi;Okan Üniversitesi,Earth ;  Mars Civil Engineering ;  Moon ;  Space

Innovative learning in engineering education: Experimenting with short-term project-oriented research and project-based learning,This paper presents a reflection on the results of an experimental curricula design which combined short-term project-oriented research and project-based learning in the field of electrical engineering and renewable energy. The experiment was based on the application of the Project-Based Learning methodology. The problem to be solved arose from a local company and was carried out at a master level in the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança in Portugal. This experiment aimed to contribute to the innovation and modernization of educational projects of professionally oriented programmes in higher education institutions. It also demonstrated some of the advantages and challenges of learning innovation. Feedback from the students was encouraging but the results of this experiment mainly pointed to the need that everyone must be prepared for change. The study contributes to understanding both why and how we need to foster educational shift in electrical engineering to educate students and enhance their engineering skills for the twenty-first century.,Leite V.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics,2017-08-03,CISE-Centro de Investigação em Sistemas Electromecatrónicos;Instituto Politécnico de Bragança,Innovative learning ;  Project-based learning ;  Short-term project-oriented research
Improving the learning experience and outcomes in entrepreneurial courses,"Entrepreneurship has been gaining momentum is Europe over the last years as a way to reduce unemployment levels, and in line with the take-off of the digital economy in the world. Entrepreneurship education is still an open research area, with many courses being launched in almost all universities. We describe our experience in running a summer school and mentoring the teams created in the context of the EU-XCeL project, and ICT focused project funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. From this experience, we extract some conclusions and recommendations for preparing better courses and learning experiences, and we also advocate for courses mixing students from different Degrees studies, mainly Engineering and Business, for improving the experience and the course outcomes, especially for students of Engineering Degrees.",Alonso D.; Pastor J.; Alvarez B.; Suarez T.; Tasic I.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics,2017-08-03,Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena;BlueSpecs;Barrabés Next,Entrepreneurship curriculum ;  Entrepreneurship education ;  Mixed teams
Oral nerve tissue repair and regeneration,"Nerve tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary topic relevant to medicine and dentistry. Repairing nerves with bioengineered scaffolds not only relies on the types of the biomaterials used to produce a mechanically stable and biocompatible environment for regeneration, but also may require the application of stem cells and growth factors to induce differentiation and bioactivity. Multiple techniques have led to development of a number of scaffolds with unique advantages and limitations. Innovations in neural tissue engineering have already yielded positive results in medical capacities, including spinal nerve repair. With the increasing utilization of stem cell therapy and advances in the field of material science, research in neural tissue regeneration in the head and neck region, especially the repair of the trigeminal nerve, has gradually become very prominent. The use of reproducible, rapid, and patient-specific approaches are evolving to treat nerve injuries and reverse sensory and motor deficits, ultimately restoring a functional and healthy patient lifestyle.",Jazayeri H.; Fahimipour F.; Tahriri M.; Almeida L.; Tayebi L.,Book,Biomaterials for Oral and Dental Tissue Engineering,2017-08-01,University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine;Marquette University School of Dentistry,Oral nerve ;  Oral nerve tissue repair ;  Oral never tissue engineering ;  Oral regeneration
Co-design for a circular approach in green technologies: Adaptation of reused building material as growing substrate for soilless cultivation of lettuce (lactuca sativa var. capitata),"Improving the awareness of the responsibility of our actions is the basis of achieving the ambitious aim of waste management and prevention established by the European Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/CE and the most recent Circular Economy Package. Circular Economy is connected both to improve manufacturing technologies and also educate people towards responsible consumption and waste reduction. Due to its educational and institutional role, universities provide a context to rethink not only at our technological system through the adoption of eco-innovation, but also to reconsider the entire system of our values through the education of the society in many aspects of sustainability. Most sustainability education courses co-generate knowledge in an explorative way through inter-and trans-disciplinary methodologies. A Living-lab of sustainability called Terracini in Transizione is ongoing at the School of Engineering and Architecture of University of Bologna. This Living-lab offers new opportunities and useful feedback to research and teaching, as well as contributing to the engagement of engineering students. As a result ofthe Living-lab, various experimental green technologies for Urban Resilience have been co-designed by students, researchers and professors. In order to strengthen the sustainability ofthe proposed solutions, some of them are being constructed using recycled materials. The aim is to close the cycle of utilized materials, and the hereby presented experiment focuses on testing the water and rooting capacity of innovative recycled materials as substrates for edible plants cultivation in innovative green technologies (e.g. soilless cultivation). Tested substrates include a control (mix of perlite-vermiculite) and recycled substrates, either made of crushed plasterboard panels, synthetic wadding or panels of rockwool. The present study addresses the definition ofthe hydraulic properties ofthe substrates and their effect on the yield of hydroponically grown lettuce (Lactuca sativa).",Rizzo S.; Cappellaro F.; Accorsi M.; Orsini F.; Gianquinto G.; Bonoli A.,Journal,Environmental Engineering and Management Journal,2017-08-01,ENEA Centro Ricerche Bologna;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;Research Centre on Urban Environment for Agriculture and Biodiversity (ResCUE-AB),Circular approach ;  Green technologies ;  Lettuce ;  Soilless growing ;  Waste and water management
Smart medicine and healthcare,"Innovation and rapid technological development in Smart Medicine or Smart Healthcare impact profoundly on many aspects of healthcare. It is believed that Health Information Technology (HIT) has the potential to improve integration between care providers, reduce administrative costs and burdens, reduce medical errors, and improve care quality and patient outcomes. However, issues such as interoperability, compatibility, and integration are critical to effectively integrating hardware and software in order to fully realize the benefits of HIT. High-end medical devices and equipment, including medical carts / mobile computer carts and wireless physiological and biomedical monitoring devices, should also be integrated into the hospital information system. Furthermore, the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom Hierarchy (DIKW) has been gaining popularity in the development of Nursing Information Systems (NIS) since 2013. To create a DIKW-based information system, data must first be defined and analyzed and then transformed into meaningful information. Eventually, this information is transformed into an intelligent system. For example, if evidence-based nursing research results / findings are integrated into the NIS to guide clinical practice, patient outcomes, patient safety, and healthcare quality will be greatly enhanced.",Lu Y.; Chen L.,Journal,Journal of Nursing,2017-08-01,Chang Gung Memorial Hospital;Chung Shan Medical University,Health information technology (HIT) ;  Human factors engineering ;  Intelligent systems ;  Smart medicine
Statistical controversies in clinical research: Data access and sharing-can we be more transparent about clinical research? Let's do what's right for patients,"Calls for greater transparency and 'open data access' in clinical research are widespread, from sources including the Executive Office of the President, which in 2013 called for increased access to the results of federally funded research. In 2015, The Institute of Medicine issued a report advocating for a multi-stakeholder effort to foster responsible data sharing, and there are many others. Open science is good for researchers, good for innovation, and good for patients. The question at the center of the open-science efforts for clinical trials should not be whether data should be shared, but rather how we can usher in responsible methods for doing so. Unfortunately, there remain numerous perceived barriers to complete transparency around clinical trial data. This paper reviews the current status of data disclosure, the barriers to achieving it and a suggestion for the future.",Rockhold F.,Journal,Annals of Oncology,2017-08-01,Duke Clinical Research Institute,Data access ;  Data sharing ;  Open science ;  Transparency
Progress in three-dimensional bioprinting,"Manufacturing has historically followed a mass production approach due to economies of scale and the engineering challenges of large-scale customization, leading to a one-size-fits-all paradigm. This manufacturing-centric approach has forced consumers and patients to adapt to medical devices in terms of anatomical fit and biological performance, often significantly decreasing their quality of life. In order to improve the biological interface with the human body, the materials science and bioengineering communities are rapidly adopting three-dimensional (3D) printing, which promises high precision, automation, and a customized fit. However, numerous design and engineering constraints, many posed by the fragile nature of living cells and soft gels, suggest exciting opportunities for further research in materials synthesis, characterization, and integration. Specifically, materials innovations in bioinks and support materials, coupled with improved 3D bioprinting processes for multiple materials, have the potential to empower the next generation of biology by enabling precision engineered tissues, organoids, and eventually whole organs.",Feinberg A.; Miller J.,Journal,MRS Bulletin,2017-08-01,Carnegie Mellon University;Rice University,biological ;  biological synthesis (assembly) ;  biomedical
Biomimetics image retrieval platform,"Biomimetics is a new research field that creates innovation through the collaboration of different existing research fields. However, the collaboration, i.e., the exchange of deep knowledge between different research fields, is difficult for several reasons such as differences in technical terms used in different fields. In order to overcome this problem, we have developed a new retrieval platform, ""Biomimetics image retrieval platform,"" using a visualization-based image retrieval technique. A biological database contains a large volume of image data, and by taking advantage of these image data, we are able to overcome limitations of text-only information retrieval. By realizing such a retrieval platform that does not depend on technical terms, individual biological databases of various species can be integrated. This will allow not only the use of data for the study of various species by researchers in different biological fields but also access for a wide range of researchers in fields ranging from materials science, mechanical engineering and manufacturing. Therefore, our platform provides a new path bridging different fields and will contribute to the development of biomimetics since it can overcome the limitation of the traditional retrieval platform.",Haseyama M.; Ogawa T.; Takahashi S.; Nomura S.; Shimomura M.,Journal,IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems,2017-08-01,National Museum of Nature and Science;Chitose Institute of Science and Technology;Hokkaido University,Biomimetics ;  Inter-field collaboration ;  Scanning electron microphotograph ;  Visualization-based image retrieval
Working with bacteria and putting bacteria to work: The biopolitics of synthetic biology for energy in the United Kingdom,"The UK government has made significant investment into so called ‘fourth-generation' biofuel technologies. These biofuels are based on engineering the metabolic pathways of bacteria in order to create products compatible with existing infrastructure. Bacteria play an important role in what is promoted as a potentially new biological industrial revolution, which could address some of the negative environmental legacies of the last. This article presents results from ethnographic research with synthetic biologists who are challenged with balancing the curiosity-driven and intrinsically fulfilling scientific task of working with bacteria, alongside the policy-driven task of putting bacteria to work for extrinsic economic gains. In addition, the scientists also have to balance these demands with a new research governance framework, Responsible Research and Innovation, which envisions technoscientific innovation will be responsive to societal concerns and work in collaboration with stakeholders and members of the public. Major themes emerging from the ethnographic research revolve around stewardship, care, responsibility and agency. An overall conflict surfaces between individual agents assuming responsibility for ‘stewarding' bacteria, against funding systems and structures imposing responsibility for economic growth. We discuss these findings against the theoretical backdrop of a new concept of ‘energopolitics' and an anthropology of ethics and responsibility.",McLeod C.; Nerlich B.; Mohr A.,Journal,Energy Research and Social Science,2017-08-01,University of Oxford;University of Nottingham,Bioeconomy ;  Biopolitics ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Synthetic biology
R&D cooperation and unintended innovation performance: Role of appropriability regimes and sectoral characteristics,"This research empirically examines the relation between R&D cooperation and unintended innovation performance. The effects of appropriability and sectoral conditions on the unintended innovation performance in the context of R&D cooperation were also tested. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the manufacturing firms sampled from the Korea Innovation Survey (KIS) 2012. Our estimation results show that for the high-tech focal firms under strong appropriability regime, cooperation with competitors increases the likelihood of their unintended innovation performance. For the high-tech focal firms under weak appropriability regime, cooperation with customer and user firms and universities increases the likelihood of their unintended innovation performance. For the low-tech firms under strong appropriability regime, cooperation with the customer and user firms and advisory organizations increases the likelihood of unintended innovation performance. For the low-tech firms under weak appropriability regime, cooperation with competitors and government research institutes increases the likelihood of unintended innovation performance. As a whole, the significance of this paper lies in shedding a new light on approaching the innovation performance with the notion of unintended innovation performance, which is shaped by different partner types and environmental conditions.",Seo H.; Chung Y.; Yoon H.,Journal,Technovation,2017-08-01,KAIST College of Business;Pôle Léonard De Vinci;Kyung Hee University,Appropriability regime ;  High technology industry ;  Low technology industry ;  R&D cooperation ;  Unintended innovation performance
The importance of the technologically able social innovators and entrepreneurs: A US national laboratory perspective,"A country's National Innovation Policies (NIP) often center on military, energy or other national security missions. Yet many countries' NIPs have resulted in tremendous societal benefit through both planned and unplanned action not associated with these goals. Socially important technology product platforms often are developed at facilities that are part of National Innovation Systems. Yet the policies that govern Social Entrepreneurial Action (SEA) at these facilities are unclear. If there is not a place for SEA in these facilities for technology transfer practice then there is cause for concern. Here we add to the growing literature on SEA by utilizing the case study method to investigate how SEA has been utilized by the US National Innovation Systems (NIS) for the benefit of society. We do this by investigating two cases which emphasize internal (corporate) and external SEA in a research facility within the US NIS. We demonstrate how a US national laboratory's external engagement of SEA led to one of the most important innovations of the last half of the 20th century – the Laminar Flow Clean Room. We also show how internal SEA led to the emergence of the National Institute for Nanotechnology Engineering (NINE). The “NINE program” created a pathway enabling the emergence of nascent policy makers, technologists and entrepreneurial professionals. We then provide a model for SEA at US national laboratories through technology able social innovators and identify a new type of internal and external social entrepreneur – the Technologically Able Social Entrepreneur (TASE).",Chavez V.; Stinnett R.; Tierney R.; Walsh S.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2017-08-01,The University of New Mexico;United States Department of Agriculture;Universiteit Twente;Sandia National Laboratories,National Innovation Policy ;  National Innovation System ;  Social Entrepreneurship ;  Technologically Able Social Entrepreneur (TASE) ;  Technologically Able Social Innovator (TASI) ;  Technology Entrepreneurship
A systematic mapping study on using social media for business process improvement,"Studies involving social media have focused on analyzing how companies can propagate information or how the social media tools can affect user behavior. Few studies have paid attention to User-Generated Content and its application to the improvement of business processes, even though there has been an increase in reported cases in recent years. Through a systematic mapping study of the Ebsco® database, we looked for articles that addressed this issue of user-generated content since its first appearance of up to 2015. In a first view, we confirmed the paucity of research related to this theme, even with the large increase of social media studies. As findings, we identified some important research trends towards public organizations using the content created by citizens to improve public services, as well as companies using social media tools to improve innovation processes. On the other hand, we identified gaps in the research, such as in journalism, engaging readers as information providers, and social media, being used for the improvement of the e-learning process.",Nascimento A.; Silveira D.,Journal,Computers in Human Behavior,2017-08-01,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Universidade de Pernambuco,Business process improvement ;  Social media ;  Systematic mapping study ;  User-created content ;  User-generated content
How to identify cooperation partners based on multisource data,"this study aims at identifying potential industry-University-research institution collaborations partners (IURC) efficaciously and analyzes the conditions and dynamics in the IURC process, based on knowledge potential and the knowledge spillover theory. Furthermore, a new identification method is constructed that takes into account the law of scientific research cooperation and economic factors. The method utilizes multisource data, combining bibliometric and econometrics analyses to achieve the network core of the existing collaboration network, and institution competitiveness in the innovation chain. Empirical analysis of the genetic engineering vaccine field shows that throughout the distribution characteristics of creative technologies from different institutions, the analysis based on the innovation chain can identify more complementarities between institutions. Compared to previous studies, this study emulates the real conditions of IURC. The rule of technological innovation can be better revealed, potential partners of IURC can be more easily identified, and the conclusion has a higher value in consultation. In particular, diverse informative indices can assist researchers in deriving appropriate partners for research and development cooperation.",Xu H.; Dong K.; Wei L.; Wang C.; Fang S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2017",2017-07-31,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences,Collaboration network ;  Industrial chain ;  Industry-University-Research institutions ;  Innovation chain ;  Institutions collaboration
Characteristics of university startups in Japan: Analysis of startup companies at The University of Tokyo,"Although university startup companies are expected to be a source of innovation around the world, economic effects of university startups have not been investigated thoroughly, especially outside of the United States. As described in this paper, we analyzed the characteristics and economic effects of companies started at The University of Tokyo, a world-recognized research university. Results show that very few successful startup companies account for most of the economic value created by all university startups. If the startup companies are expected to be a source of innovation, then it is necessary to have a large number of startup companies, assuming that most of them will end in failure. University-related startups are of two types: student-driven startups and faculty-driven research-based startups. The economic value created by student-driven startups is roughly equal to that created by faculty-driven research-based startups. To achieve economic development, promoting student entrepreneurship is equally important as promoting commercialization of the outcomes of academic research at universities.",Hasegawa K.; Sugawara T.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society Conference, TEMSCON 2017",2017-07-31,The University of Tokyo,Entrepreneurship education ;  Student startup ;  Technology transfer ;  University startup

IP strategies for sustainability,"Novel technologies are essential to enable environmental and societal sustainable growth. Intellectual property rights (IPR) provide incentives to technology development. But this positive effect on innovation comes with the downside that IPR can also hinder the diffusion of technology. Open approaches have been suggested to overcome this. However, in spite of this relevance, existing literature about Open IP approaches is scarce, and most investigations are focusing on the software industry. This paper discusses the benefits and drawbacks of different IP strategies against the backdrop of sustainability transition. The various modes of sharing IP are categorized according to their degree of openness in terms of access and contribution. Two case studies of companies that use a complete closed strategy and an open strategy are analysed and provide insights into various conditions that impact the suitability of an open or closed strategy and suggestions for promising future research are presented.",Tietze F.; Eppinger E.; Sternkopf J.; Vimalnath P.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society Conference, TEMSCON 2017",2017-07-31,University of Cambridge;Freie Universität Berlin;Indian Institute of Science;Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel,Nutriset ;  Open intellectual property ;  Sustainability transitions ;  Technology diffusion ;  Tesla Motors
Generative capability,"How do firms leverage existing innovation for the next round of innovation? We develop a novel concept of generative capability in product innovation to address this question. As a high-level organizational routine, generative capability applies the mechanisms of iteration and rapid knowledge integration to guide ordinary innovation activities. Based on panel data from 2001 to 2009 of 56,333 firm-year observations in China, we find that institutional complexity and internationalization are positively related to generative capability; that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have lower levels of generative capability than do firms with other ownership structures; and that generative capability improves firms' performance significantly. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of generative capability for theoretical development and point to a number of fruitful areas for future research.",Sun S.; Zou B.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society Conference, TEMSCON 2017",2017-07-31,Harbin Institute of Technology;University of Missouri-Kansas City,Generativity ;  Institutional complexity ;  Iteration ;  Product innovation
How a research university supports university-industry collaboration,"In the past decade, market pressures and decreasing U.S. federal budgets for science and technology have led to a fundamental change in expectations for corporate investments in innovation. The trend to significant, sustained corporate research collaboration with major academic centers has called for rethinking the balance between academic and corporate roles in these relationships. The Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a system-focused strategy for transformational research focused on grand challenges in areas of importance both to faculty and to industry collaborators. A model of an innovation ecosystem is used to guide both research and university-industry collaboration. The paper describes the strategy, the model, and the results to date including the benefits both to university research and industry collaboration.

"Engineering-derived approaches for iPSC preparation, expansion, differentiation and applications","Remarkable achievements have been made since induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were first introduced in 2006. Compared with non-pluripotent stem cells, iPSC research faces several additional complexities, such as the choice of extracellular matrix proteins, growth and differentiation factors, as well as technical challenges related to self-renewal and directed differentiation. Overcoming these challenges requires the integration of knowledge and technologies from multiple fields including cell biology, biomaterial science, engineering, physics and medicine. Here, engineering-derived iPSC approaches are reviewed according to three aspects of iPSC studies: preparation, expansion, differentiation and applications. Engineering strategies, such as 3D systems establishment, cell-matrix mechanics and the regulation of biophysical and biochemical cues, together with engineering techniques, such as 3D scaffolds, cell microspheres and bioreactors, have been applied to iPSC studies and have generated insightful results and even mini-organs such as retinas, livers and intestines. Specific results are given to demonstrate how these approaches impact iPSC behavior, and related mechanisms are discussed. In addition, cell printing technologies are presented as an advanced engineering-derived approach since they have been applied in both iPSC studies and the construction of diverse tissues and organs. Further development and possible innovations of cell printing technologies are presented in terms of creating complex and functional iPSC-derived living tissues and organs.",Li Y.; Li L.; Chen Z.; Gao G.; Yao R.; Sun W.,Journal,Biofabrication,2017-07-31,Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute;Drexel University College of Engineering;Air Force Medical University;Tsinghua University,3D microenvironment ;  cell printing ;  engineering-derived approach ;  induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)

Game-based idioms learning system implementation research,"Recently the quick development of virtual technology has made technology-Aided learning more versified and education revolution more advanced. With visual and audio stimulation, technology-Aided teaching can make student pay more attention than traditional way. Currently the way of learning idioms in elementary school is of more traditional way, which, without multiple interactions with students, can only have limited learning result. In consequence, students will have little impression and result in lack of interest in learning. Traditional way often emphasizes learning through repetition rather than usage, depriving students of learning motivation. Multisensory Learning is a versatile, interactive way of learning. By using multiple channel of visual, audio, touching to stimulate senses, memory of learning content will be reinforced and fortified. Game-based learning, which has been practiced with positive results abroad, can greatly improve learning result through ""learning through entertainment"" method. This game-based ""Idiom-Learning System"" combines 2 multimedia education design models: ADDIE(Analysis ?Design?Development?Implement?Evaluation), and IMM (Instructional Multimedia-Design Model), with 2 major functions of basic introduction and learning application. By using classic stories in ShanHaiJing and Chinese-style ink-wash painting as background, we hope to bring fresh experience to student in learning Chinese idioms. The use of role-playing and elements of Chinese culture can greatly enrich idiom learning process. By combining scenario with idioms question and game, students can review and learn in each level, thus piqued their interest in learning. Therefore, this research focuses on designing a game that is fit for elementary school students, who can have better learning results and more interests in learning through game-playing. Research shows that the application of game in learning idioms helps keep user interested and motivated, and often receive positive feedback. Thus Game-Based Learning is a good way to learn. The goal of this research is to develop a system that utilize technology to create a new way to teaching idioms, and to offer a possible structure of digital idioms teaching and learning system.",Liang Y.; Huang Y.; Shiue Y.; Sheng M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Applied System Innovation: Applied System Innovation for Modern Technology, ICASI 2017",2017-07-21,Chia-Nan University of Pharmacy and Science Taiwan,Game-based learning ;  Learning idioms ;  Multisensory learning
A novel scheme for constructing product development portfolio based on TRIZ,"'R & D efficiency' and 'systematic management' are two major key issues concerned in this research. This paper considers how to apply TRIZ methods to improve product lifecycle management in enterprise, and establishes the contents of product development portfolio at the design stage. The proposed scheme is founded on the four pillars of TRIZ: Functionality, Resource, Contradiction and Ideality. We apply a relational structure containing four sectors of data representation to effectively record the contents of the product design. We also introduce 31 management parameters to product development process, and support R & D management and analytic mechanism. In addition, systematic management is planned to assist the relationships identification among design requirements, design parameters, and engineering parameters. Through the construction of TRIZ-based product portfolio we may easily trace engineering parameters related to significant quality factors and product improvement.

The application of Lean Production and Six Sigma in the improvement of MRI efficiency in hospital settings,"The number of patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is on the increased. However, there are too few MRI machines, resulting in long waiting times for the patients. In order to address this problem and shorten the waiting time, this study focuses on the prospects of sharing of resources with other hospitals and increase in equipment availability. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether there are wasteful, unnecessary procedures taking up too much time during MRI studies, the elimination of which would mean improved efficiency and shortening of waiting time for the patients. We employ the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to identify potential wasteful, unnecessary work with Lean Production and Six Sigma. We also propose a scheme to improve the process and verify its feasibility by using system simulation. We hope the results of this research can be of a positive contribution to both academic and practical hospital management.",Yao H.; Chen P.; Chen P.; Kuo Y.; Shu G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Applied System Innovation: Applied System Innovation for Modern Technology, ICASI 2017",2017-07-21,Chi Mei Medical Center;Chung Yuan Christian University;Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology,Magnetic resonance imaging ;  Precision production ;  Six Sigma ;  System simulation ;  Value stream map
Identification of patent in incentivizing innovation for sustainability in the construction industry,"The increasing trend of research and innovation developments in the field of construction industry and their impacts on the national economy have raised much attention in the recent years. In this respect, through the relationship that exists between innovation and patent protection means that the education system of civil engineering has to gear itself to provide a sense of direction to facilitate future civil engineers to meet the challenges through innovation. The aim of this paper is to examine the educational experience and inclination of civil engineering students at Universiti Sains Malaysia in terms of their educational readiness to invent and innovate based on patents' exploration. Specifically, this paper presents research evidence using a quantitative method through questionnaire surveys in determining the dimension of patent information usage for innovation purposes, with attention to the hierarchy of each usage aspect and outcome measures reported. Results of this study revealed that majority of the participants have a ""simplistic and superficial"" ideas of patents identification as a source of innovation. Although a fair number of participants have relatively good knowledge of patents and innovation, lack of practical exposure and experience in construction industry are still a problem frequently encountered in the preparation to invent and innovate based on patents' exploration. It is recommended that the research model is tested using a greater number of research participants.",Zakaria S.; Sadullah A.; Majid T.; Ghazali F.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2017-07-21,USM Engineering Campus,
Rising to the challenge: Applying biofabrication approaches for better drug and chemical product development,"Many industrial sectors, from pharmaceuticals to consumer products, are required to provide data on their products to demonstrate their efficacy and that they are safe for patients, consumers and the environment. This period of testing typically requires the use of animal models, the validity of which has been called into question due to the high rates of attrition across many industries. There is increasing recognition of the limitations of animal models and demands for safety and efficacy testing paradigms which embrace the latest technological advances and knowledge of human biology. This perspective article highlights the potential for biofabrication approaches (encompassing bioprinting and bioassembly strategies) to meet these needs and provides case studies from three different industry sectors to demonstrate the potential for new markets in the bioprinting community. We also present a series of recommendations to create a thriving bioprinting environment.

The Oxistimulator system provides a low-level electrical stimulation to a patient in response to oxygen saturation levels dropping below a defined threshold for patient safety, and tracks data required to analyze the system's effectiveness. A successful outcome of the study could help justify a new medical device that would improve patient safety during post-anesthesia recovery.",Kuhlmann J.; Deick S.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications, MeMeA 2017 - Proceedings",2017-07-19,Mayo Clinic,clinical research ;  collaboration ;  electrical stimulation ;  engineering ;  innovation ;  PACU ;  undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea
The Evolution of Continuous Experimentation in Software Product Development: From Data to a Data-Driven Organization at Scale,"Software development companies are increasingly aiming to become data-driven by trying to continuously experiment with the products used by their customers. Although familiar with the competitive edge that the A/B testing technology delivers, they seldom succeed in evolving and adopting the methodology. In this paper, and based on an exhaustive and collaborative case study research in a large software-intense company with highly developed experimentation culture, we present the evolution process of moving from ad-hoc customer data analysis towards continuous controlled experimentation at scale. Our main contribution is the 'Experimentation Evolution Model' in which we detail three phases of evolution: Technical, organizational and business evolution.

3D bioprinting for drug discovery and development in pharmaceutics,"Successful launch of a commercial drug requires significant investment of time and financial resources wherein late-stage failures become a reason for catastrophic failures in drug discovery. This calls for infusing constant innovations in technologies, which can give reliable prediction of efficacy, and more importantly, toxicology of the compound early in the drug discovery process before clinical trials. Though computational advances have resulted in more rationale in silico designing, in vitro experimental studies still require gaining industry confidence and improving in vitro-in vivo correlations. In this quest, due to their ability to mimic the spatial and chemical attributes of native tissues, three-dimensional (3D) tissue models have now proven to provide better results for drug screening compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) models. However, in vitro fabrication of living tissues has remained a bottleneck in realizing the full potential of 3D models. Recent advances in bioprinting provide a valuable tool to fabricate biomimetic constructs, which can be applied in different stages of drug discovery research. This paper presents the first comprehensive review of bioprinting techniques applied for fabrication of 3D tissue models for pharmaceutical studies. A comparative evaluation of different bioprinting modalities is performed to assess the performance and ability of fabricating 3D tissue models for pharmaceutical use as the critical selection of bioprinting modalities indeed plays a crucial role in efficacy and toxicology testing of drugs and accelerates the drug development cycle. In addition, limitations with current tissue models are discussed thoroughly and future prospects of the role of bioprinting in pharmaceutics are provided to the reader. Statement of Significance Present advances in tissue biofabrication have crucial role to play in aiding the pharmaceutical development process achieve its objectives. Advent of three-dimensional (3D) models, in particular, is viewed with immense interest by the community due to their ability to mimic in vivo hierarchical tissue architecture and heterogeneous composition. Successful realization of 3D models will not only provide greater in vitro-in vivo correlation compared to the two-dimensional (2D) models, but also eventually replace pre-clinical animal testing, which has their own shortcomings. Amongst all fabrication techniques, bioprinting- comprising all the different modalities (extrusion-, droplet- and laser-based bioprinting), is emerging as the most viable fabrication technique to create the biomimetic tissue constructs. Notwithstanding the interest in bioprinting by the pharmaceutical development researchers, it can be seen that there is a limited availability of comparative literature which can guide the proper selection of bioprinting processes and associated considerations, such as the bioink selection for a particular pharmaceutical study. Thus, this work emphasizes these aspects of bioprinting and presents them in perspective of differential requirements of different pharmaceutical studies like in vitro predictive toxicology, high-throughput screening, drug delivery and tissue-specific efficacies. Moreover, since bioprinting techniques are mostly applied in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, a comparative analysis of similarities and differences are also expounded to help researchers make informed decisions based on contemporary literature.",Peng W.; Datta P.; Ayan B.; Ozbolat V.; Sosnoski D.; Ozbolat I.,Journal,Acta Biomaterialia,2017-07-15,"Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences;Çukurova Üniversitesi;Nanchang University;Pennsylvania State University;Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur",Bioprinting ;  Drug screening ;  Drug testing ;  Pharmaceutic ;  Tissue models

OCR-mirror image reflection approach: Document back side character recognition by using neural fuzzy hybrid system,"OCR is technical approach to analyze the handwritten text and turn it into a structure which the process the system more effectively for searching, re-storing, retrieval and indexing purpose. Many innovations are discovered in the field of OCR, but still many challengers are waiting for the solutions such as the recognition of document-backside-layered characters along with front side layer characters. The recognition of paper-backside-layered handwritten cum printed text is very difficult than the recognition of paper-frontside-layered characters. The fuzzy logic system process the data with help of bunch set of primary-based knowledge and delivers it into high successive recognition rate by using fuzzy classification functions, inference rules with decision-making procedures. Neural networks are compatible and best area to solve the pattern cum text recognition tasks, the learning based process start to implement from the basic imprecise data and algorithmic steps are formed with help of neuron-based learning process cum observations, but it is not effective to accomplish the user expected requirements for making the decisions. The successful combinational platform of neural fuzzy based closed loop system is proposing many technical ideas with effective solutions to solve the significant problems in OCR. This research methodology has proposed the mirror image reflection approach for recognition of document backside layer characters by using neural fuzzy hybrid system: it categorize the single page into the two sub layers, the first sub layer contains the paper front side text and the second sub layer contains paper back side text with corresponding pictures, characters, numerals and figures. Here the front sub layer text is completely bypassed with backside layer. The document-backside-layer input characters converted into neural-inputs, transformed it into fuzzy-sets, then fuzzy-rules applied based on the knowledge in fuzzification, related output responses are generated and the pre-cum-post-processing technique has applied to backside layer characters. Our ancestors used the palm leaves as the language-script-storage-Tool and enclosed valuable information about the astrology, geographical, engineering, architecture, scientific, astronomy and so on. This hidden invention provides the technical ideas and alternate salvation for engineering and medical challenges. But the major problem is extracting the information from it without open, turn the pages. Difficult to open bunched of palm leaves from a bundle due to running out of their natural life.

Influence of Nonsulfated Polysaccharides on the Properties of Electrospun Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) Fibers,"Biomimetic tissue engineering aspires to develop bioinspired implantable devices that would positively interact with the host. Given that glycosaminoglycans are involved in many physiological processes, whereas their deprivation is associated with pathophysiologies, functionalization of implantable devices with natural and/or synthetic carbohydrate moieties is at the forefront of scientific research and industrial innovation. Herein, we venture to assess the influence of various concentrations (0.01%, 0.1%, 1%) of hyaluronic acid and Ficoll on the structural, thermal, biomechanical and biological (human osteoblasts) properties of electrospun poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) fibers. The addition of hyaluronic acid and Ficoll reduced the fiber diameter, with the 1% hyaluronic acid exhibiting the smallest fibers diameter (p < 0.001). Neither the addition of hyaluronic acid nor the addition Ficoll significantly affected the onset and peak temperatures (p > 0.05). All hyaluronic acid and Ficoll treatments significantly reduced stress at break, strain at break and elastic modulus values (p < 0.001). Hyaluronic acid and Ficoll did not affect osteoblast viability and metabolic activity temperatures (p > 0.05); the 1% hyaluronic acid and Ficoll significantly increased (p < 0.001) osteoblast proliferation at day 21. By day 21, the 1% hyaluronic acid and 1% Ficoll fibers showed the highest alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. At day 21, osteocalcin was not detected, whereas osteopontin was detected on all samples. Collectively, our data clearly illustrate the biological benefit of nonsulfated polysaccharides as functionalization molecules.",Azeem A.; Marani L.; Fuller K.; Spanoudes K.; Pandit A.; Zeugolis D.,Journal,ACS Biomaterials Science and Engineering,2017-07-10,University of Galway,electrospinning ;  Ficoll ;  functionalized scaffolds ;  glycosaminoglycans ;  hyaluronic acid ;  osteoblast response
"Drip irrigation for agriculture: Untold stories of efficiency, innovation and development","Initially associated with hi-tech irrigated agriculture, drip irrigation is now being used by a much wider range of farmers in emerging and developing countries. This book documents the enthusiasm, spread and use of drip irrigation systems by smallholders but also some disappointments and disillusion faced in the global South. It explores and explains under which conditions it works, for whom and with what effects. The book deals with drip irrigation 'behind the scenes', showcasing what largely remain 'untold stories'. Most research on drip irrigation use plot-level studies to demonstrate the technology's ability to save water or improve efficiencies and use a narrow and rather prescriptive engineering or economic language. They tend to be grounded in a firm belief in the technology and focus on the identification of ways to improve or better realize its potential. The technology also figures prominently in poverty alleviation or agricultural modernization narratives, figuring as a tool to help smallholders become more innovative, entrepreneurial and business minded. Instead of focusing on its potential, this book looks at drip irrigation-in-use, making sense of what it does from the perspectives of the farmers who use it, and of the development workers and agencies, policymakers, private companies, local craftsmen, engineers, extension agents or researchers who engage with it for a diversity of reasons and to realize a multiplicity of objectives. While anchored in a sound engineering understanding of the design and operating principles of the technology, the book extends the analysis beyond engineering and hydraulics to understand drip irrigation as a sociotechnical phenomenon that not only changes the way water is supplied to crops but also transforms agricultural farming systems and even how society is organized. The book provides field evidence from a diversity of interdisciplinary case studies in sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, Latin America, and South Asia, thus revealing some of the untold stories of drip irrigation.",Venot J.; Kuper M.; Zwarteveen M.,Book,"Drip Irrigation for Agriculture: Untold Stories of Efficiency, Innovation and Development",2017-07-06,"Gestion de l’Eau, Acteurs, Usages;CIRAD;Institut Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan II;Wageningen University & Research;Universiteit van Amsterdam;IHE Delft Institute for Water Education;Royal University of Agriculture",

A Path to Collaborative Innovation Through Internal Boundary Breaking: Open innovation tools applied within the organization helped LG Chem Research Park build a culture that nurtures collaborative innovation.,"OVERVIEW: This paper describes LG Chem Research Park’s process of transforming a large, closed R&D center into a collaborative organization. Experiments with open innovation intermediaries unveiled internal boundaries, both formal and informal. That experience led the organization’s leadership team to seek ways to “unfreeze” the organizational culture. The internal application of open innovation tools broke down formal boundaries between individuals and teams. Informal communities allowed researchers to build relationships, thereby breaking informal boundaries. Easing researchers’ anxieties about collaboration, and then building researchers’ trust, in others and in the organization’s commitment to collaboration, were crucial cultural shifts. The transition process at LG Chem Research Park can serve as a model to guide R&D organizations seeking to broaden internal collaboration and move toward deeper open innovation.",Lee S.; Shin J.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2017-07-04,"LG Life Sciences, Ltd.;Sungkyunkwan University",Internal boundaries ;  Internal collaboration ;  Open innovation

"Probiotics, D–Lactic acidosis, oxidative stress and strain specificity","The existence of an implicit living microscopic world, composed primarily of bacteria, has been known for centuries. The exact mechanisms that govern the contribution of bacteria to human health and disease have only recently become the subject of intense research efforts. Within this very evident shift in paradigms, the rational design of probiotic formulations has led to the creation of an industry that seeks to progress the engineering of probiotic bacteria that produce metabolites that may enhance human host health and prevent disease. The promotion of probiotics is often made in the absence of quality scientific and clinically plausible data. The latest incursions into the probiotic market of claims have posited the amelioration of oxidative stress via potent antioxidant attributes or limiting the administration of probiotics to those species that do not produce D-Lactic acid (i.e., claims that D-Lactic acid acidosis is linked to chronic health conditions) or are strain-specific (shaping an industry point of difference) for appraising a therapeutic effect. Evidence-based research should guide clinical practice, as there is no place in science and medicine that supports unsubstantiated claims. Extravagant industry based notions continue to fuel the imprimatur of distrust and skepticism that is leveled by scientists and clinicians at an industry that is already rife with scientific and medical distrust and questionable views on probiotics. Ignoring scientifically discordant data, when sorting through research innovations and false leads relevant to the actions of probiotics, drives researcher discomfit and keeps the bar low, impeding the progress of knowledge. Biologically plausible posits are obligatory in any research effort; companies formulating probiotics often exhibit a lack of analytical understanding that then fuels questionable investigations failing to build on research capacity.",Vitetta L.; Coulson S.; Thomsen M.; Nguyen T.; Hall S.,Journal,Gut Microbes,2017-07-04,The University of Sydney School of Medicine;Medlab Clinical,bacteria ;  D-Lactate ;  efficacy ;  oxidative stress ;  probiotics ;  safety ;  strain

On the comparison of a team's directed and undirected innovation networks,"An innovation team is usually formed for a task in which the partners collaboratively commit to the same goals, and form knowledge-complementary and mutually accountable working relationships. Using a deep processing graphite RD center as an example and collecting the data from the members' published papers in CPCI-S (Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science), EI (The Engineering Index), and SCI(Science Citation Index) databases, we extract the cooperation and consultation relationships to construct the undirected and directed network. By analyzing the cohesion, connectedness of network subgroups and other measures, we show that when the RD center is developing, subgroups are connected by the key members. Some members lead in internal cooperation while others excel in external communication. We also find that the team has an obvious hierarchy and appears fragile. Our research on the RD center both increases our current theoretical knowledge and guides managerial practice.",Li H.; Qu S.; Zheng X.; Sui X.,Conference Proceeding,International Conference on Management Science and Engineering - Annual Conference Proceedings,2017-07-02,Harbin Institute of Technology;University College Dublin,Directed and undirected network ;  Innovation management ;  Stability ;  Structure comparison

Design-driven ednovation: How interdiscplinary education from design and business program can bring university R&D to society,"This research aims to explore the mechanism of design-driven ednovation (education innovation) to identify how interdisciplinary education from design and business program can bring university R&D to society. Today's research challenges in university already changes because the new ill-defined problems often exceed the abilities of any one discipline, which means that experts from diverse fields must work together to provide a range of problem-solving perspectives. To enhance the problem-solving mechanism in interdisciplinary research projects and identify real problem or humanity demands from the real society, thereby commercializing the R&D outcome, design thinking perspective is already adopted to create the linkage from the engineering to business discipline. Some new arguments also raised that innovation outcome guided by design thinking process has come to complement the market's view that, in order to innovate, one must focus on the development or integration of new technologies and on opening and/or servicing new markets. As a result, this research adopts a participant observation approach to conduct a case study of design-driven ednovation program at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan to show the findings regarding the facilitating role of design-based program and the proposed operational model to diffusing the university R&D for humanity.",Yang C.; Liou S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Orange Technologies, ICOT 2017",2017-07-02,National Cheng Kung University,Design thinking ;  Design-driven ednovation ;  Innovation management ;  Interdisciplinary
Researching computing teachers' attitudes towards changes in the curriculum content - An innovative approach or resistance?,"The content of the teaching subjects focussing on computing equipment, informatics and information and communication technologies (in general as well as digital technologies), has undergone continual changes, in particular in response to society's needs and fresh technological developments. New requirements declared by state authorities, interest organisations and school founders need to be translated into school practice. An important role in this is played by teachers, who are the designers of specific instruction procedures which they subsequently implement together with their pupils. However, how do computing teachers cope with changing requirements and are they willing to implement them or capable of doing so? Are they more likely to be innovative or will they be resistant and continue with business as usual? We have sought answers to the above posed questions through a research survey implemented at 58 basic schools in the Czech Republic. Eighty-seven teachers participated in the research. Although it is a minor research survey, it was successful in proving statistically that there are three groups of computing teachers. The first indicated group can be described as provocative innovators who pro-actively change the teaching content of their own accord in compliance with new trends and come up with new ideas regardless of external impulses in the form of new curricular syllabi. The second identified category is made up of reactive innovators who carry out changes only on the basis of certain regulations, new syllabi, etc. The third category comprises opponents to change who actually enjoy being stuck in a rut. The conclusions of the research develop the theory of computer education and, in addition, can also be applied in more comprehensive transformation processes in education or partial curricular innovations. It was proven that teachers are significant agents of changes in education.",Dostal J.; Wang X.; Nuangchalerm P.; Brosch A.; Steingartner W.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Informatics and Computing, ICIC 2017",2017-07-02,Technická Univerzita v Košiciach;Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach;Univerzita Palackého v Olomouci;Mahasarakham University,attitude ;  computing ;  curriculum ;  education ;  teacher
An examination of barriers to business model innovation,"Business models (BM) are the logic of a firm on how to create, deliver and capture value. Business model innovation (BMI) is essential to organisations for keeping competitive advantage. However, the existence of barriers to BMI can impact the success of a corporate strategic alignment. Previous research has examined the internal barriers to business model innovation, however there is a lack of research on the potential external barriers that could potentially inhibit business model innovation. Drawn from an in-depth case study in a German medium size engineering company in the equestrian sports industry, we explore both internal and external barriers to business model innovation. BMI is defined as any change in one or more of the nine building blocks of the Business Model Canvas; customer segment, value propositions, channels, customer relation, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partners, cost structure [1]. Our results show that barriers to business model innovation can be overcome by the deployment of organisational learning mechanisms and the development of an open network capability.",Rüb J.; Bahemia H.; Schleyer C.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation: Engineering, Technology and Innovation Management Beyond 2020: New Challenges, New Approaches, ICE/ITMC 2017 - Proceedings",2017-07-02,"Newcastle University Business School, United Kingdom;Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences",Barriers to Business Model Innovation ;  Business Model Innovation ;  Corporate Strategy

Managing open innovation in connected health through a living lab,"The digital footprint marks all parts of society and impacts our lifestyles. Beyond perceived changes in individual way of life, digital revolution also affects sociotechnical systems, collective structures or communities that delivers primary services for citizens. Healthcare is deeply impacted by such a digital mutation at many levels (patient expectations, caregivers practices and organization). We are probably witnessing the emergence of smart and personalized healthcare with a very large scope. To be included in this dynamics, many healthcare organizations now feature collaborative approaches and open innovation management to improve their performance in a sustainable perspective. But the complexity of systems is often a limit to their progress. This paper discuss the place and role that could be played by new utilities that are naturally based on open innovation approach: the living labs. In connected health where many stakeholders should interact, they are naturally expanding. Using an example, we show the gains in value chain that this new envision of open innovation could provide. In parallel, the paper argues for a development of open innovation engineering in such labs.

Open innovation in software requirements engineering: A mapping study,"Background: Since 2003, when the concept of open innovation (OI) was introduced, OI has been applied in many industrial fields. Previous research indicates that the use of OI in computer science is less diverse than in other fields. Especially, the role of OI in software requirements engineering (RE) seems to be little explored. Goals: This study aimed to summarize the body of knowledge about the use of OI in the field of RE. More specifically, we analyzed what uses of OI in the context of RE have been reported and how OI has contributed to individual steps of the RE process. Method: We conduct a mapping study on the literature provided in four scientific databases (ISI Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Science Direct). Results: We identified 20 relevant papers. We found: 1) 20 primary studies from the period 2003-2016 report on results about applying OI in RE. 2) Half of the studies report on the application of OI on RE as a whole. 3) Only one paper each is related to requirement prioritization and validation. 4) None of the primary studies presents a proprietary tool support for OI in RE. Only one study presents a method for automatic requirements extraction in OSS projects which can be implemented using standard machine learning tools. Conclusions: Acknowledging the lack of published research on the use of OI strategies in specific RE activities, i.e., prioritization and validation, as well as the lack of reported tool support, we see new opportunities for research on automated and thus non-intrusive and low-cost methods for applying OI strategies in RE.",Yin H.; Pfahl D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences, ICSESS",2017-07-02,Tartu Ülikool,Literature Review ;  Open Innovation ;  Requirement Engineering
Evaluation of FPGA design tools for safety systems with on-chip redundancy referring to the standard IEC 61508,"Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 lead to great possibilities of technical innovations but also to great risks and hazards. Not only the data has to be secured, but also the processing systems have to be more reliable and safe. From this perspective, implementation of safety related systems based on separated chip dies should belong to the past. ASIC developers have already designed diverse redundant system architecture on a single chip die. In last four years major FPGA manufacturers, Xilinx and Intel Altera, have been trying to establish a concept for implementing of redundant systems on a common FPGA. This study evaluates such concepts and conducts a comparative analysis with the requirements of international safety standard IEC 61508. Respectively, it argues with empirical results and discusses why the statements about reaching a SIL3 on FPGA platform are recently controversial.

A framework for lean knowledge dissemination: Enhancing innovation excellence,"Lean manufacturing concepts are currently not only limited to high-volume production; they are also becoming increasingly common in low-volume, high-variety production environments, as well as in knowledge work (e.g. innovation, product development, engineering analysis and evaluation, etc.). The ad hoc application of Lean concepts to specific local situations results in the existing body of knowledge on customized Lean being fragmented and scattered across academic and management literature, as well as among individual practitioners and academics. This creates significantly high variability among industrial applications, educational programs and teaching materials. Hence, it is necessary to have comprehensive frameworks to unify the body of knowledge related to Lean knowledge dissemination at different phases of industrial applications to drive excellence in innovation operations.

The voltages data set is calculated to reconstruct an image. 16 electrodes has been used in the system and current applied, then voltage measured. The image reconstruction process used the voltage with the help of back projection algorithm. This technique is better than X-Ray, CT Scan etc. because it has no side effect since it does not create any sort of radiation that could harm human body. Different structural element is used to enhance the image for further processing which improved the accuracy of the result.",Hossain M.; Ferdous J.; Tabassum M.,Conference Proceeding,"4th International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering, ICAEE 2017",2017-07-01,"Jagannath University, Bangladesh",Bit Plane Slicing ;  Contrast Stretching ;  EIT ;  Image Processing ;  Laplacian of Gaussian ;  Object Detection
Vertically integrated projects (VIP) at Inha University: The effect of convergence project education on learning satisfaction,"Due to the advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution in the 21st century, people with abilities based on convergence thinking are required in various fields of society. In addition, there is a growing interest in emphasizing the innovation of knowledge through academic, industrial, and technological convergence, and in how to foster convergent human resources as the scope of creativity expands. To this end, it has become necessary to change educational practices in higher educational institutions.

The curriculum is designed to improve students' major knowledge, research skills, and collaboration skills by teaming up multi-year and multi-disciplinary students. In addition, the effectiveness of convergence education is analyzed through various student evaluations every semester, and based on the results, the students' understanding of convergence education and the need for training convergent human resources in educational institutions are further expanded.",Choi J.; Kim H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2017 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering, TALE 2017",2017-07-01,Inha University,convergence education ;  multi-disciplinary ;  multi-year ;  project-based learning ;  team-based learning
A technology map to facilitate the process of mine modernization throughout the mining cycle,"It is vital for organizations and individual operations to have access to a platform with technology-related information to consider for further research and development. This paper presents a technology map that was created with the purpose of facilitating mine modernization through technological advancement throughout the mining lifecycle/cycle. To achieve this, a platform was created to represent the mining lifecycle that incorporates each of the mining phases, i.e. exploration, project evaluation, mine design, operations, closure, and post-closure phases. The constituent value drivers for each phase were then investigated and included. These covered the various focus areas within the mining cycle, such as the applicable sub-phases, processes, systems, activities, or specific challenges, that impact a mine's operation. Technologies, both physical and digital, with the potential to add value to these focus areas were then incorporated into the platform to create a technology map. This potential to add value, if applied or modified for application, was assessed on any combination of five factors, namely the ability to increase production, increase productivity, increase efficiency, improve safety, or reduce the risk of human error. The primary focus was on technologies currently classified as disruptive and/or exponential, e.g. internet of things, cloud computing, advanced robotics, genomics, 3D printing, and artificial Intelligence. Other emerging technologies were also investigated, such as automation, machine learning, renewable energy generation, energy storage, advanced materials, and more. Furthermore, selected innovative technologies adapted for or developed in mining were also investigated, as well as other new technologies in non-mining industries with potential to add value to mining. As such, a technology map was created that covers the entire lifecycle of a mining venture, which highlights technologies with the potential to add value to specific focus areas. This technology map may be applied to facilitate advances in technology for mine modernization.",Jacobs J.; Webber-Youngman R.,Journal,Journal of the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy,2017-07-01,University of Pretoria,Innovation in mining ;  Mine life-cycle ;  Mining cycle ;  Mining R and D ;  Modernization ;  New technologies in mining ;  Technology map

4Cs of innovation: A conceptual framework for evaluating innovation strategy,"While innovation is on the agenda of almost all organizations, successful innovation management remains quite elusive for many managers. This paper on innovation management strategy identifies four key interrelated areas that an innovator needs to concurrently define and organize for a systemic and effective innovation: the innovation concept, the consumer context, the competitive context, and the collaborative context. We refer to the framework involving these four areas as the 4Cs of innovation. Careful consideration of each of these four areas addresses specific issues, regarding operations, marketing, finance, and regulations, for the organization to enhance the effectiveness of the innovation strategy. We offer a practical diagnostic tool to implement the 4Cs of innovation framework. Further, we discuss our research on 99 highly innovative clean technology projects funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy as an example of how to utilize the 4Cs of innovation framework. Our analysis brings out important insights for managers of established firms and startups on how to prioritize innovation activities and highlights the effective use of 4Cs of innovation for guiding successful innovation strategies.",Erzurumlu S.,Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2017-07-01,Babson College,

Analyses of deposited and granted patents at federal university of Ceara in Brazil,"Background: Investments in patents are more and more widespread at the capitalism, because all the system working is related to the innovation and the technological and scientific advance, in which the industries and universities have a fundamental rule. When those researches generate a product, this can be patented, being deposited initially on an intellectual property bank and thus the inventor and his group will have exclusively the product rights by a time period that varies according to the country legislation. Objective: Due do the increasing interest from the general universities in innovation, the objective was to conduct a prospective study about patents deposited by the Federal University of Ceara (UFC) at the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) that is the organ responsible by the Brazil intellectual property. To do so, were selected all the deposited patents by the university till nowadays. Experimental Section: Were found deposits of 123 patents, in which 43 hadn't achieved the publication process and 3 expired. Conclusion: After the analyses of the Federal University of Ceara patents, is concluded that the majority is related to the products classes with medical, dental and hygiene finalities and that the interest of the refereed university in relation to the intellectual property protection is still small, being interesting a greater divulgation on the subject in the university.",Valadas L.; Queiroz L.; Bandeira M.; De Oliveira Filho R.; Diógenes É.; De Mello Fiallos A.; De Mello Fiallos N.; Da Silva R.; Do Carmo Filho J.; Dias C.; Ponte E.; Fernandes C.; Capistrano A.; Bruno P.; De Carvalho Furtado J.,Journal,Journal of Young Pharmacists,2017-07-01,Universidade Federal do Ceará;Universidade Federal da Paraíba;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,Intellectual Property l ;  Patents ;  Prospective Studdy ;  Technology ;  Universities
Women's representation in national science academies: An unsettling narrative,"Science academies are well placed to contribute towards strengthening of national systems of innovation through advocating for an increased participation of girls and women in science. To successfully do so, academies would need to overcome challenges faced with regard to women's representation in their own ranks and women's resultant full participation in the activities of national science academies. We collected baseline data on the representation of women scientists in the membership and governance structures of national science academies that are affiliated with IAP: the Global Network of Science Academies. Women academy members remained far below parity with men, given that women's membership was typically about 12%. Women members were better represented in the social sciences, humanities and arts but the corresponding shares rarely exceeded 20%. In the natural sciences and engineering, women's membership remained well below 10%. On average, the largest share of women members (17%) was associated with academies in Latin America and the Caribbean. The average share of women serving on governing bodies was 20%. To change this unsettling narrative, the importance of academies of science annually collecting, analysing and reporting gender-disaggregated data on membership and activities is highlighted as a key recommendation. Several aspects of women's representation and participation in national science academies are highlighted for further investigation.",Ngila D.; Boshoff N.; Henry F.; Diab R.; Malcom S.; Thomson J.,Journal,South African Journal of Science,2017-07-01,Academy of Science of South Africa;York University;American Association for the Advancement of Science;National Research Foundation;Stellenbosch University;University of Cape Town,Academy governance ;  Genderdisaggregated data ;  Membership ;  Representation ;  Women

Research on the innovation of agricultural products circulation based on food safety coordination mechanism,"Agricultural products food safety and circulation affect and restraint each other. The nature and structure of agricultural production determines the choice of depth, breadth and mode of circulation of agricultural products, and the benefit mechanism of exchange relationship in the circulation guides the production of agricultural products. Auction, direct sales, forward transactions, adversaries and other price formation mechanism determines the main body and responsibility for food safety management. There are different food safety risks in the circulation patterns of agricultural products including peasant school docking, farmer docking, e-commerce and which are dominated by wholesale market or supermarkets, take the logistics center as the main body, lead enterprises as the core. From the commodity attribute of the agricultural product, the risk access point and the circulation mode the food safety coordination mode is divided into the administrative coordination mode, the organization coordination mode and the social coordination mode.",Shang J.; Zhou J.; Li Y.,Journal,Boletin Tecnico/Technical Bulletin,2017-07-01,Harbin University of Commerce;Northeast Forestry University,Benefit mechanism ;  Circulation mode ;  Circulation of agricultural products ;  Food safety
NEST HiLo: Investigating lightweight construction and adaptive energy systems,"This paper presents research on lightweight construction and smart, integrated and adaptive building systems. The research is focused on addressing challenges related to the building industry at large, including most prominently the improvement of energy efficiency, onsite power generation, and the reduction of the quantity of materials required to build. We introduce four innovations in context of the design of an experimental building (NEST HiLo): a lightweight, unreinforced funicular floor system; a flexibly formed, concrete shell sandwich roof; a soft actuated, adaptive solar facade and an automated, occupant-centred control system. We demonstrate novel structural engineering approaches to compression-only concrete elements and shell design using multi-criteria shape optimisation. We explore a building facade concept, which employs robotic actuators for solar shading and on-site generation. In addition, the operational phase of the building will be used as a living laboratory where occupants’ locations and needs for comfort are detected and used for the control of the energy innovations. The research provides insight into design topics that will become increasingly relevant for the evolution of improved lifecycle energy buildings.",Block P.; Schlueter A.; Veenendaal D.; Bakker J.; Begle M.; Hischier I.; Hofer J.; Jayathissa P.; Maxwell I.; Echenagucia T.; Nagy Z.; Pigram D.; Svetozarevic B.; Torsing R.; Verbeek J.; Willmann A.; Lydon G.,Journal,Journal of Building Engineering,2017-07-01,Cockrell School of Engineering;ETH Zürich;ZJA Zwarts and Jansma Architects,Adaptive solar facade ;  Building energy systems ;  Lightweight construction ;  Occupant-centred control ;  Shell structures ;  Structural design
Application of industry 4.0 technologies to the design and manufacturing of handicraft products,"Considering as a starting point the principles that characterize the artisanal and industrial production systems, this article explore the mechanisms to promote interdisciplinary relationship between industrial designers, industrial manufacturers and artisans; the main objective is to enhance the knowledge for the development and consolidation of the craft activity. We propose a methodology which industrial facilitators 4.0 are incorporated into the craft technics using methods of engineering design, technological solutions of production and innovations respecting the identity values of craftsmanship. The best available techniques in the industry and emerging trends as Industry 4.0 or Factories of the future were analyzed; this analysis shows that some fundamentals, concepts and strategic plans can be applied to craft processes. These factors support a viable proximity between the three centers of industrial production, technological innovation and craftsmanship. The proposal, seeking to have an open, holistic approach, was developed through analysis and intervention phases, through enabling technologies 4.0. This methodology is structured in five phases, which sequenced the processes of analysis and intervention. This model allows the definition of a strategic plan for restructuring of the activity, providing the artisan upgrade skills to new media and industrial technologies, allowing the need to adapt theirs work to current market demands.

From ad hoc to strategic ecosystem management: the “Three-Layer Ecosystem Strategy Model” (TeLESM),"Recently, business ecosystems have been recognized as one of the most interesting phenomenon in software engineering research. Companies experience a paradigm shift where product development and innovation is moving outside the boundaries of the firm and where networks of stakeholders join forces to co-create value. While there is prominent research focusing on the managerial perspective of business ecosystems, few studies provide strategic guidance for how to intentionally manage the different ecosystems that companies operate in. Therefore, and on the basis of multicase study research, we provide empirical evidence on the challenges that software-intensive companies experience in relation to the different types of business ecosystems they operate in. We conduct a “state-of-the-art” literature review to identify strategies that are used to manage ecosystem engagements, and we develop a conceptual model in which we identify strategies for managing the innovation ecosystem, the differentiating ecosystem, and the commoditizing ecosystem. By categorising the different strategies in relation to the different types of ecosystems for which they are valid, the “three-layer ecosystem strategy model” provides comprehensive support for strategy selection. We validate the use of the identified strategies in 6 software-intensive case companies, and we provide empirical insights on the “relevance” and the “desired use” of these strategies as experienced by the case companies.",Holmström Olsson H.; Bosch J.,Journal,Journal of Software: Evolution and Process,2017-07-01,Malmö Universitet;Chalmers University of Technology,business ecosystems ;  commoditizing ecosystem ;  differentiating ecosystem ;  ecosystem challenges ;  ecosystem strategies ;  innovation ecosystem
"Kinematic and polarimetric radar observations of the 10 May 2010, Moore-Choctaw, Oklahoma, Tornadic debris signature","Tornadoes are capable of lofting large pieces of debris that present irregular shapes, near-random orientations, and a wide range of dielectric constants to polarimetric radars. The unique polarimetric signature associated with lofted debris is called the tornadic debris signature (TDS). While ties between TDS characteristics and tornado- and storm-scale kinematic processes have been speculated upon or investigated using photogrammetry and single-Doppler analyses, little work has been done to document the three-dimensional wind field associated with the TDS. Data collected by the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (KTLX), and Norman, Oklahoma (KOUN), WSR-88D S-band radars as well as the University of Oklahoma's (OU) Advanced Radar Research Center's Polarimetric Radar for Innovations in Meteorology and Engineering (OU-PRIME) C-band radar are used to construct single- and dual-Doppler analyses of a tornadic supercell that produced an EF4 tornado near the towns of Moore and Choctaw, Oklahoma, on 10 May 2010. This study documents the spatial distribution of polarimetric radar variables and how each variable relates to kinematic fields such as vertical velocity and vertical vorticity. Special consideration is given to polarimetric signatures associated with subvortices within the tornado. An observation of negative differential reflectivity () at the periphery of tornado subvortices is presented and discussed. Finally, dual-Doppler wind retrievals are compared to single-Doppler axisymmetric wind fields to illustrate the merits of each method.",Griffin C.; Bodine D.; Palmer R.,Journal,Monthly Weather Review,2017-07-01,Gallogly College of Engineering;National Center for Atmospheric Research,Radars/Radar observations ;  Supercells ;  Tornadoes
Landscape of Innovation for Cardiovascular Pharmaceuticals: From Basic Science to New Molecular Entities,"Purpose This study examines the complete timelines of translational science for new cardiovascular therapeutics from the initiation of basic research leading to identification of new drug targets through clinical development and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of new molecular entities (NMEs) based on this research. Methods This work extends previous studies by examining the association between the growth of research on drug targets and approval of NMEs associated with these targets. Drawing on research on innovation in other technology sectors, where technological maturity is an important determinant in the success or failure of new product development, an analytical model was used to characterize the growth of research related to the known targets for all 168 approved cardiovascular therapeutics. Findings Categorizing and mapping the technological maturity of cardiovascular therapeutics reveal that (1) there has been a distinct transition from phenotypic to targeted methods for drug discovery, (2) the durations of clinical and regulatory processes were significantly influenced by changes in FDA practice, and (3) the longest phase of the translational process was the time required for technology to advance from initiation of research to a statistically defined established point of technology maturation (mean, 30.8 years). Implications This work reveals a normative association between metrics of research maturation and approval of new cardiovascular therapeutics and suggests strategies for advancing translational science by accelerating basic and applied research and improving the synchrony between the maturation of this research and drug development initiatives.",Beierlein J.; McNamee L.; Walsh M.; Kaitin K.; DiMasi J.; Ledley F.,Journal,Clinical Therapeutics,2017-07-01,Bentley University;Tufts University School of Medicine,cardiovascular disease ;  cardiovascular therapeutics ;  drug development ;  drug discovery ;  innovation ;  quantitative modeling
"A new approach to teaching biomechanics through active, adaptive, and experiential learning","Demand of biomedical engineers continues to rise to meet the needs of healthcare industry. Current training of bioengineers follows the traditional and dominant model of theory-focused curricula. However, the unmet needs of the healthcare industry warrant newer skill sets in these engineers. Translational training strategies such as solving real world problems through active, adaptive, and experiential learning hold promise. In this paper, we report our findings of adding a real-world 4-week problem-based learning unit into a biomechanics capstone course for engineering students. Surveys assessed student perceptions of the activity and learning experience. While students, across three cohorts, felt challenged to solve a real-world problem identified during the simulation lab visit, they felt more confident in utilizing knowledge learned in the biomechanics course and self-directed research. Instructor evaluations indicated that the active and experiential learning approach fostered their technical knowledge and life-long learning skills while exposing them to the components of adaptive learning and innovation.",Singh A.,Journal,Journal of Biomechanical Engineering,2017-07-01,Widener University,
Direct and cross scheme effects in a research and development,"Research and product or process development are two distinct, yet complementary innovation activities. Making use of a specific grant-based policy design that explicitly distinguishes between research projects, development projects, and mixed R&D projects, this study estimates the direct and cross scheme effects on both research and development investments of recipient firms. Positive cross scheme effects can be expected when research and development activities are complementary and financing constraints are more binding for research than for development projects. The results show that while research grants yield positive direct effects on net research spending as well as positive cross effects on development, development grants are less effective for stimulating development expenditures. The positive effect of development grants on overall R&D stems from cross effects of development grants on research expenditures. These results suggest a higher priority for subsidies targeting research projects.",Hottenrott H.; Lopes-Bento C.; Veugelers R.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-07-01,"TUM School of Management, Munich;Bruegel, Belgium;Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung GmbH;Maastricht University School of Business and Economics;KU Leuven;Centre for Economic Policy Research, London",Complementarity ;  Development subsidies ;  Innovation policy ;  R&D ;  Research subsidies
Large-scale experimentation using the 12-fan wall of wind to assess and mitigate hurricane wind and rain impacts on buildings and infrastructure systems,"Engineering research is undergoing dramatic changes with novel, large-scale research facilities being developed to help reduce the growing economic losses associated with natural disasters. The wall of wind (WOW), at Florida International University (FIU), is such an experimental facility, capable of simulating hurricane winds and wind-driven rain to better understand hurricane effects on buildings and other infrastructure. The WOW has been designated by the national science foundation (NSF) as one of the experimental facilities (EFs) under the natural hazards engineering research infrastructure (NHERI) program, which aims to allow researchers to enable innovations and help prevent natural hazards from becoming societal disasters. The WOW EF's goal is to facilitate research to improve design practices for structural systems, building envelopes, and lifeline infrastructure. This paper presents an overview of the design and development of the WOW research facility and delineates its capabilities to assess and mitigate the impacts of hurricane wind, rain, and debris on civil infrastructure. Advantages and limitations of the facility are explained.

Rethinking Resilience in Industrial Symbiosis: Conceptualization and Measurements,"Resilience has become the new imperative of industrial symbiosis research, since its recognition as a fundamental factor in the development of sustainable Industrial Symbiosis Networks (ISNs). We offer a contribution to this topic by providing a wider conceptualization of resilience and an innovative method of measuring it, borrowing from studies in other disciplines such as ecology, complexity science, and engineering. We focus on two important antecedents of ISN resilience, i.e., diversity at system and firm level and the ubiquity of wastes, on the basis of which we design a new method of measuring ISN resilience. This captures the extent to which the removal of a firm is critical for the ISN's survival. We test our resilience index on two real ISNs and compare it against other network-based measurement methods commonly adopted in the literature. Finally, we discuss the advantages of the new measurement procedure.",Fraccascia L.; Giannoccaro I.; Albino V.,Journal,Ecological Economics,2017-07-01,Politecnico di Bari,Diversity ;  Ecological systems ;  Industrial Symbiosis Network ;  Measurements ;  Resilience ;  Ubiquity
Induced technological change and the timing of public R&D investment in the Japanese electricity sector considering a two-factor learning curve,"The UNFCCC has stated that energy policies and measures to address climate change should be cost-effective to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost. To mitigate the bulk of carbon emission from the electricity sector, a large market penetration of renewable energy technologies with as low cost as possible is a key research topic. The energy-related R&D policy in Japan aims to achieve a green economy. In our study, based on this context, we demonstrated how to optimize the timing of public R&D investment within the framework of a bottom-up partial equilibrium model. The developed optimization model represents the Japanese electricity sector and minimizes the total system cost subject to an accumulated carbon emission constraint. Our main research focus is the role of R&D activity, especially in the innovation stage of renewable technologies. We employ a two-factor learning curve and quantify the impact of the learning effect on the dynamic diffusion of major renewable technologies. The study shows a dynamic technology transition in the Japanese electricity sector and the optimized R&D investment schedule for each renewable technology. With the first-best energy policy, an R&D budget of more than 2000 million USD would be allocated to PV in 2050, which corresponds to 45% of the energy-related Japanese R&D budget in 2050. Because some have criticized the uncertainty problems with dynamic simulations and learning models, supplemental sensitivity analyses are included.",Usui T.; Furubayashi T.; Nakata T.,Journal,Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,2017-07-01,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Tohoku University,Endogenous technological development ;  Induced technological change ;  Learning ;  R&D policy ;  Renewable energy technology ;  Timing of investment
The Monge theorem and its application in engineering practice,"Engineering innovation activities cannot be performed without mathematical devices. The present paper describes the theoretical analysis of the reconstruction of the Monge theorem. The significance of the analysis is that we consider those Monge projections the same, which can be translated to one another by parallel shifting. Accordingly, in a fixed Descartes coordinate system in the space, every Monge projection is determined by its two projection lines that go through the origin point, which is described by three free parameters. The three free parameters determining the Monge projections make up the points of the Monge cuboid. We are looking for Monge projections to a fixed third-grade spatial curve, in which the reconstruction of the curve can be carried out only with two pictures without any further information. The inner points of the Monge cuboid—defined by the bijective Monge projections—are bordered by a surface. This surface is described in this article during our research work first. We have proved the engineering application of this theorem by calculating the correct camera position for the wearing examination of the hob’s cutting edge.",Balajti Z.; Dudás I.,Journal,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2017-07-01,Miskolci Egyetem;Institute of Manufacturing Science,Hob ;  Monge ;  Projection ;  Worm gear
Learning with mobile technologies – Students’ behavior,"The increasing growth of mobile technology in our Society has become a reality. This paper was designed to research about the different factors and drivers that could influence students’ behaviour into the usage of mobile technologies for learning. The methodology was based on a quantitative survey grounded on the Technology Acceptance Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Data were collected from medical students in University of Coimbra. This model pointed to a behaviour pattern based on the experience and application by medical students, correlating with a strong attitude towards using mobile technology for learning (57%) and willingness to recommend it (40.5%). In line with previous studies, Social Influence raised to be an important factor towards the Attitude and Behavioural Intention of using Mobile Learning. In addition, according to the results, the student's ease of perception seems to be the main factor affecting the Social Influence (31.9%) and the reliability for recommending this technology for learning was the main factor that affected the Behavioural Intention. Findings provide support for Technology Acceptance Model and the implications of these findings are discussed within the context of Innovation in Education.",Briz-Ponce L.; Pereira A.; Carvalho L.; Juanes-Méndez J.; García-Peñalvo F.,Journal,Computers in Human Behavior,2017-07-01,Universidad de Salamanca;Universidade de Aveiro;Universidade de Coimbra,Innovation ;  Medical education ;  Mhealth ;  Mobile application ;  Mobile learning ;  TAM

Whereas existing research widely regards storytelling as creating a common understanding between developers and users, we argue that storytelling and prototyping are intertwined practices for innovators to persuade decision makers. Based on a two-year qualitative case study in two innovating software firms, we identify and dialectically examine practices of storytelling and prototyping. Our study implies that storytelling and prototyping should be integrated together into software engineering methods.",Ciriello R.; Richter A.; Schwabe G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice Track, ICSE-SEIP 2017",2017-06-30,IT-Universitetet i København;Universität Zürich,Case Study ;  Innovation ;  Malpractices ;  Practices ;  Prototyping ;  Software Engineering ;  Storytelling
"What is the perception of female and male software professionals on performance, team dynamics and job satisfaction? Insights from the trenches","Research has shown that gender diversity correlates positively with innovation and productivity in many professional engineering and technology domains. Yet, software development teams are dominated by males. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether female software professionals, compared to male, have different perceptions on a) team performance and dynamics, b) their own personal performance, c) their immediate supervisors, and d) accomplishment, recognition, and opportunities. Understanding perceptions of different genders can help software professionals, their supervisors and those responsible for staff create and foster environments in which both females and males are comfortable and perform best. To achieve this aim, we conducted a survey targeted at individual software professionals in technical roles. We collected and analyzed data from 55 female and 69 male respondents. Our results show basic differences in demographics (e.g., males tend to be older, have more senior roles, and have longer tenure with their employer). While we did find some differences around perceptions of spirit of team work, productivity, sense of satisfaction and fairness of reviews from supervisors, in general, females and males do not seem to differ significantly in their perceptions. Based on the results from our survey and insights from the current literature, we discuss commonalities and differences between females and males, and explore potential implications for performance reviews, recognition, and career progression.",James T.; Galster M.; Blincoe K.; Miller G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice Track, ICSE-SEIP 2017",2017-06-30,University of Canterbury;The University of Auckland;Orion Health,descriptive survey ;  diversity ;  female and male software professionals ;  perceptions ;  software development teams
"A Proposal of Practices, Processes and Models That Enable Innovation Potential","Innovation is neither predictable nor guaranteed within a solution development project. Novel ideas can appear during any level of work, whether high-level design or in code algorithms. As design innovation is a creative action, this paper proposes a vision of related practices, processes and modeling ideas that enable innovation to potentially happen. The practices are mostly mental techniques for a designer to use which help to maintain an open mind to solution possibilities. The process approaches are based on and support progress within a flexible, incremental and iterative methodology that can respond to new ideas. The modeling technique ideas strive to support the clear communication of understanding and the evolution of the design through multiple alternatives. The proposals suggested are rooted in some successes from actual industry projects over the years, but can benefit from further research and empirical evaluation.",Matheson D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2017 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Design and Innovation in Software Engineering, DISE 2017",2017-06-30,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Development process ;  Innovation ;  Modeling ;  Software engineering

"Biomimetic molecular design tools that learn, evolve, and adapt","A dominant hallmark of living systems is their ability to adapt to changes in the environment by learning and evolving. Nature does this so superbly that intensive research efforts are now attempting to mimic biological processes. Initially this biomimicry involved developing synthetic methods to generate complex bioactive natural products. Recent work is attempting to understand how molecular machines operate so their principles can be copied, and learning how to employ biomimetic evolution and learning methods to solve complex problems in science, medicine and engineering. Automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms are now converging to generate what might broadly be called in silico-based adaptive evolution of materials. These methods are being applied to organic chemistry to systematize reactions, create synthesis robots to carry out unit operations, and to devise closed loop flow self-optimizing chemical synthesis systems. Most scientific innovations and technologies pass through the well-known “S curve”, with slow beginning, an almost exponential growth in capability, and a stable applications period. Adaptive, evolving, machine learning-based molecular design and optimization methods are approaching the period of very rapid growth and their impact is already being described as potentially disruptive. This paper describes new developments in biomimetic adaptive, evolving, learning computational molecular design methods and their potential impacts in chemistry, engineering, and medicine.",Winkler D.,Journal,Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry,2017-06-29,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation;Monash University;La Trobe University,Automated chemical synthesis ;  Deep learning ;  Development ;  Evolutionary algorithms ;  In silico evolution ;  Machine learning ;  Materials design ;  Neural networks

Academic-industry collaborations: Effective measures for successful engagement,"Academic-Industry collaborations have always been important to universities for generating high-value socio-economic impact. The need for developing strong, long lasting relationships with industry has been intensified during the last years, as universities seek alternative means for funding than traditional research projects. This led universities to seek both, conventional and unconventional forms of engagement at a much higher rate than ever before, leading to the transformation of modern universities into multichannel knowledge transfer hubs. At the same time, this enabled companies to remain competitive in the global economy and stimulated economic growth and development in their regions. Despite the obvious benefits, fostering this change does not come without challenges. It requires each side to recognize the benefits, cultivate the appropriate innovation and enterprise-driven culture and in parallel, overcome the barriers of traditional processes and communications. This panel will discuss different forms of effective measures for successful academic-industry engagement. Its main topics are: • Cultivating an innovation and enterprise-driven culture within universities: What measures are effective? • Industry informed curricula design and outcomes assessment: What are the challenges? • Undergraduate/postgraduate internships and placements: How can they be integrated?",Polycarpou I.; Andreou P.; Laxer C.; Kurkovsky S.,Conference Proceeding,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2017-06-28,University of Cyprus;Central Connecticut State University;Rose Hulman Institute Technology;InSPIRE Research Center University,Academic-industry collaborations ;  Industry engagement ;  Industry informed curriculum ;  Student internships

STEAM-based interventions in computer science: Understanding feedback loops in the classroom,"Many organizations are seeking to address the need for greater numbers of computer scientists in the US, and in particular, more women and underrepresented minorities. It is not uncommon to develop curriculum that relies heavily on cutting edge technology and computing tools designed to make computing more compelling. Many curriculum developers are seeking to promote creativity as a part of computing, and often do so using STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics)-based interventions where the arts play a prominent role in the classroom. EarSketch, a web-based computer science instructional tool, is an example of a STEAM-based instructional innovation, where students learn programming skills while engaging in authentic music mixing practices. EarSketch allows students to remix musical samples into original musical compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application, while simultaneously picking up programming skills. However, there can be hidden challenges to student learning that may go unnoticed without careful observation. In our efforts to understand the classroom and school level factors that affect successful implementation of EarSketch in computer science classrooms, models were created to explain certain observed behaviors in the classroom. Using Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD's), a tool from systems engineering and operations research, we have identified reinforcing feedback loops that can result in 'virtuous' or 'vicious' cycles of student learning with respect to programming. In both cases, the students appear engaged with the activity, but in some cases, fixation on the arts piece, in this case the music, supersedes the students' active learning of programming and computational thinking practices (the intended learning outcomes in a computer science course.) In this paper, we present the causal loop diagrams developed to explain the relationships between the actors and attributes involved in implementing EarSketch in a particular school setting. The diagram allows us to better make decisions that ensure both an engaging but also effective STEAM-based computing curriculum. In addition, possible broader ramifications of the results will be explored. The authors expect that virtuous and vicious cycles may be common in other STEAM and technology-based curricular interventions designed to be highly engaging for students. The authors also see potential parallels to engineering curriculum-is time spent 'tinkering' leading to student learning of engineering processes? The hope is that awareness of the possible challenges, as evidenced by the feedback loops, will help other interventions implement successfully.",Moore R.; Helms M.; Freeman J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Georgia Institute of Technology,
Experiences of pre-college teachers working with undergraduate engineering students with ADHD in research laboratories,"Students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are significantly underrepresented in engineering programs despite their high potential to impact the field through their strong divergent thinking and unparalleled risk-taking abilities. The current engineering education system has yet to realize the unique potential of these students and largely fails to attract and retain them due to the overemphasis on lecture-based learning and its discouraging evaluation methods. The abilities of these students are often overlooked in pre-college environments as well, where educators typically approach ADHD from a deficit perspective, which has engraining impacts on the student's confidence and self-image. To recognize the unique intellectual strengths of engineering students with ADHD and encourage them to continue in engineering careers, a specialized National Science Foundation funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site for students with ADHD was established. To extend the impact and findings of the REU program to pre-college students, two teachers, one fourth and one ninth grade, joined engineering research labs at the University of Connecticut as NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Fellows, and spent six weeks working with undergraduate student researchers with ADHD. These grade levels were chosen to involve teachers from both elementary and secondary education. In addition to taking part in the research activities, the teachers attended multiple roundtable discussions where the REU students shared their experiences in both their personal lives and their engineering programs. This provided a unique opportunity for the teachers to observe firsthand the performance of students with ADHD outside of a traditional classroom setting when they are involved in interestprovoking tasks that actively demand creative thinking, i.e. research. This paper presents the major observations and experiences of the two RET fellows after completion of the program. The program significantly improved the teachers' perceptions of students with ADHD and the shortcomings of the current education system that puts this population of students with significant potential for innovation at a substantial risk of academic failure and disinterest in pursuing higher education. Overall, the major observations from this REU were that: given the right environment, i.e. niche, students with ADHD can thrive; engineering research can be a stimulating and ideal environment for students with ADHD; and the opportunity to learn and interact with peers with ADHD can provide a rich and meaningful experience and help their confidence and ability as learners. It was noted that the education system needs to move from the idea of 'accommodating' for some, to differentiating for all. Dissemination of these impactful findings will continue through the teacher's discussions with colleagues, administrators, and by publishing papers. Employing a different approach to planning meaningful lessons and activities that support all learners' contributions, necessarily implies utilization of more diverse evaluation methods, as well as teaching strategies. The uniquely attractive components of engineering, i.e., real world applications, the design process, and creative problem-solving, can capture the curiosity and imagination of these students who can solve the most complex and challenging problems facing our nation. c American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",Hain C.; Turek W.; Zaghi A.; Hain A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,University of Connecticut;Mansfield Public Schools,
Catalyzing a research agenda for enhancing engineering education through institutional collaborations,"To augment the extensive engineering education research that has been done over the past decades, greater opportunities are needed for institutional leaders and education practitioners to directly share the pedagogical practices that have worked best (and perhaps not so well) at their institutions as well as to explicitly consider bi-directional scalability and adaptability between institutions. The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded workshop described here brought together a small group of thought leaders from various institutions to share their ideas and experiences and to develop a research agenda for creating productive collaborations among a wide range of institutions of different types, characteristics, and missions. The workshop sought to develop a framework for how diverse institutions can effectively impact engineering education in addressing questions such as: How to scale, adapt, and transfer best practices? What are the roles of differing types of institutions in engineering education research and innovation? How can engineering education research at all institutions be enhanced? Preliminary results presented in this paper include quantitative measures of the characteristics of the participating institutions, the results of a pre-workshop survey completed by each institution about educational constraints and opportunities, and highlights of the workshop itself. The workshop brought to light the significant changes that have already occurred in engineering education in recent years, the need to focus on cultural change rather than content change, and the recognition that institutions of higher learning, the NSF, and engineering professional societies have not yet succeeded in creating the right culture, climate, and educational infrastructure for fully implementing change in engineering education based on the most effective approaches to engaging students. Based on the outcomes of the workshop, engineering education must clearly change in ways that allow it to focus on defining problems differently and to facilitate a shift in both the mindsets of faculty and the mindsets they cultivate in students.",Buffinton K.; Manno V.; Helble J.; Lord S.; McKenna A.; Ohland M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,College of Engineering;Franklin W.

Ecosystems of entrepreneurship in Canadian engineering faculties: A systematic map,"The economic turbulence of the 21st century is changing the engineering career landscape. Large firms face great challenge in boosting the economy and creating more jobs amidst uncertain economical forecast. Engineers today need innovation, leadership and business skills more than ever. Engineering schools are aware of the rising demand of engineers to learn about entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship programs for engineers are becoming a trending topic. This paper explores the different ecosystems of entrepreneurship offered at faculties of engineering across Canada. We explore two research questions in this paper: a) What is the growth, in demand and availability, of entrepreneurship courses in engineering schools, and b) What are the different components of an entrepreneurship ecosystem in engineering faculties today. The intent of this research is not to compare which program is better; rather, it is to explores the different ways of how entrepreneurship is taught in engineering schools. By providing a systematic map of the current entrepreneurial landscape in engineering faculties, this research can benefit professors and program directors who are building entrepreneurship courses and programs for engineering students, and to researchers who are studying the impact of academic entrepreneurship on engineering education.",Jarrar M.; Anis H.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,University of Ottawa,Academic entrepreneurship ;  Engineering education ;  Entrepreneurial ecosystem

Algae for STEM Education,"In 2008, a list of engineering challenges put forth by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) identified the need for technological innovations for global progress. These challenges focused on education, energy, infrastructure, clean water, climate change, and much more. In an effort to help foster a generation of engineers that are more aware of their role in making the world a better place, a partnership was formed with the Adventure Aquarium Center for Aquatic Sciences (CAS). Funded by the National Science Foundation, the goal of this partnership was to form a multidisciplinary engineering team focused on adapting current experiments to more environmentally conscious alternatives. These experiments have begun to be implemented in freshman engineering courses, the STEM Academy at Glassboro High School, and K-12 outreach programs. Ultimately, the purpose of these experiments is to reduce environmental impact by replacing current environmental processes with algae based alternatives. By partnering with the CAS, the University gained access to its algae production facility, a powerful tool in researching the many uses of algae. Algae-based experiments and hands-on activities in the fields of water resources engineering, environmental engineering, cosmetics, and nutrition have been developed. By focusing on these fields, the positive impact that algae can have on issues faced by developing nations around the world was highlighted. Gas transfer and coagulation flocculation experiments have been used to research the sustainability of algae use in the water treatment process, with a focus on the feasibility of replacing current processes with algae based alternatives. Calorimeter tests have been conducted to research the potential nutritional benefit of algae based products. Exposure to social and environmental injustices along with ethics case studies are also an integral part of the project. Ultimately, the purpose of this project is to teach a generation of future engineers the impact that algae can have on solving humanitarian issues around the world.",Jahan K.; Farrell S.; Tang Y.; Bodnar C.; Slater C.; Savelski M.; Bhavsar P.; Wenger A.; Hurley P.; Breen R.; Miller D.; Ieva K.; Mittenzwei M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Rowan University;The Center for Aquatic Sciences Inc,
The impact of community college students' propensity for innovation on persistence in STEM majors,"There is a critical need for more students with engineering and science majors to enter into, persist, and graduate from postsecondary institutions. Increasing the diversity in engineering and science is also a profound identified need. According to national statistics, the largest groups of underrepresented minority students in engineering and science attend United States public higher education institutions and in particular the community colleges. Recent research has indicated that students from these populations who are strong problem solvers, and who understand how to seek assistance and navigate college campuses, are most likely persist to degree completion. Accordingly, this research examined a sample of non-traditional college students enrolled in science and engineering programs in four urban community colleges to determine (a) the types and frequency of support practices they utilized, (b) how such practices influenced their achievement, persistence and transfer status to four-year colleges and universities, and (c) how in turn their propensity for innovation and creative problem solving affected such choices and persistence. The study analyzed the impact of pedagogical support practices-practices designed to foster successful transfer from community college to four-year colleges and universities, and how students' innovative capability affected such transfer capacity. The goals were: (a) to understand whether particular pedagogical support practices were effective in offering nontraditional students a program that enabled them to remain in engineering and science majors and to transfer to a four-year college or university, and (b) to determine if students' propensity for innovative problem solving influenced use of pedagogical practices and ultimately, transfer persistence. The research targeted four research questions: (1) What are the patterns of pedagogical practices that community colleges employ to enhance students' transfer success in engineering and science? (2) How do students' creative and innovative problem solving approaches influence the choices that they make in using pedagogical support practices? (3) What are the impacts of pedagogical practices and differences among pedagogical practices, on persistence toward students' transfer to colleges and universities? (4) How do students' creative and innovative problem solving approaches influence their persistence toward transfer to engineering and science programs at four-year universities? This research involves a two-stage study in which in stage one, the types of pedagogical support practices used in community colleges were analyzed and taxonomized. Results of this part of research led to the delineation and refining of three categories of pedagogical support: (1) College attending support, (2) Program planning and execution support, and (3) Classroom and program performance support. These categories led to development and refinement of a college level pedagogical practice taxonomy and inventory which was used in stage two of the research in which data was collected on 2476 community college students in STEM majors. The intent of stage two of the research is to determine the role of students' creativity and propensity of innovation had on their persistence and the impact that use of particular pedagogical practices had on their persistence, creativity and propensity for innovation in STEM. Two structural equation models (SEMs) have been developed for data analyses with one containing grade point average (as a proxy for achievement) as the outcome of interest and the second with engineering creativity and propensity for innovation as the outcome of interest. These two models indicate that use of pedagogical practices impact students' creativity and propensity for innovation and propensity for innovation impacts students' achievement (with GPA as a proxy.) Notably, background characteristics also have impacts on the two outcomes of interest. This research informs community college faculty and student affairs personnel on which support practices best support students in STEM majors to transfer to colleges and universities and how students' creativity and propensity for innovation affects such transfer persistence.",Ragusa G.; Slaughter J.; Juarez C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,University of Southern California,
"Exploring connections between engineering projects, student characteristics, and the ways engineering students experience innovation","Innovation is a key competency in engineering. Researchers and educators have long explored the processes, attributes, and environments of innovators with an aim to support engineering students in developing the competencies necessary to innovate. Yet, innovation is a complex phenomenon with many potential paths. In a recent phenomenographic study of engineering students, we found eight distinct ways of experiencing innovation. While these different ways of experiencing innovation were not necessarily better or worse, they could be compared in terms of their comprehensiveness, especially with respect to the innovation process and the issues (e.g., technical, user, or business) that drove innovation. In this study, we performed a two-phase qualitative analysis to understand how individual characteristics of the engineering students and contextual characteristics of the engineering projects in which they encountered innovation intersected to influence them to experience innovation in one of the eight categories described in the earlier study. In the first phase, we used content analysis to catalog distinct individual and project characteristics and explore similarities among participants in each of the eight categories. In the second phase, we used thematic analysis to describe, at a more general level, how individual participants came to experience innovation in more comprehensive ways. Content analysis showed that individuals may be drawn to specific categories due to nuanced connections between individual and project characteristics, while thematic analysis demonstrated three general pathways to more comprehensive categories, including (1) comprehensiveness of the innovation project experience, (2) connections between project goals and an individuals' interests and values, and (3) acute or persistent tensions between current perspectives and innovation experiences. We discuss these results in depth and describe implications for teaching and learning engineering innovation.",Fila N.; Purzer S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Purdue University,
Engineering faculty perceptions of diversity in the classroom,"Broadening participation and enhancing diversity remains a challenge in STEM disciplines. Many universities have strategic diversity plans; however, very few include an assessment of program success or utilize faculty as a primary vehicle to achieve the desired outcomes. Previous work suggests faculty play a key role in promoting diversity in higher education and creating an inclusive environment in the classroom. Few studies have explored faculty perceptions of their role in promoting diversity and a single study identified factors that contribute to faculty applying strategies to promote diversity concepts within the course content. Additionally, previous research has highlighted the need for departmental and institutional support for faculty interested in adopting teaching practices that promote diversity and inclusion. Therefore, it is important that we understand the motivations and supports needed for STEM faculty to include diversity concepts in the classroom to promote inclusivity. The guiding research questions for the current study are: 1) What perceptions do faculty hold about diversity and inclusion? 2) How do faculty's personal experience with diversity and inclusion impact how they integrate diversity and inclusion in their classroom? 3) How can we effectively use professional development to aid faculty in creating more inclusive environment for diverse learners? The data reported here is from the pilot for a larger case study design informed by institutional change models and faculty motivation. Taking lessons from recent engineering education research that describes strategies that encourage faculty to adopt instructional innovations, we paralleled our research to capture faculty practices for implementing diversity concepts into engineering course content. The pilot included 10 engineering faculty participants representing all faculty ranks and both research and teaching tenure tracks. The participants completed a short survey with multiple open-ended questions, followed by individual interviews exploring responses and allowing further clarification. The faculty came from two large research intensive universities with strong engineering reputations (five from each university). The survey was administered through a commercially available data collection software program and the individual interviews were audio recorded. The results from this initial pilot study discuss how our faculty participants defined diversity and inclusion, the resources they view as important to promoting diversity and inclusion, how their personal experiences inform their views on diversity and inclusion in the classroom, and what they would look for in professional development around diversity and inclusion.",Cross K.; Cutler S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Pennsylvania State University;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,
"The non-curriculum challenges and opportunities of administering a U.S.-based M.S. degree in Kilimanjaro, Africa","In the world of pharmaceuticals, regulatory science is an emerging field that has goals of developing tools, drugs, devices, and practices to increase benefit and lower risk concerning safety, quality control, and effectiveness. The dangers of having a subpar or non-existent, regulatory science practice can be costly at best or lethal at worst.

The collaboration of the university's Biotechnology Innovation and Regulatory Science program with the Kilimanjaro School of Pharmacy is helping to provide good regulatory practices in Africa. Designing an applicable, theoretically sound and pragmatically implementable curriculum was the first step. This curriculum has been discussed in a previous paper on this topic. The risks of attending class through war torn territories, lack of information technology infrastructure, language, cultural implications, and the payment of tuition and fees are but a few, and perhaps most administratively challenging, of the challenges and opportunities yet to be documented and presented. This paper, therefore, focuses on the many non-curriculum challenges and opportunities of delivering a U.S.-based M.S. degree in Kilimanjaro, Africa. A program individuals' risked their lives to participate in.",Springer M.; Clase K.; Terruso L.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,College of Engineering,
Complete research paper: Implementation of an introductory module on biogeotechnics in a freshman engineering course,"This Complete Research paper describes a one-lesson instructional module introducing biogeotechnical engineering that has been developed by an interdisciplinary team of engineers and educators for use in freshman-level introduction to engineering courses. The primary aims in developing the module were to educate incoming engineering students regarding the field of biogeotechnics and motivate them to pursue it further. Expanding research and innovation in this emerging area requires providing students with an understanding of the principles of this new paradigm for developing sustainable solutions in geotechnical engineering applications. Field trials of the instructional module, which included pre- and post-assessments, were conducted in two sections of a freshman engineering course at a large southwestern university in the United States. Evaluation data were collected regarding student knowledge gains and attitudes. Both the overall gain in technical knowledge and positive attitudes toward the field of biogeotechnical engineering were reflected in participant responses. With the advent and development of this new field, this work represents a pioneering effort in the biogeotechnical engineering education space. Looking ahead, the study could contribute toward longitudinal research in understanding the best practices of interdisciplinary approaches to developing engineering instruction.",Larson J.; Dalal M.; Savenye W.; Zapata C.; Hamdan N.; Kavazanjian E.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Arizona State University;Center for Bio-Mediated and Bio-Inspired Geotechnics,
Curriculum innovations through advancement of MEMS/NEMS and wearable devices technologies,"State of the art technologies using both micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) and wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have impacted our daily lives in applications including wearable devices and sensor technology as applied to renewable energies and health sciences, among others. Several examples are device implants, optical devices, micro and nanomachining, embedded systems and integrated nano sensor systems. The recent Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Mechanical Engineering (ME) curricula lacked inclusion of these elements within their programs. Close scrutiny to the need of local industry from engineering graduates has emphasized the motivation to develop these materials into the engineering curricula. Within the ECE curriculum, a new senior course was developed to cover MEMS/NEMS devices as well as wearable and IoT devices with Bluetooth and wireless features. The MEMS/NEMS module of the new course integrates software CAD tools and hardware implementations. It is a project-based course where students learn software for the device process, then fabricate the device in the school laboratories. The wearable and IoT devices module introduces the students to Wearable and Internet of Things systems. It covers sensors and sensor fusion, embedded processors, tools for wearable and IoT applications, and design using Bluetooth and wireless IoT systems. The new course development objectives are hands-on practice, and preparation of senior students for industrial and research careers. In addition, an introductory MEMS topic section is added in the sophomore level electrical engineering course offered to mechanical engineering students. It introduces MEMS devices employed as energy conversion devices. Based on our recent feedback, the students have favorably accepted this MEMS addition to the course. This paper details the software and hardware development elements of the new course. It also presents the assessment data for students' satisfaction for both the electrical and computer engineering (ECE), and mechanical engineering (ME) students.",Shayesteh S.; Rizkalla M.; El-Sharkawy M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,
Geographically distributed teams in engineering design: Best practices and issues in cases of international teamsworking from different continents,"It is not rare to have engineering design teams in companies, working from different parts of the world on a shared project. This new addition to the working context has been triggered by advances in communication technologies and the knowledge economy. This begs the question, are today's engineering students prepared to enter the workforce in this new international teaming environment? Most of the research that reports on geographically distributed teams or virtual teams is performed under industrial contexts. Thus, research is limited with regards to collaborative or distributed teams in educational environments (Dym et al. 2015). This is what motivates our study. This paper investigates the challenges and benefits of partnering students located in different continents under a problem-based, innovation driven, engineering-design course. For this, we build on previous experiences of teaming up students from Chile and the United States, as well as students from Finland and Mexico. In this second endeavor, we grouped seven students from Finland and Chile to fulfill a semester long course. The students met physically during two specific periods of the semester and then worked remotely throughout the span of the project. Students followed the same curriculum and deliverables. Qualitative data analysis was performed on semi-structured interviews (taken at different points of the semester), blogs and other forms of self-reported data. The outcomes are presented as a case study. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, and aligned with the interest of accreditation institutions such as ABET, it provides insight on how to instill the ability to work within global teams to ensure that graduates will have the skills to enter the profession successfully. Secondly, we identify strategies to orchestrate the work of cross-cultural teams. These can be taken by any educator and can be translated to its own engineering teaching practice. Finally, we examine the potential pitfalls in cross-cultural teams. We assert that, as in the field of medicine, it is critical to discuss the issues and complications so that the intervention can contribute to the educational experience. Future work may involve the study of more cases with engagement of the community at ASEE.",Mendoza C.; Martinez D.; Forget M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Aalto University;Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,
The making of an innovative engineer: Academic and life experiences that shape engineering task and innovation self-efficacy,"This research paper presents the results of a study that uses multivariate models to explore the relationships between participation in learning experiences, innovation self-efficacy, and engineering task self-efficacy. Findings show that many engineering students participated in learning experiences that are typically associated with engineering education, such as taking a shop class or engineering class in high school (47%), taking a computer science (81%) or design/prototyping (72%) class as an undergraduate, working in an engineering environment as an intern (56%), or attending a career related event during college (75%). Somewhat surprisingly, given the rigors of an engineering curriculum, a significant number of students participated in an art, dance, music, theater, or creative writing class (55%), taken a class on leadership topics (47%), and/or participated in student clubs outside of engineering (44%) during college. There also were important differences in rates of participation by gender, underrepresented racial/ethnic minority status, and first generation college student status. Overall prediction of engineering task self-efficacy and innovation self-efficacy was relatively low, with a model fit of these learning experiences predicting engineering task self-efficacy at (adjusted r2 of).200 and.163 for innovation self-efficacy. Certain patterns emerged when the learning experiences were sorted by Bandura's Sources of Self-Efficacy. For engineering task self-efficacy, higher participation in engineering mastery and vicarious engineering experiences was associated with higher engineering task self-efficacy ratings. For the development of innovation self-efficacy, a broader range of experiences beyond engineering experiences was important. There was a strong foundation of engineering mastery experiences in the innovation self-efficacy model; however, broadening experiences beyond engineering, particularly in the area of leadership experiences, may be a factor in innovation self-efficacy. These results provide a foundation for future longitudinal work probing specific types of learning experiences that shape engineering students' innovation goals. They also set the stage for comparative models of students' goals around highly technical engineering work, which allows us to understand more deeply how ""innovation"" and ""engineering"" come together in the engineering student experience.",Schar M.; Gilmartin S.; Rieken B.; Brunhaver S.; Chen H.; Sheppard S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Stanford University;Arizona State University,Academic pathway ;  Engineering task self-efficacy ;  Innovation self-efficacy ;  Learning experiences ;  Self-efficacy
Application of a virtual environment for education on the construction process of the Colosseum of Rome,"The education of engineering in the classroom has relied on increasingly advanced technologies throughout the years, up to and including modern computer graphics and digital simulation. One of the most valuable innovations for both education and engineering has been the field of virtual environments, which are defined as simulations of data and methods created and presented in a wholly or partially digital space. A virtual environment is an ideal tool for students to observe engineering techniques and concepts with minimal expense and in relative safety. For this research, the project being demonstrated is not a modern construction project, but an ancient one, the Colosseum of Rome. For this particular simulation, the virtual environment was rendered using a graphics pipeline representing the components of the structure as individual pieces which could, in theory, be assembled into a complete structure in a specific order based on how the walls, support piers, concrete arches, and floors of each story were in the two decades during which the actual structure was built, starting from ca. 79 AD. From there, these digital assets were compiled in a virtual environment which was presented to a sample student test body via a virtual reality simulation employing a personal computer and the Oculus Rift headset. Each student would navigate through the erection process of the Colosseum, level by level, including infographics describing specific engineering aspects and methodologies used throughout the construction of the monument. The results of this simulation were graded based on both the historical accuracy of the simulation and the clarity of the presentation, although a more immersive simulation may be possible with improvements to the graphics processing unit (GPU) processing power, framerate, and display resolution. These surveys are a clear demonstration that virtual environments can be a powerful educational tool in terms of instructing students about both construction and computer simulation. It is hoped that virtual environments can be employed for many future simulations in construction engineering, history, and architecture.",Tan A.; Tan F.; Parke M.; Butalia T.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,The Ohio State University,
NSF CAREER: Towards a framework for engineering student innovation,"The ability to innovate is essential in the rapidly evolving technological landscape. Many efforts have been made in engineering education to support student innovation (e.g., innovation and entrepreneurship programs and targeted courses). Yet, research on how engineering students approach and experience innovation has been limited. In this CAREER project we conducted a series of empirical studies using interviews, think-aloud protocols, and surveys to examine engineering students' innovation skills, views of the innovation process, and experiences that supporedt their development of innovative competencies. Informed by these studies, as well as the broader body of literature, we developed a framework for engineering student innovation that can guide instructional practices to support student innovation. In this paper, we present this framework with supporting evidence from recent and ongoing studies.",Purzer S.; Fila N.; Bohlin A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Purdue University,
Course modules designed for creativity training in materials Engineering education,"One of the challenges for us is to excite creativity and innovation in the Engineering education by emerging the design courses. The objectives of designing courses for engineering is to teach students the aesthetics and critical thinking with creativity. In this study, we merged two design-based courses modules into the original course curriculum to promote the creativity of students in the field of material engineering. The course module (I) ""User-Centered Design-Problem Definition"" was offered based on the product and user oriented design aspects. The other course module ""Experiential Manufacturing and Material Aesthetics"" was proceeded through project-based learning activities. The two course modules were combined into relevant course, Project Laboratory (1) & (2), on the spring semester (2016) as an elective course to undergraduate students. Students should submit their research portfolios and final report of the program with a device or material system and they also needed to show their achievements by oral or poster presentation in a workshop. Summative assessments of student's performance as well as the effectiveness determined for taking the Project Laboratory (1) & (2) courses was evaluated at the end of the semester. In this study, students' creativity were assessed by means of a rubric adapted from the Consensual Assessment Technique (ITC). There were 87 students taking the Project Laboratory (1) & (2) courses in the third and fourth years, respectively. Among them 29 students attended the project under guidance with the two course modules and achieved a higher average score (>3.0/4.0) in every assessed criterion than other students. ""Motivation"" seems to be the key for students to bring their potential into play. Students became more confident to face and deal with the laboratory problems after training with the two design-based course modules. It is widely accepted for students' comment that introduction of the design-based courses make the course more lively and interesting. These course modules make them to think about the origin properties of materials and creativity in applications.",Hu Y.; Chen A.; Chen Y.; Yang C.; Yeh C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Tatung University,
The engineering education maker identity project: A look at the first year,"The LBJ Institute for STEM Education & Research at Texas State University launched a threeyear research study to examine how university Maker Spaces might affect student identity formation and self-efficacy, and how these experiences can be leveraged to serve as a potential pathway to engineering. The primary experimental work for this research aims to: 1) discover key concepts and principles that particularly enable a more diverse group of students to leverage creativity and innovation toward success in engineering careers; 2) discover specific learning models that involve both STEM university students and pre-service teachers in order to develop teamwork, self-efficacy, communication, and identity formation in the Maker environment; 3) pilot instruments to measure the impact of such programs on students' self-efficacy, communication, and identity formation and 4) understand to what extent students who use the maker space for a class project become regular users of the space. This paper reports on the progress and findings from the first year of implementation. Maker Space user log in data will be analyzed as will preliminary results of student surveys. Further, the paper will describe the integration of making-based projects into engineering design and educational technology courses.",Talley K.; Ortiz A.; Sriraman V.; Smith S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Texas State University,
Engineering a culture of engagement,"This paper presents the current status of a research project underway at Montana State University investigating student ""dis-engagement"" and how it relates to a student's ultimate motivation to enter the engineering workforce. This research aims to understand why engineering students show less and less concern over time for how engineering contributes to public welfare. Prior work has shown that when the engineering profession is viewed as one that holds only agentic value (i.e., advancement only for one's self), it is often unappealing to certain student groups, especially women and first generation college students. If interventions can be implemented that change the value system among engineers to create a culture that views engineering as having important prosocial, communal value, this cultural shift will have a transformative impact on the formation of engineers by attracting a more diverse population into the profession. This will in turn spur innovation and support an inclusive engineering workforce. This two-year project is currently in its first year through funding from the National Science Foundation's Research Initiation in Engineering Formation (RIEF) program. This paper will present the initial findings of a comprehensive survey deployed in a 100-level, electrical engineering course to measure student attitudes about, stereotypes of, and overall level of (dis)engagement in engineering. This paper will benefit engineering educators interested in improving student persistence, retention, and graduation rates through cultural interventions. The ultimate goal of this work is to contribute to the body of knowledge of how to produce graduates that choose to stay in the engineering workforce with a commitment to benefiting society through their work.",Lameres B.; Smith J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Montana State University,
Online based innovation - Online tools and teaching to support global collaboration and distributed development projects,"This paper is based on work done at IdeaSquare, an innovation experiment at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Challenge Based Innovation-course (CBI) is a 4-6 months long format developed by IdeaSquare and collaborating universities. During the course, graduate students visit CERN for 3-4 weeks, and rest of the project is distributed globally in the premises of the participating universities. This paper focuses on the second iteration of the course, which was done in collaboration with 7 universities, across 8 time zones and with 46 students from engineering, business and product design. The main research question of this paper is, what elements should be considered when scaling such a project from small and partly co-located ""Challenge Based Innovation"" to bigger and fully distributed ""Online Based Innovation"" while maintaining the strong connection with fundamental research at CERN to inspire new solutions for the targeted societal challenges. The research question is approached by analyzing the usage and results of an experimental online collaboration platform put together by the author, and the remote interactions of the participating 46 students during the course in 2014-2015. In addition, this paper introduces recommendations for setting up such a global collaboration project and to optimize the learning experience and collaboration aspects for the participating students.",Kurikka J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Aalto University,
"Getting ""there"": Understanding How innovation and entrepreneurship become part of engineering education","The investments made to change engineering education in the US are immense, as anyone who has perused NSF's annual reports quickly realizes. As Giersch notes (2014), significant change requires attention to at least two dimensions: equipping individual faculty with effective tools and approaches, and working on an institutional level to scale and sustain improvement. How to operationalize this conceptual understanding is still elusive, however - both individuals and organizations tend to resist change, and the prospect of doing both simultaneously is daunting. This paper presents the results of new research on a national network of universities engaged in an effort to embed innovation and entrepreneurship in undergraduate engineering education, in an attempt to ""look under the hood"" at the process of change. While innovation and entrepreneurship serves as the primary lens for this research, the lessons learned may be of value to engineering education transformation more generally, and perhaps also to transformation in other disciplines. Previous articles examining the work of this network have summarized the types of activities that have been initiated at the institutions; this paper will update that information and move beyond to examine the work of change itself, with particular focus on these dimensions: • Change as a team effort: How do team size and composition impact the effectiveness of transformation initiatives? How can teams organize their work to maximize their chances of success? • Leading change: How do leaders of teams working in these initiatives approach their work? Are there particular leadership attributes or attitudes that can accelerate change? • The context of change: What impact do institutional context factors, such as college or university leadership transitions, have on engineering education transformation efforts? In addition to presenting the results of research currently underway, the paper will suggest areas in which additional research is needed. The research presented here is not focused on the ways in which innovation or entrepreneurship are or should be taught - only with the question of how I&E offerings become embedded in the engineering education experience.",Nilsen E.; Morrison E.; Asencio R.; Hutcheson S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,College of Engineering;Purdue University,
Career certainty: Differences between career certain and uncertain engineering students,"To gain a deeper understanding of the career decisions of undergraduate engineering students, this research paper explores the differences between students who show a high degree of career certainty and those who are rather uncertain about what their professional future should look like. These analyses were based on a dataset from a nationwide survey of engineering undergraduates (n=5, 819) from 27 institutions in the United States. The survey was designed with an interest in understanding engineering students' career pathways. For the purpose of this study, students were designated as either ""career uncertain"" or ""career certain"" according to their survey answers. Those two groups were then compared against a variety of background characteristics, past experiences and personality variables. The results suggest that career uncertain and career certain students do not differ on background variables such as gender, age or family income. However, when it comes to students' past experiences, the percentage of students who had already gained internship experiences during their time in college was significantly higher among career certain students as compared to career uncertain students. As expected, seniors were more certain about their professional future than juniors. Similarly, a higher percentage of career certain students reported talking about their professional future with other students or faculty members more frequently. Furthermore, career certain students were significantly more likely to show a higher level of innovation self-efficacy and engineering task self-efficacy. In addition, career certain students were more likely to have career goals that involved innovation and they also considered several job characteristics as more important than did uncertain students. On average, career certain engineering students were also more certain about staying in engineering one, five and ten years after graduation. Overall, the results of this research suggest that more hands-on experiences and fostering stronger beliefs in their engineering skills can contribute to undergraduates becoming more certain about their future professional careers.",Schadl B.; Sheppard S.; Chen H.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Stanford University,
Unpacking latent diversity,"This theory paper explores how diversity apart from social identities like race and gender is framed in the engineering education literature and how these concepts promote a different but compatible approach to understanding diversity-latent diversity. Latent diversity is a new approach to diversity work that captures underlying affective and cognitive differences that provide potential sources for innovation but are not visible. This approach does not examine other non-visible social identities like sexual orientation, first-generation status, socioeconomic status, etc. Prior literature suggests that diversity in approaches, problem solving, and ways of thinking improve innovation in engineering design more reliably than does diversity along the lines of age, race, gender, etc. However, the process of enculturating students into engineering through engineering curriculum often creates homogeneity in students' approaches to problems, ways of thinking, and attitudes. In this paper, I explore a limited set of existing research on diversity from these underlying perspectives including identities, alternative ways of thinking and being, motivation, cognitive diversity, and innovation and creativity. This work synthesizes the findings of these studies to paint a rich picture of how students develop different attitudes and skills to navigate their paths within engineering. Additionally, this work provides an evidence-based argument for the importance of recognizing and understanding latent diversity to promote a more inclusive environment in engineering and recruit, educate, retain, and graduate more innovative and diverse engineers. This paper opens the conversation about a new, but complementary, focus for developing a STEM workforce rich in talent and capable of adapting to the changing STEM landscape.",Godwin A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,College of Engineering,
Scaling a faculty professional development program to multiple disciplines through disciplinary communities of practice evolving from evidence-based workshops,"For more effective teaching and learning in undergraduate engineering education, there is a strong need for faculty professional development to instruction from instructor-centered, information-transmission teaching by lecture to more student-centered, conceptual-change learning by active learning through student engagement. The National Science Foundation IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) program has funded a large-scale faculty development program at a large southwestern university called Just-in-Time-Teaching with Two Way Formative Feedback for Multiple Disciplinary (JTFD) Programs. The project scales to seven engineering disciplines with 84 faculty using a train-the-trainer model to engage faculty in year-long apprenticeships with a semester of eight biweekly workshops followed by a semester of six biweekly mentor-supported classroom innovation implementation. Prior project research has shown that evidence-based practices such as student engagement, contextualization of content, and two-way formative feedback can improve student attitudes, achievement and persistence. Research also shows that changing faculty teaching beliefs toward evidence-based strategies and practices can be difficult, but the transition can be eased when disciplinary communities of practice support faculty while they are changing their beliefs and practices. The personal interactions that occur within and between the disciplinary communities of practice are being characterized in JTFD with social network analysis (SNA) and will be correlated to shifts, across time, in the beliefs and practice of the faculty toward student-centered instruction. Prior project SNA research has shown faculty who are socially better connected to one another also teach with more student-centered classroom practices, as found from classroom observations. This was assessed by a tool called Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) which has 25 items related to evidence based practice and is used by trained observers to assess classroom practice. Faculty beliefs and classroom practice are being assessed in JTFD with surveys, open ended questions and classroom observations. Faculty motivation is being assessed with a new survey using expectancy-value theory. The impact of faculty changes in classroom practice results have been collected during the spring 2016 term from four pairs of disciplinary leader trainers who completed the eight workshops. One result showed that the effect of the eight workshops on faculty's student-centered classroom practice, as measured by RTOP, was an improvement between 34% and 65%. Another result showed that, for two faculty, compared to the same class for a prior semester, significant gains in the student grade ratio (the ratio of A's plus B's to C's plus D's plus E's plus W's). Thus, the cohort of eight faculty trained during the Spring 2016 semester shifted their practice significantly from teacher-centered instruction to student-centered learning as shown by the classroom observation RTOP results. Because of the limited number of participants other measures of change in faculty beliefs and motivation were positive, but did not show statistical significance. Future cohorts with larger numbers of participants can reveal correlations between faculty beliefs, motivation and classroom practice.",Krause S.; Middleton J.; Hjelmstad K.; Judson E.; Culbertson R.; Ankeny C.; Chen Y.; Ross L.; Mayled L.; Lopez E.; Park Y.; Smith B.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,"University of California, Berkeley;Arizona State University;California State University, Fullerton",
UNL summer REU program in biomedical devices,"We report results of a multi-year summer undergraduate research program (REU) focused on diagnostic and therapeutic biomedical devices. The goals of the project include fostering independent research skills, recruitment from underrepresented groups and/or schools with limited research opportunities, and professional development particularly targeting entrepreneurship and innovation. Pre/post surveys and focus group interviews were conducted to collect data from participants. Students strongly indicated that the program was an important bridge between their undergraduate and graduate careers and that important knowledge, skills, and interests were developed as a result. One of the main self-perceived deficiencies of students entering the program was technical communication, and gains were achieved in this area by structuring biweekly program-wide meetings around developing relevant skills. We found that one of the key indicators of a successful summer research experience is early contact between the student and the faculty mentor and/or graduate student mentor prior to the start of the research experience, and regular contact thereafter. We also determined that for purposes of engagement, it is important to provide hands-on activities from the beginning (in parallel with research training that supports the later phases of the summer project), even if these hands-on activities do not bear directly on the longer-term research goals. Finally, we found that exposure to professional development activities involving industry and technology transfer themes resulted in increased self-efficacy related to the ability to innovate in students' chosen field. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative survey results are presented to support these findings.",Nelson C.; Bashford G.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,University of Nebraska–Lincoln,
Classroom education using animation and virtual reality of the Great Wall of China in Jinshanling,"The field of virtual reality (VR) has provided many useful aids in the academic setting due to the user-friendly control of realistically immersive 3D simulation. Some examples include virtual simulation (e.g., simulation of a medical surgery for medical students), component and environment construction (e.g., assembly of an automotive engine for mechanical engineering students), and data visualization (e.g., a virtual building site project for construction engineering students). However, certain specific avenues of study have yet to catch up with education as a whole with regards to such innovations, so rectifying this could be instrumental for topics where these innovations could be invaluable - especially in the engineering sector. For example, there is little research on the use of virtual reality in the education on ancient construction engineering, as most applications tend to focus on modern works of construction. For this specific reason, this research concerns a state-of-theart virtual reality simulation of the ancient construction methods of the Jinshanling region of the Great Wall of China, which collects and presents the most up-to-date information regarding these processes, as a case study for classroom education. The virtual environment described in this paper allows the students to view the construction method of the Great Wall from different angles and analyze this process more clearly, compared to traditional photos or static digital modeling images. The use of VR is relevant to modelling the originally constructed structure from the currently damaged condition of the wall. The Jinshanling section of the Great Wall is located in the Luanping County of Hebei, China. This section of the wall was first built in the beginning of the Ming Dynasty in AD 1368, and later renovated in approximately AD 1569; it comprised the closest section of the wall to Beijing (China's capital during the Ming Dynasty), a mere 150 km away from the capital, thus requiring reinforcement against invasion. This explains the complex construction methods of this Jinshanling section - an outer layer of foundation stones and bricks and an inner layer of rubbles and rammed earth. The data used for the modeling processes was obtained from measurements taken from both site visits and literature search. The authors used Dassault Systèmes SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD design software to reconstruct the damaged monument in a piecewise, bottom-up fashion, since SOLIDWORKS has an excellent display on curved surfaces and thus has an outstanding animated visualization of the step-by-step construction process. The SOLIDWORKS assembly also verified which sequences of construction were most logical. SketchUp (with Google Earth) was used for extraction of the existing terrain of the Jinshanling section of the Great Wall. The final 3D assembly along with the terrain were transferred to and coded in Unity (a gaming engine) to create a VR simulation using the Oculus Rift (a VR headset) and an Xbox controller, allowing students to examine the construction process in a virtual environment. A walkthrough of the wall would allow students to inspect the wall in a virtual environment. Thus, this study is expected to allow students to immerse themselves in the virtual erection process of ancient structures in a classroom setting.",Yang J.; Tan F.; Tan A.; Parke M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,The Ohio State University,
A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study for a game intervention in an Undergraduate wireless communications course,"The importance of preparing the next-generation workforce in engineering cannot be overstated. Undergraduate engineering education is vitally important to this venture and must undergo continuous improvements to meet dynamically changing needs in industry research and development. Of the many areas of engineering that benefit from pedagogical innovations, this study focuses on the context of teaching wireless communications. Wireless communications is a dynamic field, responsible for advances in cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other technologies and systems using the wireless medium for communications. Engineers recruited by industry are expected to design new and innovative systems for wireless technologies as the field continues to expand in its applications, which include mobile devices, peripherals, and networks. This constantly changing and evolving industry in wireless communications requires undergraduate engineering students to learn more advanced engineering concepts. We argue that sophisticated principles can be effectively introduced at the undergraduate level. Current state-of-the-art technologies normally taught to graduate students are now being explored in undergraduate education, and novel methods of instruction are necessary to provide a scaffold for advanced learning at the undergraduate level. To enhance learning as interactive decisional AIDS, serious games in education are proposed to better educate, motivate, and engage students. Games may also be used to acquaint students with machine thought in a robust manner. In this research, a game exploring wireless communication concepts is created. A quasi-experimental study is then performed to determine the effects of an intervention of access to a wireless communication concepts and interactive quiz game on student performance using numerically scored quizzes. This was implemented in a wireless communications course of 30 students in an undergraduate engineering program. Nonparametric comparative analyses are performed to determine the effect of the game intervention so as to answer the following research question: What is the change in student performances in an undergraduate communications course that uses a game intervention to deepen understanding of wireless topics in the course material?.",Sheridan J.; Goff R.; Dietrich C.; Marojevic V.; Polys N.; Buehrer R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Virginia Tech College of Engineering;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,
Industry funded research impacts on engineering faculty's research experiences: A review and synthesis of the literature,"Participation in industry funded research can have significant impacts on faculty's research experiences. As industry funded research tends to have different characteristics than government funded research, i.e. industry funded research is relatively short term, deadline driven, more applied, and more focused on commercial outputs than government funded research, these characteristics can lead to measurable impacts on faculty research experiences when participating in industry funded research. This is especially true for Engineering at R1 institutions, where industry funded research is a much higher percentage of R&D expenditures than overall industry funded university R&D expenditures (typically 10-25% for Engineering alone, compared to about 6-8% of the university overall). This paper examines the existing literature for impacts on Engineering faculty's research experiences when participating in industry funded research, including research productivity as measured by publication output, innovation as measured by patent output, and the likelihood for collaboration with others. Results of the literature review will be synthesized for a better understanding of each of these impacted areas and where there are opportunities for further research on the subject.",Holloway E.; Oakes W.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,College of Engineering,Engineering ;  Faculty ;  Industry ;  Literature review ;  Research
Community health innovation through an interprofessional course,"The broad goal of this interdisciplinary course is to allow pre-professional biology, pre-nursing, and engineering students to leverage MakerSpace technology to produce and communicate tangible solutions to current challenges in community health. For the past two iterations of the course students developed solutions to metabolic syndrome using MakerSpace technologies (3D printing, laser cutters/engravers, virtual reality, and related software). Communication between disciplines that impact each other, but may have different biases and goals, is important. This communication is facilitated through teamwork. In the course, students receive explicit training in problem solving techniques, teamwork, and communication. For example, students form their teams using the StrengthsFinders analysis to build on the individual strengths. Moreover, the teams watch a video on the challenger disaster to evaluate systemic reasons leading to failure in team decision making. Additionally, the MakerSpace is used to foster creative problem solving, collaboration skills, and knowledge of technologies that may shape their professions' future. The instructor's' role in the course is to serve as facilitators and guides while students work to develop their solutions. This process ensures that students take ownership of their project as an engaged team. It allows students to strengthen their problem-solving and collaboration skills. The interdisciplinary teaching team models the teamwork skills the students are learning. The aim is to promote interdisciplinary learning, foster teamwork, and improve student engagement. Other course objectives are to develop students' creative problem solving, empathetic design practices, communication skills, prototyping skills, and ethical reasoning. Students are expected to become proficient at the empathetic design process as well as interdisciplinary communication and teamwork. Creative problem solving, ethical reasoning, and realization of a product through prototyping are expected to be emergent skills that will need further refinement after the course. Research was conducted with consenting participants from the course using qualitative content analysis of student responses to prompts with the aim of assessing course outcomes. Results indicate that the multidisciplinary experience and use of and maker technologies enhance student learning and engagement, foster teamwork and interdisciplinary skills, and increase students' ability to innovate.",Nagel J.; Ludwig P.; Lewis E.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,James Madison University,
How are threshold concepts applied? A review of the literature,"Funded by a recently awarded NSF RED grant, we aim to transform the curriculum and culture of a large electrical and computer engineering department with a model that foregrounds design and innovation to offer students a variety of pathways to a degree. We are developing a combination of approaches to create a program with disciplinary depth and a range of learning experiences, including a participatory design approach that involves not only curriculum redesign, but also engagement of faculty and students in industry and K-12 outreach. Through these combined approaches, we hope to increase the diversity of students entering the program, the variety of pathways through the program, and the kinds of careers graduates pursue. We begin with the goal of effectively employing the Threshold Concepts Framework to identify transformative targets for curricular revisions. Our first step in approaching the RED grant from the perspective of curriculum develop includes a literature review that both systematically canvases existing resources and summarizes and synthesizes themes that enable us to answer the following questions: 1. What research findings have been reported about threshold concepts across disciplines, in the field of engineering, and in electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science? 2. What are the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the threshold concepts framework, both in theory and practice? 3. Which methods are most effective for identifying threshold concepts? 4. How have threshold concepts been used to enact change? In exploring these questions, we investigate the history and evolution of the threshold concepts framework with attention to sociotechnical patterns such as whether and how ""professional"" and ""technical"" concepts are delineated. In terms of methodology, we consider whether data collection prompts guide people away from the center of their discipline, and whether there is less of a dichotomy between social and technical than often portrayed in engineering education narratives. Finally, we are employing a participatory design process in which we are not only asking department stakeholders to identify sites of threshold concepts, but also to enroll them in a grassroots, transformative effort. To that end, we explore ways that the process of understanding threshold concepts serves as an opportunity for dialog that can kick-start the culture shift of the department. This paper will be framed as a literature review beginning with the seminal three volume collection on threshold concepts (edited by subsets of the team Ray Land, Jan Meyer, Jan Smith, Caroline Baillie, and Michael Flanagan), a search of ASEE and Frontiers in Education proceedings, then concluding with the Education Research Complete database for other relevant articles between 2003 and 2016. In this review, we will (1) summarize the theory of threshold concepts, (2) identify what threshold concepts have been proposed in both Electrical and Computer Engineering, (3) explain how the concepts have been used in curriculum development to enact change, and (4) discuss how the existing literature will inform our participatory design process in revolutionizing the ECE department.",Reeping D.; McNair L.; Harrison S.; Knapp R.; Lester L.; Martin T.; Patrick A.; Wisnioski M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Institute for Creativity,
Extracurricular college activities fostering students' innovation self-efficacy,"This study examines the relationship between participation in extracurricular college activities and its possible impact on students' career interests in entrepreneurship and innovation. This work draws from the Engineering Majors Survey (EMS), focusing on innovation self-efficacy and how it may be impacted by participation in various extracurricular college activities. The term self-efficacy as developed by Albert Bandura is defined as ""people's judgment of their capabilities to organize and execute courses of action required to attain designated types of performances"" (Bandura, 1986, p.391). Innovation self-efficacy is a variable consisting of six items that correspond to Dyer's five discovery skills seen as important for innovative behavior. In order to investigate the relationship between participation in certain activities and innovation self-efficacy, the 20 activities identified in the EMS survey were grouped thematically according to their relevance to entrepreneurship-related topics. Students were divided into two groups using K-means cluster analysis according to their innovation selfefficacy (ISE.6) score. Cluster one (C1) contained the students with higher ISE.6 scores, Cluster two (C2) included the students with lower innovation self-efficacy scores. This preliminary research focused on descriptive analyses while also looking at different background characteristics such as gender, academic status and underrepresented minority status (URM). The results show that students in C1 (high ISE.6) have significantly greater interest in starting an organization (78.1%) in comparison to C2 students (21.9%) (X2=81.11, p=.000, Cramer's V= .124). At the same time, male students reported significantly higher ISE.6 scores (M=66.70, SD=17.53) than female students (M=66.70, SD=17.53) t(5192)=-5.220 p=.000 and stronger intentions to start an organization than female students (15% and 6.1 % respectively). Cluster affiliation representing innovation self-efficacy as well as gender seems to play a role when looking at career interest in entrepreneurship. According to Social Cognitive Career Theory, self-efficacy is influenced by learning experiences. In this work activities referring to hands-on activities in entrepreneurship and innovation are highly correlated with ISE.6 (r=.206, p=.000), followed by non-hands-on exposure to entrepreneurship and innovation. At the same time, students in C1 participated almost twice as often in hands-on activities in entrepreneurship and innovation (28.6%) as compared to students in C2 (15.2%). Interestingly in C1, there were no gender differences in participation in hands-on activities in entrepreneurship and innovation. Overall, female students (M=4.66, SD=2.5) participated in significantly more activities than male students (M=3.9, SD=2.64), t(5192)=9.65 p=.000. All in all, these results reveal interesting insights into the potential benefits of taking part in innovation and entrepreneurship-related activities and their impact on students' innovation self-efficacy and interests in corresponding careers.",Dungs C.; Sheppard S.; Chen H.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Stanford University,
Young makers becoming the engineers of the future and implications,"The purpose of this NSF-funded study ""Might Young Makers Be the Engineers of the Future?"" is to understand Young Makers in K-12 and how their knowledge, skills, and attitudes might prepare them to pursue advanced STEM education and careers. Makers are an emerging community of self-described DIY-enthusiasts, tinkerers and hobbyists. Makers embolden characteristics from the Engineer of 20201 like practical ingenuity, creativity, and propensity toward lifelong learning. Making is of particular interest to the field of engineering and to engineering educators. The mission of this research is to develop a theory, inductively grounded in data and deductively built on literature, illuminating the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of Young Makers related to pathways forward to engineering and STEM-related majors and careers. By describing educational pathways to or around formal engineering education, we will better inform future innovations to improve the practical ingenuity and lifelong learning of our future engineers. The specific research questions to be answered are: (RQ 1.) What knowledge, skills, and attitudes do Young Makers possess that could be related to engineering? and (RQ 2.) How do pathways of Young Makers intersect with engineering?",Lande M.; Jordan S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus,
Clinical immersion program for bioengineering and medical students,"A summer Clinical Immersion experience for rising bioengineering seniors who are enrolled in a twosemester capstone design sequence is offered to provide exposure to the clinical environment, including process flow, workarounds, and a first-hand understanding of where and how medical devices are used. In 2016 the program was expanded to include rising second year medical students. The primary learning objective is to formalize a methodical approach to needs assessment based on user-centered design. In this six-week internship, students rotate 30 hours per week in a clinical department under a physician mentor. Students also receive weekly workshop instruction on user-centered design, empathy, contextual inquiry and stakeholder interviewing, analysis and synthesis of research, and prioritization of user needs. Students work in teams made up of 2 medical students and 2 rising senior bioengineering students and rotate through three-week long clinical rotations in two of the following departments: Anesthesia, Emergency Medicine, Gastroenterology, Hematology and Radiation Oncology, Neurology, Ophthalmology, Orthopedics, Pulmonary Critical Care, Radiology, and Urology. At the end of each rotation, teams present problem statements based on insights from their primary research as well as potential design concepts to address the identified needs. Participants maintain a blog to capture and reflect on their observations, which also allows them to share their experience with the other students. Upon completion of the Clinical Immersion program, Bioengineering students are well prepared for the senior design capstone course that emphasizes development of medical devices conceived from validated end-user needs. Select medical students, as part of their Innovation Medicine program, gain experience in interdisciplinary collaboration with engineers, exposure to the user-center process, and enhance their interpersonal skills.

Incorporating faculty sense making in the implementation and modification of an instrument to measure social and cognitive engagement,"Background Over the last decade, numerous calls for change in the engineering curriculum and content delivery have been made. Following these recommendations, the field of engineering education saw research on the development and implementation of several learning innovation and instructional practices. However, while there has been extensive research examining barriers and affordances to the adoption of teaching practices and curriculum, much less work has been done on assessment instruments. In addition, research highlights there is generally resistance on the part of faculty members when it comes to adopting new practices. This resistance often stems from faculty feeling as though that their input was not solicited during the development of these innovations. Purpose As part of a larger study to develop an instrument that measures students' social and cognitive engagement with a course, this work seeks to explore the sensemaking processes faculty undertake when they choose to adapt and adopt the aforementioned instrument. In addition, we seek to investigate how engaging faculty in the process of developing and using the instrument impacts the overall ability of the instrument to meet the needs of current and future users. Method A group of engineering faculty at a pacific northwest institution participated in this study through interviews and survey implementation in their course. Data were collected through three interviews. First, faculty were interviewed to understand their motivation in using our survey and their perception of its benefits. A second interview followed, using the instrument items as a guide, to determine how faculty made sense of these items in relation to their course and their students. In a final interview, faculty were given the opportunity to select results they wished to view thereby eliminating questions from the dataset that they deemed outside of their needs or interests. Faculty were also asked what parts of the survey they would like changed and why. Results This study demonstrated how feedback from faculty, as it relates to the usability of the instrument and recommendations for improvement, impacted the evolution of the social and cognitive engagement instrument. In addition, this approach allowed for an understanding of how the adoption of the instrument emerged through faculty input. Conclusion Engaging faculty in the process of developing educational initiatives is an important aspect of fostering change. Most importantly, understanding faculty perspective can guide current and future development efforts of our instrument. Future research will investigate the role of the instrument and student data on teachers' decisions to modify their teaching practices.",Ironside A.; Pitterson N.; Brown S.; Fisher K.; Gestson S.; Simmons D.; Adesope O.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Washington State University Pullman;Florida International University;Oregon State University,
"Integrating engineering, innovation, and research at all levels: An educational model for water reuse design","Growing urban populations, increasing water consumption, and decreasing predictability of climate all point to an ever-increasing need to improve water-use efficiency and watershed management around the world. Moreover, providing clean water and restoring the nitrogen cycle are two of the fourteen National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges that future engineers will need to act upon. Therefore, treating once-used water on-site to safe effluent-reuse standards-rather than using the water just once and flushing it back to an expensive, highmaintenance centralized treatment plant-has the potential to help address these challenges by restoring the local water-nutrient cycle. With these considerations, during the spring of 2016 a capstone project at Northeastern University was designed to task civil and environmental engineering students to provide solutions to those Engineering Grand Challenges. The project involved the selection of an on-site wastewater reclamation and reuse technology, followed by the design, construction, and operation of a pilot system to test the selected technology, as well as the creation of educational material including a website for educational and outreach purposes. The project was presented internally at the university-level and at a regional student design competition related to water, for which the students received first place, and had access to participate at the national level competition. The project was finally handed to the Civil and Environmental Engineering department, and it has been used for research both by high school students as part of the Young Scholar Program (YSP) over the summer of 2016 and by several undergraduate students since September 2016. This paper will discuss the implementation of this hands-on capstone project that along with providing students with a high-quality curriculum, research opportunities, and exposing them to real world problems, this project-oriented capstone initiative helped equip the next generation of engineers to make a valuable contribution and put them at the forefront of education, engineering, and innovation.",Onnis-Hayden A.; Venegas-Martinez C.; Dreyer M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Northeastern University,
Supportive mentoring practices based on undergraduate experiences,"A recent study shows that 30% of undergraduate students are successful in completing degrees in STEM fields, of those only 29% are from historically underrepresented groups.1 During the past decade, the number of undergraduate students pursuing degrees in STEM fields from underrepresented groups has increased only by 3%.2 In order to address the significant need for the completion of degrees in STEM fields by underrepresented groups, efforts to develop effective mentoring practices have been undertaken. Mentoring has proven to be an effective mechanism for ensuring student success in STEM fields. Select mentoring programs for women, minorities, and underrepresented groups have shown significant gains in increasing the presence of students from various backgrounds in the STEM fields.3 Mentoring provides participants from underrepresented groups with exposure to role models, support networks, and other mechanisms that help them succeed in STEM fields.7 Attracting more students from underrepresented populations into the STEM workforce will maximize innovation, creativity, and competitiveness. The present research study reviewed, characterized, and analyzed the various practices, procedures, and policies of successful mentoring programs. Survey instruments composed of 22 questions were used to learn about the mentoring experiences of graduate students in STEM fields during their undergraduate matriculation, particularly if they benefited or failed to benefit from their mentor. The selection process used to pick mentors and mentees was also investigated with the research questionnaire to further understand student preferences and specific needs of those majoring in STEM fields. The sixty-four (N=64) participants represents a diverse sample of graduate students who pursue undergraduate STEM degrees. Students reported their mentors helped with the following: 1) providing funding, setting goals, providing positive and constructive feedback on their work, and being supportive of ideas which allowed the mentee to follow his/her own ideas for their work. Alternatively, some participants reported unmet expectations by their mentor(s), such as wishing the mentor had: 1) provided more exposure to industry-based tasks, 2) assisted in decision making regarding career decision, 3) presented the mentee with more challenges by encouraging the student to go above and beyond, 4) provided more research opportunities. Such findings indicate that mentors can play a pivotal role in the development of students. These results also demonstrate that mentoring relationships need to be improved for students to receive equal and adequate support. Eighty-four percent of participants reported having more than two mentors. Therefore, having multiple mentors may be more beneficial for students to expand their exposure to multiple mentoring practices while reducing their needs not being met by one mentor. Additionally, 17% of participants reported having five or more mentors. Findings of the present study will be used to create mentoring practices that help students succeed in the STEM fields. This may suggest that students in STEM require more support in order to successfully complete their degrees. Results are being used for suggestions and recommendations for supportive practices that can be implemented in future mentoring programs to help underrepresented groups to successfully achieve degrees in the STEM field under the guidance of a mentor. Mentoring practices should be structured to fully support students specifically in STEM fields facing unique barriers.",Little G.; Crumpton-Young L.; Brady S.; DeShai Carter T.; Davis L.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Tennessee State University,
The use of a medical device surrogate for cooperative product development learning of engineering design,"While many core engineering classes prepare students' technical ability, there are few classes that strictly enforce development of key concepts. The work presented is a project-based learning experience that teaches and enforces three key concepts: (1) innovation, (2) prototyping strategies, and (3) design processes crucial for engineering design. While it is important for students to learn the presented key concepts, it is imperative to ensure that upon completion of the course, each student is at an equal proficiency. The focus of this study is on translatability between professors and times a course is offered. Such that, no matter when and by whom the course is instructed, the students will effectively learn and show improvements in innovation, prototyping, and design. Our research poses the question: how will a project-based learning experience translate between different professors and times a course is offered when trying to enhance and develop concepts of innovation, prototyping, and design? A hands-on, project-based cooperative learning lab was designed where students are placed into teams to design and develop a final prototype. The course uses the development of a board game as a surrogate for a medical device to enhance students' skills in innovation, prototyping, and design. The use of the board game allows students to focus on the process versus the development of a final specific device. Additionally, the board game requires consideration in all aspects of medical device design: innovation, prototyping, standards consideration, regulatory pathway, intellectual property, and design of an experiment. The course has three main components that enforce and teach innovation, prototyping, and design. The students begin by taking a survey for self-assessment evaluation, a pre and post design challenge for instructor assessment, and expert validation of a final project prototype. From the study, the design challenges and student surveys showed significant differences between pre and post scores. This was evident in all three key concepts. Some of the key findings were, the spring 2014 semester, 76% showed improvement in innovation, fall 2015 Wednesday section showing a 73% increase in the innovation category for the student survey, and spring 2014 showing a 143% score increase in the design category of the design challenge. However, at this time, there are no reported statistical differences in validator scores for the final product prototype. The study here hopes to address two concepts. The first being teaching and retention of concepts that are important in design, specifically senior year design. Second, it offers promise into the transferability of content and learning between professors, semesters, and time a class is offered. While this study was performed on a junior year course, a project-based learning experience is perfect for the freshmen year experience, to ensure that students are taught these skills early on in their academic careers. In addition, the methodology used in this course is applicable to any grade level. While implemented junior year, this form of teaching could greatly benefit FYE.",La Belle J.; Malkoc A.; Honikel M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Arizona State University,
Institutionalizing campus innovation and entrepreneurship programming by optimizing a faculty grantmaking process: A case study,"The number of institutions offering entrepreneurship courses and programs has grown dramatically over the last decade. Many of these programmatic offerings have been driven by the passion of individual faculty champions. Unfortunately, the programming often remains the responsibility of that founding faculty champion. In such cases, if the faculty champion leaves, the entrepreneurship programming declines or may be completely lost. VentureWell, a not-for-profit that supports STEM innovators and entrepreneurs, has utilized its Faculty Grants Program to provide seed funding to faculty champions to create courses and programs that enhance student development of skills and knowledge associated with innovation and entrepreneurship. To foster lasting impact, the program sets the expectation that meritorious educational innovations will continue after funding ends. While this has occurred in most cases (over the last 5 years 72% of grantees' claim activities have continued, expanded or been institutionalized), continuation of the program typically remains the responsibility of the founding faculty members, an indicator that institutionalization is not yet complete. Research on propagation and institutionalization of educational innovations has suggested that an institutionalization plan should be constructed in three phases: (i) describe the gap between the current situation and the desired future situation, (ii) prepare a plan for bridging the gap, and (iii) prepare a plan for monitoring progress toward bridging the gap. This paper describes how VentureWell is integrating this three-phase approach to institutionalization, Designing for Institutionalization (DI), into its Faculty Grants program. The DI approach is an adaptation of the three-phase Designing for Sustained Adoption Framework, which supports educational developers to increase the percentage of educational innovations that are propagated beyond the original developers. Case studies of institutionalization efforts provide lessons that could be applied by others interested in institutionalization.",Matthew V.; Froyd J.; Khatri R.; Katona T.; Sanders R.; Bachman B.; Cole R.; Lovitt J.; Geist M.; Henderson C.; Friedrichsen D.; Weilerstein P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,"Tennessee Technological University;Missouri University of Science and Technology;University of Iowa;Texas A&M University;Wichita State University;California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo;Western Michigan University;VentureWell",
"Technical communication instruction for graduate students: The communication lab vs, a course","Communication skills are critical to engineers' success in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, a variety of factors keep engineering students from developing those skills while in school, leading to a skills gap between recent graduates' actual preparation and their expected performance. This gap can be especially pronounced with graduate students, yet relatively little research and innovation has targeted this key population. Here we present two initiatives to improve the communication skills of graduate students: a department-level ""Communication Lab"" using peer tutors, and a for-credit communication course. Each approach is analyzed for pedagogical advantages, resource intensiveness, and general utility to the department. We conclude that the Communication Lab model is an overall effective resource for reaching a large number of students in a way that is cost-effective per-student, pedagogically advantageous, and an efficient use of student time. With appropriate modifications, it may even supply some of the advantages that the communication course offered, namely explicit communication frameworks and peer feedback.",Hanson A.; Lindahl P.; Strasser S.; Takemura A.; Englund D.; Goldstein J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Training students with T-shaped interdisciplinary studies in predictive plant phenomics,"Modern engineering and data analysis techniques make it feasible to develop methods to predict plant growth and productivity based on information about their genome and environment, however students trained with broader skillsets will be needed to unlock this potential. This paper describes the structure and activities of a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Traineeship (NRT) award focusing on Predictive Plant Phenomics (P3). Our program aims to increase agronomic output as highlighted by the National Plant Genome Initiative's current fiveyear plan [NST, 2014]. Ph.D. training production levels and types are not always a good fit for addressing complex technical and societal problems such as these. To train these scientists, the P3 NRT is using the T-training model proposed by the American Society of Plant Biology (ASPB) and described in ""Unleashing a Decade of Innovation in Plant Science: A Vision for 2015-2025"". This approach requires that students get broader exposure to multiple disciplines, work with industry and develop effective communication and collaboration skills without increasing the time to graduation. This paper describes how we are working towards meeting these challenges. Initial results show that the students have more contact with faculty across departments than single discipline graduate students and that the students are open to learning about new areas. However, we are still grappling with issues such as finding the best mechanism for balancing student skills as they start their program in leveling activities such as bootcamps and initial course training.",Dickerson J.; Heindel T.; Lawrence-Dill C.; Schnable P.; Wittrock J.; Losch M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,University of Northern Iowa;Iowa State University,
Climate survey in a mid-sized research university mechanical engineering department: Report,"This study was inspired by the restructuring of a mid-sized private research university's mechanical engineering undergraduate major. This restructuring consists of offering major ""concentrations"" in several different areas which were developed based on student and alumni feedback, and redesigning academic advising for mechanical engineering majors. This time of change is being utilized as a chance to assess the undergraduate student climate in the department more generally. Climate is operationalized around the following factors: sense of community, perceptions of diversity of both faculty and students, and perceptions of inclusivity. This study is guided by the following evaluation questions: 1. What can be learned about our students' self-beliefs and perceptions of supports? How do they differ by gender and major? 2. How might self-beliefs and perceptions of supports be related? To answer these questions, data were collected via surveys administered to current students who have declared a major in mechanical, biomechanical, or design engineering. The data gathered included students' study skills and habits, their thoughts on program diversity and inclusivity, experiences with faculty, the sense of community of the program, and demographic information including parents' education levels and careers, high school classes and exposure to engineering, and engineering activities outside of school. We found that there were significant differences between men and women, and mechanical engineering and design students. For men and women, these differences were present in the areas of certain engineering skills, engineering identity, innovation task self-efficacy, engineering task self-efficacy, engineering identity, major fit, and major perception. For mechanical engineering and design students, these differences were present in innovation and engineering task selfefficacy, sense of engineering community, engineering identity, and major perception. Lastly, we found strong positive correlations between the three supports considered in this work (support of diversity, engineering community support, and faculty support) and a student's sense of fitting into their major. In addition, a strong sense of engineering community support is correlated with greater engineering task self-efficacy, whereas a stronger sense of faculty support is correlated with greater skill beliefs.",Turpin A.; Chew K.; Chen H.; Rieken B.; Sheppard S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Stanford University,
Accelerating biomedical innovation in academia: Leveraging academic discoveries to meet the needs of both Faculty and students,"Faculty and students have unique educational and professional needs and priorities. Faculty traditionally focus their efforts on research, service, and teaching on the path toward promotion and tenure, with less emphasis placed on translating findings outside of the lab during their academic training. Alternatively, graduate students seeking careers in industry or as entrepreneurs have a keen interest in innovation and commercialization and hope to develop skills in this area. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to address the opportunities and challenges of commercialization and entrepreneurship while also meeting the demands of academia. Our objective was to develop a course to meet the unique needs of both groups by providing students with real-world experience in technology commercialization while at the same time providing Faculty with structured support to bring their discoveries and innovations to patients. In collaboration with the Columbia-Coulter Translational Research Partnership, we created a semester-long course, ""Lab-to-Market: Accelerating Biomedical Innovation"" aimed at providing interdisciplinary teams, comprised of students and faculty, with an introduction to the specialized frameworks and essential tools necessary for biomedical technology commercialization. This course successfully met the needs of both students and Faculty by providing students with an immersive real-world training in technology commercialization, while also providing Faculty with additional support on translating their academic discoveries.

A computer-based interactive activity for visualizing crystal structures in introductory materials science courses,"This paper presents and discusses an interactive classroom activity on visualizing the atomic arrangement of common crystal structures and planes. This two-part module is built upon the ICAP framework [1], with students first completing an individual constructive activity, where they mentally visualize and manipulate crystal structures. The second part is an interactive activity in which students work together to view and manipulate crystal structures using OVITO, an open-source software tool. At the end of the exercise, students evaluate their previous individual work using the solutions from the group. This lesson both challenges students to synthesize information about crystal structures and introduces them to a visualization tool used by researchers. The module was pilot-tested in a fifty-minute lecture of an introductory materials science course at a large research institution. Students downloaded and ran the software on their personal computers, which most students found to be reasonable. Students perceived this activity to be useful and educational, and preliminary results indicate that the activity supported student learning. Samples of student work are included to illustrate misconceptions that were identified and corrected during the activity. All of the resources for this activity are shared publicly to support other faculty in their curricular innovations.",Gentry S.; Faltens T.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,"University of California, Davis;Purdue University",
Reviewing the current state of grand challenge scholars programs across the United States,"In 2008, the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) identified the Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century representing the fourteen most pressing issues facing modern society requiring engineering innovation. To equip the next generation of engineers with the tools to address these challenges and create global sustainable solutions, engineering education must expose students to these Grand Challenges during their undergraduate studies. More than 120 engineering schools across the country have committed to producing at least twenty students specifically equipped to tackle these challenges through the NAE's Grand Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP). The GCSP aims to progress undergraduate engineering around global issues rather than isolated disciplines and help students in the program develop skills in five components: Research Experience, Interdisciplinary Curriculum, Entrepreneurship, Global Dimension, and Service-Learning. To date, there are no specified requirements for each of the program components; students attaining the NAE Grand Challenge Scholar designation can achieve this recognition in a variety of ways based on the institution's requirements. For example, at one institution students are required to have industry experience outside the United States for Global Dimension, while at other institutions students are required to study abroad or take cross-cultural courses. In an effort to understand the variation between the thirty-five active GCSPs and corresponding variant student capabilities, each institution's program and student requirements were analyzed via information provided on the NAE GCSP website and available from individual institutions' websites. In this paper, the authors highlight the range of experiences and immersion required for each program component and detail unique and innovative practices. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to track similarities and differences between Grand Challenge Scholars Programs and drive towards a more thorough understanding of student-learning outcomes and experiences.",Donaher S.; Dancz C.; Plumblee J.; Gordon A.; Patel K.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2017-06-24,Clemson University,
Graduate automotive engineering education innovation-deep orange program collaborative industry partnerships enable system engineering based approach for project-focused learning,"Through traditional education associated with engineering disciplines, students are expected to become familiar with fundamental engineering design and principles through a series of engineering materials explanations, stages of assignments and class projects. The usual knowledge flow offered to engineering students is based on a step-by-step process taught by faculty using text books. Design solutions to real world problems often require approaches that cannot be obtained from traditional text books, such as the formulation of meaningful ideas, setting realistic design requirements, learning to execute trade-offs, balancing competing priorities, and communicating with colleagues that have different technical backgrounds. This paper presents the implementation of a system-based, sponsor-partner, collaboration focused, learning approach within the curriculum of the Department of Automotive Engineering at Clemson University which meets these realworld design engineering needs. The program implementing this real-world approach is called Deep Orange (DO). The Deep Orange initiative is an integral part of the automotive graduate program at the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research. The initiative was developed to provide first-year graduate engineering students with hands-on experience of the knowledge attained in the various automotive engineering and related disciplines (such as marketing and human factors psychology). The program focuses on developing and building new, innovative vehicle concepts and is driven entirely by graduate automotive engineering and transportation design students as part of their education in close collaboration with industry partners. This paper demonstrates and discusses the flow-down of requirement characteristics of the systems engineering process applied in DO. During this process, the students start with translating a grand challenge (defined by the sponsoring industry partners) into customer needs incorporating marketing analyses. The project proceeds with general investigation of various vehicle architectures and design alternatives, including the selection of one concept that is based on carefully balanced environmental, economic, performance, and social design imperatives. During the process, faculty serves as student mentors rather than direct knowledge providers. Students are empowered to make decisions and justify their concept selection to different program groups, i.e. sponsoring industry partners and faculty.

The methodological approach to monitoring of the economic and functional state of innovation-oriented machinery engineering enterprises at the modern technological modes,"The article is dedicated to the development of the methodological approach to monitoring of the economic and functional state of innovation-oriented machine engineering enterprises in the context of selected indices in alignment with the range of recommended (desired) values. The authors suggest the following stages of performing the monitoring: structuring of the indices which determine results of performing economic functions; formation of the composition of machine engineering enterprises in accordance with the fourth and the fifth techno-economic paradigms (technological modes); calculation of economic indices, determination of respective indices of dynamics; elimination of the influence on the values of the indices of non-systemic events; indication of the range of a recommended (desired) rate of knowledge and analysis of indices of a particular enterprise. The authors applied the proposed approach to research 20 enterprises of Ukraine which by the types of activities belong either to the fourth or the fifth technological paradigm. The ranges of recommended (desired) values for the indices of dynamics in figures relevant to the results of performing economic functions of innovation-oriented machine engineering enterprises were calculated for the fourth and the fifth technological paradigm enterprises. The difficulties in turning to the fifth technological paradigm in Ukraine in comparison with Poland, Germany, France and The United Kingdom were detected due to a complex of internal and external factors; nevertheless, a possibility for positive dynamics in 2017 has been outlined.",Gavrysh O.; Boiarynova K.,Journal,Economic Annals-XXI,2017-06-22,National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”,Economic and functional state ;  Indices of dynamics of economic figures ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation-oriented development ;  Innovation-oriented engineering enterprise ;  Techno-economic paradigm ;  Technological mode
Private universities' participation in open and distance learning for enhanced access to higher education among Underserved in India,"It is now well recognised and understood that the higher education is one of the important components in accomplishing the Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations for the countries. However this important sector continues to remain a matter of concern in India primarily because of supply demand gaps, poor quality of teaching-learning, disparities in access and constraints on research & innovation. The conventional mainstream systems of education are able to serve a very small segment of the society. Alongside, new demands of education are fast emerging from the working class and who are away from the centre of activities. The scarce financial allocations from the Government are not able to meet the demand of education. Such a scenario threatens the sustained high growth of the Indian economic engine. The advent of private sector and the opening of private universities and other institutions for higher and professional education has now emerged as important factors that are, now, running sizeable number of professional degree programmes particularly management and engineering and accounts for 59% of all the tertiary enrolments in India. Despite a lot of scepticism about the role of private sector, there has been a policy thrust for private sector's participation in higher education. This paper discusses the needs of private universities and their roles in making access of higher education in masses. The authors have tried to explore the roles of vast network of private universities in expansion of open and distance learning in accordance with the issues and challenges.",Pandey A.; Rizvi S.,Book,Optimizing Open and Distance Learning in Higher Education Institutions,2017-06-19,Government of Madhya Pradesh,
Implementation model of smart connected motorbike service: An engineering economic analysis of Machine to Machine application,"Nowadays, mobile operators are faced with difficult conditions, where subscriber growth rate is already at its peak. Revenue growth is also declined because legacy services are tend to decreased due to threat from OTTs. Therefore we need a strategy to be able to withstand these conditions, one of which is a glance at the digital market. Strategy to offer digital services is developed in order to increase operators' revenue through offering of Machine to Machine (M2M) services, where potential and digital ecosystem support of those services is promising. In reality, implementation of those digital services is not yielding significant effect on operators' revenue growth, thus they need new strategy with a new service innovation. This research aims to modeling an M2M services, into a Smart Connected Motorbike (SCM) services. Furthermore, this research also analyzes business model implementation of this service as a study case at PT.XYZ, where this service is expected to become a new revenue source. From system modeling result and business model analysis, it is revealed that implementation of Smart Connected Motorbike services practices multi-sided platform business model pattern that brings together two different groups of customers which are motorbike users/buyers and corporate customers. Moreover, this research analyses four business models approach to find appropriate implementation models of Smart Connected Motorbike services and additional revenue opportunities for PT.XYZ.",Suroso J.; Jamilah E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 11th 2016 International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems, KICSS 2016",2017-06-16,Bina Nusantara University,M2M ;  mobile operator ;  multi-sided platform business model ;  smart connected motorbike
Industry-academia collaborations in software engineering,"Research collaboration between industry and academia supports improvement and innovation in industry and helps to ensure industrial relevance in academic research. However, many researchers and practitioners believe that the level of joint industry-academia collaboration (IAC) in software engineering (SE) research is still relatively low, compared to the amount of activity in each of the two communities. The goal of the empirical study reported in this paper is to exploratory characterize the state of IAC with respect to a set of challenges, patterns and anti-patterns identified by a recent Systematic Literature Review study. To address the above goal, we gathered the opinions of researchers and practitioners w.r.t. their experiences in IAC projects. Our dataset includes 47 opinion data points related to a large set of projects conducted in 10 different countries. We aim to contribute to the body of evidence in the area of IAC, for the benefit of researchers and practitioners in conducting future successful IAC projects in SE.

Study on energy consumption evaluation of mountainous highway based on LCA,"For the system to understand the road construction energy consumption process, this paper selects a typical mountainous highway in the south, using the theory and method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantitatively study the energy consumption of the whole process of highway raw materials production, construction and operation. The results show that the energy consumption in the raw material production stage is the highest, followed by the highway operation and construction stage. The energy consumption per unit of tunnel engineering, bridge engineering, roadbed engineering and pavement engineering in the construction phase are 2279.00 tce, 1718.07 tce, 542.19 tce and 34.02 tce, and in operational phase, 85.44% of electricity consumption comes from tunnel ventilation and lighting. Therefore, in the bridge and tunnel construction process, we should promote energy-saving innovation of the construction technology and mechanical equipment, and further strengthen the research and development of tunnel ventilation, lighting energy-saving equipment and intelligent control technology, which will help significantly reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the life cycle of highway.",Fei L.; Zhang Q.; Xie Y.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2017-06-13,Jiangxi Expressway Investment Group;Beijing Engineering Consultants Ltd.,
Understanding the use of leap motion touchless device in physiotherapy and improving the healthcare system in India,"Since early 2000 there is a constant need to build a strong healthcare innovation engine to allow researchers from multi-disciplinary field to develop innovative products in the healthcare sector. Many western countries have adopted the use of innovative products in the form of mobile/web technologies and wearable devices to improve their healthcare system. Interestingly, a wearable device called MYO Armband is being adopted in the physiotherapy treatment and few studies show doctors and patients are interested in using the device but due to MYO's cumbersome nature, we decided to consider non-wearable device(s) for the treatment. Recently, we identified a touchless device (non-wearable) called 'Leap Motion', which is used for gaming systems and controlling applications in mobiles and computers. A sudden spark made us think the Leap Motion could be used in the physiotherapy treatment and we also, spotted interesting web applications which could potentially be used along with the device. We conducted workshops with the UK and Indian doctors and common people to understand the Leap Motion's use in physiotherapy and set some guidelines in using the device. Though the methodology of using workshops and survey responses collected to analyze is not the strongest of research methodologies, we tried to generalize the outcomes and recommendations, and the stimulating discussions with the doctors and practitioners helped us address ten-points to improve the healthcare system in India.",Sathiyanarayanan M.; Rajan S.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 9th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks, COMSNETS 2017",2017-06-09,"Fortis Healthcare Ltd.;City, University of London",Gesture interaction ;  Healthcare ;  Human factors ;  Human gestures ;  Human-computer interaction ;  Leap Motion ;  Physiotherapy ;  Usability

The design and exploration cycle as research and development framework in computing education,"Innovative and traditional learning designs like workplace-integrated learning in Industry 4.0, Computer Science Education (CSE) on higher and secondary level and Engineering Education require formative as well as summative approaches of evaluation for their further development or refinement. Educational evaluation of CSE learning scenarios has to take into account different perspectives, e.g. the learning design and especially the competence development processes of the involved stakeholders like learners and teachers. In this paper we discuss research on competence development in the context of CSE and engineering education and the possible support this research might obtain from relying on a theory-grounded research framework. The main contribution of the article is the explication of such a framework, which we have developed and refined based on an analysis of informatics processes.

"The impact of the innovation and Technology Support Offices (ITSOs) on innovation, intellectual property (IP) protection and entrepreneurship in philippine engineering education","This paper presents the impact of the intellectual property (IP) education program of the Innovation and Technology Support Offices (ITSOs) in Philippine universities, especially in the field of engineering and its allied courses. This descriptive study shows how the ITSOs' IP education program has led to the increase of patent applications from different engineering disciplines and the onset of technology commercialization in Philippine universities this decade. ITSOs were established in the different universities in the country to facilitate IP creation, protection and technology commercialization. Relevant information was gathered from the different ITSOs in the country and relevant statistics from the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) were obtained for this paper. Prior to the birth of ITSO, intellectual property protection and technology commercialization activities in the field of engineering in Philippine universities were not apparent. This study reveals that since its founding in 2010, already 195 patent applications have been filed from more than 80 ITSO universities by December 31, 2015, compared to only 23 patent applications from 2007 to 2010 of the same universities. A breakthrough in technology commercialization of one chemical engineering patent from the University of San Carlos (USC) in 2014, followed by one chemical engineering patent from Adamson University in 2015, provides confirmation of the early success of the IP education program in Philippine universities. USC was able to license its chemical engineering technology with a private firm in Cebu City and has built a 200-million peso manufacturing plant that processes mango wastes to produce flour. Sixty-seven mango garbage collectors in the city were employed and provided with new homes through the company that the USC helped establish, a proof that IP education is gaining ground in the country.",Dellosa J.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2017-06-07,Caraga State University,Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Intellectual property ;  Patent ;  Technology commercialization.

"Thermal scribing to prototype plastic microfluidic devices, applied to study the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps","Innovation in microfluidics-based biological research has been aided by the growing accessibility of versatile microscale fabrication techniques, particularly in rapid prototyping of elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based devices. However, the use of PDMS presents considerable and often unexpected limitations, particularly in interpreting and validating biological data. To rapidly prototype microfluidic culture systems in conventional plastics commonly used in cell culture, we developed 'thermal scribing', a one-step micromachining technique in which thermoplastics are locally patterned by a heated tip, moving in user-controlled patterns. To demonstrate and study the thermal scribing process, we modified an inexpensive desktop hobby craft cutter with a soldering iron to scribe micropatterns on polystyrene substrates. The thermal scribing technique is useful for creating a variety of channel profiles and geometries, which cannot be readily achieved using other microfabrication approaches. The entire fabrication process, including post-processing operations needed to fabricate devices, can be completed within a few hours without the need for skilled engineering expertise or expensive equipment. We apply this technique to demonstrate that induction of functional neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) can be significantly enhanced over previous studies, when experiments are conducted in microfluidic channels prototyped in an appropriate material. These results ultimately inform the design of neutrophil culture systems and suggest that the inherent ability of neutrophils to form NETs may have been significantly under-reported.",Chandrasekaran A.; Kalashnikov N.; Rayes R.; Wang C.; Spicer J.; Moraes C.,Journal,Lab on a Chip,2017-06-07,Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Centre;Centre Universitaire de Santé McGill;Université McGill,
Cultivating a grassroots aerospace innovation culture at NASA ames research center,"This paper details the adaptation of specific 'knowledge production' methods to implement a first of its kind, grassroots event that provokes a cultural change in how the NASA Ames civil servant community engages in the creation and selection of innovative ideas. Historically, selection of innovative proposals at NASA Ames Research Center is done at the highest levels of management, isolating the views and perspectives of the larger civil servant community. Additionally, NASA innovation programs are typically open to technical organizations and do not engage non-technical organizations to bring forward innovative processes/business practices. Finally, collaboration on innovative ideas and associated solutions tend to be isolated to organizational silos. In this environment, not all Ames employees feel empowered to innovate and opportunities for employee collaboration are limited. In order to address these issues, the 'innovation contest' method was adapted to create the NASA Ames Innovation Fair, a unique, grassroots innovation opportunity for the civil servant community. The Innovation Fair consisted of a physical event with a virtual component. The physical event provided innovators the opportunity to collaborate and pitch their innovations to the NASA Ames community. The civil servant community then voted for the projects that they viewed as innovative and would contribute to NASA's core mission, making this event a truly grassroots effort. The Innovation Fair website provided a location for additional knowledge sharing, discussion, and voting. On March 3rd, 2016, the 'First Annual NASA Ames Innovation Fair' was held with 49 innovators and more than 300 participants collaborating and/or voting for the best innovations. Based on the voting results, seven projects were awarded seed funding for projects ranging from innovative cost models to innovations in aerospace technology. Surveys of both innovators and Fair participants show the Innovation Fair was successful in fostering cross-organizational collaborations, soliciting participation of non-technical innovations, and increasing employee engagement in influencing the future of NASA Ames Research Center. The grassroots component of the Innovation Fair has been bench marked by the agency as a solid foundation for increasing employee engagement in the development of game changing aerospace technology and processes in support of NASA's mission.",D'Souza S.; Sanchez H.; Lewis R.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2017-06-07,NASA Ames Research Center,

Current developments in multifunctional smart materials for 3D/4D bioprinting,"Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TE&RM) has made continuous advancements by extending three-dimensional (3D) printing towards the development and fabrication of biomimetic scaffolds composed of biomimetic natural and synthetic materials. Although several clinical applications of 3D-printed scaffolds made of classical biomaterials have yielded promising results, current basic research trends have shifted towards rendering scaffolds “smart” or dynamically responsive where shape changes are induced by external stimulation (ie. electromagnetic radiation, mechanical stress, heat) or physiological changes in the local microenvironment through pre-designed mechanisms of action. Although a bulk of the research efforts have led to high-impact publications demonstrating the capabilities of these technologies, hardly any studies have been published illustrating the application of these research efforts in a clinical context. Herein, we will discuss current trends and advancements of 3D printable bioinks and highlight the most recent developments (2015-present) of 3D-printed smart materials also commonly referred to as 4D printing/programmable matter. We will conclude with a prospective opinion of this research field where innovation is synonymous with risk-taking. High-risk, high-reward research founded on revolutionary innovations are often disruptive and lead to new paradigms; conclusively the 4D printing can be disruptive, because it has the potential to change the current paradigm by changing the question from “what can we do with these materials/technologies?” to “how can we move the concept/technology forward to achieve what we need”.",Castro N.; Meinert C.; Levett P.; Hutmacher D.,Journal,Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering,2017-06-01,Queensland University of Technology,4D printing ;  Bioink ;  Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) ;  Programmable matter ;  Smart materials
Driving mechanism of environmental technology innovation behavior in the corporate from internal and external perspectives,"Based on 416 sample data on corporate environmental technology innovation implementation and using PLS path analysis of structural equation model (SEM), the paper examines the impacts mechanism of environmental innovation behavior interaction between the two perspectives of internal and external drivers. The research shows that the internal driver, enterprise competitive advantage inherent desire craving has a direct role in promoting environmental technology innovation (ETI) behavior. Whereas stakeholder pressures and organizational legitimacy as external drivers indirectly impact on ETI behavior by means of mediated role of managerial interpretations. In addition, through empirical test, compared with the internal or external driven model, we know the internal and external integrated driven model better describes ETI behavior choice in the firm. Thus at first, enterprises implement various incentives and initiatives to pursue a competitive advantage inherent desire in order to improve them to choose ETI behavior actively. Then the local government helps build non-profit organizations (NPO) such as environmental conservation institute and make them more opportunities to communicate with enterprises for environmental issues. Furthermore, the external driving forces play a greater role to develop ETI behavior in enterprises.",Zhang H.; Shao Y.; Wang B.,Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2017-06-01,Jiangsu University of Science and Technology;University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Environmental technology innovation behavior ;  Internal and external driving ;  Managerial interpretations ;  Mediate effects

How better regulated composite materials could contribute billions to UK industry,"A research paper entitled 'Modernizing composite materials regulations’, stated that the introduction of effective regulation in the use of composites in the aerospace, and other new sectors, could bring more than £4bn worth of benefit to the UK by the year 2030. The study was carried out by a multidisciplinary team from Southampton’s Faculties of Engineering and the Environment, and Business, Law and Art supported by the Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute and the University’s department for Research and Innovation Services (RIS). One of the major inhibitors to the uptake of composites in new sectors was that regulations, codes and standards were inappropriate for composites. This was because they were both explicitly and implicitly based on named materials, such as steel, and did not permit consideration of composites applications despite the strengths and benefits of the materials in many cases.",Pye A.,Trade Journal,Environmental Engineering,2017-06-01,,

"If You Build It, They Will Come: How to Establish an Academic Innovation Enterprise","The rapid growth of minimally invasive, image-guided intervention has redefined the procedural management of multiple disease entities. The process of innovation which has characterized the growth of interventional radiology can be best described as “needs-based,” whereby practicing interventionalists identify unmet clinical needs and subsequently invent solutions to achieve desired technical and clinical outcomes. Historically, catheters and other percutaneous devices were developed with rudimentary manufacturing techniques and subsequently translated to patients with relatively little regulatory oversight. Since then, the resources required and financial costs of interventional technology development have grown exponentially. Fortunately, advances in software development, new methods of rapid prototyping, and commoditization of hardware components have made in-house engineering feasible once again. This has created an opportunity for academic medical centers to translate their research into testable prototypes in humans sooner and at reduced costs, and academic interventional radiology divisions are now leveraging these developments to create collaborative centers of innovation.

Functionality and versatility of aggregation-induced emission luminogens,"Breakthrough innovations in light-emitting materials have opened new exciting avenues for science and technology over the last few decades. Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) represents one of such innovations. It refers to a unique light-emitting phenomenon, in which luminescent materials that are non-emissive in molecular state can be induced to emit efficiently in aggregated state. The design and development of AIE luminogens (AIEgens) have overcome technical and fundamental limitations that exist in conventional light-emitting materials, and thus generate great opportunities for various applications. In this review, we aim to introduce the wonderful world of AIE to scientists from different disciplines by summarizing the recent progress made in this exciting research field. The mechanistic analyses and the working principles of the AIE processes are first elaborated, which reveal the restriction of intramolecular motions as the main cause for the AIE effect. The different molecular engineering strategies for the design of new AIEgens are subsequently discussed with examples of various AIEgen systems. The recent high-tech applications of AIEgens as optoelectronic materials, chemical sensors, and biomedical probes are presented and discussed. We hope that this review will stimulate more research interest from physics, chemistry, life science, and biomedical fields to this wonderland of AIE.",Feng G.; Kwok R.; Tang B.; Liu B.,Journal,Applied Physics Reviews,2017-06-01,National University of Singapore;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,
Hand posture and gesture recognition techniques for virtual reality applications: a survey,"Motion recognition is a topic in software engineering and dialect innovation with a goal of interpreting human signals through mathematical algorithm. Hand gesture is a strategy for nonverbal communication for individuals as it expresses more liberally than body parts. Hand gesture acknowledgment has more prominent significance in planning a proficient human computer interaction framework, utilizing signals as a characteristic interface favorable to circumstance of movements. Regardless, the distinguishing proof and acknowledgment of posture, gait, proxemics and human behaviors is furthermore the subject of motion to appreciate human nonverbal communication, thus building a richer bridge between machines and humans than primitive text user interfaces or even graphical user interfaces, which still limits the majority of input to electronics gadget.

Information sharing and user behavior in internet-enabled peer-To-peer lending systems: An empirical study,"Internet-based information systems (IS) have enabled various forms of collective intelligence, action, and resources (e.g. open source software, innovation marketplaces, crowdsourcing, and crowdfunding). Within the domain of crowdfunding, Internet-enabled Peer-To-Peer Lending Systems (IP2PLS) have emerged as a disruptive technology, with implications for the financial services sector, business capitalization strategies, and personal and community development. IS research investigating user behavior in IP2PLS has revealed the saliency of social identity and personal transparency (as expressed through information sharing) in such systems. Prior research has largely focused on a small number of IP2PLS providers, thus this study examines a very large but under-researched platform. The study tests a theoretical model based on Social Identity Theory and prior IP2PLS studies, through an analysis of 116,667 loan records, and a subsequent analysis of 1000 manually coded records, to investigate the impact of information sharing on user (lenders and borrowers) behavior. The study reveals the importance of social (vs financial) data, and further reveals relationships that frequently contradict prior findings from other IP2PLS. The study thus implies the need for a more heterogeneous view of the IP2PLS domain, and the need to more fully understand as systems that support user behavior by enabling social information exchanges.",Feller J.; Gleasure R.; Treacy S.,Journal,Journal of Information Technology,2017-06-01,University College Cork,Collective action ;  Crowdfunding ;  Information sharing ;  Internet-enabled Peer-To-Peer Lending Systems (IP2PLS) ;  Personal transparency ;  Social Identity Theory
Process optimization of oil-natural gas gathering and transferring from the perspective of industrial engineering,"Process of oil-natural gas gathering and transferring starts with a stage from underground oil mining to wellhead process and ends with oil refining. The features of this phase include a large amount of the mixture of oil-gas and medium, long technics process, high investment, and high cost of processing. This paper systematically analyzes several critical problems of the crude oil gathering and transferring technology based on the analysis, evaluation, improvement and innovation of industrial engineering. It mainly involves: (1) a multi-subsystem linkage study based on system analysis to optimize the surface technology for the oilfield; (2) an economic decision model of multi-scheme optimization and technology upgrading of the oilfield; (3) a fundamental solution of the lengthy and complicated process of the oilfield, which emphasizes on the creative research & development as well as the application of the core production equipment. The simplified processing technology for the oil-natural gas gathering and transferring in the future is illustrated based on the field test of a new type oil-gas-water separator.",Yang W.; Sun L.,Journal,"ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications",2017-06-01,Dalian University,Industrial engineering ;  Oil-natural gas field development ;  Oil-natural gas gathering and transferring ;  Process optimization

"Entertainment, engagement, and education: Foundations and developments in digital and physical spaces to support learning through making","Making is a relatively new concept applied to describe the increasing attention paid to constructing activities to enable entertaining, and engaging learning. Making focuses on the process that occurs in digital and/or physical spaces that is not always learning oriented, but enables qualities such as problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, and innovation, to name a few. Contemporary technical and infrastructural developments, such as Hackerspaces, Makerspaces, TechShops, and FabLabs, and the appearance of tools such as wearable computing, robotics, 3D printing, microprocessors, and intuitive programming languages, posit making as a very promising research area to support learning processes, especially towards the acquisition of 21st-century learning competences. Collecting learning evidence via rigorous multidimensional and multidisciplinary case studies will allow us to better understand and improve the value of making and the role of the various digital and physical spaces. Drawing from our experience with a recent workshop that used making as a pathway to foster joyful engagement and creativity in learning (Make2Learn), we present the developments, as well as the four selected contributions of this special issue. The paper further draws attention to the great potential and need for research in the area of making to enable entertaining, and engaging, and learning.",Giannakos M.; Divitini M.; Iversen O.,Journal,Entertainment Computing,2017-06-01,Aarhus Universitet;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Constructionist ;  Creativity ;  Entertainment technologies ;  Knowledge construction ;  Learning technologies ;  Maker movement ;  Technological fluency
The emergence of gastronomic engineering,"Modern consumers increasingly derive their foods from away-from-home sources. Rising incomes, the emergence of chefs as innovative actors in the food scene, and the growing consumer demand for culinary experiences, are the main driving forces behind haute cuisine. At the same time, food engineering is in urgent need to expand its scope and engage in new collaborations and partnerships. Gastronomic engineering (GE) means using the vast body of knowledge accumulated in food engineering and food materials science to propel the curiosity and creativity of chefs to what is technologically feasible and environmentally sustainable. GE opens new opportunities for food engineering, a discipline that has been mostly oriented to the food processing industry. This article describes the emergence of GE or a new branch of food engineering, as a space of co-creation between chefs and food engineers in a university set-up. Our GE unit consists of an experimental kitchen headed by a chef, a food engineering area and a materials science laboratory. The impact of GE on academic activities (teaching and research) and outreach experiences is discussed.",Aguilera J.,Journal,Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies,2017-06-01,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,Chefs ;  Co-creation ;  Culinary ;  Food engineering ;  Gastronomy ;  Innovation ;  Kitchen ;  Molecular gastronomy ;  Restaurant
Gender effects in research evaluation,"The paper contributes to the literature on gender gap in research investigating whether there is a gender gap in research evaluation. We use detailed data on 180,000 research papers evaluated during the Italian national research assessment (VQR 2004–2010) conducted by the Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes (Anvur). The data are merged with information on individual researchers and characteristics of referees. The most important empirical finding is that there is a significant gender gap in research evaluation. The gap is reduced once we control for researchers’ characteristics, such as age and academic rank, but is almost unaffected by the characteristics of the research output (monographs, journal articles, book chapters, etc.), co-authorships, international collaborations. Childbearing and maternity leaves do not account for the remaining gap in research evaluation. The evaluation method (peer review or bibliometric analysis) and the referee mix (whether men or women) do not disadvantage women. Analysis of a random sample of papers evaluated using bibliometric indicators and peer review reveals that bibliometric evaluation proves to be more favourable to women than peer review evaluation.",Jappelli T.; Nappi C.; Torrini R.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-06-01,Agenzia per la Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e Della Ricerca;Banca d'Italia;Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,Bibliometric analysis ;  Gender gap ;  Maternity leaves ;  Peer review ;  Research evaluation
Making a marriage of materials: The role of gatekeepers and shepherds in the absorption of external knowledge and innovation performance,"Through interviews and a large-scale survey of R&D scientists and engineers, this paper explores individuals’ attempts to absorb external knowledge, focusing on their efforts to identify and assimilate external knowledge and promote its utilization. Extant research does not explicitly address whether individuals should better specialize in certain absorption efforts or rather work as generalists dedicated to a range of efforts. We suggest that assimilation efforts increase the value of individuals’ efforts at external search and at promoting the utilization of external knowledge, which culminates in two main absorption roles that can help individuals achieve greater innovation performance. We argue that gatekeepers who combine external search with assimilation effort help to achieve innovation by contributing to building potential absorptive capacity, while shepherds who combine assimilation with utilization effort aid innovation by building realized absorptive capacity. We find support for these predictions and discuss the implications for research and managerial practice in open innovation.",Ter Wal A.; Criscuolo P.; Salter A.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-06-01,"University of Bath, School of Management;Imperial College Business School",Absorptive capacity ;  Assimilation ;  Gatekeepers ;  Knowledge integration ;  Shepherds

Automotive software engineering: A systematic mapping study,"The automotive industry is going through a fundamental change by moving from a mechanical to a software-intensive industry in which most innovation and competition rely on software engineering competence. Over the last few decades, the importance of software engineering in the automotive industry has increased significantly and has attracted much attention from both scholars and practitioners. A large body-of-knowledge on automotive software engineering has accumulated in several scientific publications, yet there is no systematic analysis of that knowledge. This systematic mapping study aims to classify and analyze the literature related to automotive software engineering in order to provide a structured body-of-knowledge, identify well-established topics and potential research gaps. The review includes 679 articles from multiple research sub-area, published between 1990 and 2015. The primary studies were analyzed and classified with respect to five different dimensions. Furthermore, potential research gaps and recommendations for future research are presented. Three areas, namely system/software architecture and design, qualification testing, and reuse were the most frequently addressed topics in the literature. There were fewer comparative and validation studies, and the literature lacks practitioner-oriented guidelines.

How resource information backgrounds trigger post-merger integration and technology innovation? A dynamic analysis of resource similarity and complementarity,"Overseas mergers and acquisitions (M&A) proposed by companies from emerging economies have been aiming to secure outward technology sourcing from developed countries in order to improve their technology innovation abilities in recent years. This paper proposes a comprehensive analytical framework of post-merger integration’s influence on technology innovation by global game modeling. We show how different resource similarity and resource complementarity backgrounds of the acquirer and target companies can affect post-merger strategies and technology innovation output through multi-stage analysis with an asymmetrical payoff structure. We focus on two main dimensions of post-merger integration, which are integration degree and target autonomy. Equilibrium analysis that is based on potential innovation output signals show that resource similarity has a positive relation with integration and a negative relation with target autonomy in overseas M&A; however, resource complementarity has the opposite effects compared with resource similarity. The positive interaction between resource similarity and complementarity will trigger more M&A and increase the degrees of integration and autonomy; M&A integration has a positive impact on technology innovation output. The innovation growth of the acquiring company is affected by the effectiveness of the post-merger process and the interaction of substitution elasticity with resource potential difference. Our study provides insight into the factors driving post-merger decisions and contributes to a multi-stage resource-based understanding of technology innovation induced by overseas post-merger integration.",Chen F.; Meng Q.; Li F.,Journal,Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory,2017-06-01,"School of Economics, Zhejiang University",Post-merger integration ;  Resource complementarity ;  Resource similarity ;  Technology innovation

Enterprise Resource Planning system continuance usage intention at an individual level: An approach from value perspective,"User's continuance usage plays a critical role in determining ERP success. However, previous studies related to continuance usage tend to focus on factors that drive continuance usage and few studies consider factors that could reduce user's continuance intention. This research is aimed to explain user's continuance usage intention by identifying factors that can increase and reduce user continuance intention, using utilitarian value concept. Utilitarian value is defined as value of the system related to its capability to accomplish task-related benefit. A number of individual benefits such as decision making improvement, task innovation, productivity improvement are considered as a set of constructs in benefit dimension that could increase utilitarian value of ERP. Psychological cost is considered as a sacrifice that could decrease utilitarian value of ERP usage. Data was collected from two companies in Indonesia. Results of this study show that decision making improvement, task innovation, productivity improvement, and psychological cost significantly influence the utilitarian value of ERP usage. Moreover, utilitarian value has a significant impact on user continuance usage intention in the context of ERP systems.",Rizana A.; Govindaraju R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2016 International Conference on Data and Software Engineering, ICoDSE 2016",2017-05-30,Institut Teknologi Bandung,Benefit ;  Continuance usage ;  ERP success ;  ERP systems ;  Intention ;  Sacrifice ;  Utilitarian value

Sustainability and innovation in the automotive sector: A structured content analysis,"This study aims to analyse the scientific literature on sustainability and innovation in the automotive sector in the last 13 years. The research is classified as descriptive and exploratory. The process presented 31 articles in line with the research topic in the Scopus database. The bibliometric analysis identified the most relevant articles, authors, keywords, countries, research centers and journals for the subject from 2004 to 2016 in the Industrial Engineering domain. We concluded, through the systemic analysis, that the automotive sector is well structured on the issue of sustainability and process innovation. Innovations in the sector are of the incremental process type, due to the lower risk, lower costs and less complexity. However, the literature also points out that radical innovations are needed in order to fit the prevailing environmental standards. The selected studies show that environmental practices employed in the automotive sector are: the minimization of greenhouse gas emissions, life-cycle assessment, cleaner production, reverse logistics and eco-innovation. Thus, it displays the need for empirical studies in automotive companies on the environmental practices employed and how these practices impact innovation.",Vaz C.; Shoeninger Rauen T.; Rojas Lezana á.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2017-05-23,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,Automotive industry ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability
A CRISPR New World: Attitudes in the Public toward Innovations in Human Genetic Modification,"The potential to genetically modify human germlines has reached a critical tipping point with recent applications of CRISPR-Cas9. Even as researchers, clinicians, and ethicists weigh the scientific and ethical repercussions of these advances, we know virtually nothing about public attitudes on the topic. Understanding such attitudes will be critical to determining the degree of broad support there might be for any public policy or regulation developed for genetic modification research. To fill this gap, we gave an online survey to a large (2,493 subjects) and diverse sample of Americans. Respondents supported genetic modification research, although demographic variables influenced these attitudes—conservatives, women, African-Americans, and older respondents, while supportive, were more cautious than liberals, men, other ethnicities, and younger respondents. Support was also was slightly muted when the risks (unanticipated mutations and possibility of eugenics) were made explicit. The information about genetic modification was also presented as contrasting vignettes, using one of five frames: genetic editing, engineering, hacking, modification, or surgery. Despite the fact that the media and academic use of frames describing the technology varies, these frames did not influence people’s attitudes. These data contribute a current snapshot of public attitudes to inform policy with regard to human genetic modification.",Weisberg S.; Badgio D.; Chatterjee A.,Journal,Frontiers in Public Health,2017-05-22,University of Pennsylvania,CRISPR ;  genetic modification ;  Mechanical Turk ;  metaphor ;  online survey

Review on 2R1T 3-DOF parallel mechanisms,"Mechanisms are the skeletons and end-effectors of manufacturing equipments. The innovation of mechanism is indispensable to the independent innovation of manufacturing equipments. Compared with serial industrial manipulators, parallel mechanisms offer high rigidity, good dynamic response, potential high accuracy and large payload capability with the price of less dexterity, complex distribution of singular configurations and limited workspace. Over the last two decades, lower-mobility parallel mechanisms whose degrees of freedom (DOF) are fewer than six have been successfully implemented in many applications like positioning, orientation, and axis-symmetrical machining, which do not reqiure all six DOFs. With the well optimized architecture of a lower-mobility parallel mechanism, the reduced cost of fabrication, actuation, control and maintenance can be obtained compared with their 6-DOF counterparts. The 2R1T (R: rotation, T: translation) 3-DOF parallel mechanisms are most typical examples of successful applications in advanced manufacturing equipments such as parallel kinematic machine, industrial robot, and articulated tool head. Based on the relative geometrical relations between the two axes of rotation, the 2R1T 3-DOF parallel mechanism is classified into four categories: UP, PU, RPR and P*U*. The motion of the moving platform of a UP (U: universal joint, P: prismatic joint) parallel mechanism can be generated by a UP serial chain, including a rotation about a fixed axis, a rotation about a moving axis perpendicular to the fixed one, and a translation along the normal of the two axes. The motion of the moving platform of a PU parallel mechanism can be generated by a PU serial chain, including a rotation about an orientation-fixed axis, a rotation about a moving axis perpendicular to the orientation-fixed one, and a translation perpendicular to the orientation-fixed one. The motion of the moving platform of a RPR parallel mechanism can be generated by a RPR serial chain, including a rotation about a fixed axis near the base, a translation perpendicular to the fixed revolute axis and a rotation about a moving axis perpendicular to the orientation-fixed one. When the orientation and position of the two rotational axes of a 2R1T parallel mechanism are time varying, the motion of the moving platform cannot be modeled by a 3-DOF serial chain and is denoted by a virtual serial chain P*U*. The current research status of study on type synthesis, performance analysis and dimensional synthesis of the UP, PU, RPR and P*U* parallel mechanisms are reviewed and discussed. It is worth noting that despite the fact that many well-acknowledged progresses have been obtained by Chinese researchers in type synthesis, kinematic analysis and synthesis of lower-mobility parallel mechanisms, there is still a lack of basic principles and methods for selecting the architectures with engineering potentials from the massive outputs of type synthesis. This is an important challenge that the Chinese researchers in the fundamental research area of parallel mechanisms must face to support the self-innovation of manufacturing equipments. In addition, there are many open problems concerning rigid-flexible coupled dynamic design, accuracy calibration, and control of 2R1T 3-DOF parallel mechanisms, which require an immediate deployment of systematic and thorough research.",Li Q.; Chai X.; Chen Q.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2017-05-15,Zhejiang Sci-Tech University,Dimensional synthesis ;  Parallel mechanism ;  Performance index ;  Screw theory ;  Type synthesis
Engineering philosophy and design scheme of gully land consolidation in Loess Plateau,"Loess Plateau used to be the area with the most serious erosion in China even world. Erosion area in Loess Plateau was up to 454 000 km2, accounting for 70% of the total area in the 1990s. Extremely intensive erosion area with erosion modulus more than 8 000 t/(km2·a) was up to 85 000 km2, accounting for 64% of the similar areas in China. Severe erosion area with erosion modulus more than 15 000 t/(km2·a) was up to 37 000 km2, accounting for 89% of the similar areas in China. Since 1998, Grain-for-Green Project has been implemented in the Loess Plateau. With the advancement of Grain-for-Green Project, forested land and grassland increase, and farmland decreases. Besides, as the population grows, Grain-for-Green Project has negative effects on grain production in some regions, and the population-grain conflict is intensified. In Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, farmland decreased by 74 000 hm2, grain production decreased by 156 000 t, and per capita grain production decreased by 132 kg with an increase of the residential population of 260 000 compared with those prior to the implementation of the project. With the further intensification of the conflict between population and grain, the demand for new agricultural production space is increasing. After decades of implementing Grain-for-Green, the vegetation cover rate increases and the erosion decreases greatly, which creates preconditions for gully land consolidation. Local initiatives of gully land consolidation since 2012 have achieved initial success. Gully land consolidation creates new space for agricultural and rural development. But how to design and plan the gully land consolidation engineering at a large scale and thus make it be approved by the central government needs systematic thinking and research. Taking Yan'an City, Shaanxi Province as a case study, this paper introduces the basic concepts of the gully land consolidation and its enhanced design in the Loess Plateau. Taking ""farmland increasement, ecological protection, people's livelihood guarantee"" as the theme, and ""landscape coordination, structure stability, sustainable land use, effective function"" as the concepts, the project highlights the land use zoning, which can be described in detail as ""returning farmland to forest on the mountain, consolidating gully to farmland in the valley"", and put the emphasis on protecting ecological environment and benefiting local residents' livelihood. In the step of planning and design, the zoning, classification standards and key techniques of gully land consolidation are identified, and 4 project construction types are proposed, which are restoration-type consolidation, facilities-type consolidation, exploitation- type consolidation, and comprehensive management-type consolidation. Furthermore, the enhanced consolidation technology system is also created, which involves ""mainstream-tributary-capillary flow"" tiered prevention and control technology, ""canal-embankment-dam"" matching system, and ""tree-shrub-grass"" scientific collocation. Since the implementation of the major project of more than 2 years, it has generated economic, social and ecological benefits to some extent. To further exert the project's comprehensive benefits, the next 4 major projects need be adopted, namely new rural communities and residential resettlement project, urban and rural equalization of services and service facilities engineering, modern agriculture industrialization base construction, and rural land capitalization and land system innovation.",Liu Y.; Li Y.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2017-05-15,"Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences",Agricultural engineering ;  Agricultural geography engineering ;  Consolidation ;  Gully land ;  Land use ;  Loess plateau ;  Yan'an city
"Semiotic engineering as a reflexive, transdisciplinary and humanistic theory in and beyond HCI","Since the early 1990's Semiotic Engineering has evolved from a semiotic-based approach to user interface languages design to a comprehensive theory of Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI). More recently, in 2016, Semiotic Engineering went beyond HCI and gave initial contributions to the field of Human-Centered Computing. This chapter presents three aspects that can be interpreted as constants in the process of permanent evolution of this theory: Reflexivity, Transdisciplinarity, and Humanistic values. The stimulus and support to engagement in critical reasoning about research and practice; the development of a distinct and transdisciplinary object of study examined in light of its own ontology and methodology; and the role of human meanings and values in the theory are discussed as drivers of innovation and transformation. These key factors can serve as supporting analytical categories in discussions around Semiotic Engineering and its contributions, as well as in the learning process of the theory.",Leitão C.,Book,Conversations Around Semiotic Engineering,2017-05-09,Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro,

Creating the learning situation to promote student deep learning: Data analysis and application case,"How to lead students to deeper learning and cultivate engineering innovative talents need to be studied for higher engineering education. In this study, through the survey data analysis and theoretical research, we discuss the correlation of teaching methods, learning motivation, and learning methods. In this research, we find that students have different motivation orientation according to the perception of teaching methods in the process of engineering education, and this affects their choice of learning methods. As a result, creating situations is critical to lead students to deeper learning. Finally, we analyze the process of learning situational creation in the teaching process of «bidding and contract management workshops». In this creation process, teachers use the student-centered teaching to lead students to deeper study. Through the study of influence factors of deep learning process, and building the teaching situation for the purpose of promoting deep learning, this thesis provide a meaningful reference for enhancing students' learning quality, teachers' teaching quality and the quality of innovation talent.",Guo Y.; Wu S.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2017-05-08,Tianjin University of Technology,deep learning ;  questionnaire ;  situation creation ;  teaching methods

Inbodied interaction: 3 things you need to know about how your body works to lead HCI innovation,"From Ergonomics to Embodied interaction, the body is a fundamental locus of interaction in HCI research and design. In HCI the body and all its awesome complexity, however, is largely treated as a black box where we focus on designing around the constraints of its input and output. If we understand, for instance, how sleep affects ability to see errors, or how stress suppresses creativity or affects recall, or how social interaction with movement enhances insight, we can immediately begin to explore new kinds of design challenges to help us perform better from general to specific contexts: how would we design a tool that identifies sleep and stress patterns to prompt counterintuitive but beneficial increase of social engagement prior to a critical deadline, for instance? In this course we explore how, by cracking the lid of the body black box via three accessible heuristics, we can address these new kinds of questions to enable us to innovate better designs for human performance and enhanced quality of life for all.",Schraefel M.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2017-05-06,University of Southampton,Creativity ;  Design ;  Embodied ;  Human performance ;  Inbodied interaction ;  Neurology ;  Performance ;  Physiology
Research ethics in HCI a town hall meeting,"As interactive technologies evolve and reach into every aspect of modern life, research practices in human-computer interaction (HCI) have changed. The methodological and epistemological foundations of the field are shifting to reflect the diversity of contexts in which rapidly changing digital technology is being used. Alongside these changes, new ethical challenges emerge for the HCI community, both in terms of research ethics and responsible research and innovation. Open dilemmas include issues such as the shifting meaning of informed consent, anonymisation or privacy in an always-online world. The SIGCHI Ethics Committee has been established to look into the processes, practices and structures at SIGCHI venues to deal with such ethical dilemmas and how they can be addressed in a transparent, consistent and open way. This town hall style panel will be an opportunity to prompt community discussion and collect input into how we can further address these challenges.",Frauenberger C.; Densmore M.; Bruckman A.; Waycott J.; Munteanu C.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2017-05-06,University of Melbourne;Georgia Institute of Technology;Technische Universität Wien;University of Toronto;University of Cape Town,Ethics ;  HCI

Refugees & HCI workshop: The role of HCI in responding to the refugee crisis,"Over 21 million refugees are residing in camps, journeying through Europe or resettling in new countries [19]. The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis calls for technological innovation in addressing the challenges being faced by refugees and humanitarian aid stakeholders. At our CHI 2016 Special Interest Group (SIG) on Refugees and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) [17], HCI researchers expressed interest in exploring the difficulties faced by refugees and having a participatory approach when addressing these difficulties. Additionally, further consideration is needed regarding the methodological, organizational and practical challenges in working with refugee communities. Accordingly, this one-day workshop followed by a day of informal meetings with stakeholders aims to (1) explore research methods that can be adapted and applied to refugee contexts and to (2) formulate a research agenda for future work. Participants will be joined by members of organizations that engage with refugees in Denver and be presented with testimonials from refugees in order to develop a research agenda.",Talhouk R.; Vlachokyriakos V.; Weibert A.; Aal K.; Ahmed S.; Fisher K.; Wulf V.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2017-05-06,Universität Siegen;University of Washington;Cornell University;Open Lab,Ethics ;  Methods ;  Refugees ;  Research agenda
"Aging, HCI, & personal perceptions of time","While aging has become an influential area of research in HCI, the science of human longevity presents itself as an untapped framework through which HCI researchers may further investigate. The present work presents preliminary research on older adults' personal perception of time in context with their personal perception of technology. Researchers worked to thus investigate the underlying socioemotional effects of technology during the aging process. Initial results suggest research opportunities in regards to HCI's awareness of and potential influence upon personal perception of 'time'. Beginning with a sample of older adults previously interested in technical innovation, we point to (1) the processes behind intention to learn about novel technologies and (2) personal perception of 'time' or longevity coinciding with said investment. We pose questions and aim to inspire discussion and future investigations into time as a foundation for self-reflection and perception.",Loup J.; Subasi Ö.; Fitzpatrick G.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2017-05-06,Technische Universität Wien,Aging ;  Perception ;  Perception ;  Reflective practice ;  Socioemotional ;  Temporal experience ;  Time

Breaking down silos: Involving various researchers for driving HCI research,"Ethical, legal and social implications of HCI research require a safe system for encouraging rational dialogue between ICT and social sciences and humanities researchers. However, involving researchers from various fields remains challenging, owing to the silo formed by researchers' diversified values. The authors are forming an interdisciplinary network, called Acceptable Intelligence with Responsibility (AIR), to build a prototype system that will help researchers become aware of different senses of values, to preventively deepen their discussions.

Detecting Symmetries in Mechanical Assembly Model,"The symmetry information of model is necessary for product innovation design and engineering analysis. However, the existing symmetry detection research for mechanical assembly model is not enough. Therefore, an approach to detecting intra-part symmetry, inter-part symmetry and global symmetry in mechanical assembly model is proposed. Firstly, the feature-manager design tree is traversed to get all parts, which are classified into part sets according to duplicate relations and part surface attributes, for an assembly model. Then the part sets are sorted on the basis of their part numbers to improve symmetry combining efficiency. Next, the feature information within the model is made use of to detect intra-part symmetry and acquire rotational axis and reflectional plane of symmetry. Then the rotation, reflection and translation symmetry among parts can be detected according to centroid and bounding box of the parts. Finally, the global symmetry of an assembly model could be derived after symmetry merging inside and among the part sets. Experimental results show that our method is capable of detecting the intra-part symmetry, the inter-part symmetry and the global symmetry of assembly model accurately.",Hua S.; Li X.; Bai M.,Journal,Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering,2017-05-05,Dalian University of Technology,Assembly model ;  Global symmetry ;  Inter-part symmetry ;  Intra-part symmetry ;  Part sets classification ;  Symmetry merging
"The Role of Leadership in Innovation: A quantitative analysis of a large data set examines the relationship between organizational culture, leadership behaviors, and innovativeness.","OVERVIEW: Organizational and corporate culture clearly play a role in innovation effectiveness, but little work has been done to explore the exact nature of that relationship. To address that gap, the IRI Research-on-Research working group on Innovation Culture analyzed data from the Center for Creative Leadership’s KEYS to Creativity and Innovation survey. Key conclusions include that while challenging work is important in all organizations, the importance of organizational encouragement and work group support differs by organizational factors. The impact of organizational encouragement is most pronounced for organizations with low-control, high-support, or high–risk-aversion cultures. Work group support, while important across all segments studied, has less effect than challenging work or organizational encouragement. This information can be used by managers to drive more effective innovation in the context of an organization’s particular cultural characteristics.",Dodge R.; Dwyer J.; Witzeman S.; Neylon S.; Taylor S.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2017-05-04,,Innovation culture ;  Innovation leadership ;  Talent management
Creating and Capturing Value Through Sustainability: The Sustainable Value Analysis ToolA new tool helps companies discover opportunities to create and capture value through sustainability.,"OVERVIEW: Recent research and practice have shown that business model innovation can be one way to create and capture new value and drive production and consumption toward sustainability. However, business model tools typically do not create a space to consider how sustainability concerns may be integrated into the innovation process. To address this gap, this article describes a tool that can help companies identify new opportunities to create and capture value through sustainability by analyzing value captured and uncaptured for key stakeholders across the product life cycle. The Sustainable Value Analysis Tool is shown to help companies recognize value uncaptured and turn it into opportunities; it facilitates sustainability-focused business model innovation by identifying value uncaptured—and hence, opportunities for innovation—associated with environmental and social sustainability in production, use, and disposal.",Yang M.; Vladimirova D.; Evans S.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2017-05-04,University of Cambridge,Business model innovation ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainability-focused innovation ;  Sustainable Value Analysis Tool

Identifying experts in the crowd for evaluation of engineering designs,"Crowdsourcing offers the opportunity to gather evaluations on concept designs from evaluators that otherwise may not have been considered, thus leveraging additional expertise to improve decision making during early stages of the design process. Previous research has shown that crowdsourcing may fail to evaluate correctly even ‘simple’ engineering design concepts, because non-expert evaluations overwhelm the entire crowd evaluation. This article proposes using expertise prediction heuristics to automatically identify experts and filter non-experts prior to a crowdsourced evaluation. We conducted an experiment to test four common expertise prediction heuristics: (1) evaluator demographics, (2) evaluation reaction time, (3) mechanical reasoning aptitude, and (4) ‘easy and known’ versions of the actual ‘difficult and unknown’ design evaluation task. The results show statistical significance between variables for all four heuristics; however, most predictive power is garnered going from easy to difficult tasks. A combination of these heuristics offers a practical way to identify and filter experts from non-experts, thus improving crowdsourced evaluation of early-stage design concepts.",Burnap A.; Gerth R.; Gonzalez R.; Papalambros P.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Design,2017-05-04,"The United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Ground Vehicle Systems Center;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",crowdsourcing ;  Design evaluation ;  expertise identification ;  open innovation
The best laid plans: Educational innovation in elementary teacher generated integrated STEM lesson plans,"Students need to be prepared for the 21st century by developing the literacy skills necessary for participating in the age of synthesis—an age that requires a progressive set of skills and knowledge. The authors identified nine educational innovations that are perceived to be effective for preparing students for the 21st century age of synthesis society. They coded a collection of 39 teacher-generated Grade 3–5 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) lesson plans to document the extent to which the teachers included these nine educational innovations their STEM lesson planning. The authors found practices such as project-based and student-centered learning (which are common established approaches to teaching STEM) to be strongly represented in the plans, whereas practices such as family involvement and place-based learning (which have not been traditionally used in STEM instruction) were less evident in the plans. In their discussion they explore the implications for STEM teaching, and potential directions for future research.",Sias C.; Nadelson L.; Juth S.; Seifert A.,Journal,Journal of Educational Research,2017-05-04,Utah State University;Colorado Mesa University;Idaho National Laboratory,Curricular choice ;  innovation ;  instructional practices ;  lesson plans ;  STEM
Student-centred strategies to integrate theoretical knowledge into project development within architectural technology lecture-based modules,"This article presents methods and findings resulting from a project for innovation in architectural engineering education. The project aimed to encourage students to successfully integrate theoretical knowledge on architectural technology into project development within lecture-based modules. This type of integration has been possible in past experiences within design studio modules; however, little research can be found about lecture-based modules. The student-centred strategies proposed here were guided by Bigg’s constructive alignment and focused on promoting advanced learning levels. They comprised interconnected activities and learning-oriented assessment methods, which proved to strengthen students’ skills for effective autonomous and collaborative learning. The teaching methods used included inverted class, peer learning and role play. The evaluation of the project was supported by SPSS and ATLAS.ti tools. This experience was set within a Colombian university, where increasing student numbers, cross-university competition and limited resources present several challenges. Findings could be of significance for curricular development or the promotion of good teaching practices.",Rodriguez Bernal C.,Journal,Architectural Engineering and Design Management,2017-05-04,"Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia",Architectural engineering education ;  architectural technology ;  collaborative learning ;  problem-based learning ;  student-centred

"Supporting cultures of making: Technology, policy, visions, and myths","Recent HCI research has linked social policy to design, e.g., in issues such as public safety, privacy, and social justice. One area where policy, technology, and design intersect is in the vision of the creative economy. In that vision, creativity, distinct local/regional cultural practices, technology, and entrepreneurship synergistically produce social innovation on a scale sufficient to drive economies. Culture and creative industries (CCI) policy specifies how governments intervene to support such clusters. Maker cultures are seen as central to this vision, but comparatively little is known about how makers produce culture. We offer a critical analysis of several encounters between CCI policy in Taiwan and its maker scene. These encounters reveal misalignments that undercut efforts intended to support making. We propose that supporting any creative culture, including making, entails a serious commitment to understanding its culture, including its cultural contents and their means of production. We further argue that scholarly rigor in cultivating cultural appreciation is just as fundamental as scholarly rigor in empirically representing cultural practices when it comes to pursuing such a cultural understanding.

UX design innovation: Challenges for working with machine learning as a design material,"Machine learning (ML) is now a fairly established technology, and user experience (UX) designers appear regularly to integrate ML services in new apps, devices, and systems. Interestingly, this technology has not experienced a wealth of design innovation that other technologies have, and this might be because it is a new and difficult design material. To better understand why we have witnessed little design innovation, we conducted a survey of current UX practitioners with regards to how new ML services are envisioned and developed in UX practice. Our survey probed on how ML may or may not have been a part of their UX design education, on how they work to create new things with developers, and on the challenges they have faced working with this material. We use the findings from this survey and our review of related literature to present a series of challenges for UX and interaction design research and education. Finally, we discuss areas where new research and new curriculum might help our community unlock the power of design thinking to re-imagine what ML might be and might do.",Dove G.; Halskov K.; Forlizzi J.; Zimmerman J.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2017-05-02,Aarhus Universitet;Carnegie Mellon University,Design material ;  Interaction design ;  Machine learning ;  UX practice

Genetic engineering represents a safe approach for innovations improving nutritional contents of major food crops,"About 70 years ago early microbial genetic research revealed that inherited phenotypic traits become determined by DNA filaments composed of 4 different nucleotides that are linearly arranged. In the meantime we know that genes, the determinants of specific life functions, are genomic segments of an average size of about 1000 nucleotides, i.e. a very small part of a genome. Fundamental insights into the structures and functions of selected genes can be reached by sorting out the relevant short DNA segment, splicing this fragment into a natural gene vector such as a viral genome or a fertility plasmid. This allows the researchers to transfer the genetic hybrid into an appropriate host cell in order to produce many copies that can then serve for functional and structural analysis. This research approach became efficient in the 1970s. On the request of involved researchers, safety guidelines became proposed 1975 at the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA (Berg, Baltimore, Brenner, Roblin, & Singer, 1975), then generally introduced and still largely followed nowadays. Carefully carried out genetic engineering by horizontally transferring a selected and functionally well known DNA segment into the genome of another organism has in many published biosafety investigations never shown any unexpected harmful effect. We will present below selected examples of research contributions enabling innovations for the benefit of human life conditions.",Arber W.,Journal,Journal of Innovation and Knowledge,2017-05-01,Universität Basel,Biotechnology ;  Genetic engineering ;  Genetically modified (GM) ;  Hunger
Stem cell culture and differentiation in microfluidic devices toward organ-on-a-chip,"Microfluidic lab-on-a-chip provides a new platform with unique advantages to mimic complex physiological microenvironments in vivo and has been increasingly exploited to stem cell research. In this review, we highlight recent advances of microfluidic devices for stem-cell culture and differentiation toward the development of organ-on-a-chip, especially with an emphasis on vital innovations within the last 2 years. Various aspects for improving on-chip stem cell culture and differentiation, particularly toward organ-on-a-chip, are discussed, along with microenvironment control, surface modification, extracellular scaffolds, high throughput and stimuli. The combination of microfluidic technologies and stem cells hold great potential toward versatile systems of 'organ-on-a-chip' as desired. Stem cells, capable of self-renewing and differentiating into cells of various tissue types, are drawing more and more attention for their enormous potential in many clinically associated applications that include drug screening, disease modeling and regenerative medicine. Conventional cell culture methods, however, have proven to be difficult to mimic in vivo like microenvironments and to provide a number of well-controlled stimuli that are critical for stem cell culture and differentiation.

Energy conscious deterministic self-healing new generation wireless sensor network: smart WSN using the Aatral framework,"It is expected that in the next year, over a billion wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes will be deployed throughout the world, constituting a wide variety of sensor applications. In such a domain, management of the randomly distributed sensor networks is complicated by issues such as knowledge of energy consumption and coverage, extended lifetimes and demands for improved quality of service parameters. Several researchers have addressed these issues through their own innovations and discoveries of different schemes, methods, techniques or mathematical models and architectures or applications, using a variety of node designs. This in turn, has lead to multiple different choices of hardware and software options. However, this has not simplified the process of setting up application testbeds considering energy consumption. There is no readily available solution for setting up a WSN with user selected profiles and parameters. Multiple communication protocols, routing protocols, signal calibration and propagation methods, data aggregation schemes, clustering formations with multiple variations have been proposed for different research objectives. This paper proposes a method for consolidating all the initiatives and integrating these in a service panel framework that helps manage the desired WSN with options to set up an individual WSN profile and supporting the energy engineering processes involved in the WSN.",Thangaraj M.; Anuradha S.,Journal,Wireless Networks,2017-05-01,Madurai Kamaraj University,Application testbed ;  Energy auditing ;  Energy engineering ;  Energy harvesting ;  Wireless sensor network
New advances in probing cell-extracellular matrix interactions,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides structural and biochemical support to cells within tissues. An emerging body of evidence has established that the ECM plays a key role in cell mechanotransduction-the study of coupling between mechanical inputs and cellular phenotype-through either mediating transmission of forces to the cells, or presenting mechanical cues that guide cellular behaviors. Recent progress in cell mechanotransduction research has been facilitated by advances of experimental tools, particularly microtechnologies, engineered biomaterials, and imaging and analytical methods. Microtechnologies have enabled the design and fabrication of controlled physical microenvironments for the study and measurement of cell-ECM interactions. Advances in engineered biomaterials have allowed researchers to develop synthetic ECMs that mimic tissue microenvironments and investigate the impact of altered physicochemical properties on various cellular processes. Finally, advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques have facilitated the visualization of the complex interaction between cells and ECM in vitro and in living tissues. This review will highlight the application of recent innovations in these areas to probing cell-ECM interactions.

Analysis on the value innovation of product art design based on the cost and function,"With the development of the modern science and technology, the connotation and extension of the innovation management of products can be continuously enriched and deepened. Product art design is an important part of the product innovation management and also the important means and ways of product value innovation. The control of product cost, the planning of function and the rationality of design are the important factors that affect the value of the product, but in the existing research theory and development practice, the three can't achieve the effective integration. Based on this, under the constraint of cost control and function, how to implement the art of product innovation design to enhance the product value was studied in this paper.",Liu J.; Liu H.,Journal,Agro Food Industry Hi-Tech,2017-05-01,Wuhan University of Technology;Wuhan Technical College of Communications,Art design ;  Cost control ;  Functional planning

Briefing: Resource scarcity and resource security - A suppressed civil engineering challenge,"While natural and manufactured resources provide the raw materials with which civil engineers work, the term 'resources' should always be considered in its wider interpretation and then in the context that resources are in many cases limited. That they should be used wisely (resource efficiency) is beyond contention - we do this as a matter of course - yet considerations of where and how resources are obtained and refined for use are far less likely to feature in a civil engineer's psyche. Similarly, considerations of resource availability for others now, and importantly in the future, and the vulnerability of these resources to future supply disruption (e.g. for geopolitical reasons) are likely not to be in the forefront of our thinking when conducting our routine business. The ICE Research, Development & Innovation towards Engineering Excellence panel has chosen this topic as one of pressing importance across all the sectors that comprise civil engineering. Accordingly, the panel is promoting this topic for Research & Development Enabling Fund (R&DEF) proposals. This briefing note describes the prior work of the panel in exploring the extent of this issue, along with insights from current research, to raise awareness, encourage R&DEF proposals and prime debates on this topic.",Rogers C.; Hunt D.; Leach J.; Purnell P.; Roelich K.,Journal,Proceedings of Institution of Civil Engineers: Waste and Resource Management,2017-05-01,University of Birmingham;University of Leeds,Natural resources ;  Recycling & reuse of materials ;  Waste management & disposal
Computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery,"Nowadays, operating rooms can be inefficient and overcrowded. Patient data and images are at times not well integrated and displayed in a timely fashion. This lack of coordination may cause further reductions in efficiency, jeopardize patient safety, and increase costs. Fortunately, technology has much to offer the surgical disciplines and the ongoing and recent operating room innovations have advanced preoperative planning and surgical procedures by providing visual, navigational, and mechanical computerized assistance. The field of computer-assisted surgery (CAS) broadly refers to surgical interface between surgeons and machines. It is also part of the ongoing initiatives to move away from invasive to less invasive or even noninvasive procedures. CAS can be applied preoperatively, intraoperatively, and/or postoperatively to improve the outcome of orthopaedic surgical procedures as it has the potential for greater precision, control, and flexibility in carrying out surgical tasks, and enables much better visualization of the operating field than conventional methods have afforded. CAS is an active research discipline, which brings together orthopaedic practitioners with traditional technical disciplines such as engineering, computer science, and robotics. However, to achieve the best outcomes, teamwork, open communication, and willingness to adapt and adopt new skills and processes are critical. Because of the relatively short time period over which CAS has developed, long-term follow-up studies have not yet been possible. Consequently, this review aims to outline current CAS applications, limitations, and promising future developments that will continue to impact the operating room (OR) environment and the OR in the future, particularly within orthopedic and spine surgery.",Hernandez D.; Garimella R.; Eltorai A.; Daniels A.,Journal,Orthopaedic Surgery,2017-05-01,The Warren Alpert Medical School,Computer-assistance ;  Orthopaedic surgery ;  Spine surgery
Partnering to develop a talent pipeline for emerging health leaders in operations research,"In initiating its first central office for Quality Improvement (QI), The Scarborough Hospital (TSH) sought to accelerate momentum towards achieving its ""Quality and Sustainability"" strategic priority by building internal capacity in the emerging QI specialty of operations research. The Scarborough Hospital reviewed existing models of talent management in conjunction with Lean and improvement philosophies. Through simple guiding principles and in collaboration with the University of Toronto's Centre for Healthcare Engineering, TSH developed a targeted approach to talent management for Operations Research (OR) in the Office of Innovation and Performance Improvement, reduced the time from staffing need to onboarding, accelerated the development of new staff in delivering QI and OR projects, and defined new structures and processes to retain and develop this group of new emerging health leaders.",Ng A.; Henshaw C.; Carter M.,Journal,Healthcare Management Forum,2017-05-01,The Scarborough Hospital;University of Toronto,
Responsible research and innovation in the digital age,"Responsible research and innovation (RRI) aims to ensure that the processes and outcomes of research are aligned with societal values.The authors propose a context-specific and flexible framework AREA (Anticipate possible outcomes of research and innovation, Reflect on motivations, processes and products, Engage with relevant stakeholders, and Act accordingly to address issues revealed)for RRI in ICT to help researchers use it as a source of inspiration and creativity. The framework draws on such existing approaches to ICT development and provides a variety of scaffolding questions. Each aspect of the framework expands into deeper questions, suggesting literature, more detailed discussion, and problematization of a particular aspect of ICT innovation. The framework is meant to be adapted to the context in which researchers and other stakeholders find themselves. The idea is to productively 'open up' not 'close down' expert discourse. In sum, certain forms of practical self-reflection and self-criticism exist in ICT research and could be cultivated further under the extended AREA Plus framework. In this sense, U.K. Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC's) original AREA principles are a starting point for the reinvigoration and possible extension of a much more nuanced discourse with and within ICT research. By incorporating active considerations of alternate socio-technical futures into design, engaging with stakeholders, reflecting on process, product, and purpose, and putting people at the center of research and innovation, RRI may well provide inspiration and become a unique source of innovation and creativity.",Jirotka M.; Grimpe B.; Stahl B.; Eden G.; Hartswood M.,Journal,Communications of the ACM,2017-05-01,University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland;University of Oxford;Universität Klagenfurt;De Montfort University,

Design strategies and applications of nacre-based biomaterials,"The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine relies heavily on materials capable of implantation without significant foreign body reactions and with the ability to promote tissue differentiation and regeneration. The field of bone tissue engineering in particular requires materials capable of providing enhanced mechanical properties and promoting osteogenic cell lineage commitment. While bone repair has long relied almost exclusively on inorganic, calcium phosphate ceramics such as hydroxyapatite and their composites or on non-degradable metals, the organically derived shell and pearl nacre generated by mollusks has emerged as a promising alternative. Nacre is a naturally occurring composite material composed of inorganic, calcium carbonate plates connected by a framework of organic molecules. Similar to mammalian bone, the highly organized microstructure of nacre endows the composite with superior mechanical properties while the organic phase contributes to significant bioactivity. Studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have demonstrated nacre's biocompatibility, biodegradability, and osteogenic potential, which are superior to pure inorganic minerals such as hydroxyapatite or non-degradable metals. Nacre can be used directly as a bulk implant or as part of a composite material when combined with polymers or other ceramics. While nacre has demonstrated its effectiveness in multiple cell culture and animal models, it remains a relatively underexplored biomaterial. This review introduces the formation, structure, and characteristics of nacre, and discusses the present and future uses of this biologically-derived material as a novel biomaterial for orthopedic and other tissue engineering applications. Statement of Significance Mussel derived nacre, a biological composite composed of mineralized calcium carbonate platelets and interplatelet protein components, has recently gained interest as a potential alternative ceramic material in orthopedic biomaterials, combining the integration and mechanical capabilities of calcium phosphates with increased bioactivity derived from proteins and biomolecules; however, there is limited awareness of this material's potential. Herein, we present, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive review of nacre as a biomaterial. Nacre is a highly promising yet overlooked biomaterial for orthopedic tissue engineering with great potential in a wide variety of material systems. It is our hope that publication of this article will lead to increased community awareness of the potential of nacre as a versatile, bioactive ceramic capable of improving bone tissue regeneration and will elicit increased research effort and innovation utilizing nacre.",Gerhard E.; Wang W.; Li C.; Guo J.; Ozbolat I.; Rahn K.; Armstrong A.; Xia J.; Qian G.; Yang J.,Journal,Acta Biomaterialia,2017-05-01,Penn State College of Engineering;Penn State College of Medicine;Zhejiang Wanli University,Biomaterials ;  Bone ;  Nacre ;  Orthopedic ;  Pearl ;  Pearl powder ;  Tissue engineering

The dynamics of micro-conflicts and uncertainty in successful and unsuccessful design teams,"What differentiates successful from unsuccessful design teams? Building on new research on design innovation that emphasizes interactions between social and cognitive processes, we investigated a potential distinguishing feature: Successful design teams may harness interpersonal conflicts (a social design process) to mitigate uncertainty (a cognitive design process). We analyzed temporal relationships between brief, expressed interpersonal disagreements and subsequent spoken individual uncertainty in 30 h of conversations of 10 successful and 11 unsuccessful engineering product design teams. We discovered that micro-conflicts were followed by a relative reduction in uncertainty in successful design teams, whereas uncertainty rose after micro-conflicts in unsuccessful design teams, suggesting that interactions between conflict and uncertainty may be a differentiating factor for design team success.",Paletz S.; Chan J.; Schunn C.,Journal,Design Studies,2017-05-01,"School of Computer Science;University of Maryland, College Park;University of Pittsburgh",collaborative design ;  conflict ;  innovation ;  problem solving ;  teamwork
Top management team’s innovation-related characteristics and the firm’s explorative R&D: an analysis based on patent data,"This study investigates the relationship between characteristics of the firm’s top management team (TMT) and its research and development (R&D) activities. Specifically, this research analyzes how observable characteristics of the TMT, such as functional experiences or educational background, and average tenure affect the firm’s proportion of explorative R&D activities. From the perspective of the upper-echelon theory, we hypothesize that the TMT’s functional experiences with R&D or science or engineering educational backgrounds increase the firm’s tendency towards explorative R&D. Moreover, we propose that the average tenure of TMT members with innovation-related experiences would have a positive moderation effects on these relationships. The hypotheses are tested using a dataset containing biographical information of the TMT members, financial, and patent data of 89 firms in U.S. high-tech industries from 2006 to 2009. Firm’s explorative R&D activities are analyzed using data on patent citations, patent classes, and non-patent references. The empirical analysis shows that the top managers’ educational background in science or engineering as well as their previous functional experiences with R&D have a positive effect on the firm’s explorative innovation activities. We also find that the size of these effects increases with a longer tenure of these TMT members. Our findings provide implications related to the effects of organizational characteristics on the establishment of a R&D strategy and highlight the role of TMT members with innovative experiences in directing a firm’s R&D activities and outcomes.",Lee C.; Park G.; Marhold K.; Kang J.,Journal,Scientometrics,2017-05-01,Samsung SDS;Seoul National University,Exploration ;  Innovation ;  Patent analysis ;  R&D ;  Top management team
Epistemic Practices of Engineering for Education,"Engineering offers new educational opportunities for students, yet also poses challenges about how to conceptualize the disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices of the disciplinary fields of engineering. In this paper, we draw from empirical studies of engineering in professional and school settings to propose a set of epistemic practices of engineering that can inform curriculum development, teacher education, and research in science and engineering education. We examine the ways that these practices emerge from the work of engineering and serve to guide problem solving across a range of engineering fields. The proposed epistemic practices for education take into consideration social contexts of engineering, the salience of evidence for decision making, the types of tools and strategies used to construct knowledge, and need for creativity and innovation. The article concludes with suggestions for research in engineering education.",Cunningham C.; Kelly G.,Journal,Science Education,2017-05-01,Pennsylvania State University;Museum of Science,

Fixation studies have already generated many useful results but there are clear opportunities to better connect with work done on other related concepts and work done in other disciplines. This would allow fixation research to broaden and strengthen its methodological approaches, offering richer insights into how design ideas originate and how they subsequently evolve. Such knowledge could then be applied to influence the development of design education, training and tools. In this way, fixation research would maximize its potential to provide insights into the creative process, improve design practice and thereby support innovation.",Crilly N.; Cardoso C.,Journal,Design Studies,2017-05-01,"Faculteit Industrieel Ontwerpen, TU Delft;University of Cambridge",creativity ;  design behaviour ;  design fixation ;  research methods
Interlocking Patent Rights and Value Appropriation: Insights from the Razor Industry,"This paper analyzes a duopoly-like situation in the wet shaving industry featuring an innovation leader and a follower. In this, the leader claims to have filed 'interlocking' patents. The explorative case study examines how the leader filed said patents and how their structures have affected potential value appropriation. In fact, the market leader has claimed technical elements in multiple patents, while the patents themselves do not legally overlap. This analysis will also cover triggers and boundary conditions that facilitate or limit such claim compositions. Finally, the market leader has seemingly been able to successfully appropriate value from its strategy.

The Impact of Postgraduate Health Technology Innovation Training: Outcomes of the Stanford Biodesign Fellowship,"Stanford Biodesign launched its Innovation Fellowship in 2001 as a first-of-its kind postgraduate training experience for teaching biomedical technology innovators a need-driven process for developing medical technologies and delivering them to patients. Since then, many design-oriented educational programs have been initiated, yet the impact of this type of training remains poorly understood. This study measures the career focus, leadership trajectory, and productivity of 114 Biodesign Innovation Fellowship alumni based on survey data and public career information. It also compares alumni on certain publicly available metrics to finalists interviewed but not selected. Overall, 60% of alumni are employed in health technology in contrast to 35% of finalists interviewed but not selected. On leadership, 72% of alumni hold managerial or higher positions compared to 48% of the finalist group. A total of 67% of alumni reported that the fellowship had been “extremely beneficial” on their careers. As a measure of technology translation, more than 440,000 patients have been reached with technologies developed directly out of the Biodesign Innovation Fellowship, with another 1,000,000+ aided by solutions initiated by alumni after their training.

Incorporating the concept of systematic innovation into quality function deployment for developing multi-functional smart phones,"Smartphone has been recognized as one of the most powerful mobile carriers because of its portability, multiple functions, and wireless connectivity. However, the market shares of mobile phones have been intensively fluctuating because many brand companies like Nokia or Motorola have been merged. In order to brainstorm innovative ideas, this paper incorporates the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) into quality function deployment (QFD) to address the following issues: (1) a smartphone is characterized by marketing requirements (MRs) and technical attributes (TAs), (2) engineering conflicts among TAs are tackled by TRIZ, (3) user preferences for MRs are extracted to form a basis of market segmentation, (4) user perceptions of TAs are captured to identify significant features with regard to the ad-hoc segments. More importantly, numerous industrial examples including Sony's QX series, Samsung's K-zoom, Nokia's Lumia 1020, Asus's Zenfone zoom, Asus's Padfone series, LG's G flex, Samsung's galaxy beam, and Lenovo's Yoga Tablet 2 are illustrated to validate this research.

Research and application: conceptual integrated model based on TRIZ and bionics for product innovation,"TRIZ and bionics are two techniques for systematic innovation that can help designers achieve innovative product solutions. In order to help the designer to determine conflicts happened in the design of product, an adapted TRIZ method is proposed. Bionics is a new developing frontier science permeating and combine biology, mathematics and engineering studies, and the designer can attain a innovative solution by adapting bionics method. This paper describes a interactive model by integrating TRIZ tools with coupling bionics. Firstly, a new table of inventive principles based on biological function is presented, and the human–computer interaction query interface was designed by MATLAB tool. After design conflicts in product system are determined, designer or group of ideation chooses from the bionic template which is attained according to the conflict Matrix 2003 in TRIZ, The biological tree model is built to analyze biological coupling elements of the bionic template, and then analytic hierarchy process is applied to figure out the main and hypo-main coupling elements. By imitating functions of the main and hypo-main coupling elements, different kinds of bionic coupling models for product can be established. Finally, the designer can evaluate and judge whether the innovative solution is optimal or should be returned to design.",Xiaomin L.; Shuiping H.; Yuting C.,Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2017-05-01,Fuzhou University,Biological coupling ;  Bionics ;  Coupling elements ;  TRIZ

Decoding the Impact of Robustness Measures of SOSM Control in SMAW Process,"Sustained research on an engineering invention gives birth to innovative products. For its success, the adoption and subsequent diffusion of those products should be natural process. In spite of continued research over last several decades the adoption of sliding mode controllers is virtually nonexistent. Continuous improvement in feedback, actuation, means of actuation etc. has ensured effectiveness of prevailing controllers. Choice of control idea is an integral part of product design where PI has remained as sole dominating concept for control of industrial processes. The search for superior control ideas has remained an active research area but none could penetrate the domains of PI. For any engineering innovation to succeed, it is important that all ground needs (e.g. easy implementation mechanisms, performance, lateral benefits, etc.) for its adoption are met. This article details how SOSM controller could achieve robust arc stability features for wide range SMAW having huge non-linearity, parametric variations and disturbances. It also details that characteristics of SMAW is ideally suited for SOSM.

A systems engineering approach to systematic innovation in an industry-university collaboration,"This paper introduces a disciplined, system-focused approach to systematic innovation and product enhancement. This approach addresses a paradox facing multinational companies that must quickly adapt to new market opportunities and enhance products to sustain market competitiveness but must also assure their products perform as specified with predictable development and support cost. Thus, the engineering process must be able to incorporate innovative concepts that may be high risk while ensuring such concepts translate into product enhancements with low risk. The approach described in this paper is based on a visionary system description that suggests possible enhancements to an existing system. The system is decomposed into subsystem components. Opportunities to enhance each component are explored and each is assessed based on the technical risk of the proposed enhancement. Each risk is then reduced to an acceptable level through a combination of prototyping, experimentation, and/or open innovation methods. The work described is based on a collaboration between thyssenkrupp AG, a multinational company headquartered in Essen (Germany) and its innovation centre at a leading U.S. research university, the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia (USA). This collaboration is an example of how corporations are increasingly seeking strategic university partners to augment their own technical expertise, to search for and acquire new technologies, to influence university research programmes, and to explore potential game changing innovations. The source for the visionary system description in this work is the Industry 4.0 vision for advanced manufacturing as first articulated in Germany. A case study is provided to illustrate the systems-focused innovation approach. Based on the case study, observations are made about lessons learned as well as future areas of research.",Cross S.; Felis T.,Conference Proceeding,"2016 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit, E-TEMS 2016",2017-04-26,Georgia Institute of Technology;Thyssentrupp AG,Experimentation ;  Industry-University Collaboration ;  Innovation ;  Prototyping ;  Systems Engineering
Convergence: An integrated framework for architecture,"""There is today a pronounced and accelerated convergence in architecture. This convergence is occurring by doers not thinkers; in practice not academia; in building design, fabrication, and construction. It is about solution-centric individuals engaged in real time problem solving, not in abstractions. The nature of this convergence, where things are converging and what that means for architecture, is the subject of this book."" -from the Introduction Those working in architecture and engineering feel pressure to work faster, at lower cost, while maintaining a high level of innovation and quality. At the same time, emergent tools and processes make this possible. Convergence is about the firms, teams and people who thrive in this environment as a result of their ability to creatively combine and innovate. It seeks to answer several timely questions: What are the tools and work processes that are converging? How are individuals and organizations converging their tools and work processes? What challenges and benefits are they seeing? What is the ultimate endgame of this convergence? What skillsets and mindsets would someone need to develop to work effectively in this changing environment? What are the implications of convergence on the role of the designer, and on design? On how we design, build, fabricate, and construct? On how we work? The book explains how convergence relates to, but ultimately differs from integration, consolidation, multi-tasking, automation, and other forms of optimization. The practice-based research builds upon the author's research in BIM and in the collaborative leveraging of data in design and fabrication. As an investigation and meditation on the impact of technology on the education and making of design professionals Convergence explains what is happening in the world of design, and discusses the implications for the future of education, training and practice.",Deutsch R.,Book,Convergence: An Integrated Framework for Architecture,2017-04-25,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,

Prospective characteristics of contemporary engineers (using the approach of mechanical engineering): Contribution and role of the mechanical engineer to organization management and productivity,"If it becomes possible to train and raise the awareness of engineers, and if they are qualified and well educated in accordance with the statements mentioned in this chapter, it can be possible to achieve technical innovations and advances in many areas. In addition, it may be possible to make progress in the efficiency and productivity of industrial companies and factories. This contribution discusses the productivity and for organizational management will be concluded by a successful case study in industrial development arising from scientific studies and, finally, followed up by economic growth. Therefore, thanks to these studies, the welfare level of a given society can increase. Those working in engineering mainly operate and manage domestic and global natural resources by considering national or international interests and contribute to increase the productivity of industrial applications. All engineers, regardless of their specific profession or branch,must be conscious of society and the environment while carrying out their engineering tasks and behave responsibly. This chapter consists of lecture notes that I have used in recent years in my ""Introduction to Mechanical Engineering"" course while I was a lecturer at the university. This chapter explains scientifically the kind of fundamental characteristics and educational background level an engineer should have with respect to business, industrial, and academic life. I have tried to describe the science of mechanical engineering and its research interests and scope of business as well as the duties engineers undertake during their professional life. I have explained the procedure to follow to be a well-educated, skilled engineer and to have a solid engineering career. I also provide some important factors for engineers to be successful in their business life based on the knowledge and experience I have accumulated over the course of my academic and industrial professional life. I have tried to emphasize the prospective fundamental characteristics of a newly minted engineer in today's world.While presenting that information, I also consider the main objectives and requirements of learning outcomes for accreditation boards for engineering education. In spite of the fact that this chapter was written with mechanical engineering in mind, the content and descriptions are comprehensive and valid for most other engineering branches.

Effective International Knowledge Exchange to Rehabilitate Rivers in Urban Delta's with RDM approach,"In coastal and low-lying vulnerable delta cities, such as the Rotterdam Metropolitan region and Metropolitan Manila, there has been an increase in vulnerability of urban flooding and water quality problems. New approaches address the current and future effects of climate change and increase urban quality, reduce vulnerability and increase water quality. New arrangements for international cooperation are set up in order to address these problems in the project 'IWASTO' ('to correct and to prevent') where several organisations from the Philippines and The Netherlands join forces to rehabilitate rivers and introduce new innovations for water quality monitoring and waste collection using the 'Research Design and Manufacaturing (RDM)' approach. One of the concrete results from this RDM approach in 2016 is the development and implementation of the 'Longganisa', a waste collection tool that was designed by a Dutch- Philippine team. In addition, the waterquality was measured and mapped with innovating methods using apps in order to locate and prioritize highly polluted areas. In the near future measures will be implemented to rehabilitate the rivers in Manila and a knowledge exchange forum will be set up to share the best management practices on international scale in countries as Indonesia, India and China.",Boogaard F.; De Boer E.; Heikoop R.; Palsma M.,Conference Proceeding,MATEC Web of Conferences,2017-04-05,Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences;Hanzehogeschool Groningen;Tauw Environment Ltd;Waterwegen Consultancy;RDM Centre of Expertise Rotterdam,
Developing Engineering Leaders: An Organized Innovation Approach to Engineering Education,"In addition to providing technical expertise in their respective fields, engineers are increasingly assuming leadership roles in academia, industry, government, and even non-profit organizations. We draw from lessons learned in our decade-long study of the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center program to provide both a theoretical framework, the Organized Innovation Model for Education, and tangible recommendations to educators, engineering managers, and anyone else interested in developing highly skilled engineers who are also excellent leaders. The model addresses a long-lamented need for systematic ways to integrate leadership development into technical curriculum and skill-building programs.",Perry S.; Hunter E.; Currall S.; Frauenheim E.,Journal,EMJ - Engineering Management Journal,2017-04-03,Southern Methodist University;Baylor University;Great Place to Work Institute,Commercialization ;  Engineering Management Development ;  Engineering Research Centers ;  Higher Education ;  Innovation ;  Leadership Development ;  Leadership Skills ;  National Science Foundation
A Semiautomatic Experience-Based Tool for Solving Product Innovation Problem,"In this paper, we present the idea of Smart Innovation Engineering (SIE) System and its implementation methodology. The SIE system is semiautomatic system that helps in carrying the process of product innovation. It collects the experiential knowledge from the formal decisional events. This experiential knowledge is collected from the group of similar products having some common functions and features. The SIE system behaves like a group of experts in its domain as it collects, captures, and stores the experiential knowledge from similar products as well as reuses this experiential knowledge that ultimately enhances the innovation process of manufactured goods. Moreover, with SIE in hand, entrepreneurs and manufacturing organizations will be able to take proper, enhanced decisions and most importantly at appropriate time. The system gains expertise each time a decision is taken and stored in the form of set of experience that can be used in future for similar queries. Implementation of the SIE system using Set of Experience Knowledge Structure and Decisional DNA for case study suggests that the SIE system is capable of capturing and reusing the innovation-related experiences of the manufactured products. The case study confirmed that the SIE system can be beneficial for entrepreneurs and manufacturing organizations for efficient decision making in the product innovation process.",Waris M.; Sanín C.; Szczerbicki E.; Shafiq S.,Journal,Cybernetics and Systems,2017-04-03,"Aligarh Muslim University;Gdańsk University of Technology;The University of Newcastle, Australia",Decisional DNA ;  product design ;  product innovation ;  set of experience ;  smart innovation engineering
Some key issues of X/gamma-ray detection in space,"Space as a frontier of scientific exploration and discovery, basic and extreme environment engineering research laboratory has its own unique advantages. In the study of space science exploration, whether it is a natural physical phenomenon research, or outside resources, disaster and security application, X/gamma-ray detection has become an indispensable necessity. There are many unsolved mysteries of science of nature, its exploration and research are closely related to X/gamma-ray radiation detection, key scientific issues are: supernovae, black hole formation, Lunar and planetary evolution and the origin of the universe, dark matter and dark energy; and outer space resources available; national security and space research, and so on. In addition, the space X/gamma-ray radiation detection research and application is different from the ground-based observation, as launches and space environment requirements, space radiation detection instruments not only have good performance, but also should have a high and reliable quality. Therefore, there are some of key technical problems to be overcome. This paper consists of three main parts. In the first part, described as an integrated lab space has in the radiation field, high vacuum, microgravity, comprehensive and wide field of view, and other features, the peaceful use of space will bring enormous benefits for human development and wide space, and given in table development status in worldwide, it describes several big space nations to solve the scientific fundamental problems and key technical challenges, made a series of research strategy or projects, and gradually promote the implementation. Highlight five trends that are targeted to explore unknown space science and to develop deep space: the first is exploring the unknown space science, developing deep space exploration; the second is challenging human innovation, which is the development of advanced space technology and detection technology; the third is based on advanced intelligent robots for leading development of manned space; the fourth is to target the near-Earth orbit exploration, made innovation in methods and ways to use outside resources; the fifth point is looking for potential business opportunities. In the second section, highlights the fundamental scientific problems in the space X/gamma-ray detection, including cosmic gamma-ray bursts, black holes, neutron stars and Supernova remnants, such as dark matter and dark energy. Meanwhile, also pointed to the space environment, planetary evolution, space electromagnetic hazards, multidisciplinary issues such as ex-territorial resources available. In order to achieve some of the fundamental science goals designed, key technologies and processes in space experiments need to be addressed. In the third part, the space X/gamma ray radiation detection key technical challenges are described. Different science targets relay on different experiment requirements, needs of key technology are different. General speaking, physical parameters of a space radiation detection experiment include charge particles discrimination, energy detection, and flux, azimuth, angle, time, position detection as well.

How Personal Factors Influence Academic Behavior and GPA in African American STEM Students,"The United States has often been viewed as a leading force in technological advancement and scientific innovation. However, that may soon change with the low number of postsecondary degrees being awarded to students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Without an adequate number of qualified individuals fueling the innovative drive of the nation, we are at risk of stagnation. Further compounding this issue is the low number of minority students awarded STEM degrees and jobs. Several researchers have addressed external and internal goal-related factors that lead to student attrition from STEM, but few have explored students’ personal factors that influence academic behavior (PIAB) and, subsequently, achievement. This study aimed to expand the current literature by developing a new model to assess the influence of PIABs on student success.",Scherer S.; Talley C.; Fife J.,Journal,SAGE Open,2017-04-01,Virginia State University,academics ;  achievement ;  applied psychology ;  education ;  educational psychology ;  educational research ;  emotion ;  experimental psychology ;  higher education ;  psychology ;  social sciences ;  students
Instruments of support for research and development funded by leading domestic and international science foundations,"Introduction: one of the key aspects of the knowledge economy development is the growing significance of the results of research and development. The education and basic research play a key role in this process. Funding for education and fundamental science is carried out mainly at the expense of the state resources, including a system of foundations for scientific, engineering and innovation activities in Russia. The purpose of this article is to present recommendations for improving the tools of domestic foundations in funding fundamental research and development, including education and training. The propositions are made with a comparative analysis of the domestic and foreign science foun dations' activities. Materials and Methods: the authors used analysis, comparison, induction, deduction, graphical analysis, generalisation and other scientific methods during the study. Results: the lack of comparability between domestic and foreign scientific funds in the volume of funding allocated for basic research and development is revealed. This situation affects the scientific research. The foreign foundations have a wide range of instruments to support research projects at all stages of the life cycle of grants for education and training prior to release of an innovative product to market (the use of ""innovation elevator"" system). The Russian national scientific foundations have no such possibilities. The authors guess that the Russian organisations ignore some of the instruments for supporting research and development. Use of these tools could enhance the effectiveness of research projects. According to the study of domestic and foreign experience in supporting research and development, the authors proposed a matrix composed of instruments for support in the fields of basic scientific researches and education with such phases of the project life cycle as ""research"" and ""develo pment"". Discussion and Conclusions: the foreign science foundations use a broader spectrum of the tools to support research and development than the domestic organisations. The authors pinpoint a number of functional instruments to support research and development and advice to Russian science-supporting institutions to use the modern tools in the activities for enhancing the ef fectiveness of researches.",Ilina I.; Zharova E.,Journal,Integration of Education,2017-04-01,"Russian Research Institute of Economics, Politics and Law in Science and Technology (RIEPL)",Financing ;  Grant ;  Innovation ;  Research and development ;  Scientific activity ;  Scientific design ;  Scientific foundation ;  Support tools
Modular decomposition model of complex product system and its application,"Modular design and development technology can realize flexible manufacturing of complex product system (CoPS), but inappropriate modular decomposition will increase managerial difficulty and manufacturing cost.

This paper discusses that calculation by the modular decomposition makes the wide-area monitoring and analysis control system of power grid is divided into four functional models under the complex condition, which greatly shortens the development cycle of WARMAP system, improves the quality of research and development, verifies the validity of the modular decomposition model, and provides theoretical guidance and decision-making reference for enterprise product modular design.",Yan H.; Zhong W.,Journal,Beijing Hangkong Hangtian Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,2017-04-01,School of Economics & Management;State Grid Electric Power Research Institute,Complex product system (CoPS) ;  Innovation research ;  Modular decomposition model ;  Modular design ;  Wide area moniting analysis protection-control (WARMAP)
Planning water detention basins: A punctuated and exclusive policy,"In the face of dramatic meteorological events, the institutions dedicated to the flood safety push for the adoption of two relatively new measures: social participation and the creation of reservoirs in which temporarily store the excess water. The article aims to verify how really innovative the two measures are, and how these relate to each other according to an approach that insists on «socio-technical packages». The hypothesis is that change is temporally and spatially punctuated. Three Italian projects of water detention basin have been analysed. The research shows innovation happened mainly within the public administration (civil engineering) with a limited inclusion of planning and ecological expertise. The construction of detention basins is fruit of a contingent combination of factors opening «windows of opportunity».",Osti G.,Journal,Rivista Italiana di Politiche Pubbliche,2017-04-01,Università degli Studi di Trieste,Detention basin ;  Flood ;  Negotiated programming ;  Opportunity windows ;  Participation

Creating an Instrument to Measure Student Response to Instructional Practices,"Background: Calls for the reform of education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have inspired many instructional innovations, some research based. Yet adoption of such instruction has been slow. Research has suggested that students' response may significantly affect an instructor's willingness to adopt different types of instruction. Purpose: We created the Student Response to Instructional Practices (StRIP) instrument to measure the effects of several variables on student response to instructional practices. We discuss the step-by-step process for creating this instrument. Design/Method: The development process had six steps: item generation and construct development, validity testing, implementation, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and instrument modification and replication. We discuss pilot testing of the initial instrument, construct development, and validation using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Results: This process produced 47 items measuring three parts of our framework. Types of instruction separated into four factors (interactive, constructive, active, and passive); strategies for using in-class activities into two factors (explanation and facilitation); and student responses to instruction into five factors (value, positivity, participation, distraction, and evaluation). Conclusions: We describe the design process and final results for our instrument, a useful tool for understanding the relationship between type of instruction and students' response.",DeMonbrun M.; Finelli C.; Prince M.; Borrego M.; Shekhar P.; Henderson C.; Waters C.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Education,2017-04-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Bucknell University;North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University;The University of Texas at Austin;Western Michigan University",active learning ;  factor analysis ;  instructional methods ;  student resistance
The impact of leaders’ technical competence on employees’ innovation and learning,"The support of leaders plays a crucial role in enhancing employees’ learning and innovation.

Label-free deep shotgun proteomics reveals protein dynamics during tomato fruit tissues development,"Current innovations in mass-spectrometry-based technologies allow deep coverage of protein expression. Despite its immense value and in contrast to transcriptomics, only a handful of studies in crop plants engaged with global proteome assays. Here, we present large-scale shotgun proteomics profiling of tomato fruit across two key tissues and five developmental stages. A total of 7738 individual protein groups were identified and reliably measured at least in one of the analyzed tissues or stages. The depth of our assay enabled identification of 61 differentially expressed transcription factors, including renowned ripening-related regulators and elements of ethylene signaling. Significantly, we measured proteins involved in 83% of all predicted enzymatic reactions in the tomato metabolic network. Hence, proteins representing almost the complete set of reactions in major metabolic pathways were identified, including the cytosolic and plastidic isoprenoid and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Furthermore, the data allowed us to discern between protein isoforms according to expression patterns, which is most significant in light of the weak transcript-protein expression correspondence. Finally, visualization of changes in protein abundance associated with a particular process provided us with a unique view of skin and flesh tissues in developing fruit. This study adds a new dimension to the existing genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic resources. It is therefore likely to promote translational and post-translational research in tomato and additional species, which is presently focused on transcription.",Szymanski J.; Levin Y.; Savidor A.; Breitel D.; Chappell-Maor L.; Heinig U.; Töpfer N.; Aharoni A.,Journal,Plant Journal,2017-04-01,John Innes Centre;Weizmann Institute of Science Israel;Tel Aviv University,fruit development ;  fruit ripening ;  proteomics ;  secondary metabolism ;  Solanum lycopersicum

Evaluating the Effect of Contract Timing on Lifecycle-Design Innovation in Public-Private Partnerships: Comparative Case Study of Highway Projects,"Public-private partnerships (P3s) are becoming a prevalent solution to address the growing infrastructure needs across the United States. Proponents of P3s believe that they enable the private sector to implement more lifecycle-design innovations, or design changes that benefit long-term project performance. While studies have explored innovation in highway P3s, to date none have explored the effect of contract timing on the ability to realize lifecycle-design innovations. This study addresses this gap by analyzing three design-build-finance-operate-maintain (DBFOM) P3s to explore the influence of contract timing on the private sector's ability to realize lifecycle-design innovations. Using innovation theory as a framework to measure the magnitude of lifecycle-design changes, the research explored contract timing of private involvement and analyzed whether this timing enabled or inhibited the ability of the project team to realize the promise of lifecycle innovations. Furthermore, through the identified examples, a conceptual model illustrates how the private sector's ability to perform more radical lifecycle-design innovations increases the earlier the partner is brought into a project.",Antillon E.; Molenaar K.; Javernick-Will A.,Journal,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,2017-04-01,College of Engineering and Applied Science,Case study ;  Lifecycle design innovation ;  Public-private partnerships
Creating awareness around rhizomatic principles in mlearning: A means to improving practice,"Educational technological innovation to enhance the learning experience of students requires a sound understanding of intended learning outcomes and an understanding of the pedagogical affordances of technology. Literature reveals that an understanding of the application of mLearning in facilitating the achievement of specific learning objectives is limited. This may lead to negative quality perceptions and subsequently have a negative impact on the adoption of potentially rich technological resources. The challenge for educators is to create learning environments based on sound didactical principles. The purpose of this study is to highlight rhizomatic principles in mLearning practice using an integrated research synthesis. This may contribute to creating an awareness of, and a belief in rhizomatic principles in mLearning practice and this in turn may improve their practice.

Translational Challenges in Cardiovascular Tissue Engineering,"Valvular heart disease and congenital heart defects represent a major cause of death around the globe. Although current therapy strategies have rapidly evolved over the decades and are nowadays safe, effective, and applicable to many affected patients, the currently used artificial prostheses are still suboptimal. They do not promote regeneration, physiological remodeling, or growth (particularly important aspects for children) as their native counterparts. This results in the continuous degeneration and subsequent failure of these prostheses which is often associated with an increased morbidity and mortality as well as the need for multiple re-interventions. To overcome this problem, the concept of tissue engineering (TE) has been repeatedly suggested as a potential technology to enable native-like cardiovascular replacements with regenerative and growth capacities, suitable for young adults and children. However, despite promising data from pre-clinical and first clinical pilot trials, the translation and clinical relevance of such TE technologies is still very limited. The reasons that currently limit broad clinical adoption are multifaceted and comprise of scientific, clinical, logistical, technical, and regulatory challenges which need to be overcome. The aim of this review is to provide an overview about the translational problems and challenges in current TE approaches. It further suggests directions and potential solutions on how these issues may be efficiently addressed in the future to accelerate clinical translation. In addition, a particular focus is put on the current regulatory guidelines and the associated challenges for these promising TE technologies.",Emmert M.; Fioretta E.; Hoerstrup S.,Journal,Journal of Cardiovascular Translational Research,2017-04-01,"Universitätsspital Zürich, Klinik für Kardiologie;Universität Zürich;Wyss Translational Center Zurich",Clinical translation ;  Off-the-shelf ;  Regenerative medicine ;  Remodeling ;  Self-repair capacity ;  Tissue engineering

An innovative bio-engineering retaining structure for supporting unstable soil,"The paper presents a new prefabricated bio-engineering structure for the support of unstable soil. This prefabricated structure is made of a steel frame which is completely filled with soil and a face made of tree trunks among which scions or autochthonous bushes are planted. Due to the difficulties in interpreting the complex interaction between soil and structure during the installation and lifetime, an in situ test was carried out in order to evaluate the state of stress in the steel frame and to understand the global behavior of the structure under service loads. On the basis of the obtained results, a procedure for checking the structure safety was proposed and discussed. An easy design method was developed during the research. Moreover, the use of this type of prefabricated structure shows several advantages, such as good performances in terms of stabilizing effects, and easy assembly and transport.",Bella G.; Barbero M.; Barpi F.; Borri-Brunetto M.; Peila D.,Journal,Journal of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering,2017-04-01,Politecnico di Torino,Bio-engineering ;  Landslide ;  Live cribwall ;  Test site ;  Unstable soil

Opportunities and challenges of the Sponge City construction related to urban water issues in China,"Waterlogging is one of the major water issues in most cities of China and directly restricts their urbanization processes. The construction of Sponge City is an effective approach to solving the urban water issues, particularly for the waterlogging. In this study, both the urban issues emerged at the stage of rapid urbanization in China and the demands as well as problems of Sponge City construction related with the water issues were investigated, and the opportunities and challenges for the Sponge City construction in the future were also proposed. It was found that the current stormwater management focused on the construction of gray infrastructures (e.g., drainage network and water tank) based on the fast discharge idea, which was costly and hard to catch up with the rapid expansion of city and its impervious surface, while green infrastructures (e.g., river, lake and wetland) were ignored. Moreover, the current construction of Sponge City was still limited to low impacted development (LID) approach which was concentrated on source control measures without consideration of the critical functions of surrounding landscapes (i.e., mountain, river, wetland, forest, farmland and lake), while application of the integrated urban water system approach and its supported technologies including municipal engineering, urban hydrology, environmental science, social science and ecoscape were relatively weak and needed to be improved. Besides, the lack of special Sponge City plan and demonstration area was also a considerable problem. In this paper, some perspectives on Good Sponge City Construction were proposed such as the point that idea of urban plan and construction should conform to the integral and systematic view of sustainable urban development. Therefore, both the basic theoretical research and the basic infrastructure construction such as monitoring system, drainage facility and demonstration area should be strengthened, meanwhile, the reformation and innovation in the urban water management system and the education system should also be urgently performed. The study was expected to provide a deeper thinking for the current Sponge City construction in China and to give some of suggestions for the future directions to urban plan and construction, as well as urban hydrology discipline.",Xia J.; Zhang Y.; Xiong L.; He S.; Wang L.; Yu Z.,Journal,Science China Earth Sciences,2017-04-01,"CPG Corporation Pte Ltd;Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;Wuhan University;Hohai University",China ;  Integrated water system approach ;  Opportunities and challenges ;  Sponge City ;  Waterlogging
The Internet of Things for basic nursing care—A scoping review,"Background The novel technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) connects objects to the Internet and its most advanced applications refine obtained data for the user. We propose that Internet of Things technology can be used to promote basic nursing care in the hospital environment by improving the quality of care and patient safety. Objectives To introduce the concept of Internet of Things to nursing audience by exploring the state of the art of Internet of Things based technology for basic nursing care in the hospital environment. Data sources and review methods Scoping review methodology following Arksey & O'Malley's stages from one to five were used to explore the extent, range, and nature of current literature. We searched eight databases using predefined search terms. A total of 5030 retrievals were found which were screened for duplications and relevancy to the study topic. 265 papers were chosen for closer screening of the abstracts and 93 for full text evaluation. 62 papers were selected for the review. The constructs of the papers, the Internet of Things based innovations and the themes of basic nursing care in hospital environment were identified. Results Most of the papers included in the review were peer-reviewed proceedings of technological conferences or articles published in technological journals. The Internet of Things based innovations were presented in methodology papers or tested in case studies and usability assessments. Innovations were identified in several topics in four basic nursing care activities: comprehensive assessment, periodical clinical reassessment, activities of daily living and care management. Conclusions Internet of Things technology is providing innovations for the use of basic nursing care although the innovations are emerging and still in early stages. Internet of things is yet vaguely adopted in nursing. The possibilities of the Internet of Things are not yet exploited as well as they could. Nursing science might benefit from deeper involvement in engineering research in the area of health.",Mieronkoski R.; Azimi I.; Rahmani A.; Aantaa R.; Terävä V.; Liljeberg P.; Salanterä S.,Journal,International Journal of Nursing Studies,2017-04-01,Department of Computer Science;Turun Yliopistollinen Keskussairaala;Technische Universität Wien;Turun yliopisto,Basic nursing care ;  Hospitals ;  Internet of Things ;  Nursing informatics
The Early Tech Development Course: Experiential Commercialization Education for the Medical Academician,"Problem Research produced by medical academicians holds promise for developing into biomedical innovations in therapeutics, devices, diagnostics, and health care information technology; however, the road to biomedical innovation is fraught with risk, including the challenge of moving from basic research insight onto a viable commercialization path. Compounding this challenge is the growing demand on medical academicians to be more productive in their clinical, teaching, and research duties within a resource-constrained environment. Approach In 2014, the University of Michigan (UM) Medical School and College of Engineering codesigned and implemented an accelerated, biomedical-focused version of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program. The UM Early Tech Development (ETD) Course, designed for medical academicians exploring the commercial potential of early-stage ideas, covers the NSF I-Corps concept; supports the formation of teams of faculty, graduate, and medical students; and accommodates medical academicians' schedules. Outcomes From 2014 to 2015, the ETD Course graduated 39 project teams from UM and other institutions. One-third of the teams have continued to pursue their projects, receiving additional funding, engaging industry partners, or enrolling in the NSF I-Corps program. Next Steps The ETD Course, a potential pipeline to the NSF I-Corps program, captures a target audience of medical academicians and others in academic medicine. To better understand the long-term effects of the course and its relationship to the NSF I-Corps program, the authors will conduct a study on the careers of all ETD Course graduates, including those who have enrolled in NSF I-Corps versus those who have not.",Servoss J.; Chang C.; Fay J.; Ward K.,Journal,Academic Medicine,2017-04-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",
"3rd congress on applied synthetic biology in Europe (Costa da Caparica, Portugal, February 2016)","The third meeting organised by the European Federation of Biotechnology (EFB) on advances in Applied Synthetic Biotechnology in Europe (ASBE) was held in Costa da Caparica, Portugal, in February 2016. Abundant novel applications in synthetic biology were described in the six sessions of the meeting, which was divided into technology and tools for synthetic biology (I, II and III), bionanoscience, biosynthetic pathways and enzyme synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering and chemical manufacturing.

With the aid of synthetic biology, production costs of chemicals, metabolites and food products are expected to decrease, by generating sustainable biochemical production of such resources. Also, such synthetic biological advances could be applied for medical purposes, as in pharmaceuticals and for biosensors. Recurrent, linked themes throughout the meeting were the shortage of resources, the world's transition into a bioeconomy, and how synthetic biology is helping tackle these issues through cutting-edge technologies. While there are still limitations in synthetic biology research, innovation is propelling the development of technology, the standardisation of synthetic biological tools and the use of suitable host organisms. These developments are laying a foundation to providing a future where cutting-edge research could generate potential solutions to society's pressing issues, thus incentivising a transition into a bioeconomy.",Cueva M.,Journal,New Biotechnology,2017-03-25,The University of Edinburgh,
Research on Time-series Modeling and Filtering Methods for MEMS Gyroscope Random Drift Error,"The precision of MEMS gyroscope is reduced by random drift error. This paper applied time series analysis to model random drift error of MEMS gyroscope. Based on the model established, Kalman filter was employed to compensate for the error. To overcome the disadvantages of conventional Kalman filter, Sage-Husa adaptive filtering algorithm was utilized to improve the accuracy of filtering results and the orthogonal property of innovation in the process of filtering was utilized to deal with outliers. The results showed that, compared with conventional Kalman filter, the modified filter can not only enhance filter accuracy, but also resist to outliers and this assured the stability of filtering thus improving the performance of gyroscopes.",Yi Wang X.; Yun Meng X.,Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2017-03-23,Beijing Institute of Technology,

Advances and perspectives in research of potato genetics and breeding,"Potato, the third most important food crop, plays a key role in global and China's food security. Improvement of varieties is a base for sustainable development of potato industry. Potatoes frequently suffer from diverse biotic and abiotic stress, so it is urgent to breed new varieties with better disease resistance, stress tolerance, tuber yield and quality as well as specific usage to meet the needs of potato processing and people nutrition. Potato breeding is a system combining germplasm evaluation and utilization, major traits genetics analysis, breeding technology application and variety extension and crop management together. Within a global conservation strategy there are about 65,000 accessions. Using a homozygous doubled-monoploid potato clone, 86% of the 844-megabase genome sequence are revealed and assembled, and 39,031 protein-coding genes are predicted. At present, re-sequencing of potato accessions is in process. Common cultivated potato is an asexual propagation tetraploid with tetrasomic inheritance and high heterozygosity. Nevertheless, inheritance of many major traits involving plant development and morphology, tuber quality, disease resistance and stress tolerance are revealed. A lot of genes determining potato major traits are mapped and cloned. Potato breeding technology involves conventional breeding, ploidy manipulation, marker-assisted selection, genetic engineering and promising genomic selection for complex traits. Since 1949, China potato breeding has achieved great progress that is reflected on growth of number of registered varieties. Dutch potato breeding ranks among the best in world and participatory potato breeding model is a successful practice for commercial breeding. In the future, it is a trend to breed superior and specific purpose varieties based on improvement of integrated breeding technology, innovation of breeding model and germplasm utilization.",Xu J.; Jin L.,Journal,Scientia Agricultura Sinica,2017-03-16,Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China,Advances ;  Breeding ;  Genetics ;  Perspectives ;  Potato

Current developments in the French engineering education system,"The French engineering education system has been established in quite a different way from others in Europe, such as the German and British systems, for instance. Due to both the whole state system and the private initiatives during the industrial revolution, the engineering education system today is composed of a large number (nearly 200) of rather small and specialised institutions, which have historically mostly developed outside universities. In the last decades, this system has had to face a powerful internationalisation movement. This has had major consequences on the curricula design, regarding foreign language teaching, international exchanges, and links with research. Currently, the French engineering education system is facing new challenges, regarding innovation and environmental and social issues, in a very competitive higher education context.",Lemaître D.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2017-03-04,ENSTA Bretagne,curriculum ;  Education engineering ;  French model ;  globalisation
Models of direct editing of government spatial data: challenges and constraints to the acceptance of contributed data,"The current popularity of government open data platforms as a way to share geospatial data has created an opportunity for government to receive direct feedback and edits on this very same data. This research proposes four models that can define how government accepts direct edits and feedback on geospatial data. The four models are a “status quo” of open data provision, data curation, data mirroring, and crowdsourcing. These models are placed on a continuum of government control ranging from high levels of control over data creation to a low level of control. Each model is discussed, with relevant challenges highlighted. These four models present an initial suite of options for governments looking to accept direct edits from data end users and can be framed as a partial realization of many of the principles of open government. Despite the varied potential of these approaches, they generate a shift in locus of control away from government, creating several areas of risk for government. Of these models, near-term interest may focus on data curation and data mirroring as evolutionary, rather than revolutionary steps that expand on the simple provision of open data.",Johnson P.,Journal,Cartography and Geographic Information Science,2017-03-04,University of Waterloo,crowdsourcing ;  geospatial data ;  Open data ;  open government
Analysis and prospects of developing higher education as a key factor of economy development (Comparative analysis),"The goal of this article is to define top priority areas of the education development for spreading innovative labor as a core factor of the economy development. Today, according to many indicators, the system of Kazakh higher education complies with standards of the developed countries. Every year the graduation of specialists of various levels increases. However, unlike the quality growth, the dynamics of quality indicators of the educational and professional preparation causes concerns, because its structure and content do not aim at forming the competences required for innovations. In this context, in accordance with the research methodology, the article defines criteria of developing the Kazakh education to spread innovative labor as a core factor of development. Based on them, it defines the results showing a considerable tendency towards social and humanitarian specialties in higher education while the labor innovation requires strengthening its technological component.

A mode mixing elimination method of HHT in fault detection,"As a new method of signal analysis, Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) has become one of the research hotspots in modern signal processing field. The main innovations of HHT are the creation of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the introduction of the concept of intrinsic mode function (IMF). The signal is decomposed as IMFs through EMD, and then we can get the instant frequency through Hilbert Transform (HT). Nowadays, the theory of HHT has been effectively applied to many practical engineering fields. However, there are lots of research to be done for the improvement and development of HHT. In this paper, the basic theory of HHT and the mode mixing phenomenon in EMD are introduced. Subsequently, two methods that can eliminate mode mixing are studied: the method of high-frequency harmonic addition and the method of ensemble empirical mode decomposition. The simulation experiments are conducted with the signal which contains interval signal and pulse of interference. Finally, a mode mixing eliminating method is proposed for the rotating blade signal. The experiment result shows that it is available for the fault detection of the rotating blade.",Li J.; Zhao C.; Su H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2016 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, CCIOT 2016",2017-03-01,Wuhan University of Technology,EEMD ;  fault detection ;  HHT ;  mode mixing

The ecosystem that powered the translation of OCT from fundamental research to clinical and commercial impact [invited],"25 years is a relatively short period of time for a medical technology to become a standard of care impacting the treatment of millions of people every year. Yet 25 years ago there were no OCT companies, no OCT products, no OCT markets, and only one journal article published using the term OCT (optical coherence tomography). OCT has had a tremendous scientific, clinical, and economic impact on society. Today, it is estimated that there are ~30 Million OCT imaging procedures performed worldwide every year and the OCT system market is approaching $1B per year. OCT has helped diagnose patients with retinal disease at early treatable stages, preventing or greatly reducing irreversible vision loss. The technology has facilitated pharmaceutical development and contributed to fundamental understanding of disease mechanisms in multiple fields. The invention and translation of OCT from fundamental research to daily clinical practice would not have been possible without a complex ecosystem involving interaction among physics, engineering, and clinical medicine; government funding of fundamental and clinical research; collaborative and competitive research in the academic sector; entrepreneurship and industry; addressing real clinical needs; harnessing the innovation that occurs at the boundaries of disciplines; and economic and societal impact. This invited review paper discusses the translation of OCT from fundamental research to clinical practice and commercial impact, as well as describes the ecosystem that helped power OCT to where it is today and will continue to drive future advances. While OCT is an example of a technology that has had a powerful impact, there are many biomedical technologies which are poised for translation to clinical practice, and it is our hope that highlighting this ecosystem will help accelerate their translation and clinical impact.",Swanson E.; Fujimoto J.,Journal,Biomedical Optics Express,2017-03-01,MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science;Acacia Communications Inc.,(170.3880) medical and biological imaging ;  (170.4500) optical coherence tomography
Future Perspectives of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common procedure of orthopaedic surgery. The challenges of recreating normal knee function after an injury to the ACL have led to excessive research and continuous innovation of the surgical techniques for ACL reconstruction. Recently, focus has been turned toward the anatomical ACL reconstruction that is one of the most intriguing approaches regarding the surgical technique. Furthermore, exploration of basic anatomy of the knee has led to further insight in concepts of tunnel placement, graft options, and treatment strategies. The possibility of quantitative measurement of knee laxity has evolved and is presented as one future approach to individualized surgery. The vast amount of literature available on ACL reconstruction illustrates that evidence regarding many aspects is advancing. However, it also illustrates that some studies are not generalizable, and that there is a need for further high-quality research.

These mouse models mimic the trauma and recovery processes in vivo and serve as carriers for tissue engineering and gene modification to test various therapies or associated genes in bone regeneration. The present review introduces a classification of surgically induced mouse models in bone regeneration, evaluates the application and value of these models and discusses the potential development of further innovations in this field in the future.",Ning B.; Zhao Y.; Buza J.; Li W.; Wang W.; Jia T.,Journal,Molecular Medicine Reports,2017-03-01,Qilu Hospital of Shandong University;NYU Langone Health;Shandong University,Animal model ;  Bone regeneration ;  Mouse ;  Surgical model
Modular steel lamella structures by Hugo Junkers – scientific bases for an appropriate repair,"Modular steel lamella structures by Hugo Junkers – scientific bases for an appropriate repair. The German engineer Hugo Junkers (1859–1935) is well-known mostly for his innovations in plant engineering and aircraft design. In the mid-1920s, he developed an innovative roof construction that was comprised of modular steel lamellas, and is regarded a milestone in the development of lightweight structures. The technical construction principle is closely related to Zollinger's (1880–1945) timber lamella roof design. Unfortunately, most of the buildings do not exist anymore or are in bad condition. Two three-section, barrel-vaulted hangars from 1934 still exist on the site of the former military airfield in Oberschleißheim. They are classed as listed buildings but their structural condition is very alarming. They gave the occasion of a research project, promoted by the Meitinger Foundation, which has been edited from 2014–2016 at the Chair of Structural Design at the Technical University of Munich. This article summarizes the main results of the investigations: The point cloud of a 3-D-laser-scanning was converted into a static calculation model. Parametric analyzes brought new insights into the geometry and fitting of the construction. Studies on the load bearing behavior show a number of weaknesses of the structure, which necessarily have to be considered in a maintenance.",Tutsch J.; Hipper A.; Schling E.; Barthel R.,Journal,Bautechnik,2017-03-01,Technische Universität München,barrel vault ;  Hugo Junkers ;  lamella roof ;  load bearing ;  maintenance ;  modular ;  steel
Beta Testing in Social Work,"The field of social work does not currently have a widely adopted method for expediting innovations into micro- or macropractice. Although it is common in fields such as engineering and business to have formal processes for accelerating scientific advances into consumer markets, few comparable mechanisms exist in the social sciences or social services. Given that beta testing is successfully used to scale innovation in business and engineering, why is there no method for beta testing in social work? Could this be the reason that innovations in social work practice remain decades behind scientific research findings? This article explores reasons for the scarcity of options for scaling innovation in the field of social work and proposes a method for shortening development cycles for social work innovations to ensure that advances reach consumers—and ultimately improve their lives—more quickly.",Traube D.; Begun S.; Petering R.; Flynn M.,Journal,Research on Social Work Practice,2017-03-01,University of Southern California;University of Denver,beta testing ;  innovation ;  lean startup model
"Science, Innovation, and Social Work: Clash or Convergence?","Social work as a human services profession has been distinctive for its inclusion of research as a required element of practice and instrument in instigating reform. At the present time, the relationship of social work to science and a redefinition of social work as a science have reentered our national dialogue with new force. This expansion of perspective has, however, failed to explicitly attend to a closely related intellectual and practical domain, the world of social innovation. Innovation as an end itself, a synonym for progress, has largely been owned by the professions of business, engineering, and the biosciences. This essay presents a discussion of how social work may engage with social innovation and the tensions inherent to such an engagement. A place for social innovation within the recognized domains of scientific investigation and social work is essential. Social work would make a unique contribution to the enhancement of this conception through the weight given to values, social purpose, and context that is endemic to the social work perspective. The result of combining science and social innovation perspectives in the same academic home might be a flowering of new social configurations, networks, organizations, and relationships disciplined by repeated appraisals through the scientific method.",Flynn M.,Journal,Research on Social Work Practice,2017-03-01,University of Southern California,program scale ;  scientific method ;  social change ;  social innovation

Optimizing antibody expression: The nuts and bolts,"Antibodies are extensively utilized entities in biomedical research, and in the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. Many of these applications require high amounts of antibodies. However, meeting this ever-increasing demand of antibodies in the global market is one of the outstanding challenges. The need to maintain a balance between demand and supply of antibodies has led the researchers to discover better means and methods for optimizing their expression. These strategies aim to increase the volumetric productivity of the antibodies along with the reduction of associated manufacturing costs. Recent years have witnessed major advances in recombinant protein technology, owing to the introduction of novel cloning strategies, gene manipulation techniques, and an array of cell and vector engineering techniques, together with the progress in fermentation technologies. These innovations were also highly beneficial for antibody expression. Antibody expression depends upon the complex interplay of multiple factors that may require fine tuning at diverse levels to achieve maximum yields. However, each antibody is unique and requires individual consideration and customization for optimizing the associated expression parameters. This review provides a comprehensive overview of several state-of-the-art approaches, such as host selection, strain engineering, codon optimization, gene optimization, vector modification and process optimization that are deemed suitable for enhancing antibody expression.",Ayyar B.; Arora S.; Ravi S.,Journal,Methods,2017-03-01,Baylor College of Medicine,Antibody expression ;  Codon optimization ;  Expression hosts ;  Gene optimization ;  Process optimization ;  Vector modification
Correlation between Architectural Complexity of Engineering Systems and Actual System Design Effort,"Architectural complexity management of engineering systems is becoming a major issue as systems built nowadays implement more complex technologies and innovations. In this paper, we present a preliminary research finding where quantitative values for an engineering system's architectural complexity are mapped with design effort for individual subsystems that are part of the system architecture. This was done to establish relationships between abstract architectural complexity of engineering systems and metrics that can directly be applied to system design and development.

Testing regimes in clinical trials: Evidence from four polio vaccine trajectories,"This paper highlights distinctive features of a neglected class of economic activity in the domain of medical innovation, namely the creation of testing regimes in clinical trials, asking how their nature might be expected to affect innovation of medical technology. It argues firstly that clinical trials are not simply about passively validating an already well-known technology and verifying its safety. Rather, clinical trials are part of a more active process of learning that allows pharmaceutical innovations to be useful outside the laboratory. It argues secondly that product development can proceed along a number of long and costly paths before a product's behaviour in actual practice becomes clear, which can make selecting between alternative courses of action difficult. Thus, product choice and product development need to go hand-in-hand. To consider these arguments, the paper maps out four trajectories of polio vaccine development, tracing their paths through clinical trials since the 1950s, and describes some of the defining features of testing regimes for medical innovation. These include institutions that integrate knowledge and co-ordinate skills in testing processes, and capabilities for allocating testing resources, managing testability constraints, sharing knowledge and improving commensurability between testing communities.",Yaqub O.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-03-01,University of Sussex,Clinical trial ;  Medical innovation ;  Research governance ;  Research translation ;  Vaccine
Promoting the Appropriate Use of Advanced Radiation Technologies in Oncology: Summary of a National Cancer Policy Forum Workshop,"Purpose Leaders in the oncology community are sounding a clarion call to promote “value” in cancer care decisions. Value in cancer care considers the clinical effectiveness, along with the costs, when selecting a treatment. To discuss possible solutions to the current obstacles to achieving value in the use of advanced technologies in oncology, the National Cancer Policy Forum of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine held a workshop, “Appropriate Use of Advanced Technologies for Radiation Therapy and Surgery in Oncology” in July 2015. The present report summarizes the discussions related to radiation oncology. Methods and Materials The workshop convened stakeholders, including oncologists, researchers, payers, policymakers, and patients. Speakers presented on key themes, including the rationale for a value discussion on advanced technology use in radiation oncology, the generation of scientific evidence for value of advanced radiation technologies, the effect of both scientific evidence and “marketplace” (or economic) factors on the adoption of technologies, and newer approaches to improving value in the practice of radiation oncology. The presentations were followed by a panel discussion with dialogue among the stakeholders. Results Challenges to generating evidence for the value of advanced technologies include obtaining contemporary, prospective, randomized, and representative comparative effectiveness data. Proposed solutions include the use of prospective registry data; integrating radiation oncology treatment, outcomes, and quality benchmark data; and encouraging insurance coverage with evidence development. Challenges to improving value in practice include the slow adoption of higher value and the de-adoption of lower value treatments. The proposed solutions focused on engaging stakeholders in iterative, collaborative, and evidence-based efforts to define value and promote change in radiation oncology practice. Recent examples of ongoing or successful responses to the discussed challenges were provided. Conclusions Discussions of “value” have increased as a priority in the radiation oncology community. Practitioners in the radiation oncology community can play a critical role in promoting a value-oriented framework to approach radiation oncology treatment.",Smith G.; Ganz P.; Bekelman J.; Chmura S.; Dignam J.; Efstathiou J.; Jagsi R.; Johnstone P.; Steinberg M.; Williams S.; Yu J.; Zietman A.; Weichselbaum R.; Tina Shih Y.,Journal,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,2017-03-01,"Massachusetts General Hospital;The University of Chicago;UCLA Fielding School of Public Health;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Yale School of Medicine;The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center;The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston;University of Pennsylvania;David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA;Moffitt Cancer Center",
The Functional Resonance Analysis Method for a systemic risk based environmental auditing in a sinter plant: A semi-quantitative approach,"Environmental auditing is a main issue for any production plant and assessing environmental performance is crucial to identify risks factors. The complexity of current plants arises from interactions among technological, human and organizational system components, which are often transient and not easily detectable. The auditing thus requires a systemic perspective, rather than focusing on individual behaviors, as emerged in recent research in the safety domain for socio-technical systems. We explore the significance of modeling the interactions of system components in everyday work, by the application of a recent systemic method, i.e. the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM), in order to define dynamically the system structure. We present also an innovative evolution of traditional FRAM following a semi-quantitative approach based on Monte Carlo simulation. This paper represents the first contribution related to the application of FRAM in the environmental context, moreover considering a consistent evolution based on Monte Carlo simulation. The case study of an environmental risk auditing in a sinter plant validates the research, showing the benefits in terms of identifying potential critical activities, related mitigating actions and comprehensive environmental monitoring indicators.",Patriarca R.; Di Gravio G.; Costantino F.; Tronci M.,Journal,Environmental Impact Assessment Review,2017-03-01,Sapienza Università di Roma,Environmental audit ;  Environmental impact assessment ;  Environmental risk ;  Functional resonance ;  Monte Carlo simulation
Industry use of virtual reality in product design and manufacturing: a survey,"In 1999, Fred Brooks, virtual reality pioneer and Professor of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published a seminal paper describing the current state of virtual reality (VR) technologies and applications (Brooks in IEEE Comput Graph Appl 19(6):16, 1999). Through his extensive survey of industry, Brooks concluded that virtual reality had finally arrived and “barely works”. His report included a variety of industries which leveraged these technologies to support industry-level innovation. Virtual reality was being employed to empower decision making in design, evaluation, and training processes across multiple disciplines. Over the past two decades, both industrial and academic communities have contributed to a large knowledge base on numerous virtual reality topics. Technical advances have enabled designers and engineers to explore and interact with data in increasingly natural ways. Sixteen years have passed since Brooks original survey. Where are we now? The research presented here seeks to describe the current state of the art of virtual reality as it is used as a decision-making tool in product design, particularly in engineering-focused businesses. To this end, a survey of industry was conducted over several months spanning fall 2014 and spring 2015. Data on virtual reality applications across a variety of industries was gathered through a series of on-site visits. In total, on-site visits with 18 companies using virtual reality were conducted as well as remote conference calls with two others. The authors interviewed 62 people across numerous companies from varying disciplines and perspectives. Success stories and existing challenges were highlighted. While virtual reality hardware has made considerable strides, unique attention was given to applications and the associated decisions that they support. Results suggest that virtual reality has arrived: it works! It is mature, stable, and, most importantly, usable. VR is actively being used in a number of industries to support decision making and enable innovation. Insights from this survey can be leveraged to help guide future research directions in virtual reality technology and applications.",Berg L.; Vance J.,Journal,Virtual Reality,2017-03-01,Iowa State University,

Hacking and making at time-bounded events: Current trends and next steps in research and event design,"Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. While hackathons, that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims, such as sprints, codefests, hack-days, edit-athons and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators.

Placing value on community co-creations: A study of a video game 'modding' community,"Firms developing software - and in particular, video game producers - seek to leverage the community of users/developers in enhancing product offering and increasing sales. Despite the practical importance of this phenomena, to date little research has investigated the actual value such communities add aside from few qualitative case studies of successful synergies between commercial enterprises and open-source communities. The objective of this study is to try and quantitatively assess the effectiveness of firms' efforts to increase sales of their product through inducing community's co-creation activity. Our empirical investigation focuses on producers of video games and their user/developer 'modding' community. An analysis of 45 games reveals that when firms are successful at engaging the community, the value added by the modding community contributes to an increase in sales of the base product.

IoT and smart infrastructure,"There is an increasing recognition that people's aging infrastructure needs to be monitored using the nascent Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Infrastructure monitoring is still in its relative infancy, though benefiting from rapid technological innovation in MEMS sensors, fiber optic sensors, wireless communication, embedded computing, and energy harvesting. This chapter discusses the engineering decisions. A significant part of wireless sensor research and field work is based on the assumption that people will use very low-power wireless sensors for infrastructure monitoring. Many industrial and infrastructure processes depend on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems continuously for their critical missions. It is important to know the amount of time given to provide the needed control; there may be consequences of failing to provide the needed control signal in time. Such stringent performance requirement could constrain people's design decisions greatly.",Lu G.; Yang Y.,Book,Internet of Things and Data Analytics Handbook,2017-02-17,"GoodXense, Inc",Engineering decisions ;  Internet of things technology ;  MEMS sensors ;  Network infrastructure monitoring ;  Supervisory control and data acquisition systems ;  Wireless sensor research

Bringing the outside world in: Using mixed panel assessment of oral presentations with Electrical and Electronic Engineering students,"Engineering students have been portrayed as having poor oral communication skills despite oral communication competence being a key factor in future career success. With the aim of equipping students with attributes identified as important for Engineering graduates this paper presents a research project carried out at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China in the Division of Science & Engineering with Electrical and Electronic with undergraduate students, focusing on the use of a mixed specialist and non-specialist audience for students' end of semester oral presentations assessment.It is known that oral presentations are an important academic genre developing communication skills and confidence in students but it is an area which has been found to be lacking in traditional engineering courses. The innovation of the mixed panel was to help prepare students for life after university by giving them experience of pitching technical material appropriate to the knowledge of the audience, which is something they will have to do when working in companies or on projects. This paper outlines the experience from the perspective of the assessors from different disciplines who were interviewed to determine what they were looking for in the presentations. It will also review the experience of the students themselves, based on a survey which considered the impact the mixed audience had on their presentation preparation in terms of language, presenting skills and content.

High pressure synthesis of nanotwinned ultrahard materials,"In this review, we present our recent research progress in superhard materials, with specially focusing on two topics. One topic is to understand hardness microscopically and establish the quantitative relationship between hardness and atomic parameters of crystal, which can be used to guide the design of novel superhard crystals. The other topic is to identify the fundamental principle and technological method to enhance the comprehensive performances (i.e., hardness, fracture toughness, and thermal stability) of superhard materials, and to synthesize high-performance superhard materials. Starting from the chemical bonds associated with crystal hardness and electronic structure, we propose a microscopic understanding of the indentation hardness as the combined resistance of chemical bonds in a material to indentation. Under this assumption, we establish the microscopic hardness model of covalent single crystals and further generalize it to polycrystalline materials. According to the polycrystalline hardness model, we successfully synthesize nanotwinned cubic boron nitride and diamond bulks under high pressure and high temperature. These materials exhibit simultaneous improvements in hardness, fracture toughness, and thermal stability. We also clarify a long-standing controversy about the criterion for performing a reliable indentation hardness measurement. Our research points out a new direction for developing the high-performance superhard materials, and promises innovations in both machinery processing industry and high pressure science.",Xu B.; Tian Y.,Journal,Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica,2017-02-05,Yanshan University,Hall-Petch effect ;  Nanotwins ;  Quantum confinement effect ;  Superhard materials
Green Innovation Design of Products under the Perspective of Sustainable Development,"with the continuous development and progress of productivity, product design spans with the age now and forms a diversified formation. But when there is a progress of science and technology, the speed of consumption of resources is also increasing, the relationship between mankind and the nature further worsens, resources will be exhausted, pollution is increasingly serious and shocking public nuisance events occur frequently. People pay more attention to the environment due to the harms to the nature caused by the development of industry, science and technology. Nowadays, people have clearly recognized the important role of design in environmental protection. The ecological research on constructing a new aesthetic relationship between human and nature has drawn wide attention from all circles of the society.

Engineering teaching courses leading-in creativity which demands teaching situation and element analysis,"In the era of industry 4.0, students not only need to cater to the needs of customers but also need to achieve the goal of integrating industrial skills with sales and products experience. It also helps to build up the complete adaptability, efficiency of resource and smart factory of human factors and ergonomics. As the result, there is a huge change of education in the field of engineering. Systematic cultivation of theory of innovation thinking and the practical application would be valued. Thus, this research chose the engineering students from one of the famous universities in Taiwan as the objects of study and also chose three courses of the college as the research samples. This research aimed at qualitative analyzing by doing in-depth interview and class observation to examine the teachers' teaching, students' learning attitudes and the arrangement of courses. According to this research suggests that there are two parts of the characters of teachers' teaching and students' learning of the college of engineering. First, teachers from engineering fields still focus on the outcome of 'power of operation', thus, teachers especially emphasize on logics and 'elaboration'. Furthermore, they regard students' 'internal interests' is the top condition of learning. Second, the characters of the students from the college of engineering put stress on learning knowledge and skill systematically. Brainstorming and skill integration of project are developed in the end. Although the students show the positive attitudes of solving problems, it is hard for them to present the achievements of the course in finite time. As the result, this research suggests the adaptability and supporting measures of leading Three-Capacity to courses to advance the efficiency. In basic engineering courses and experimental courses, students need to learn basic concepts and skill; therefore, teachers have to provide the students with concrete practical teaching materials and proper materials and guide them to observe, thinking, present and lead creative thinking to courses. The advanced courses of engineering belong to be practical learning. To make students get rid of the old way that learning systematically and guide them to think creatively and integrate what they learn, teachers adopt unit-oriented teaching with creativity methods to be one of the characters of guidance of engineering teaching.",Ting L.; Cheng G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Materials for Science and Engineering: Innovation, Science and Engineering, IEEE-ICAMSE 2016",2017-02-02,National Yunlin University of Science and Technology,Creativity ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation teaching

As the partnership with UK Sport has evolved, so too has the technology. Ahead of last summer's games, BAE provided Team Great Britain (GB) with a number of virtual reality simulations, accessible on smartphones, as well as VR headsets. Known as VR-Vantage, the project was designed to help athletes familiarise themselves with the big stage before setting out for Rio. BAE created underboot attachments for Britain's speed skaters. BAE's cycling ergometer helped propel Team GB's cyclists to medal success. With the current four-year cycle coming to an end this year, discussions with UK Sport are under way to renew the partnership.

Bridgework ahead! Innovation ecosystems vis-à-vis responsible innovation,"Public funding agencies largely support academic research as an effort to stimulate future product commercialization and foster broader societal benefits. Yet, translating research nurtured in academic settings into such outcomes is complex and demands functional interactions between government, academic, and industry, i.e., “triple helix,” organizations within an innovation ecosystem. This article argues that in the spirit of responsible innovation, research funding should build bridges that extend beyond the triple helix stakeholders to connect to peripheral organizations. To support that argument, evidence from agent network analysis gathered from two case studies reveals strong and weak connections, as well as gaps within innovation ecosystems in Switzerland and metropolitan Phoenix, USA.

Industrial and natural waste transformed into raw material,"Currently, we live in a world where the materials are the protagonists. Raw materials are fundamental to make industrial products; however, the increasing demand for these finite natural resources put the more industrialized countries under pressure to find ways to recycle and reuse the products at the end of their lives. Every year, tons of industrial and natural waste are accumulated and destroyed without a new use for them. Today, the energy consumption at the world level to extract raw materials contributes significantly to pollution and environmental degradation. In the European Union, the construction sector is responsible for 40% of global energy consumption, contributing considerably to CO2 emissions. The planet's future is compromised, unless the human beings learn how to preserve and conserve resources that Earth offers, changing the basic patterns of consumption, manufacturing and recycling. Sofa industries and wood industries generate significant amounts of waste that undergo a thoughtless destruction or recycling with a final order to reuse. This paper presents the research work that has been conducted in the scope of the Master Program in Product and Industrial Design of Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Fine Arts and Design Studio FEUP, seeking the reuse of leftovers (textile and wood powder), to create innovative products. The main objective is to prepare the waste that is mixed with different amounts and types of binders, and cast in molds. In some cases, the introduction of a shape memory alloy can promote an extra value and functionality to the designed products. This way the aim is to sensitize the community to the possibility of introducing new products in the market addressing concepts such as green design, sustainability and innovation.",Costa C.; Monteiro M.; Rangel B.; Alves F.,Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications",2017-02-01,Instituto de Ciência e Inovação em Engenharia Mecânica e Engenharia Industrial;Universidade do Porto,design ;  engineering ;  innovation ;  sustainability ;  Waste
"Biomimetics: Process, tools and practice","Biomimetics applies principles and strategies abstracted from biological systems to engineering and technological design. With a huge potential for innovation, biomimetics could evolve into a key process in businesses. Yet challenges remain within the process of biomimetics, especially from the perspective of potential users. We work to clarify the understanding of the process of biomimetics. Therefore, we briefly summarize the terminology of biomimetics and bioinspiration. The implementation of biomimetics requires a stated process. Therefore, we present a model of the problem-driven process of biomimetics that can be used for problem-solving activity. The process of biomimetics can be facilitated by existing tools and creative methods. We mapped a set of tools to the biomimetic process model and set up assessment sheets to evaluate the theoretical and practical value of these tools. We analyzed the tools in interdisciplinary research workshops and present the characteristics of the tools. We also present the attempt of a utility tree which, once finalized, could be used to guide users through the process by choosing appropriate tools respective to their own expertize. The aim of this paper is to foster the dialogue and facilitate a closer collaboration within the field of biomimetics.",Fayemi P.; Wanieck K.; Zollfrank C.; Maranzana N.; Aoussat A.,Journal,Bioinspiration and Biomimetics,2017-02-01,LCPI Laboratoire de Conception de Produits et Innovation;Technische Universität München;Deggendorf Institute of Technology;Aim-Innovation,biomimetics ;  design ;  methods ;  process ;  tools
Union renewal: what can we learn from three decades of research?,"Drawing on three decades of research on union renewal, this article asks what we can learn from these studies. It covers successively the modernisation of union strategy, the re-engineering of union structures and organising techniques, the renewal of collective action repertoires, and the search to bridge the gap between labour market insiders and outsiders. While the research on these four themes yields few easy answers, it does highlight a continuing search for trade union renewal from which real understanding emerges. The overarching argument is that this long process of democratic experimentalism in union purpose and practice needs to be understood in exactly those terms. It also highlights the critical role of strategic capabilities and the need to develop these capabilities in order to experiment with innovations likely to reveal new sources of vigour for worker organisations.",Murray G.,Journal,Transfer,2017-02-01,Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire sur la Mondialisation et le Travail;University of Montreal,capabilities ;  experimentation ;  insiders and outsiders ;  organising ;  union democracy ;  Union renewal ;  union repertoires ;  union revitalisation
Can intersectional innovations reduce hospital infection?,"Preventing healthcare-associated infection remains an international priority given the clinical and economic consequences of this largely preventable patient safety harm. Whereas important strides have been made in preventing hospital infections over the past several decades, thorny issues remain, including how to consistently improve hand hygiene rates and further reduce device-related complications such as catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Rather than relying solely on directional innovations – incremental changes that continue to serve as the bedrock of scientific advancement – perhaps we should also search for ‘intersectional innovations’, which represent breakthrough discoveries that emanate from the intersection of often widely divergent disciplines. Several intersectional innovations that have the potential to greatly impact infection prevention efforts include human factors engineering, sociology, and engaging the senses. Indeed, Professor Edward Joseph Lister Lowbury, the namesake of this lecture, exemplified intersectional thinking in his own life, having been both an accomplished bacteriologist and poet. By incorporating approaches outside of traditional biomedical science we may hope to provide patients with the safe care they expect and deserve.",Saint S.,Journal,Journal of Hospital Infection,2017-02-01,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System;University of Michigan Medical School,Culture ;  Hospital infection ;  Human factors engineering ;  Intersectional innovation ;  Senses ;  Sociology
A literature study for DEA applied to energy and environment,"This study systematically summarizes previous research efforts on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) applied to energy and environment in the past four decades, including concepts and methodologies on DEA environmental assessment. Industrial developments are very important for all nations in terms of their economic prosperities. A problem is that the development produces various pollutions on air, water and other types of contaminations, all of which are usually associated with our health problems and climate changes. Thus, it is necessary for us to consider how to make a balance between economic success and pollution mitigation to maintain a high level of social sustainability in the world. It is widely considered that DEA is one of the methodologies to examine the level of sustainability. This study examines a recent research trend on DEA applications from 1980s to 2010s. Nowadays, many researchers have paid serious attention on how to combat various difficulties in the areas of energy and environment. As a result, the number of articles on DEA applications on energy and environment has dramatically increased, particularly after 2000s. However, it is true that DEA has strengths and drawbacks in the applications. Therefore, it is very important for us to carefully use DEA for guiding large policy issues and business strategies such as the global warming and climate change. An underlying premise of this study is that technology innovation in engineering and natural science may solve various problems by linking it with political and managerial efforts. The use of DEA provides a methodological linkage among them, so enhancing the practicality in mitigating problems due to climate change and environmental pollutions. This literature study, along with a summary on conceptual and methodological developments, provides us with guidelines for our future research works on DEA on energy and environment issues.",Sueyoshi T.; Yuan Y.; Goto M.,Journal,Energy Economics,2017-02-01,Institute of Science Tokyo;New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology,DEA ;  Disposability ;  Energy ;  Environment ;  Sustainability
From open innovation to enginomics: Paradigm shifts,"Background Food engineering is at a crossroads. Inertia, combined with diminishing research funding, declining new academic positions, combined with disruptive and emerging competitive adjacent domains have a heavy toll on the field and its attractiveness for talented faculty members and students. The proliferation and flourishing of many bio-disciplines highlight the acute need for food engineering profession to revise its vision, strategy and missions and to reinvigorate and expand its horizon. Open innovation is a concept developed for commercial applications for gaining competitive advantages. Open innovation is based on utilizing both external and internal ideas and open channels for accessing and employing knowledge and solutions. Open innovation main philosophy should be adopted to integrate, assimilate and synergize food engineering core fundamental principles and to build on the accelerating developments in emerging knowledge, science and technology. Scope and approach To fully benefit from the vast future emerging opportunities, food engineering is faced with a plethora of demanding challenges (e.g., new curricula, innovation ecosystem, partnerships, creativity, multidisciplinary, entrepreneurship, sustainability, food and nutrition security, population growth, health and wellness, nutrition, bioavailability). ‘Enginomics’ (engineering + omics) - a new term coined to express some of the major food engineering future challenges that holistically combines food processing and human internal digestion. It calls for studying human internal transport phenomena, utilization of new techniques (e.g., micro-processing, virtualization) for modelling and simulation, emerging topics (e.g., bioavailability, signaling, satiety, personalized nutrigenomics, targeting, pro- and prebiotics, nanotechnology, biotechnology), as well as traditional food and product engineering. Key findings and conclusions The food engineering domain should rise to future mounting challenges and opportunities by redefining its vision and strategy recapturing its significant roles, and stopping the loss of its graduates in the competitions with other fields. Several paradigm shifts are recommended including reinventing its curricula in pursuing of excellence with a start-up-university (innoversity) mentality, new mindset for promoting open innovation, implementing virtualization, embracing enginomics and social responsibility. As a part of enginomics and health and wellness, the development of low cost, fast and accurate bioavailability tests is required. Open innovation provides food engineers with the unique prospects for spearheading the four-helix innovation ecosystem. Both basic and applied science and utilizing of the most advanced and up-to-date technologies and scientific breakthroughs are paramount.",Saguy S.; Taoukis P.,Journal,Trends in Food Science and Technology,2017-02-01,Hebrew University of Jerusalem;National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),Bioavailability ;  Innovation ecosystem ;  New curricula ;  Nonthermal processing ;  Open innovation
Research performance and teaching quality in the Spanish higher education system: Evidence from a medium-sized university,"This paper studies the relationship between research performance and teaching quality in the context of the Spanish university system. We investigate whether there is a relationship between being an active researcher and teaching quality of college professors in Spain. We use a data set from the University of Extremadura, which contains information on teaching evaluations and research performance over a ten year period (from 2001–2002 to 2011–2012). Our results suggest that, on average, professors who are more involved in research obtain better results in their teaching evaluations. We also suggest that this positive link between research and teaching is non-linear, as we find a larger improvement in teaching quality from additional research at lower levels of research intensity. Additionally, we show that the relationship between teaching and research is not constant along the distribution of teaching scores, and that the teaching quality of professors in the lower quantiles is much more related to their research intensity than that of professors in the top quantiles.",Artés J.; Pedraja-Chaparro F.; Salinas-JiméneZ M.,Journal,Research Policy,2017-02-01,Universidad Complutense de Madrid;Universidad de Extremadura,Higher education ;  Research output ;  Teaching performance

The Future of Structural Chemistry Nucleates in the Present,"A personal view of nearly four decades of structural chemistry is presented. The rise of molecular crystal engineering as an independent cross-disciplinary field of research at the intersection of crystallography with supramolecular chemistry and solid-state reactivity is discussed in light of the development of theoretical and instrumental tools and the need for novel molecular materials. The exchange of ideas and experience within the structural chemistry community has played a fundamental role in reaching the present high level of understanding of the factors that control crystal formation and stability. Crystal-oriented synthetic strategies, including solvent-free mechanochemical methods, have been developed, as well as screening methods and computational approaches. Some drawbacks and limitations are also discussed. The wealth of multiple crystal forms, from single-molecule crystals to solvates, co-crystals, salts and ionic co-crystals, and their polymorphs, is both an open challenge to the crystal engineering paradigm and a source of discovery and innovation.",Braga D.,Journal,Israel Journal of Chemistry,2017-02-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,crystal engineering ;  crystal growth ;  polymorphism ;  solid-state structures ;  supramolecular chemistry
Propagation from the start: the spread of a concept-based instructional tool,"We describe the propagation of a technology-based educational innovation through its first 3 years of public use. The innovation studied is the Concept Warehouse (CW), a database-driven website developed to support the use of concept-based pedagogies. This tool was initially developed for instructors in undergraduate chemical engineering courses, but has spread to other disciplines as well. In this time, it has grown to over 650 registered instructors representing over 170 institutions. While this study is specific to a particular case, the intent of this article is to provide an exemplar of real-time propagation that informs other researchers and developers. We frame our analysis with Diffusion of Innovation Theory and use a design research methodology that focuses on communication channels, types of knowledge, and stages of the innovation-decision process. Data sources include usage records and survey responses which are analyzed with network diagrams and non-parametric statistics. We find that in comparison to mass media, interpersonal communications tended to result in higher proportions of how-to knowledge and implementation. Three types of opinion leaders were identified through user data and network diagrams. All played critical roles in the tool’s propagation, especially the project collaborators—opinion leaders who actively promoted the CW, in part, because it also propagates their own innovations. Finally, users with self-identified prior principles knowledge showed statistically significantly greater progress in gaining how-to knowledge, but no significant difference in progressing to the implementation stage of the innovation-decision process when compared to users without.",Friedrichsen D.; Smith C.; Koretsky M.,Journal,Educational Technology Research and Development,2017-02-01,College of Engineering,Communication channels ;  Diffusion of innovations ;  Instructional technology ;  Pedagogy ;  Principles knowledge ;  Propagation
Human factor: the competitive advantage driver of the EU’s logistics sector,"This article aims to test the weight that main sub-components of the global competitiveness index might have on the logistics performance index. We deploy a novel technique based on three newly particularised clusters (‘infrastructure’, ‘institutions’ and ‘human factor’) to look into whether such clusters are related to efficiency in the 28 European Union’s countries. It is manifest that the human factor is far more important for improving the logistics performance index than infrastructure and institutions. It follows that in this new domain of analysis, all initiatives to prioritise investment on the human factor are appropriate means of stimulating innovation and economic outlook, perceived that the logistics sector accounts for an average of 10% of the European Union’s GDP.",D’Aleo V.; Sergi B.,Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2017-02-01,Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies;Università degli Studi di Messina,competitiveness ;  human factor ;  logistics ;  operational research ;  performance measures
The use of technology platforms as a policy tool to address research challenges and technology transfer,"The paper analyses technology platforms (TPs) that are seen as a valuable policy instrument to assist a multi-stakeholder formulation and implementation of long-term research and development (R&D) programs in specific technology areas. TP are predominantly initiated by policy-makers to support a wide range of priority technologies through direct funding and indirect support measures, information and technology transfer at economy or industry level. The authors propose a theoretical approach to TPs as a science, technology and innovation policy concept. A taxonomy of TPs is offered that may be useful for policy-makers in designing the R&D support measures through assessing a platform’s risk level.

Criteria to assess potential reverse innovations: Opportunities for shared learning between high- and low-income countries,"Background: Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are developing novel approaches to healthcare that may be relevant to high-income countries (HICs). These include products, services, organizational processes, or policies that improve access, cost, or efficiency of healthcare. However, given the challenge of replication, it is difficult to identify innovations that could be successfully adapted to high-income settings. We present a set of criteria for evaluating the potential impact of LMIC innovations in HIC settings. Methods: An initial framework was drafted based on a literature review, and revised iteratively by applying it to LMIC examples from the Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) program database. The resulting criteria were then reviewed using a modified Delphi process by the Reverse Innovation Working Group, consisting of 31 experts in medicine, engineering, management and political science, as well as representatives from industry and government, all with an expressed interest in reverse innovation. Results: The resulting 8 criteria are divided into two steps with a simple scoring system. First, innovations are assessed according to their success within the LMIC context according to metrics of improving accessibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and overall effectiveness. Next, they are scored for their potential for spread to HICs, according to their ability to address an HIC healthcare challenge, compatibility with infrastructure and regulatory requirements, degree of novelty, and degree of current collaboration with HICs. We use examples to illustrate where programs which appear initially promising may be unlikely to succeed in a HIC setting due to feasibility concerns. Conclusions: This study presents a framework for identifying reverse innovations that may be useful to policymakers and funding agencies interested in identifying novel approaches to addressing cost and access to care in HICs. We solicited expert feedback and consensus on an empirically-derived set of criteria to create a practical tool for funders that can be used directly and tested prospectively using current databases of LMIC programs.",Bhattacharyya O.; Wu D.; Mossman K.; Hayden L.; Gill P.; Cheng Y.; Daar A.; Soman D.; Synowiec C.; Taylor A.; Wong J.; Von Zedtwitz M.; Zlotkin S.; Mitchell W.; McGahan A.,Journal,Globalization and Health,2017-01-25,Results for Development;Rotman School of Management;Kaunas University of Technology;The Hospital for Sick Children;North York General Hospital;University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine;Women's College Hospital;University of Toronto;Duke University,Global health ;  Healthcare delivery models ;  Innovation ;  Low- and middle-income countries ;  Reverse innovation
Corporate social responsibility and its effect on innovation and firm performance: An empirical research in SMEs,"The link between CSR and business value has been investigated, but a significant research gap remains when considering the relationship between CSR and innovation. The paper assesses its relationship with organizational innovation and firm performance in a single integrative model by using structural equation modelling on a data set of 552 Spanish firms. Our results supports a partial mediation effect of innovation performance on the relationship between CSR and firm performance, since the effect of CSR on firm performance shrinks upon the addition of innovation performance to the model.

Control of perishable goods in cold logistic chains by bionanosensors,"Nanotechnology can contribute to food security in supply chains of agri production-consumption systems. The unique properties of nanoparticles have stimulated the increasing interest in their application as biosensing. Biosensing devices are designed for the biological recognition of events and signal transduction. Many types of nanoparticles can be used as biosensors, but gold nanoparticles have sparked most interest. In the work presented here, we will address the problem of fruit and vegetable decay and rotting during transportation and storage, which could be easily generalized also onto post-harvest loss prevention in general. During the process of rotting, different compounds, including different gasses, are released into the environment. The application of sensitive bionanosensors in the storage/transport containers can detect any changes due to fruit and vegetable decay and transduce the signal. The goal of this is to reduce the logistics cost for this items. Therefore, our approach requires a multidisciplinary and an interdisciplinary approach in science and technology. The cold supply chain is namely a science, a technology and a process which combines applied bio-nanotechnology, innovations in the industrial engineering of cooling processes including sensors for temperature and humidity measurements, transportation, and applied mathematics. It is a science, since it requires the understanding of chemical and biological processes linked to perishability and the systems theory which enables the developing of a theoretical framework for the control of systems with perturbed time-lags. Secondly, it is a technology developed in engineering which relies on the physical means to assure appropriate temperature conditions along the CSC and, thirdly, it is also a process, since a series of tasks must be performed to prepare, store, and transport the cargo as well as monitor the temperature and humidity of sensitive cargo and give proper feedback control, as it will be outlined in this chapter. Therefore, we shall discuss how to break the silos of separated knowledge to build an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary science of post-harvest loss prevention. Considering the sensors as floating activity cells, modelled as floating nodes, in a graph of such a system, an extended Material Requirement Planning (MRP) theory will be described which will make it possible to determine the optimal feedback control in post-harvest loss prevention, based on bionanosensors. Therefore, we present also a model how to use nanotechnology from the packaging facility to the final retail. Any changes in time, distance, humidity or temperature in the chain could cause the Net Present Value (NPV) of the activities and their added value in the supply chain to be perturbed, as presented in the subchapter. In this chapter we give the answers to the questions, how to measure the effects of some perturbations in a supply chain on the stability of perishable agricultural goods in such systems and how nanotechnology can contribute with the appropriate packaging and control which preserves the required level of quality and quantity of the product at the final delivery. The presented model will not include multicriteria optimization but will stay at the NPV approach. But the annuity stream achieved by improved sensing and feedback control could be easily combined with environmental and medical/health criteria. An interdisciplinary perspective of industrial engineering and management demonstrates how the development of creative ideas born in separate research fields can be liaised into an innovative design of smart control devices and their installation in trucks and warehouses. These innovative technologies could contribute to an increase in the NPV of activities in the supply chains of perishable goods in general.",Bogataj D.; Drobne D.,Book,"Materials Science and Engineering: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",2017-01-11,Univerza v Ljubljani;Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,
Teaching and Learning of Divergent & Convergent Thinking Skills using DCT,"Enriching design and creative thinking skills is unaccountably vital in these times of rapid changes and highly competitive pressure for elevated innovation. Thus training engineering undergraduates in design thinking form a substantial role in their making. Divergent and Convergent thinking skills are one of the most predominant design thinking skills which are needed to tailor novel and innovative solutions to a given problem. In an earlier study steered by Reddy (2016) [1], an intervention was proposed and executed, which amalgamated developing both divergent and convergent thinking during the multiple phases of problem solution in engineering. The above mentioned intervention used open problem solving and the method of scaffolding as a means of integrating these thinking skills in student training. The Intervention was conceptualized and employed in natural settings in order to investigate the ecological validity of the proposed intervention. The first iteration of the Design Based Research (DBR) exhibited significant improvisation in students thinking skills in both divergence and convergence. The present study makes an effort towards realizing the need of a tool to accustom the intervention designed by Reddy. We propose a system which integrates open problem solving and the process of training students' develop their divergent and convergent thinking skills. The various features of the tool are upheld in a way that can effectively result in high performance of the desired thinking skills. Through this study we explore the second cycle of DBR as an extension of study geared by Reddy, by effectively rendering a technology enhanced learning environment in the form of a Web Based learning Tool (WBLT). The sample comprised of a mixture of MSc/MCA/BE or equivalent students (n=15). The most significant finding was that the Divergence and Convergence Thinking Skills showed noteworthy upsurge when student performance was evaluated and compared against their pre-test. The role of the tool in increasing these design thinking skills is being studied in this paper and the usability reported.",Pathan R.; Khwaja U.; Reddy D.; Kamat V.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - IEEE 8th International Conference on Technology for Education, T4E 2016",2017-01-11,Goa University;Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,Design Thinking Skills ;  Divergent and Convergent Thinking Skills ;  Open Problem ;  Scaffolds
Technological entrepreneurship for IT/IS innovations and inventions,"Exploitation of university research have been recognized as an important driving force for technology transfer and societal benefit. However, the level of success of commercialization of inventions (innovations) for IT/IS (and engineering) from higher institution to industry is insufficient.

Consuming use orientated product service systems: A consumer culture theory perspective,"Research suggests that product service systems (PSS) may usefully form part of the mix of innovations necessary to move society toward more sustainable futures. However, PSS implementation rates are disappointingly low and an implementation gap has emerged. Drawing on consumer culture theory (CCT), this paper provides insights to help resolve this issue in business to consumer markets. Since consumption of use orientated PSS is analogous to access based consumption, six dimensions of access are set out to analyse a case study of infant car seat provision. Five outcomes are derived from the analysis and these include partial identification with accessed product and interplay of use and symbolic value. This analysis questions the view that PSS do not create sufficient value to overcome a preference for ownership in western societies. Rather, PSS consumption is likely to arise when both functional and symbolic value are extracted by consumers and when PSS are promoted to appropriate consumer groups such as ‘nomads’. Further research is needed to explore these phenomena and address the issues they raise in PSS design processes.",Catulli M.; Cook M.; Potter S.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2017-01-10,The Open University,Consumer culture theory ;  Diffusion ;  Infant care products ;  Product service systems ;  Sustainable futures
The electric road system transition from a system to a system-of-systems,"Electric roads have had a pleasant journey through the research landscape but are now about to enter the 'valley of death.' The basic technologies for dynamic power transfer from the road to vehicles in motion has been developed through various research projects across the globe, largely supported by public funding. Electric road systems (ERS) will soon be tested on public roads, but is still a long way from constituting a large-scale commercial system. While ERS has gained recognition as a technological solution, few studies address the necessary system transition from a holistic perspective. This article addresses this gap by presenting the state of the art of ERS and examining future use case scenarios and stakeholder implications. The purpose of this article is accordingly to examine how ERS not only constitutes a technical development challenge, but also radically increases technical, business, and systems complexity. This article illustrates how ERS will likely evolve from a system to a system of systems and the likely changes in the business and system architecture occurring during this transformation will be analyzed.

Neural recording and modulation technologies,"In the mammalian nervous system, billions of neurons connected by quadrillions of synapses exchange electrical, chemical and mechanical signals. Disruptions to this network manifest as neurological or psychiatric conditions. Despite decades of neuroscience research, our ability to treat or even to understand these conditions is limited by the capability of tools to probe the signalling complexity of the nervous system. Although orders of magnitude smaller and computationally faster than neurons, conventional substrate-bound electronics do not recapitulate the chemical and mechanical properties of neural tissue. This mismatch results in a foreign-body response and the encapsulation of devices by glial scars, suggesting that the design of an interface between the nervous system and a synthetic sensor requires additional materials innovation. Advances in genetic tools for manipulating neural activity have fuelled the demand for devices that are capable of simultaneously recording and controlling individual neurons at unprecedented scales. Recently, flexible organic electronics and bio- and nanomaterials have been developed for multifunctional and minimally invasive probes for long-term interaction with the nervous system. In this Review, we discuss the design lessons from the quarter-century-old field of neural engineering, highlight recent materials-driven progress in neural probes and look at emergent directions inspired by the principles of neural transduction.",Chen R.; Canales A.; Anikeeva P.,Journal,Nature Reviews Materials,2017-01-04,MIT School of Engineering,
A qualitative research on the difference of expectation to NPD related to two occupational categories in Japanese enterprises,"Although it has been said that conceiving potential needs and customers is important for realizing innovations, companies have had difficulty in getting through new product development (NPD) looking toward the prospective demand because of high risk. Former studies have shown that there are differences of NPD strategies employed by companies depending on whether one aims NPD for potential needs or not. This study focuses not on the differences of NPD strategies in companies but on what each occupation expects for NPD. Several open-end-type questionnaire surveys on employees from Japanese companies who have experienced medium to long term perspective idea generating workshops have revealed that occupational categories can be divided into two groups by the differences of expectation to NPD; rapid-fire NPD expectation group and late bloomer NPD expectation group. The former group which consists of marketing experts and engineering experts, tends to expect just responding to existing needs and gaining profit expeditiously in NPD, and the latter that comprises of design experts and research experts, tends to expect realizing future innovations in NPD. This study implies the confrontation with two occupation groups prevent Japanese enterprises from realizing future innovations.",Furue N.; Washida Y.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Hitotsubashi University,

Art thinking beyond design thinking Mazda design: Car as art,"This research proposes the importance of art-thinking as compared with design-thinking, using a case study of Mazda. The Japanese automobile firm has been introducing a series of successful new products in the past few years, featuring art-thinking approach. Mazda publicly declares that 'the car is art,' and has been winning numerous design awards. In our definition, design-thinking tries to meet specific customer needs, while art-thinking pursues more fundamental values. There are two critical differences between the two. First, art-thinking focuses more on fundamental values than specific customer needs. Artists try to express their emotions and beliefs. Second, with art-thinking, designers would not compromise themselves easily, partially because they pursue internal expression. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of art-thinking and to investigate its actual application with in-depth study of Mazda. Design team at Mazda led by a charismatic design director, Ikuo Maeda, has been working on car design motivated by art-thinking. We have interviewed five chief designers and Ikuo Maeda to achieve these research purposes. We believe that this paper proposes the importance of a concept of art-thinking for social innovation, using empirical evidences from Mazda case.",Nobeoka K.; Kimura M.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Hitotsubashi University,
How to motivate external open innovation-partners: Identifying suitable measures,"Shorter product life cycles require shorter innovation cycles which forces companies to launch new innovative products on the market at increasingly shorter intervals to stay competitive. A promising approach to face this challenge is described as the new paradigm of Open Innovation (OI) where knowledge of external partners (e.g. suppliers, product users or universities) is used to accelerate the company internal innovation process. Thereby, the motivation of external partners is, among other things, crucial for the success of an OI-collaboration. So far there is no systematic approach available in literature that provides guidance for finding the right 'levers' to motivate these external partners to contribute their knowledge within an Ol-collaboration. For this purpose, the present paper provides a methodology for identifying appropriate measures to motivate external partners depending on the type of cooperation (e.g. Idea Platform, Lead-User-Workshop or Cross-Industry Innovations). Based on existing models in the research field of motivation psychology, suitable motivational factors are derived and considered. Finally, an interactive software-tool for raising the usability of the methodology is introduced.",Holle M.; Elsesser L.; Schuhmacher M.; Lindemann U.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Technische Universität München,

"Evaluating inclusive innovative performance: The case of the eHealth system of the Western Cape Region, South Africa","This paper presents a theoretical framework for determining the inclusive innovative performance of the eHealth innovation system in the Western Cape region in South Africa. The authors critically reflect on exclusion and inclusion as a process and draws on the innovation systems approach towards developing a possible set of inclusive innovation performance indicators. The inclusive innovation system literature is still in its infancy with most of the contributions being theoretical and conceptual with a lack of empirical work. Apart from being unclear of what such a system would actually look like in reality, there is also a lack of clear methodologies for the analysis of inclusive innovation systems. The analysis method of the Technological Innovation Systems literature was found to be the most appropriate and was adapted in this research. This entails the nature of innovations required; actors involved and the relations among each other; the type of learning they take on; and the institutional environment they are operating in. From the literature an eight step framework was developed as follows: 1) Define the inclusive innovation system in focus; 2) Identify structural components; 3) Identify functions; 4) System failure approach; 5) Inducement and blocking mechanisms; 6) Phase of development; 7) Assessing functionality and setting process goals; 8) Addressing key policy issues. The framework summarizes and sets out the theoretical underpinning for the empirical stage, on which this framework will be applied, to improve the general understanding of the innovative performance of the eHealth innovation system in the Western Cape region in South Africa.",Van Der Merwe E.; Grobbelaar S.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Stellenbosch University;Centre for Research on Evaluation;DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Scientometrics and Science,

Academic performance management policy for changing roles of universities in innovation systems,"The purpose of this study is to establish a new performance measurement method for academic actors for their changing roles in innovation systems. The widely accepted triple helix and systems of innovation models show changing and overlapping roles of academic, industrial and governmental actors. In previous innovation systems, universities were not focused on applied research and technology transfer as much as they are now. Current literature shows a changing role of universities and importance of their involvement in innovation systems. Although academic organizations' roles have changed in innovation systems, academic performance measurement systems (APMS) are not adapted to examine innovation related performance factors. Many APMS focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as; publications, research projects and patents. However, the new APMS needs to assess the activities and processes that are related to innovation, such as; technology transfer processes, collaborative innovation activities, consultancies and academic spin-offs. For this study a new APMS is applied according to the needs of universities by using a synthetic data based on an engineering department's KPIs. APMS scores are calculated based on the cumulative metric of all research and innovation activities and, weighted according to the needs and considerations of the university. The results of this study show that many of those academicians who have great performance in publications and academic research do not necessarily have high-level performance in innovative activities. In fact the results show that those who had high points in some measurements have very low performance in others. For the management point of view, it may be more effective to position academicians for different roles and assess their performance accordingly as innovation-targeted, teaching-targeted and research-targeted academicians.",Ozcan S.; Ozyazici M.; Ozerdem M.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Bahçeşehir Üniversitesi;Izmir Ekonomi Üniversitesi,
How university technology transfer offices at US medical schools value innovation,"Commercializing innovations remains essential to meeting societal goals. The licensing of university discoveries offers important benefits; in 2014, academic research in the US led to $28 billion in product sales and 965 new products from licensed university work (AUTM). Each of the top 15 institutions collected at least $100 million; some over $400 million. Valuation strategies used in the licensing process have important implications for universities and their prospective licensing partners. A school's financial and IP-related objectives color the innovation portfolio, as well as the willingness of external enterprises to license innovations. Medical schools offer particular opportunities to improve the world's standard of living, and this study focuses on methods used to establish a priori value for their university-sponsored research. Technology licensing offices in US institutions were interviewed. Overall, about one-third of the respondents' technology is licensed; respondents represent about 40% of all licensing revenue reported by AUTM. Generally, about one-half of the medical institutions estimate the value of their IP prior to licensing, primarily via comparison with comparable technologies. About 50% consider non-financial metrics in the process: noting both the value to society and the nature of the technology, per se. Implications and lessons learned are discussed.",Hallam C.; Munson J.; Spivey W.; Wurth B.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,University of Strathclyde;Santa Clara University;The University of Texas at San Antonio,
Examining the role of Global Value Chains in the context of smart specialisation strategies (S3),"This paper examines the EU's policy of Smart Specialisation in the context of Global Value Chains. Technology upgrading is highly dependent on whether countries and regions use global value chains and international R&D networks as levers, linkages and mechanisms of learning. The key challenge for S3 which is still very much unexplored is how can the local production stage of GVC become a building block of regional innovation strategy? There are policy views which argue that GVCs are key to technology upgrading. Linking is everything and there are suggestions that countries or regions should link up only when they are able to benefit i.e. they need first build endogenous technological capability and only then link up. In the past a dominant feature of earlier regional and national research strategies has been an excessive inward orientation or domestic led modernization but starting with S3, there is a requirement to provide evidence that each S3 strategy is sufficiently outward looking. While outward looking can mean inward oriented SSS which has taken into account the global context, within the EU context it also means taking account of what other regions are doing and where complementarities arise, engaging with those other regions. On the other hand, there are limits of only GVC led upgrading. This paper explores how to transationalize S3 and offers insight into the key elements that need to be incorporated into a policy tool box that can help policy makers achieve such an objective.",Brennan L.; Rakhmatullin R.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Trinity Business School;European Commission Joint Research Centre,
Non-R&D-based innovation and the growth of SMEs in China: A case study of Hangzhou FC company,"Recently, a growing number of academic research shows that this R&D-focused view of innovation ignores the other popular innovation activities in SM Es, which cannot explain that some SMEs with weak R&D capability still be innovative. Further, relevant studies have indicated that absorptive capacity is closely related to the degree of benefit SMEs can get from non-R&D-based innovation. Non-R&D-based innovation provides newly innovative ideas for the enterprise, while absorptive capacity helps enterprises to adapt to the diverse actual situations, which further improves the innovation performance. Therefore, this paper is trying to reveal the pervasive non-R&D-based innovation practices in Chinese SMEs basing on a case study of Fashion in China (FC in short). It shows that non-R&D-based innovation activities, namely technology adoption, imitation and reverse engineering, design, innovative implication of existing knowledge, etc., have positive effects on innovative performance, and the enterprise's absorptive capacity also has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between non-R&D-based innovation activities and innovation performance. This research argues that, non-R&D-based innovation activities are very effective and popular for SMEs' survival and growth and the continuous investment in absorptive capacity can help to further enhance the effects of non-R&D-based innovation.",Zheng Q.; Guo Y.; Lei M.; Zheng G.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,"School of Management, Zhejiang University",
From literature to practice: Selection criteria for industry-university partners,"To strategically exploit open innovation, many companies continue to expand their research collaboration with universities to boost the novelty and speed of innovation development. Recently, literatures propose various sets of criteria for selecting universities as partners but the research on practicality and generalizability of such applications are still limited. This explorative study reveals how managers apply the criteria from literature into the practice for their industry-university collaboration. The structured interviews were conducted and the quotations were extracted to obtain common criteria. The result of case studies reveals that both systematic and traditional approaches are applied in partner selection. With a systematic approach, the academic databases and partner profiles are used along with expert judgment to support the decision whereas a traditional approach relies on trust which emerges from collaboration experiences and personal connection.",Manotungvorapun N.; Gerdsri N.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Mahidol University,

An integrated innovation management model from the viewpoint fitting customer value: Based on Chinese cases,"Based on management situation analysis of local Chinese companies which have weak management foundation and previous researches, we find there are five typical basic management bottlenecks which prevent these companies from achieving innovation performance: strategic management, cultural representation, organizational form, management mechanism, execution. We track the present one of the fast-growth Chinese companies, Beijing XIAOMI Science and Technology Co. Ltd., deeply analyze the case, especially XIAOMI's attitude on the five associated core management elements above. XIAOMI has extended definition of their own innovation management through the way that highly fits the external customers' values and expectations, and it reflects an apparent characteristic of management and a unique management style. Therefore, XIAOMI has achieved rapid growth. After further analysis and research, we find that these five elements interact with each other and constitute a fundamental modern innovation management style. Based on this, we try to construct a theoretical framework, Pentagon Model, an innovation management model, which can be used for reference by local Chinese firms.",Xie F.; Li B.; Xie P.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,"Antai College of Economics and Management;Université Côte d'Azur;Georgia Institute of Technology;Beijing Daluhangxing Quality Certification Center Co., Ltd",

Technology assessment: A role for UNESCO and S&T parks,"Globalization and information/communication technology, as well as new modes of assessment, have opened new prospects for the practice of technology assessment. These prospects hold the potential for realizing the technology assessment role that has long heen recommended for UNESCO and other United Nations agencies. They may also solve the problem of research parks that, as 'hyhrid organizations,' have failed to mesh with the cultural values of their surrounding communities. This paper highlights the new prospects for assessment, and identifies the institutional gaps in assessment practice. We propose, as a solution, that assessment become a function of an international network of research parks, with the official recognition and clearinghouse services of an international agency. We find this proposal aligns well with the recent technology assessment literature and its implications, and we put forth the Daejeon/ UNESCO Global Innovation Forum as a possible network platform.",Oh D.; Phillips F.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Chungnam National University;Yuan Ze University,
Flexibility of organizational structure in a context of organizational innovations and modern concepts of enterprise Management,"Flexibility of the organizational structure of enterprises depends, among others, on the organizational strategy of enterprise's management. Contemporary concepts of the management of knowledge based enterprises: learning, intelligent, virtual and agile, assume high level of organizational structure flexibility. The literature analysis indicates however that theoretical postulates are only partially confirmed by empirical studies and case studies. The analysis of particular dimensions of organizational structure shows important differences between theoretical postulates and empirical studies. As much as the results of comparison of Configuration and Centralization dimensions' flexibility are consistent, the comparison of dimensions Specialization, Standardization and Formalization brings inconsistent conclusions. Author's own research on the organizational structure of Polish enterprises based on two large empirical research projects undertaken at the Faculty of Engineering Management of Poznan University of Technology, the first project conducted in 2012, called 'Adjustment of enterprises' management systems to knowledge-based economy', and the second one in 2014, called 'Determinants of implementing modern methods and technics of management in Polish enterprises' Both these empirical studies included surveys of 150 enterprises representing Polish economy. The results of these studies confirm the low level of organizational structure flexibility with regard to dimensions of Specialization, Standardization and Formalization. Moreover it was proven that for all dimensions of organizational structure, the level of flexibility depends on the functional area of the enterprise (marketing and sales, research and development, operational activity, administration).",Pawlowski E.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Politechnika Poznanska,

Diffusion of multiple technology generations: An agent-based simulation approach,"Agent-based modeling has recently gained much attention in innovation and technology diffusion research. It enriches traditional approaches (like the well-known Bass model, based on differential equations) by modeling the diffusion process from a micro-level perspective. This allows, for instance, for considering the heterogeneity of consumers, who differ in their preferences, are distributed across geographical regions, are connected to each other in various ways within a social network, and act as well as react based on limited information. Although multiple successive technology generations got some attention in innovation and technology diffusion research using traditional approaches (since the Norton-Bass model in 1987), agent-based models have hardly focused on this important aspect of the diffusion process. Therefore, the presented agent-based simulation aims at investigating the diffusion of new products from multiple successive technology generations. The model accounts for novel product features in each generation, normative influences, and a social network that reflects both, spatial and social proximity between consumers. A historical validation is conducted by replicating the diffusion of computers (desktops, notebooks, tablets) on the German market from 1994 to 2013.",Günther M.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Universität Bielefeld,
The impact of collaboration with big companies on entrepreneurial technology innovation,"Startups and small and medium sized companies are an important source for technology innovation. Cooperation with big companies reinforces technological innovation but it can also hamper entrepreneurial undertakings. This research considers the impact of cooperative activities of startups or small and medium sized companies with big companies in regard to technology innovation in the automotive industry. The analysis of 16 cases gives a first overview about the particular characteristics of cooperative activities in an industry that suffers from disruptive innovation and new players. The analysis covers the reasons for cooperation, the desired partner characteristics, and the benefits and sacrifices caused by the cooperative activities. Risk and cost reduction are not seen as critical by big companies regarding the decision for or against the collaboration. Their focus is on knowledge gain and new ideas. Startups or small and medium sized companies on the other hand seek for market entry and public relation. Cooperation is not primarily considered as a source for venture capital. Public funding as a financial source for innovative work is underestimated except for university cooperation. The study bases on eight expert interviews with CEOs, founders and technical directors with wide experience in research and development cooperation.",Grochowski E.; Warschat J.; Dasher R.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Universität Stuttgart;Stanford University;Fraunhofer Lao,
Trends in and factors influencing PCT applications by Japanese universities,"To promote the creation of innovations, it is imperative that new technologies by universities are patented and transferred to private companies. This study aims to reveal the trends in and factors influencing PCT applications by Japanese universities. Data on 4,158 applications for 2008-2012 were collected from the J-PlatPat database and those for university performance, research activities, and industry-academia collaboration were compiled from documents of universities and the Japanese government. The results revealed that PCT applications are mainly filed in the engineering and medicine fields, of which 45.4% are joint applications with private companies. In addition, we perform a multiple regression analysis to obtain the number of PCT applications per professor using five explanatory variable (R2 = 70.7%). The results elucidated that PCT applications were influenced by industry-academia collaboration and faculty structure. In conclusion, it is conceivable that PCT applications by Japanese universities have the potentialities for technology transfers from universities to private companies.",Yamaguchi Y.; Fujimoto J.; Yamazaki A.; Koshiyama T.,Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2016 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management For Social Innovation, Proceedings",2017-01-04,Chiba Institute of Technology,

Synthetic genome engineering forging new frontiers for wine yeast,"Over the past 15 years, the seismic shifts caused by the convergence of biomolecular, chemical, physical, mathematical, and computational sciences alongside cutting-edge developments in information technology and engineering have erupted into a new field of scientific endeavor dubbed Synthetic Biology. Recent rapid advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis techniques are enabling the design and construction of new biological parts (genes), devices (gene networks) and modules (biosynthetic pathways), and the redesign of biological systems (cells and organisms) for useful purposes. In 2014, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae became the first eukaryotic cell to be equipped with a fully functional synthetic chromosome. This was achieved following the synthesis of the first viral (poliovirus in 2002 and bacteriophage Phi-X174 in 2003) and bacterial (Mycoplasma genitalium in 2008 and Mycoplasma mycoides in 2010) genomes, and less than two decades after revealing the full genome sequence of a laboratory (S288c in 1996) and wine (AWRI1631 in 2008) yeast strain. A large international project–the Synthetic Yeast Genome (Sc2.0) Project–is now underway to synthesize all 16 chromosomes (∼12 Mb carrying ∼6000 genes) of the sequenced S288c laboratory strain by 2018. If successful, S. cerevisiae will become the first eukaryote to cross the horizon of in silico design of complex cells through de novo synthesis, reshuffling, and editing of genomes. In the meantime, yeasts are being used as cell factories for the semi-synthetic production of high-value compounds, such as the potent antimalarial artemisinin, and food ingredients, such as resveratrol, vanillin, stevia, nootkatone, and saffron. As a continuum of previously genetically engineered industrially important yeast strains, precision genome engineering is bound to also impact the study and development of wine yeast strains supercharged with synthetic DNA. The first taste of what the future holds is the de novo production of the raspberry ketone aroma compound, 4-[4-hydroxyphenyl]butan-2-one, in a wine yeast strain (AWRI1631), which was recently achieved via metabolic pathway engineering and synthetic enzyme fusion. A peek over the horizon is revealing that the future of “Wine Yeast 2.0” is already here. Therefore, this article seeks to help prepare the wine industry–an industry rich in history and tradition on the one hand, and innovation on the other–for the inevitable intersection of the ancient art practiced by winemakers and the inventive science of pioneering “synthetic genomicists”. It would be prudent to proactively engage all stakeholders–researchers, industry practitioners, policymakers, regulators, commentators, and consumers–in a meaningful dialog about the potential challenges and opportunities emanating from Synthetic Biology. To capitalize on the new vistas of synthetic yeast genomics, this paper presents wine yeast research in a fresh context, raises important questions and proposes new directions.",Pretorius I.,Journal,Critical Reviews in Biotechnology,2017-01-02,Macquarie University,Bioengineering ;  CRISPR technology ;  genome editing ;  genome scrambling ;  genome synthesis ;  Synthetic Biology ;  synthetic chromosomes ;  synthetic genomics ;  Synthetic Yeast Genome (Sc2.0) Project ;  Yeast 2.0

It discusses funders' perspectives on these working relationships. Funders make researcher-policymaker partnerships a priority because of the multiple anticipated benefits. For some federal grants, collaborating with academics is a requirement of grant receipt yielding partnerships generally believed to produce better science, practice, products and public policies than efforts that lack partnership. Federal and private institutions in the United States and globally invest billions of dollars every year to support innovations in the hard sciences. During the George W. Bush administration, as part of the President's Management Agenda, the White House and its Office of Management and Budget (OMB) championed the use of research evidence and rigorous evaluation in order to improve results achieved in federally funded programs nationwide. By mid-2006, eight federal agencies with the most robust evaluation capacity had submitted approximately science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education program evaluations for review.",Baron J.; Stack K.,Book,Researcher–Policymaker Partnerships: Strategies for Launching and Sustaining Successful Collaborations,2017-01-01,Cornell University;Laura and John Arnold Foundation;Academy of Experimental Criminology;National Academy of Public Administration,
"Textiles, a Dynamic Exchange: Challenges and Opportunities","With its capacity for infinite design adaptation and manifold nonresistant material solutions, the future-focused domain of Textiles has intrinsic value for Design and Technology (D&T) education. Recent technological research, innovation, and development have illustrated its dynamic capacity for cross-disciplinary applica¬tions (McQuaid et al. 2005). Far from staid traditional perceptions of Textiles, these iterations, like those showcased in the exhibition Extreme Textiles, include high-performance fabrics in aeronautics, medicine, apparel, sports, agriculture, transportation, and civil engineering (McQuaid et al. 2005). Quinn asserts that Textiles will continue “to transform our world more than any other material” (2010). So how will D&T education be transformed by these new possibilities? This chapter considers Textiles technologies’ evolving role within D&T educa¬tion, alongside relevant sociocultural and educational developments, challenges, and opportunities.",Von Mengersen B.,Book Series,Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series,2017-01-01,Australian Catholic University,Complexity ;  Design ;  Evolution ;  Future ;  Textiles
Engineering and Technology Concepts: Key Ideas That Students Should Understand,"Competencies people need to be well educated will vary in response to societal waves of change. As STEM education grows in popularity worldwide, interest is increasing in using this paradigm to break down the traditional conception of the four component subjects as individual “silos” of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (Vest, Putting the “E” in STEM Education. The Bridge, 39(3). Washington, DC: National Academy of Engineering, 2009). In the United States, Engineering and Technology education (ETE) is seen as a route through which the four disciplines can be integrated (NGA, Innovation America: Building a science, technology, engineering and math agenda. Washington, DC: National Governors Association. http://www.nga.org/Files/pdf/0702INNOVATIONStem.pdf, 2007). In Europe, 30 countries promote and support STEM collaboration (Kearney, Efforts to increase students ’ interest in pursuing mathematics, science and technology studies and careers. National Measures taken by 30 Countries -2015 Report, European Schoolnet, Brussels; January, 2016. Retrieved October 6, 2016, from http://files.eun.org/scientix/Observatory/ComparativeAnalysis2015/Kearney-2016-National Measures-30-countries-2015-Executive-Summary.pdf, 2015). The evolution of ETE from its craft-oriented and industrial roots (Industrial Arts in the U.S.; Craft, Design, and Technology in the U.K.; Handicrafts in Finland; the “Industrial Projects Method” in France) (Jones and de Vries, Int J Technol Des Educ 7:1–2, 2009) has resulted in a demand for new curriculum – driven not only by contemporary workforce and employability demands but by other values-driven aspirations that educators, parents, and policy makers hold for students. Since the 1980s, conceptual learning has been defined by curricular learning standards and associated performance expectations (often quite numerous) that, when attained, are presumed to provide disciplinary competence. In this chapter, the author suggests that revisiting a small set of transferable ETE thematic ideas in different contexts can complement learning of standards-based domain-specific concepts and skills. Doing so would make instruction more manageable and enable students to assimilate a more holistic understanding of engineering and technology. The chapter draws upon research studies (Rossouw et al., Int J Technol Des Educ 21(4):409–423, 2010; Hacker, Key engineering and technology concepts and skills for the general education of all high school students in the United States: A comparison of perceptions of academic engineering educators and high school classroom technology teachers.

In Press, 2017) that established a consensus of expert opinion about the most important ETE competencies high school students should attain within five thematic categories that consistently appear in the literature: (a) design, (b) modeling, (c) systems, (d) resources, and (e) human values. Two case studies are offered as examples. The first exemplifies how a cuttingedge technology company looks to hire new employees with a broad mix of skills. The second describes a new ETE curriculum model that integrates important concepts within authentic social contexts and supports the fundamental purposes of education.",Hacker M.,Book Series,Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series,2017-01-01,Hofstra University,Concepts ;  Conceptual learning ;  Contexts ;  Engineering education ;  Technology education
"Smart Specialization in the US Context; Lessons From the Growth of the Albany, New York Nanotechnology Cluster","This essay describes a major example of successful regional economic development in the United States reflecting the smart specialization concept. The development of “Tech Valley”, the nanotechnology cluster based around Albany, New York, reflected a long-term policy commitment backed by substantial state and industry investments leading to the development of new educational institutions, the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE), and ultimately attracting GlobalFoundries, a multibillion dollar semiconductor fabrication facility. The analysis puts this regional development in the context of current federal innovation and manufacturing policy while underscoring that this development was almost exclusively a state and regional effort spanning some 20 years. The importance of this consistency of effort, the commitment of substantial funds, the creation of a globally-recognized center for applied research developed through a sustained public–private–partnership that capitalized on existing regional assets are described. The importance of effective and cooperative leadership from the university, industry, and government is emphasized, as is indirectly the role of foreign direct investment.",Wessner C.; Howell T.,Book,Advances in the Theory and Practice of Smart Specialization,2017-01-01,Dentons;Georgetown University,cooperative manufacturing centers ;  industrial commons ;  New York nanotechnology cluster ;  semiconductor fabrication ;  Smart specialization ;  university–industry cooperation
Kaunas University of Technology: Developing Entrepreneurship Education with International Expert Networks,"Kaunas University of Technology (KTU), Lithuania, is one of the leading universities in the country. Initiatives to develop EE at KTU began in 2011. They were driven by the Vice-Rector for Research, professors from the School of Economics and Business, the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Centre, and a business leader. KTU offers two regular EE courses: Technology Entrepreneurship, an elective course for undergraduate students, and Technology Venturing for graduate students. Both target students from KTU’s engineering schools. There are also recurrent extra-curricular activities like an accelerator programme named “Start-up Space”. KTU also supports students in participating in a business plan competition at San José State University (SJU), US. KTU seeks to extend EE offers, curricular as well as extra-curricular. A barrier to extend EE offers at KTU appears to be that it is not considered as a “hard science” by some in the engineering schools. Furthermore, there is competition about credit-bearing courses and about resources. A striking characteristic is that KTU develops EE with comprehensive and targeted support from experts from abroad. Main supporters include Aalto University, Finland, and the US universities of Berkeley and Stanford. KTU considers these universities as world-leading examples of EE at engineering schools. There was also notable support from the US Market Access Centre. Limitations of involving external experts in developing EE were found to be related to funds, time, a necessity to have own experience in entrepreneurship, and a need for adapting foreign approaches to local socio-economic conditions. KTU’s approach may be insightful particularly for other technical universities.",Lilischkis S.,Book Series,International Studies in Entrepreneurship,2017-01-01,Empirica GmbH,Business Model ;  Entrepreneurial Ecosystem ;  External Expert ;  Guest Speaker ;  Hewlett Packard

"Learning by Merging 3D Modeling for CAAD with the Interactive Applications Bearing walls, Vaults, Domes as Case study","The development and the innovation of tools, techniques and digital applications represent a challenge for those who are in charge of architectural education to keep up with this development. This is because these techniques provide potentials that are not available in the traditional method of teaching. This raises an important question: can these tools and techniques help to achieve the targeted outcomes of education? This research paper discusses how to integrate both digital 3D models, of CAAD, and interactive applications for the development of architectural education curriculum. To test this, a case study has been conducted on the subject of building construction, for the second year at the faculty of engineering, specifically, the bearing walls construction system. In addition, this study has been divided into three parts. Through the first part, the scientific content of the curriculum, which tackles the bearing walls, has been prepared. The second part shows how to convert the scientific content into an interactive content in which the students learn through the experiment and the simulation of the traditional construction methods as the students a acquire construction skills and the ability to imagine different structural complexities. The third part includes the creation of both the application and the software containing the interactive curriculum. Workshop for the students has been held as a case study to test the effectiveness of this development and to recognize the pros and cons. The results confirmed the importance of integrating this applications into architectural education.",Khalil M.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Education and Research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe,2017-01-01,Faculty of Engineering,3D modeling ;  Bearing walls systems ;  Building Construction ;  CAAD ;  Interactive applications

Applying Social Representations to Explain Public Willingness to Use GM Foods in Taiwan: The Moderating Impact of Food Technology Neophobia—An Abstract,"Recent advancements in food science and technology, from genetic engineering to nanotechnology, have raised considerable controversies and anxiety-arousing topics from social groups and the general public. The concept of social representations is “a system of values, ideas, and practices,” which has great contribution to the analysis of the public understanding of various technological risks or objects. Food technology neophobia, a new psychometric tool developed by Cox and Evans (2008), can be used to explain a person’s willingness to use foods produced using novel technologies. There is no basis in science for regulation specific to crops and foods improved through biotech or genetically modified organisms. Genetically modified (GM) foods have received substantial attention because they are associated with unnaturalness, moral considerations, uncertainty, and risks. This research aims to apply the concept of social representations to explain public willingness to use GM foods in Taiwan. The moderating impact of food technology neophobia was also considered. A national self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted in Taiwan in 2015. A total of 487 valid data was analyzed by moderated regression analysis. The results revealed that in terms of social representations, if the respondents adhere to technology and consider food a necessity, then they are more likely to use GM foods. However, if they demonstrate resistance to and suspicion of novelties, then they are less likely to use GM foods. When food technology neophobia was taken into account as a moderator, the negative relationship between the respondents’ resistance to and suspicion of GM foods and their willingness to use GM foods was enhanced. But the relationship between the respondents treat food as a necessity and their willingness to use GM foods was changed from positive to negative. The findings can facilitate developing a clearer understanding of people’s acceptance and usage of technology innovation in the food industry.",Chen M.,Book Series,Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,2017-01-01,Tatung University,

Previous research on Oxfordshire has been mainly qualitative. This new study using quantitative data allows insights into what makes regions distinctive, how the performance of regions with some similar and some different attributes differ, and what might contribute to or inhibit their potential growth trajectories. The conceptual framework for the study is drawn from the ‘regional triple-helix spaces’ (The triple helix: University–industry–government innovation in action. Engineering, Routledge, p. 164, 2008) and the regional innovation systems concept (Environ Plan A 30:1563–1584, 1998). The two regions compared are very different in stages of development.

Intrapreneuring Within a Higher Education Institution: Introducing Virtual Business Internships,"Past research on business internships recognizes positive effects on its main stakeholders: students, employers, and higher education institutions. Moreover, some authors have acknowledged further effects in virtual internships and when applying new technologies to the internship experience, particularly referred to enhanced computer skills and learning outcomes. The Faculty of Business Administration and Management of the Universitat Politècnica de València, in Spain, has experienced an outstanding increase of its internships in recent years. As employers are demanding more computer skills in a globalized and technological world, it is expected that virtual internships and the use of ICTs during the traineeship will be a tendency in higher education institutions in the future. At present, the management of internships of the two new Double Degrees in our institution (Business Administration and Management + Computer Science Engineering, and Business Administration and Management + Telecommunications Engineering), offers, in the opinion of the authors, the perfect scenario to explore the possibilities of new technologies applied to internships and to put into practice virtual internships. Recent changes in the Spanish laws and in the regulations of universities, such as the Universitat Politècnica de València, allow business internships to take place abroad. These conditions could provide an opportunity for innovation and growth, especially by combining internationalization with virtualization of traineeships. The above mentioned initiative is a good sample of intrapreneurship within a large organization, where the employees, in this case, the authors of this text, behave like entrepreneurs, acting like agents of change.",Sanahuja Vélez G.; Ribes Giner G.; Moya Clemente I.,Book Series,"Innovation, Technology and Knowledge Management",2017-01-01,Universitat Politècnica de València,Business administration ;  Higher education ;  Internship ;  Intrapreneuring ;  Intrapreneurs ;  Knowledge ;  New technologies ;  Virtual business

Its role and contributions to the project are described, which were to create a common framework for the airport concept’s description, provide tools and methods to deal with the uncertain far future context upon which the project was developed, and to create a performance assessment framework to determine the added value of those solutions integrated within each airport concept.",Curran R.; Sentis A.,Conference Proceeding,"17th AIAA Aviation Technology, Integration, and Operations Conference, 2017",2017-01-01,"Faculteit Luchtvaart- en Ruimtevaarttechniek, TU Delft",Airport operations ;  Far future forecasting ;  Innovation ;  Value engineering
Guided-airdrop vision-based navigation,"The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center is leading an effort to develop precision guided-airdrop systems capable of navigating without a global positioning system (GPS) receiver. This capability is essential for aerial resupply of troops in challenging environments where GPS may be unavailable due to jamming, spoofing or poor satellite visibility. To address this need, a computer vision-based avionics system has been designed, implemented and flight tested. The design uses existing guidance and control algorithms currently featured on the Army's GPS-equipped airdrop systems. The key innovation to obtain GPS-free operation is the inclusion of novel navigation algorithms integrating monocular camera imagery with traditional inertial sensors. The approach first determines the parafoil position relative to the intended landing location using a wide- area image matching search. Complementary methods are used to initialize velocity and attitude, requiring only rough knowledge of the canopy's typical airspeed and glide slope as well as the local magnetic field vector. Position accuracy is maintained, and typically improved, throughout flight with a combination of multi-frame image feature tracking and triangulation as well as absolute landmark recognition with line-of-sight updates. The navigation algorithm is able to determine all inputs required for vehicle guidance and control, including real-time estimation of wind and vehicle aerodynamic quantities, all with no prior wind field knowledge. Only the transport aircraft needs to be aware of local wind conditions, enabling it to deploy the airdrop system in a target-reachable location.",Dever C.; Dyer T.; Hamilton L.; Lommel P.; Mohiuddin S.; Reiter A.; Singh N.; Truax R.; Wholey L.; Bergeron K.; Noetscher G.,Conference Proceeding,"24th AIAA Aerodynamic Decelerator Systems Technology Conference, 2017",2017-01-01,Natick Soldier Systems Center;Charles Stark Draper Lab Inc,
Impact of technology and innovation on adaptation of architectonic tradition for a sustainable future in the Middle East,"The proposed study seeks to establish whether the community is in favour of environmental traditional architecture despite the increase of modern architecture and its subsequent benefits such as indoor thermal comfort. Globally, traditional architecture has a lot of values. In the Middle East (ME), it shows the way people lived in an area and translate their requirements in a distinctive character. The old architecture carries in it very rich design features which if learned and adopted could immensely help in bringing change to current architectural designs. Thomas (2002) maintains that it is important for the Arab world to revisit all their traditional typologies. Sustainability is expected to remain high with the revealing of old identify architecture to current one. The current study is based on the fact that there is an increase in international-based engineers, who are not able to construct building in line with the cultural aspects of the local users in the ME. However, the question remains on whether and how technology and innovation can be utilized to preserve the architectonic traditions intertwined with modern architecture for a sustainable future in the ME.

German resource research institute (GERRI): Concept and aims of a raw materials network,"In 2015 the German Resource Research Institute “GERRI” was founded as a virtual institute and a national network by five leading German research institutions of the raw materials sector. The founding partners of GERRI - TU Bergakademie Freiberg, RWTH Aachen University, Clausthal University of Technology, Fraunhofer project group materials recycling and resource strategies IWKS at the Fraunhofer Institute ISC and the Helmholtz-Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology (HIF) at the HZDR - offer broad knowledge and experience in the following fields of expertise: exploration & mining, processing, hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, materials, waste management, machinery, modeling and special analytics. The main goal of GERRI is to strengthen transdisciplinary research along the entire value chain of metalliferous minerals and raw materials. Furthermore, GERRI is intended to become a central nucleus for innovation between politics, industry and academic research. GERRI's unique feature is a competence mapping, which bundles the available knowledge and experience within all competence fields of this network. Their methods and processes of technical infrastructure are directly linked to relevant elements of periodic table and material flows. GERRI is embedded in the “Research for Sustainable Development (FONA)” program of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), which is part of the funding program “r4 - Innovative Technologies for Resource Efficiency - Research on the Provision of Economic Strategic Raw Materials"". After the expiry of the five-year funding period, GERRI is envisioned to persist independently as a network and will be financed, amongst others, by industrial and research funds.",Köpf H.; Rasenack K.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - European Metallurgical Conference, EMC 2017",2017-01-01,Technische Universität Clausthal;HZDR - Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf,Competence mapping ;  Infrastructure sharing ;  Interdisciplinary research ;  Synergies
"Scaling down, scaling up: Development of a framework to understand vulnerability and change potential in the Hauraki, New Zealand","In New Zealand, regional councils are responsible for developing and implementing policy, and realising objectives for natural resource management. Across the country, councils face the challenge of creating policies that will ensure the maintenance of ecosystem services, while future-proofing the social, cultural and economic viability of their regions in the face of multiple uncertainties and drivers of change. The Hauraki subregion presents a “perfect storm” of interacting environmental, social and economic challenges. While wetland drainage at the turn of the 20th century transformed the landscape, and provided superior land for dairy farming land and associated livelihoods, this low lying coastal area now faces multiple socio-economic and environmental challenges. The legacy effects – drainage, peat shrinkage and land subsidence, salt water intrusion, and biodiversity loss – are exacerbated by changing land use and land management practices. Climate change and the risk of increasing variability and extremes, as well as social and economic drivers, further complicate the scope for policy-, planning- and adaptation solutions. In addition, there are a wide range of stakeholders in a highly complex social and political environment, including settlement claims by Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, under the Treaty of Waitangi; a Marine Spatial Plan developed with stakeholders from around the wider Hauraki Gulf; and an upcoming review of the Regional Plan and Regional Coastal Plan. The Hauraki is diverse and spatially heterogenous, implying that impacts from different driving forces will be felt in different ways by different communities. In the past, integrated assessments for the purpose of policy development have tended to focus on region- or sub-regional scale modelling of high level scenarios. Such assessments can be a useful tool to understand broad scale issues, but from the outset they often limit the scope for understanding local-level vulnerabilities and innovation potential. In order to develop effective policies, we suggest that vulnerability and innovation potential need to be both considered spatially and understood at different scales. To this end, we propose a framework, developed by Landcare Research together with the Waikato Regional Council (WRC), for an integrated assessment process intended to address the challenges described above and to underpin policy development. We approach the assessment both at the broader scale, through spatial mapping and the development of indices of environmental as well as socio-economic and cultural vulnerability; and at the local scale through the spatial identification of hotspots of vulnerability and local capacity for change, where we are able to explore place-based, adaptive pathways. Based on the premise that change can occur most efficiently, equitably and effectively where the need for such change is recognised across different parts of the community, and where there is a shared vision and direction, we propose that the understanding of vulnerability and innovation potential generated from the development of local-scale, place-based visions that cut across sectors can then be scaled up to help inform broader policy questions and future scenarios.",Kalaugher E.; Walsh P.; Huser B.; Cradock-Henry N.; Tupuhi L.; Vare M.; Hill R.; Botting K.; Andrews K.; Greenhalgh S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017",2017-01-01,Waikato Regional Council;Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research;The University of Waikato,Adaptation ;  Integrated assessment ;  Pathways ;  Policy development ;  Scale ;  Vulnerability
"Electricity consumption, Peak load and GDP in Saudi Arabia: A time series analysis","Energy is one of the most important resources of the national economy, which plays an important role in economic production and life more generally. Given its significance, this paper formulates prediction models for electricity consumption (EC), peak load (PL) and gross domestic product (GDP) in Saudi Arabia by employing the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model; using time series data from 1990–2015. It also examines the relationships between EC, PL and GDP through a vector auto-regression (VAR) analysis, which includes Granger causality (GC) testing, impulse response, and forecast error variance decompositions (FEVD). The results show that ARIMA (1, 1, 1), ARIMA (0, 1, 0) and ARIMA (0, 1, 0) were the most appropriate univariate models of EC, PL and GDP, respectively, based on the Akaike information criterion. The results also revealed significant unidirectional granger causality from PL to EC and PL to GDP. The variance decomposition reveals that in the case of EC, the major changes arise from its own innovation and the contribution from GDP at the 1%.",Tularam G.; Alsaedi Y.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017",2017-01-01,Griffith University;Umm Al-Qura University,ARIMA model ;  Electricity consumption ;  GDP ;  Peak load ;  VAR model
A Systems Engineering Approach to Ship Design,"In the recent years, ships have experienced an unprecedented growth in complexity prompted by automation, embedded software and increasingly stringent regulation and customer expectations. Systems Engineering approaches have been designed by industries like aerospace or automotive that were facing similar challenges. Shipyards and academic partners initiated the HOLISHIP project in 2016 to develop integrated methods and tools dedicated to ship design. The constraint is to devise approaches that can be implemented in existing shipyards quickly and at limited costs – including limited training costs for experimented ship designers. This paper describes an attempt, based on SysML, to bridge the gap between established systems engineering methods and naval architecture standards. SysML is used as a starting point and then adapted to fit the needs of the shipbuilding industry. The resulting systems engineering approach focuses on the physical description of the ship system. It combines system architecture diagrams that are a cross between traditional Product Breakdown Structures and SysML Internal Block Diagrams; standard SysML State Machines; and “operational scenarios” that are used to make a link between these diagrams. The bottom-line concepts of systems engineering are preserved yet the extremely reduced semantics render the approach easy to learn for ship designers, making it a promising step towards Systems Engineering tools and methods for ship design.

5.10 Encapsulation of cells (cellular delivery) using sol-gel silica,"Over the last 20 years, materials which undergo sol-gel transition have received considerable attention within the field that interfaces material science and medicine. Animal cells and tissue fragments could easily be incorporated in these materials while in the sol state, and become stably encapsulated in the apparently solid gel following the transition. This review focuses on sol-gel silicates based materials as cell delivery vehicles. Although a wealth of innovation and inventiveness was invested in the research and many medical applications were tested in vitro and in laboratory animals, no product or procedure using sol-gel systems has been medically approved to this date. Sol-gel silicates, though safe and biocompatible, are soluble in body fluids, and, thus, unsuitable for producing stable xenografts.",Braun S.; Bhattacharyya S.; Ducheyne P.,Book,Comprehensive Biomaterials II,2017-01-01,Hebrew University of Jerusalem;University of Pennsylvania,Cellular delivery ;  Encapsulation ;  Entrapment ;  Implant ;  Organ engineering ;  Sol-gel silica ;  Sol-gel transition ;  Tissue engineering ;  Xenografts
6.28 Liver tissue engineering,"Liver is a highly regenerative organ in which hepatocytes and non-parachymal cells perform critical functions to support lives. Liver transplantation remains the solution for liver failure patients. Liver tissue engineering initially focuses on developing liver support devices to bridge transplantation. More recent innovation utilizes decellulized matrices, stem cell transplantation and novel biomaterials and devices to support cell survival and functions. Ultimately, iPS cells, genome-editing technologies and blastocyst complementation would change the landscape by providing off-the-shelf liver or liver tissues for therapies. Such a top-down approach is powerful and mostly aims to replace or supplement the functions of liver, ignoring the fine anatomical structures of the liver tissues. This is in great contrast to a bottom-up approach to build micro-scale liver tissues, enabled by micro-fabrication technologies and innovative micro-/nano-scale biomaterials to engineer a very small piece of liver tissue at cellular resolution. Much innovation has been created to generate sophisticated liver tissues in 2D and 3D for mostly drug safety testing. To grow such micro-liver tissues larger for therapeutic applications have been attempted with great challenges. Eventually, the bottom-up constructed micro-liver tissues would be useful for in vitro applications to develop not only drug safety testing platforms but also to yield disease models, to test the safety of nutraceuticals, consumer goods, and environmental or industrial toxins. Top-down approach eventually yields off-the-shelf liver or liver tissues would still need to be maintained alive, transported, and integrated into living bodies. In the case of allogenic organ source, immune regulation remains an exciting area of research. Liver tissue engineering is growing into an exciting phase over the coming decade as more of such knowledge, and technologies are popping up.",Gupta K.; Song Z.; Tang H.; Fong E.; Ng I.; Yu H.,Book,Comprehensive Biomaterials II,2017-01-01,"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology;A-Star, Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology;Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore;National University of Singapore;Southern Medical University",Disease model ;  Hepatotoxicity ;  Liver support ;  Liver transplantation ;  Regeneration ;  Spheroids

Systems Biology Modeling Practices: Reflections of a Philosopher-Ethnographer,"“The nature of the problems being formulated and addressed by systems biology creates interdependence among researchers in engineering, applied mathematics, computing, and biosciences. In this context, the prefix “trans” signifies that this enterprise seeps into, penetrates, specific prior practices of the mother fields and opens an emergent problem space with multiple possibilities for interaction and integration. I have characterized the problem space of systems biology as an adaptive problem space in that, as with the systems it investigates, adaptation of the researchers is a process of continually revising and reconfiguring knowledge, methods, and so forth as they learn and gain experience. Research in adaptive problem spaces is driven by complex interdisciplinary problems, and these require that the individuals themselves achieve a measure of hybridization in methods, concepts, models, materials – in how they think and how they act.”.",Nersessian N.,Book Series,"History, Philosophy and Theory of the Life Sciences",2017-01-01,Georgia Institute of Technology;Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences,Interactional Expertise ;  Mesoscopic Modeling ;  Methodological Innovation ;  Problem Space ;  System Biology
A requirements engineering approach to accelerate innovation in automotive electronics,"The evolution of modern passenger cars into electronic consumer products packed with more and more last semiconductor innovation cycle chips, is disrupting the long existing and established tier and supplier structures for electronic car devices. The variety of changes like faster product lifecycles turnarounds, more software function depended parts or more exchangeable parts impacts the development process domain as well. Questions around how to foster fast turning development cycles shall be answered during the autoSWIFT [autoSWIFT14] research project (BMBF support code 16Es03) which does focus on the validation and verification side of car electronics. The research task is to search and find new approaches to secure the transition from early showcases to a usable and controllable series part under more volatile conditions. One of the aims therefore is the search for efficient requirements engineering methods to support the OEM - supplier network involved in the development of an electronic application. A standardized and IT friendly formatted mission profile document, based on findings from the RESCAR research project [RESCAR11], is one of the corner stones in the project. To make this standard work in early decision phases either on semiconductor technology issues or electronic application level a process framework based on requirements engineering practices optimized on the specific demands of the development field is necessary. In this paper we present the current work status and the research results for an agile requirements engineering approach which helps to accelerate the innovation cycle of inside car highly integrated semiconductor solution components.",Kreß A.; Eberhardt M.; Donig J.,Conference Proceeding,AmE 2017 - Automotive meets Electronics,2017-01-01,HOOD Gmbh,
Low computation acoustic emissions structural health monitoring through analog signal pre-processing,"In this research an innovative acoustic emission sensing systemhas been developed intended for structural fatigue crackmonitoring. The innovation lies in analog pre-processing ofthe detected acoustic emissions for signal enveloping, thus relyingon cheap high bandwidth components. The technique isbased on heterodyning the amplified acoustic emission signalwith a carrier signal of a chosen frequency. Next, the signalis filtered and the signal envelope is obtained by phaseshifting the signal by 2 creating an analytic signal that isdigitally sampled. This results in need of low sampling ratedigital acquisition equipment giving relatively small amountsof data to be processed and stored, considerably reducing thesystem cost. This is particularly suitable for applications involvinglarge or complex structures to be monitored, wherea multitude of sensors are needed. The system was built andtested on aluminum test coupons during tension-tension fatigue.The envelope signal is filtered for background noisethrough thresholding based on statistical knowledge of thenoise distribution. The accumulation of acoustic activityshows promising results with an early period of high acousticactivity during settling of the material that asymptoticallyconverges at a certain level. At the next stage, there is no activityuntil a certain point is reached where a sudden ramp upof AE is detected close to the end of the experiment. Throughextensometer measurement, the change in coupon length atthis point in time strongly indicates that the ramp up of AEactivity is due to crack initiation and propagation.",Schlanbusch R.; Bechhoefer E.; Meyer T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Prognostics and Health Management Society, PHM",2017-01-01,Teknova AS;GPMS Inc.,

Energy storage and microgrid construction,"Energy storage and microgrid (ESM) systems introduce capabilities to dramatically improve the resiliency and efficiency of electrical grids as well as enable the introduction of renewable energy systems to new and existing power distribution infrastructure. Multiple market forces have converged to enable the feasibility of ESM construction in many regions of the world. These forces include dramatic drops in the cost of solar photovoltaics and energy storage; regional shifts in the availability of low-cost natural gas; increased interest in resiliency among utilities and facility owners; and emerging capabilities among developers, builders, and finance professionals to conceive, design, finance, build, and operate ESM systems. The development and construction of ESM projects require significant levels of innovation, endurance, and responsiveness to project specific conditions. Collaborative and integrative methods have emerged as critical process management methods that facilitate the planning, construction, and operation of energy storage and microgrid projects. These unique challenges of ESM project also require specialty skills and capabilities across project developers, managers, engineers, and skilled workforce. This paper presents the patterns emerging from multiple microgrid development projects and an integrative approach to building capacity to pursue and execute ESM projects among utility professionals, electrical workers, and electrical construction project managers. New curriculum designs are presented based on lessons learned in the design, construction, and operation of a living laboratory for ESM systems and experiences gained through the development of a hybrid microgrid system including combined heat and power, solar photovoltaics, and multiple types of battery energy storage systems. The implications of ESM system growth on a global scale are also discussed, including the need for integrative research and education programs at regional levels to support the growth of ESM markets and system deployment.",Riley D.; Delgoshaei P.,Conference Proceeding,6th CSCE-CRC International Construction Specialty Conference 2017 - Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference and General Meeting 2017,2017-01-01,Pennsylvania State University,Battery ;  Construction ;  Education ;  Electrical ;  Energy storage ;  Engineering ;  Microgrid

"Governance, transparency and the collaborative design of open data collaboration platforms: understanding barriers, options, and needs","Developments in open data have prompted a range of proposals and innovations in the domain of governance and public administration. Within the democratic tradition, transparency is seen as a fundamental element of democratic governance. While the use of open government data has the potential to enhance transparency and trust in government, realising any ideal of transparent democratic governance implies responding to a range of sociotechnical design challenges. In order to address these design challenges it is essential to adopt an interdisciplinary and stakeholder-engaged approach to research and innovation. In the current study, we describe a contextualist approach to the design of an open data collaboration platform in the context of an EU innovation project, focused on enhancing transparency and collaboration between citizens and public administrators through the use of open government data. We report on a collective intelligence scenario-based design process that has shaped the development of open data platform requirements and ongoing system engineering and evaluation work. Stakeholders across five pilot sites identified barriers to accessing, understanding, and using open data, and options to overcome these barriers across three broad categories: government and organisational issues; technical, data, and resource issues; and training and engagement issues. Stakeholders also expressed a broad variety of user needs across three domains: information needs; social-collaborative needs; and understandability, usability, and decision-making needs.

Mass-customization of products through web-based feature modeling systems,"Innovation in e-systems has led to significant evolution in modern business and commerce. The technologies have been embraced in both 340the information and communication sectors as well as the manufacturing industry. Today’s manufacturers are pressed for short time-to-market and short product life cycles. Another significant trend that has emanated from today’s well-educated consumers is mass-customization. Consumers now demand personalized products, within short timeframes. Traditionally, consumers would buy mass-produced products off the shelf, which left them with little influence to modify product designs to suit their unique needs. Modern e-systems have come to the rescue of the consumers, who are ever becoming savvy technocrats. Thanks to the rapid evolution and ever decreasing prices for computer systems. Recently there has been more research focus on web-based systems that are earmarked at making mass- customization a possibility. Greater parts of the developed world and other major manufacturing economies such as China have made great strides in achieving mass-customization and short time-to-market, whilst close to zero achievement can be noticed in most developing parts of the world. Mass-customization requires a strong backbone of broadband and cloud based network systems, coupled with feature modeling systems. Today’s ever growing mobile applications industry enable the design of powerful mobile applications which can allow end user customers to interact with digital product models in order to personalize the designs before onward transmission to the manufacturer. This ability basically brings what is called ‘democratization’ of manufacturing. This chapter focuses on trends and practical research applications of mass-customization web-based product feature modeling systems. Typical research efforts will be demonstrated in the fields of additive manufacturing and toy manufacturing industries. Traditional mass-customization systems used to be web applications that were designed for use on the desktop computers. However, because of the growing number of mobile gadgets with Internet access (smart phones), mobile applications are now being designed with ability to communicate directly with manufacturing machines or at least the manufacturer’s proprietary network. Whilst product design and modeling systems housed within the manufacturer’s premises normally require high expertise of CAD skills, end user applications for mass-customization are designed for novices. These offer adjustments on less complicated product features and or attributes, such as color and size. The business potential of mass-customization systems is very 341huge since the outreach capacity is as big as the cloud-based network. Distribution systems are also becoming very efficient which enables remote companies to ship their mass-customized products anywhere in the world at low costs.",Gwangwava N.; Gumbie A.,Book,Innovations in E-Systems for Business and Commerce,2017-01-01,National University of Science and Technology Bulawayo,3d printing ;  Feature modeling ;  Mass-customization ;  Toy manufacturing ;  Web application
RENOVAGAS project: Power to methane,"RENOVAGAS is a research project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) within the framework of the National Program for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society. The project goal is to develop a 15 kwel pilot plant for the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG), following a power to methane process, from the electrolytic production of hydrogen with renewable energy sources (RES) and its combination with biogas (as CO2 source) through a methanation process. Therefore, the SNG obtained is fully renewable. The target is to obtain a SNG with the appropriate quality to be directly injected in the Spanish natural gas grid. The main project innovations include the use of CO2 from biogas directly, without previous separation from methane, the development of new methanation catalysts with high activity, selectivity and stability, the design of a specific multichannel reactor, suitable to work with biogas (that feature improves the mass and heat transfer involved in the process) and the development of an advanced process control for its integration with RES. The pilot plant of 15 kwel produces up to 2 N-cu m/hr of SNG. The plant was tested in real conditions, in a waste water treatment plant in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. Results showed that the quality of the gas produced is adequate for its direct injection in the existing natural gas grid, fulfilling the Spanish natural gas quality specifications. The works done in the project include also detailed engineering for the scale up from the pilot plant to a 250 kwel size (under study for a second phase of the project), forecast of future renewable power and biogas availability and an economical study to show the feasibility of this technology for several plant sizes and assumptions. The results of RENOVAGAS provide knowledge about the technical and economic feasibility of the Power-to-Methane systems. This technology will enhance the contribution to the environment from the utilization of natural gas for domestic and industrial applications.",Lana J.; Modrego J.; Chamberlain J.; Martínez M.; Martín M.; Cano R.; Rubio J.; Navarro R.; Pérez S.; Sánchez M.,Conference Proceeding,International Gas Research Conference Proceedings,2017-01-01,TECNALIA;Gas Natural Fenosa Group;CSIC - Instituto de Catálisis y Petroleoquímica (ICP);FCC Aqualia;Centro Nacional del Hidrógeno;Abengoa;Enagas,
Impact evaluation for University-Business Cooperation and Technology Transfer in higher education systems: Cluster analysis,"Higher education systems evolved in recent decades. Universities must not only provide society with capable professionals but also act in the market for technologies, knowledge, and ideas to promote technological development. This paper discusses the motivational performance evaluation system for technology transfer process, specifically the patterns' evaluation of academic units considering micro-cultures and idiosyncrasies' analysis, in the academic context of autonomy. Based on action research, the existing performance evaluation system was assessed, and multivariate cluster analysis was proposed and tested as a method to enable micro cultures' identification and evaluation. The analysis proposed enabled a tool for reflexive discussion regarding the effectiveness of the institutional innovation system in academic units and Engineering Education, and its implications for social and technological development of industry and society enabled action proposals for improvement in the university's technology transfer management process.",Gusberti T.; Dewes M.,Journal,Production,2017-01-01,Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saúde de Porto Alegre;Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,Patents ;  Performance measurement system ;  Technological innovation ;  Technology management ;  University-industry interaction
Empowering capability for innovation in IT organizations a confluence of knowledge for continual organizational learning,"In IT based business model innovations, emerging technologies introduce disruption into processes and organizational capabilities that could be difficult to overcome. IT services organizations must maintain their IT capabilities of innovation integration in order to exploit it internally and for their customers. Using the literature on resource based views as a grounding for organizational capabilities, this paper introduces a model of continual organizational learning that empowers IT organizations for innovation integration. Through indepth case studies conducted at IT services companies, this exploratory research identifies mechanisms of knowledge management are required to transform IT organizations to a lever rather than a barrier to integrating innovation based on emerging technologies. The study succinctly presents the convergence of knowledge assets through a cyclic process that empowers IT organization to embrace innovation.",Badr N.,Conference Proceeding,"IC3K 2017 - Proceedings of the 9th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management",2017-01-01,Grenoble Ecole de Management,It organizational learning ;  Knowledge acquisition ;  Knowledge transfer ;  Technology innovation integration
Economic success of employment and revenue generated from research commercialization activities,"The concept of entrepreneurial universities has gained more attention from policy makers and academics due to its perceived prospect of contributing to innovation and economic growth. Spin offs companies helps universities to commercialize their knowledge and technological developments. The commercialization of academic research results through academic spin-offs is becoming an important and increasingly reliable source of revenue for universities. Universities also contribute to employment creation when they establish new spin off firms or help to revamp existing ones. Universities and industries usually cooperate and engagement themselves through joint research projects and this helps universities to commercialize and exploit research results by way of patents licensing and spin-offs. The main focus of this paper is to establish the relationship that exits between the economic successes of spin offs in terms of employment and revenue generation and their spillover effects of contributing to regional growth and development. Using the linear regression method, this paper has demonstrated that, spin offs firms contribute better to employment creation than revenue generation. Spin offs that are partially owned by higher educational institutions and those termed social enterprises contribute better to employment creation than those without the full control of university's management. Spin offs do contribute insignificantly to revenue generation.",Odei S.,Conference Proceeding,"IC3K 2017 - Proceedings of the 9th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management",2017-01-01,Univerzita Pardubice,Commercialization ;  Entrepreneurial universities ;  Innovation ;  Patents ;  Spin offs

The evolution of an innovation capability: Making internal idea competitions work in a large enterprise,"OVERVIEW: As a form of crowdsourcing, idea competitions offer a mechanism to engage larger groups in innovation activities. While much of the literature on crowdsourcing focuses on idea competitions that cross a firm’s boundaries to engage external partners, relatively little is known about how this approach can be used within large companies to engage the internal community. We describe how an internal idea competition in a large company has evolved over time into a much broader innovation management system that supports a range of different types of innovations, and how it has altered the firm’s overall approach to innovation and corporate entrepreneurship.",Smith C.; Fixson S.; Paniagua-Ferrari C.; Parise S.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2017-01-01,Dell EMC;Babson College,Corporate entrepreneuring ;  Crowdsourcing ;  Idea competitions ;  Innovation culture
Can culture stimulate innovation for technopreneurship,"Among factors that influence and shape innovation in different societies is the prevailing culture. Most forms of individualistic cultures affect innovation significantly and positively. Other key factors that influence innovation among early stage startups are government interventions, innovation policy and financing. This study has three key objectives. The first is to examine how culture influence innovation among technology startups in Malaysia. Second objective is to explore factors associated with technology innovation. The third objective is to assess how innovation influence financing for technology startups. The study employs thematic analysis as the main methodological approach to analyze primary data. Qualitative survey carried out a series of semi-structured interviews with technology entrepreneurs1, relevant government agencies, industry associations, venture capitalists and leading accelerators. The study finds culture to be an impediment to innovation. Factors such as collective culture and herd mentality behavior were identified as barriers to innovation and fear of failure was attributed to low entrepreneurial innovation. Entrepreneurial attitude on the other hand was identified as a significant quality that is positively related with innovation among technology startups. Thematic analysis reveals that technopreneurs who display positive attitude, determination, perseverance and self-efficacy are more likely to display some form of innovation in their startup. These technopreneurs were more likely to be financed by venture capital funds and private or angel investors. Other factors that influence innovation are, the capacity to commercialize, overall entrepreneurship culture, incubators facilities and capabilities and market size. Based on the findings, the study offers a proposed framework that encapsulates elements, factors and components that effect innovation.",Nassar J.; Mohd Sori Z.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ICIE 2017",2017-01-01,INCEIF University,Culture ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Startups ;  Technology

Organisational innovation in SMEs: The role of partnerships,"In automotive sector, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) usually have lack of resources and all the legal and financial restrictions involved in this process are additional barriers imposed. In order to survive, SMEs in this sector can turn to the formation of partnerships with other firms and even innovate organisationally. Given the shortage of studies showing the role of inter-firm partnerships in the implementation of organisational innovation activities within the SME sector, this paper seeks to contribute to the field of SME management. In this way, the central question to be answered is: Will the formation of partnerships have an influence on the organisational innovation process? To achieve this objective, quantitative cross-section research was adopted, resorting to a questionnaire directed to owners-managers of a sample of SMEs in the automotive sector in Portugal. Based on the empirical evidence, the study concludes that the motives for partnership formation influence the implementation of organisational innovation activities, but only partially, as of the four factors of motives for partnership formation (efficiency, innovation and learning, market opportunities, technology and competition) only technology and competition showed a positive and significant influence on organisational innovation. In terms of theory, this study contributes to the field of research on SMEs in the automotive sector. It pursues a new approach applying variables related to partnership formation in general, and among SMEs in the automotive sector in particular. Some scales on the motives for partnership formation and the organisational innovation process were also implemented in this specific context of analysis. In practical terms, the results show the extent to which the motives for partnership implementation, such as those connected to technology and competition, have a strong influence on organisational innovation activities.",Franco M.; Haase H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2017-01-01,Fachhochschule Jena;Universidade da Beira Interior,Automotive sector ;  Organisational innovation ;  Partnerships ;  SMEs
"Entrepreneurship as a harmonized mix from management, engineering and design","Management principals of lean startup (Rice, 2011) and customer development (Blank, 2013) evoke new wave of further exploration what competences (Morris, 2013; Laptev, 2014) entrepreneurs should posses to create innovation based startups. Lean startup and customer development concepts of management are relatively new and start to dominate. This tendency requires revision of competencies being developed at entrepreneurship educational programs. The entrepreneurial education programs and courses evolve on the basis of three schools: Schools of management, schools of engineering, and schools of design with some interaction among each other. The authors are related to ten years of development of the masters' degree entrepreneurial management program from a management school prospective at Lomonosov Moscow State University. In our research we explore what set of competencies must be developed to let the program participants with managerial background work in the frames of lean startup and customer development concepts. The research approach was based on theoretical research, survey study, and empirical tests. The research results demonstrate and prove that programs in entrepreneurial management must provide graduates with extensive competences in engineering and design. The research results could be of great value for those who would like to improve entrepreneurial education programs especially with the focus on product innovation.",Shaytan D.; Laptev G.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2017-01-01,Lomonosov Moscow State University,Education ;  Entrepreneurial management ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Startup
Deployment of a business and innovation centre to foster cooperation between Europe and Brazil,"Research and Development as well as science and technology are key elements for innovation, and more generally are some among many areas that are becoming global. This reduces the influence of individual countries or blocs such as the European Union (EU) on developments both at home and abroad but also generates important benefits through specialization, trade and competition. R&D and science & technology are still strongly focused on the 'Triad' countries overall. However, this pattern is weakening fast, as especially the large emerging economies' role in global science, technology and innovation continues to increase. Following this reasoning, Brazil deserves special attention due its economic strength, accounting for almost 38% of Latin American GDP (IMF, 2013), and its huge entrepreneurship potential (Arruda, 2015). Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to examine in a first step the Innovation Systems of Brazil and Europe, then to show in a second step, how joint activities and programs can address the needs for a fruitful cooperation in international innovation in order to strengthen both Innovation Systems. For the first aspect, the paper provides an examination of Innovation Systems of Brazil and European countries based on library resources, articles, reports and other secondary data. The OECD bibliography will be the guideline to understand the Innovation Systems of the relevant countries. Regarding the second aspect, the EU Horizon 2020 funded project CEBRABIC - Centre for Europe-Brazil Business & Innovation Cooperation - will be elucidated. CEBRABIC aims at enhancing the cooperation in research, technology and entrepreneurship between the EU member states and Latin America's leading economy, Brazil. CEBRABIC will be a Centre working on a network basis: creating synergies and complementarities is the core value; particularly with European research and innovation (R&I) structures located in Brazil. The network will support the creation of research, innovation and business (R&I&B) opportunities for European organizations in Brazil, stimulating demand and cooperation. CEBRABIC aims to address knowledge-intensive sectors, offering a service portfolio that corresponds to an integrated approach towards the innovation value chain and that stimulates research-to-market collaborative projects.",Haunschild J.; Melo G.; Orth R.; Will M.; Kohl H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2017-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK,Brazil and Europe ;  CEBRABIC ;  Innovation and business centre ;  Innovation system ;  STI - science ;  Technology and innovation
Using evolutionary theory in studying the development of system of systems,"The paper describes a systems approach to study the evolution and development of a System of systems, particularly in military context. In this article, the System of systems is a socio-technical structure, where Information and Communication Technology is intertwined with human and other structural parts. Due to the interaction with the environment and between intertwined parts, System of systems is complex and dynamic in nature. Most of the system engineering or design methods tend to over-reduce the situation or over-emphasise some parts. When developing models describing the possible future states, Enterprise Architects struggle to analyse what future is practical to achieve. To overcome these challenges, a research method based on systems thinking is introduced. The foundation for the method was presented in Darwinian (1859) Theory of evolution. It is applied to technical systems by Mokyr (1998). Since the system in the Mokyr’s model was found too monolithic, Andriani’s and Carigani’s (2012) approach is applied to introduce modular design and innovation. Mokyr defines knowledge as underlying structure needed to design systems. Creating knowledge is extended using features of Choo’s (1998) model for Knowing Organisation. The extended model is tested with basic features presented in Bertalanffy’s (1968) general system theory. The model for the evolution of the socio-technical system of systems is corroborated with the use case in the military evolution of mechanised forces and manoeuvre tactics (Vego, 2007). The research model has been this far used in studying the capabilities of military command, control, communications, computing, and information. The business level studies have addressed the development of military knowledge management and the evolution of military training. The information level study has dealt with evolving military information management. All three studies provided tools for Enterprise Architects to do business level analyses both for the current and help in defining possible end states for strategies.",Mattila J.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the European Conference on Research Methods in Business and Management Studies,2017-01-01,Aalto University,Development of military C4I capabilities ;  Enterprise architecture ;  Evolutionary model ;  Knowledge management ;  System of systems
"Nanotechnology intellectual property rights: Research, design, and commercialization","“We need to seamlessly integrate IPR in the standard graduate/post graduate courses in science, technology, commerce, creative arts, etc., without over burdening the students with law” -Dr Prabuddha Ganguli, CEO, VISION-IPR Nanotechnology Intellectual Property Rights: Research, Design, and Commercialization offers an overview of the dynamics of development and commercialization in nanotech, where strategic integration of IP, R&D, and commercialization has become imperative.

Toward a multi-level knowledge building innovation network,"Knowledge building requires collaborative bootstrapping, with participants at all levels of the education system part of a collective effort to go beyond information exchange to innovation-producing networks that demonstrate that education can operate as a knowledge creating enterprise. Organizational theories and research are increasingly focused on multilevel perspectives for creating actionable knowledge; the challenge is to take advantage of emergence to self-organize around solutions and new means. By “innovation networks” we mean networks that go beyond sharing and discussion to the actual creation of new knowledge and innovations. Self-organization and emergence surround us, all the time and at multiple levels, whether we are aware or not. However, self-organization around idea improvement is rare and requires engaging innovative capacity at all levels, a research-intensive enterprise surrounding innovations, and an open source engineering team committed to enabling new forms of interaction, media, and analytic tools. “Multi-level” envisions inclusion of students, teachers, administrators, researchers, engineers, and policy makers in a collaborative enterprise.

Model-based development of automotive embedded systems,"Vehicles are being transformed into autonomous machines that assist drivers when accidents are about to occur, inform about traffic conditions, diagnose and upgrade themselves as required, while providing comfort and entertainment functionalities. The evolution of embedded systems technology has provided an important enabler for such new functionalities and improved qualities. In this context it can be noted that an estimated 70% of the innovations over the last 20 years are related to information and communication technologies [3]. Cars are becoming computers on wheels. The impact of introducing embedded system technology into vehicles has had, and is having, a radical effect on vehicle development, production, and maintenance. Automotive embedded systems have over the past decades evolved from single stand-alone computer systems, simple enough to be designed and maintained with a minimum of engineering, to distributed computer systems including several networks, and large numbers of sensors, electrical motors, and points of interactions with humans. These distributed systems are tightly integrated into the vehicle. They provide flexible information transfer and computational capabilities, allowing coordination among actuators, sensors, and human-machine interfaces (HMIs), removal of mechanical parts, and also completely new mechanical designs. Automotive embedded systems is an interesting area where the mechanical and control systems worlds meet with the general IT world represented by entertainment/telematics functionalities and increasing connections to the vehicle external infrastructure and IT systems. The opportunities are thus enormous, but the new technology also requires new competencies, methodologies, processes, and tools that can handle the flip side of the coin; the resulting increase and change in product and development complexity. Competition, customer demands, legislation, and new technologies are driving the introduction of new functionalities in the automotive industry. Many new functions in vehicles span traditional domains and organizations. An example of this is active safety systems that assist the driver by receiving environmental information, interpreting the driver intentions, controlling the vehicle dynamics, and, in case an accident is about to occur, informing an emergency center. The increasing system complexity and related increase in costs for the embedded systems development and maintenance create strong needs for systematic and cost-effective development approaches. Current methods of automotive embedded system development lead to [2,50,70] • Long turnaround time, since the complete behavior can only be tested in the integration phase. • Lack of continuity between requirements deinition, system design, and distributed system implementation; typically involving different people and with little formalized communication. • Suboptimal solutions. The organizational structures still mirror the mechanical architecture, and because of a current lack of a systems-level engineering approach for embedded systems design.",Törngren M.; Chen D.; Malvius D.; Axelsson J.,Book,Automotive Embedded Systems Handbook,2017-01-01,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),
Designing antimicrobial properties on urinary catheter surfaces by interaction with plasma radiation and particles,"The development of current healthcare practices is given by the emergence of new surgical procedures, materials, and medical products. Polymeric materials are present in many of these innovations and certain clinical and cost requirements must be met. The high performance of biomaterials is obtained by controlling surface properties (Aflori et al. 2013). The radio frequency (RF) plasmas are generally used for the surface modification of polymers because they produce the sterilization of the products, involve low consumption of chemicals, and it is a solvent-free and dry process. By using precisely controllable processes from RF plasma, the surface can be treated homogeneously and the surface chemistry can be tailored for the required end use (Drobota et al. 2010, Aflori 2014). In order to achieve antimicrobial surfaces properties, the research efforts have been turned toward engineering polymer films loaded with silver and silver nanoparticles (Johnson et al. 1990, Sagripanti 1992). Multilayer films containing silver nanoparticles were generated by layer-by-layer assembly, comprising catechol used to ligate and reduce silver ions to metallic silver when immersed in an aqueous silver salt solution (Hwang et al. 2011). Different commercial products containing silver have materialized: wound dressings, bandages for burns and chronic wounds, silver and silver nanoparticles-coated catheters, and other medical devices. A number of factors, such as concentration, size, shape, and aggregation, come into play in determining the efficiency of silver-based coatings (Liedberg and Lundeberg 1989, Ahearn et al. 2000). One of the most common types of healthcare-associated infection from hospitals is bacteriuria and is owing to the presence of a urinary catheter in the human body, the daily incidence of those urinary tract infections being 3%-10%. The mucosal irritation and catheter-related urinary tract infection (CUTI) are due to the insertion of the urethral catheters which inoculate organisms into the bladder and promote colonization by providing a surface for bacterial adhesion (Vergidis and Patel 2012, Padawer et al. 2015). A CUTI is defined as the new appearance of bacteriuria or funguria with a count of greater than 103 colony-forming units per milliliter (Patel and Arya 2000). Bacteriuria is developed in 10%-30% of patients who are undergoing short-term catheterization (i.e., 2-4 days) while in the case of long-term catheterization, the percents are 90%-100% (Gould et al. 2010, Hooton et al. 2010). About 80% of nosocomial CUTIs are related to urethral catheterization but only 5%-10% are related to genitourinary manipulation. The presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and an indwelling catheter produce a nosocomial CUTI. The bacteria may gain entry into the bladder during manipulation of the catheter or drainage system, during insertion of the catheter, around the catheter, and after removal (Stark and Maki 1998, Darouiche et al. 1999). The most commonly responsible for CUTI development are enteric pathogens (e.g., Escherichia coli), but Pseudomonas species, Enterococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterobacter species, and yeast also are known to cause infection (Riley et al. 1995). Nowadays, there are many studies comparing standard noncoated catheters with silver-coated catheters, and all studies have included patients requiring a catheter in situ for more than 2 days and less than 10 days (Munasinghe et al. 2001, Schumm and Lam 2008). A complete analysis con sisting of eight clinical trials was performed (Saint and Lipsky 1999) in order to establish the effect of silver coatings. When all studies were considered together (four of them using silver-oxide-coated catheters and the other four using silveralloy- coated hydrogel catheters), a statistically significant benefit was seen in all patients with silver-coated catheters. Two randomized prospective studies were performed in order to evaluate the incidence of bacteriuria during short- and intermediate- term catheterization with the silver-alloy-coated hydrogel catheter compared to the standard latex catheter following urological surgery (Verleyen et al. 1999). The authors found that the silver alloy catheter significantly delayed the onset of bacteriuria in patients catheterized for a median duration of 5 days (range 2-14 days). By day 7, 30% of patients with latex catheters and 10% with silver-coated catheters had signifi cant bacteriuria. They found no difference in the incidence of CUTIs in patients following intermediate-term catheterization for 14 days (50% vs. 50.6%). A study on the catheterized patients from 12 different centers was made comparing infection rates between those receiving standard noncoated catheters and silvercoated hydrogel catheters. The use of the silver-alloy-coated catheter significantly reduced the risk of CUTIs from 32 to 20.4 CUTIs per 1000 catheterized patients: a 33% reduction in the number of patients with secondary bacteremia and a 42% lower incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms (Thomas et al. 2002). A change in practice to silver-alloy-coated hydrogel catheters throughout the hospital was implemented, resulting in a 45% reduction in CUTIs (Lai and Fontecchio 2002). The use of standard catheters resulted in approximately 516 CUTIs per year compared to 300 CUTIs when using silver-alloy-coated catheters, thereby reducing the incidence by 216 per year.",Aflori M.,Book,Electromagnetic Radiation in Analysis and Design of Organic Materials: Electronic and Biotechnology Applications,2017-01-01,Petru Poni Institute of Macromolecular chemistry,
The knowledge managment capability of high-technology enterprises,"Improving the knowledge management (KM) capability in order to gain sustainable competitive advantages has emerged as an important strategy for addressing recurring problems in a new product development such a long time-to-market, riskiness and high development costs. Synthesizing prior theoretical research in innovation management, competitive advantages, KM and practical activities of high-technology engineering enterprises it is posited that innovation, engineering processes and organizational culture are important antecedents of KM capability. However, it is vague whether the KM capability as a mediator affects competitive advantages. The aim of the paper is to explore the impact of the KM capability in hightechnology engineering enterprises. To achieve this aim we have contributed an empiric research in which 50 high-technology engineering enterprises of Russia were involved. The regression analysis is applied to analyze the obtained empiric data. Among the three selected antecedents the engineering processes have the most impact on the KM capability. The research hasn't proved the mediating role between the KM capability and competitive advantages because of relative novelty of this phenomenon to Russian hightechnology enterprises.",Gorlacheva E.; Gudkov A.; Koznov D.; Omelchenko I.,Conference Proceeding,"IC3K 2017 - Proceedings of the 9th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management",2017-01-01,Bauman Moscow State Technical University;Saint Petersburg State University,Competitive advantage ;  High-technology engineering enterprises ;  Knowledge management capability

Sink or swim: Connected health software grasping the innovation opportunities by mitigating risk,"Connected Health innovation can be an opportunity for companies to develop and grow, if they take opportunity to develop solutions for healthcare. In this paper, we discuss a case study where a very small company in Ireland developed a connected health solution, but in doing this, discovered a number of risks which they faced. Working with a research from the University of Limerick (author 1), they developed mitigation strategies to avoid these risks, and subsequently developed an updated version of their initial connected health solution. This software, Global-MN, has been implemented by a charity in India, Varanasi Children’s Hospital. We present information about both the initial and updated product, illustrating how overcoming the risks has resulted in the company redesigning their product for a global market. Data entered via this software is now providing Varanasi Children’s Hospital with information and analysis, which, in turn, is allowing them to provide a better service and improve the nourishment of children in India.",Richardson I.; AbuBaker A.; O’Connor P.; O’Mahony J.; O’Leary P.,Conference Proceeding,"HEALTHINF 2017 - 10th International Conference on Health Informatics, Proceedings; Part of 10th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2017",2017-01-01,"University of Limerick;Rockchapel Co.

Uncovering key factors for a hospital IT change strategy,"Changing an Information Technology (IT) system within any organisation is a difficult and complex process. However, within the hospital setting, additional complexities make such change more difficult. These complexities include the protection of patient safety and privacy, improving the quality of the patient experience, protecting information and supporting the clinician in their medical requirements. Our research indicates that uncovering the process of hospital IT change management is not documented – making it difficult to build on evidence-based research and instill a ‘lessons learned’ approach in publicly funded hospitals. We address this gap in this paper. Using qualitative research methods we present the results of observations carried out in healthcare settings as well as twelve structured interviews with hospital staff. We employ the Kotter Change Model as a lens to understand this change process. While benefiting from the structure that Kotter’s model provides, we argue for the need to extend this model in an effort to capture the various influences of healthcare IT-enabled innovation which will, in turn, enable much needed change within hospitals. Building on our findings, we introduce a Healthcare IT Change Management Model (HIT-CMM).",Carroll N.; Richardson I.; Travers M.,Conference Proceeding,"HEALTHINF 2017 - 10th International Conference on Health Informatics, Proceedings; Part of 10th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2017",2017-01-01,University of Limerick,Change Management ;  Healthcare ;  Hospital ;  Kotter’s Model ;  Quality
"Design prototyping methods: State of the art in strategies, techniques, and guidelines","Prototyping is interwoven with nearly all product, service, and systems development efforts. A prototype is a pre-production representation of some aspect of a concept or final design. Prototyping often predetermines a large portion of resource deployment in development and influences design project success. This review surveys literature sources in engineering, management, design science, and architecture. The study is focused around design prototyping for early stage design. Insights are synthesized from critical review of the literature: key objectives of prototyping, critical review of major techniques, relationships between techniques, and a strategy matrix to connect objectives to techniques. The review is supported with exemplar prototypes provided from industrial design efforts. Techniques are roughly categorized into those that improve the outcomes of prototyping directly, and those that enable prototyping through lowering of cost and time. Compact descriptions of each technique provide a foundation to compare the potential benefits and drawbacks of each. The review concludes with a summary of key observations, highlighted opportunities in the research, and a vision of the future of prototyping. This review aims to provide a resource for designers as well as set a trajectory for continuing innovation in the scientific research of design prototyping.",Camburn B.; Viswanathan V.; Linsey J.; Anderson D.; Jensen D.; Crawford R.; Otto K.; Wood K.,Journal,Design Science,2017-01-01,Cockrell School of Engineering;Singapore University of Technology and Design;Aalto University;United States Air Force Academy;Georgia Institute of Technology;San Jose State University,Design prototyping ;  Methods ;  Product ;  Service ;  Systems
A disciplined innovation approach to health technology solutions,"Despite the potential of innovation-driven healthcare technology services to increase the quality, accessibility and quality of care, the realization and success of such promise has yet to be achieved.

Access to space: A new approach by the United Nations office for outer space affairs,"In the context of UNISPACE+50, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the first UNISPACE conference held in Vienna in 1968, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) has defined four pillars to address the future of space activities and their role in development: Space economy, space society, space accessibility and space diplomacy. Under the space accessibility pillar, UNOOSA intends to enable all communities, particularly in developing countries, to use and benefit from space technologies and applications. Building on previous activities and new partnerships, UNOOSA facilitates and provides (i) access to space education; (ii) access to space data; (iii) access to space technology and research facilities; and finally, for the first time, (iv) direct access to space. At the core of these activities is microgravity research, from on-ground simulation to orbital opportunities, which is one of the main tools of the Human Space Technology Initiative. This shift from on-ground space education, applications, technology and simulation to on-orbit technology is directly linked to a UNISPACE+50 thematic priority on ""Global partnerships in space exploration and innovation"". At this stage, three partnership programmes are incorporated in this strategy, with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the China Manned Space Agency, and Sierra Nevada Corporation. These programmes provide access to a wide spectrum of Low Earth Orbit opportunities.",Kojima A.; Yárnoz D.; Di Pippo S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2017-01-01,United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs,
Understanding India's new space potential: Implications and prospects for Europe,"In what its seems to be a “Great Acceleration” of space activities, much attention has been paid to the New Space paradigms emanating from the West, particularly from the dynamic entrepreneurship of Silicon Valley. In fact, a more careful examination of global commercial dynamics in space would reveal an equally pressing need to look eastward, and more specifically at the emergence of a potentially disruptive New Space dynamic in India. This fast-growing economy has not only proven to be a hotbed of so-called frugal (jugaad) and reverse engineering; it has also shown a growing ability to innovate in a variety of forms that often remain invisible to the end consumers in the West - from ground-breaking B2B solutions and R&D outsourcing innovation to process and management improvements. What is more, the country's start-up ecosystem is now the second-fastest growing and third-largest in the world. The space industry has not remained oblivious to this growth, with many Indian entrepreneurs kick-starting space ventures to provide innovative end-to-end solutions in both the upstream and downstream segments. Companies like Earth2Orbit, Bellatrix Aerospace, Satsure, Astrome Technologies, among several others, are now positioning their offerings within the national and international market and promise not only to disrupt the way space activities are conducted in India, but also to exercise a relevant influence on the future space economy. Drawing on extensive research and numerous interviews with India-based space companies and stakeholders, this paper provides an assessment of the current outlook and future trajectory of the New Space ecosystem taking shape in India. The paper first offers a mapping of this emergent commercial ecosystem and then reviews its weaknesses and strengths in order to disentangle its growth trajectory and implications for the future space economy. The paper, more specifically, demonstrates that there is an inherent growth potential for New Space in India and that such growth will create both challenges and opportunities for the global space industry, especially by that of Europe. It more specifically also shows that there is much scope to nurture mutually beneficial B2B solutions between Indian and foreign space companies in a variety of fields. The original character of this paper is that it integrates a macroscopic level analysis with actual case-studies to provide executives with a clear-eyed view of the real potential of New Space in India and to facilitate the identification of the opportunities it may bring to the European space industry.",Aliberti M.; Nader D.; Vernile A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2017-01-01,"European Space Policy Institute, Austria",B2B ;  European industry ;  Frugal innovation ;  India ;  New Space ;  Start-ups
Space innovation strengthens the socioeconomic fabric of society,"Developing the Space economy is about building a nation's resilience to meet its future challenges. This paper addresses the need for greater understanding of the benefits that space technology and knowledge transfer models can provide, by building on and expanding existing intellectual capital, to strengthen the socioeconomic fabric of society. Socioeconomic development is measured using indicators including GDP, literacy, life expectancy and levels of employment. Space ignites the imagination; it inspires students of all ages to become interested in maths, science, art, design, technology and engineering. Developing the Space narrative as a driver for innovation will launch new industries, education and jobs, will underpin socioeconomic growth and will provide positive externalities and technology spillovers. A model for business such as National Space Innovation Hub© would serve to organise and mobilise institutions, corporations, interested stakeholders and advocates across Australia to develop and implement a broad range of space-related programs and activities. Such an initiative is the logical step and necessary catalyst to establish South Australia and Australia as a key participant and (regional) leader in one of the fastest growing sectors of government, private, academic and commercial partnerships in the world. While this model is focused on Australia's needs, it can be utilised by all space-faring nations. Its purpose is to provide a strategic, inclusive and integrated focal point to facilitate collaboration between industry, research institutions and local, state, territory and federal governments.",Colton A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2017-01-01,National Space Innovation Hub©,Business ;  Collaboration ;  Socioeconomic ;  Space innovation
FluroSat: From university Pilot course to a start-up,"The FluroSat team was brought together by “Inventing the Future” (ItF), an interdisciplinary entrepreneurship and innovation course for post-graduate students at the University of Sydney that was piloted in 2016. The ItF program brings science, engineering, business and design students together to develop innovative solutions to global problems. The ItF approach differs from that of an accelerator in that it uses an interdisciplinary, curriculum-based approach to teach skills ranging from ideation, design, complex thinking, project management, prototyping and business planning. Students must respond to a design brief- rather than coming to the program with an existing product. The FluroSat team was tasked with developing an innovative application of the nanosatellites that would have high potential social and economic impact. Our solution combines the satellite imagery and sophisticated analysis pipelines to provide solutions to compelling problems of modern crop production, such as stress identification, efficient resource inputs and maintenance of yield. During the intensive three-month program, the team iteratively improved on our ideas with the help of industry and domain experts, bringing cutting-edge research to a commercially viable application. By the end of the program, we had developed and built a prototype product. Feedback and validation from industry partners encouraged us to establish a company to address the industry problems discovered throughout the course. FluroSat graduated from “Inventing the Future” to a place in Telstra's Muru-D accelerator. This integration within the start-up community has been vital to the success of our young company. We are continuing to develop our company and our product in close contact with prospective customers.",Volkova A.; Large M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2017-01-01,Faculty of Engineering;The University of Sydney,Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Start-up
"Developing innovative business models for small space programs Spin-outs, “dit space” start-up experience in Costa Rica","Aerospace sector is an engine of worldwide economy responsible for the technology that allows globalization. In Costa Rica in recent years' efforts have been made to introduce the country's economy into this sector. The Central America Association for Aeronautics and Space (ACAE) promotes the development of research projects in the aerospace field, inspiring new talent in the region. Among ACAEs programs are Ditsö for research under microgravity conditions, Irazú is the first nanosatellite in Central America, and an initiative for the creation of the Costa Rica Aerospace Cluster which has generated a knowledge base and regulatory strengths required by this high-quality industry. To further promote the country's economy insertion into the “new space” trend, an entrepreneurship model was developed by ACAE members through the implementation of a spin-out project. The entrepreneurship model relies in two big pillars. First, identifying key sectors and players of the Costa Rican economy who can benefit from space based technology, a dynamic similar to the Smart Specialization concept. Second, the development of an innovative business model trough improvement of channels, customers' relations, market segments, and revenue sources; while parts of the business model structure, such as resources activities and partners, are given by the space program background. By analysing the business model as a technical system in which different parts of the supra-system interact to produce a desired outcome, it can be assumed the system is subject to technical innovation principles, such as ideality and technical evolution, trough removal of technical contradictions. The initiative DIT Space (design, innovation, technology) aims to develop applications based in satellite images. These applications are focused on specific sectors of the Costa Rican and Central American economy including agriculture, mining industry, environmental solutions, and local governments planning. Through an innovative business model, a market of diverse niche segments with diverse needs, is both served and educated on the benefits of the implementation of space based technology. The result is a strength based model in which academy scientific research can pivot and align to local industry/government needs, to create synergies from which further space technology can be developed. This proves to be a valuable model for small space programs and proves the economic value and universal benefits of Space technology research and development.",Monge L.; Aguilar R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2017-01-01,Universidad Nacional;Central American Association of Aeronautics and Space (ACAE),
Mechanism of cooperation for the development of a Central American Space Project - A regional CubeSat,"The Central American region has embarked on different endeavors related to space engineering in recent years. CubeSat missions are currently being independently developed in Costa Rica and Guatemala, with the main purpose of training the human resources, creating the know-how, and infrastructure necessary to execute end-to-end space missions. On the longer term, both groups seek to develop further small satellite missions that will allow scientists and engineers to address the needs of the region, which include remote sensing, communications, monitoring of drug trafficking, illegal fishing, assessing the impact of and preparing for climate change, among others. Both teams understand that to potentiate their capacities beyond the realm of these initial projects, cooperation among peer teams is mandatory. Due to the similar socio-economic situation of both countries and their similar level of development and geographical closeness, there exists a great potential for collaboration. In this scenario, it has been concluded that the best way to develop this collaboration is through the development of a joint space engineering project. This paper proposes a CubeSat mission that will initiate cooperation between research institutions in Central America, led by Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG) and Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC). Previous examples of collaboration between countries of different regions in space-related projects are analyzed and discussed. A methodology developed by researchers at UVG is used to selecting the mission that would benefit the Central American region the most while considering programmatic risk and technical feasibility. This work serves as the basis for determining aspects such as spacecraft capabilities, specifications, and resources needed. Additionally, it helps define the different spacecraft subsystems and other mission features including project management, funding acquisition, testing, launch, and operations. The design philosophy is presented as well, which consists of incremental innovation, starting with the use of high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) spacecraft components from established suppliers, leading to subsystem development by universities and industry in the region. Furthermore, the distribution of responsibilities between participating organizations is defined based on the capabilities of the stakeholders.",Jenkins M.; García B.; Jiménez A.; García D.; Carvajal-Godínez J.; Lara J.; Zea L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2017-01-01,"Faculteit Luchtvaart- en Ruimtevaarttechniek, TU Delft;Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica;Universidad del Valle de Guatemala",Emerging space nations ;  Forest monitoring ;  International collaboration
Moon lava tube habitat designs-from the third space architecture contest in Japan,"Space architecture is the newest creative expression in our human culture. It combines extreme engineering challenges for inhospitable environments with new freedoms such as variation in gravity fields and the creation of structures and forms impossible on Earth. Also, space architecture is extremely challenging with the need to develop new processes and construction methods to use on-site resources for facilities needed in deep space, planetary activities and habitation. Over the next century space architecture will evolve from simple and utilitarian engineering structures to new monumental forms and iconic structures which capture the spirit of the expansion of human culture and creative expression into the Solar System. Japanese general construction companies have developed and refined the concepts and engineering R&D for space hotels, lunar bases, and Mars bases since the 1990's. Although the pace of these activities has slowed down since 2000, it has become active again in recent years. And now several general construction companies have developed ISRU systems and other technologies under the JAXA planetary open innovation hub. In this circumstance, a new Space Architecture Organization for research activities and TNL, space Architecture students' circle based on Tokai University which has space architecture department only in Japan, were established in 2014. An annual Space Architecture Contest and Award Program has been started as a STEAM activity in addition to research activities since 2014. The theme of the third space architecture competition was ""UZMARCH"", which is the acronym which combines UZUME, (Unprecedented Zipangu Underworld of the Moon Exploration), and Architecture. To construct a moon habitat to make best use of lava tube on the moon is to use special geography and moon environment and ISRU.

Optimized methodology for technology roadmaps definition and update for space systems in a System of Systems architecture,"Recently, an increased market competition has brought technology and innovation management to the centre of decision-making processes aimed at understanding the relationships between technological capabilities and objectives to reach. In addition, according to international roadmaps, aerospace systems' design has increased in complexity in the last decades to answer to market and stakeholders' needs and to face an increased synergy between projects. This scenario has led to the need of analysing a higher level of systems architecture: the System of Systems (SoS) architecture, in which systems are able to cooperate maintaining their operational and management independence. Successfully designing a SoS means being able to overcome organizational boundaries to establish a set of objectives and strategic plans. For these reasons, it has become more compelling to apply global, integrated approaches from the very early steps and all over the design process. A useful tool to monitor the current technological maturation and to support decision makers is the technology roadmap. A technology roadmap is the output of a process aimed at identifying and managing technologies, mission, capabilities and systems according to specific strategic plans. This is a complex process, that considers, at the same time, many disciplines and parameters and that has to be included from the early steps of every optimized design process. Looking at the huge number of parameters to be considered simultaneously, a methodology for technology roadmaps derivation and update has been studied to assist decision makers in identifying a global optimal solution, also considering that this optimum can be far from the results achieved through single-discipline optimizations. This paper explain the main features of the logical methodology, based on the combination of common System Engineering tools and processes with Decision Analysis tools and Project Management needs and theories, able to track and manage the technology roadmap pillars and their features between different projects. In particular, this paper aims at giving a clear view of the challenges and the key difficulties that have to be overcame to correctly size the optimal technology roadmap according to a set of identified disciplines, showing how they are involved and demonstrating the importance of their involvement for the design and manage of SoS architecture. Using as an example a simplified Space Exploration context, studies will be proposed to size the results according to the SoS architecture features and requirements and to verify their accurate application within the methodology.",Aleina S.; Monterumici E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2017-01-01,Politecnico di Torino,Complex systems ;  Space tug ;  Technology roadmap
Leap2 and lcats industry clusters: A framework for lunar site technology development using global space-stem education and global space-industry development networks,"Industry clusters, considered the building blocks of modern economies, are an economic concept used to identify and define the geospatial density, growth and network behavior associated with innovation and economic performance. Our research uses cluster analysis related to space-STEM education and space-industry to identify aerospace system-sector industry clusters and factors on a global scale related to lunar site technology development. The goal is to document and encourage space-industry cluster network development, facilitating space-STEM workforce and economic development for communities, based on technologies relevant to particular community areas of interest and aerospace resources. Using a wheel model of unique industrial system-sectors needed for lunar site technology development, analyses and documentation of clusters and factors can assist potential system-sector collaborators in commercial exploration architecture development to cluster network participation and design of space-STEM development. At present, system-sector components for lunar exploration architectures include: satellite communications (Mexico), mission operations (Germany), ISRU and vacuum chamber test environment (Korea), and lunar ecosystem and architectural prototype development (United States). Development of these initial system-sectors are underway through the LCATS and LEAP2 Global Space-STEM Education Network project, “Lunar Caves Analog Test Sites (LCATS) for Space- STEM Learning Performance”, featuring a Lunar Ecosystem and Architectural Prototype (LEAP2). To expand the LCATS and LEAP2 initiative, our research seeks to identify, map, and analyze potential collaborating corporate and industry players representing other system-sector components needed for lunar site development from the perspective of evolving a global space-STEM education network beneficial to the local community of the collaborating organization relevant to their expertise in system-sector component development. Additional cluster expertise sought includes mining and energy generation; food and waste processing; water production for fuels; vehicles and equipment systems, and logistics, to name a few.

Embedded space education in Malaysia: A catalyst towards diverse and multi-skilled graduates,"Universities are in serious discussion towards implementing a flexible curriculum that could match their graduates to the employment needs. Nowadays, graduates are expected to be able to follow several career paths, and not directed only by their degree courses. By taking into account the main challenge in Vision 2020 of becoming a developed country, many efforts have been performed by Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) and are presented in this paper. As the biggest public institution in Malaysia, the main vision is to provide study opportunity for all and to produce thousands graduates per year. However, recently, it is realized that other than education in general, space programs specifically have tangible impacts on society due to the fact that satellite education can be a tool in shaping the quality of the graduates and research diversity. Realizing how huge the impacts are, the university, in collaboration with the Ministry of Higher Education has agreed to fund the development cost of the university's first satellite, through student attachment and collaboration with Kyushu Institute of Technology in BIRDS-2 project. Here, hands-on technology-transfer is identified as the best mechanism to foster space-related researches in Malaysia so that in future, many satellites can be launched, thus will create high-paid jobs. Apart from that, space awareness activities are currently being conducted in the university to gather public's attention and appreciation towards space technologies and applications. Through student participation in innovation competition, a satellite mission control unit prototype, called Open-platform Space Education Module (OSEM) has been developed. The main aim is to design a low-cost platform, with integrated sensor-modules that can be used for classroom demonstration of satellite engineering concept. This product is proposed to be embedded in any institutions that would like to start their space program through STEM. By using this sensor-ready module, many parties will be able to explore the small-satellite applications. The prototype is being upgraded to allow public outreach mission involving local communities through collaboration with local amateur radio clubs. Other than that, a hands-on demonstration of high frequency communication has been conducted recently, which has developed huge interests among students to do hands-on activities, and due to that, a student group organizing activities related to telecommunication, space and amateur radio is to be established by this year. We hope that this could be the catalyst, which would attract more and more funds towards space-related researches in Malaysia and thus, greater number of multi-skilled graduates can be produced.",Abd Rahman N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2017-01-01,Universiti Teknologi MARA,Cube-sat ;  Nanosatellite ;  Open-source ;  Space education ;  STEM
NASA's exploration systems and habitation (X-Hab) academic innovation challenge,"Future exploration missions in the space between the Earth and the Moon or beyond will require complex operational activities to ensure that crew, cargo, and exploration systems safely reach their destination. Through the eXploration Systems and Habitation (X-Hab) Academic Innovation Challenge, NASA develops strategic partnerships and collaborations with universities to increase knowledge in technologies, capabilities, and operational approaches related to future human spaceflight missions. X-Hab activities help NASA bridge strategic knowledge gaps, better understand technology risk reduction, and combine the innovative approaches and diverse insights of university teams with unique agency expertise. The X-Hab Academic Innovation competition links with senior- and graduate-level design curricula that emphasize hands-on development of functional prototypes for deep space exploration missions. Research topics are identified and funded annually by NASA technology projects in collaboration with the National Space Grant Foundation. University teams submit proposals based on their interests and capabilities, and multiple small awards are made for the design and creation of studies or products that align with NASA strategic objectives. The selected project teams implement the design course during the fall and spring semesters using a systems engineering approach that requires formal reviews with NASA for requirements and system definition, preliminary design, and critical design. The challenges allow students to follow genuine hardware and systems engineering development processes and gain valuable experience that will extend to their professional careers.

Advances in the Production and Application of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"BACKGROUND: Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, meaning they have the capacity to selfrenew and to differentiate into cells of the 3 germ layers. In 2006, Takahashi et al. reprogrammed somatic cells into stem cells using exogenetic gene expression. These new cells became known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Research continues to develop new tools and techniques in order to reprogram cells with higher output and quality, so that iPSCs can be used in modeling of human disorders, drug discovery and of course, regenerative medicine.",Mortada I.; Bilani N.,Journal,Current stem cell research &amp; therapy,2017-01-01,Independent Consultant,bioengineering ;  genetic vectors ;  genomic vectors ;  microfluidics ;  pluripotency ;  reprogramming ;  Stem cells
Greenhouse Design with Waste Heat: Principles and Practices,"For the discipline of architectural engineering, greenhouse design represents an area where much innovation is possible and much research is needed. Current design practice relies on rules-of-Thumb and educated guesses, especially regarding energy use. In cold climates, significant heating loads are required to keep the plants growing in winter. In many locations, waste heat may be available from industrial operations, helping to make a prospective operation economically feasible and more sustainable. This paper provides an overview of some of the most important design considerations for using waste heat sources in greenhouse design. It also presents preliminary results of a study to utilize industrial waste heat (hot water) for a 3-Acre greenhouse project located in Lovell, WY. We employed energy simulation to help design the mechanical system. Our preliminary results concluded that the amount of waste heat in this case study is sufficient to provide annual heating demands for a 3-Acre greenhouse and a water to air heat pump system utilizing waste heat can save 74% of total annual site energy for the greenhouse heating.",Denzer A.; Wang L.; Thomas Y.; McMorrow G.,Conference Proceeding,AEI 2017: Resilience of the Integrated Building - Proceedings of the Architectural Engineering National Conference 2017,2017-01-01,College of Engineering and Physical Sciences,
New Association for Capital Project Professionals: Its Mission; Accelerate Professional Development and Team Innovation across the Supply Chain,"Capital projects are increasing becoming more complex and shorter in duration while the engineering and construction industry remains fragmented. A knowledge transfer gap exists between large groups of retiring experienced employees and minimally experienced newly hired personnel. A need exist for an organization to facilitate sharing best practices and innovation between all project professionals (business, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning) and stakeholders on capital projects (owners, contractors, suppliers, academics and students). A group of capital project personnel have created the first association for capital project professionals across the entire supply chain, Capital Projects Professional Exchange (CPX), the objective of this organization is to virtually connect capital project stakeholders as an online community to enhance professional development by supporting and encouraging sharing of best practices, resources and opportunities. The initiative is currently in its research phase which includes social media integration and crowdsourcing techniques as a method to exchange knowledge between various capital project stakeholders. Initial feedback indicates that such an organization can accelerate the learning curve of new professionals entering the capital projects construction industry and facilitate the exchange of best practices and innovation.",Sáenz N.; Marks E.; Back W.,Conference Proceeding,AEI 2017: Resilience of the Integrated Building - Proceedings of the Architectural Engineering National Conference 2017,2017-01-01,"Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc.;Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering",Capital projects ;  construction engineering ;  construction management ;  industry association

Computational models of expressive movement qualities in dance,"Art and science are two different but strongly coupled aspects of human creativity, driving innovation both as art influences science and technology and as science and technology in turn inspire art (Camurri and Volpe 2016). The Casa Paganini-InfoMus Research Centre 1 at the University of Genoa carries out scientific research in information and communications technology (ICT) combined with artistic and humanistic research. In particular, scientific and technological research focuses on human-centred computing wherein art and humanistic theories are a fundamental source of inspiration, capable of deep cross-fertilisation with ‘hard’ sciences and engineering. In this chapter, research results from European projects on innovative scientific and technological research related to dance and music are presented. We show how our collaboration with artists informed our work on analysing non-verbal, expressive and social behaviour and contributed to the development of a technology - the EyesWeb XMI hardware and software platform 2 - that supports both artistic and scientific developments at our research centre and is widely adopted by artists, scientists, and a large number of institutions.",Camurri A.,Book,Music-Dance: Sound and Motion in Contemporary Discourse,2017-01-01,Università degli Studi di Genova,

Beyond the barriers: Witnessing shifting gender dynamics in multinational mine jobs in Ghana,"Gender equality plays a very significant role in our socioeconomic development and corporate innovations. However, the multinational Ghanaian mining is dominated by men and a culture of masculinity. The current paper, therefore, studies the Ghanaian mines, exposes their homogeneous scopes, and examines the sociocultural barriers constraining effective participation of women in mine works. The paper further explores the transformations that have occasioned a shift in gender dynamics, leading to an increased participation of women in mines. The results of deploying a multiple case study, qualitative research design, and meta-narratives of the respondents, point to common prejudices, perceptions, and implicit stereotyped notions of gender roles in the mines, as the sociocultural factors constraining the effective participation of women in mine jobs. Beyond the barriers, the paper intuits a women’s revolution in the mines due to the collective efforts of mining companies and allied institutions, both adopting gender strategic measures such as the ‘ore solidarity movement’ gender mainstreaming in admission programs as well as gender equity-driven mining initiatives aimed at re-engineering a shift in gender dynamics of the mine jobs of Ghana. These change regimes among the mines imply inclusivity, de-feminization of poverty, a move towards achieving organizational modernization, competitiveness, and an assurance for gender equality driven social innovative mining.",Kilu R.,Journal,"Gender, Technology and Development",2017-01-01,"University of Professional Studies, Accra;Luleå University of Technology",Barriers ;  Ghanaian mines ;  Maledominance ;  Shifting gender dynamics ;  Sociocultural

What drives university technological innovation and commercialization?,"Universities are a source of technological innovation, which in turn facilitates economic growth. The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was enacted to support university research efforts. However, since its enactment, university technological innovation had been increasing slowly. In this study, I explore the current and future impact of university characteristics and regional industry R&D activities on university technological innovation and commercialization. The findings verify existing, albeit fairly dated, literature by demonstrating their current impact; and extend it by showing their future impact to various degrees.

Modeling connected customer lifetime value (CCLV) in the banking domain,"Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) has become increasingly important as a marketing metric because of its ability to predict the future profitability of clients, potentially enabling more appropriate marketing strategies. Traditional CLV models, however, do not reflect the (dynamic) networks of business transactions. This research develops a Connected Customer Lifetime Value (CCLV) model based on an empirical analysis of transactions in the financial services domain. The model was applied to a significant number of transactions between firms using a modern open source computing infrastructure (Spark plus Hadoop). We have illustrated the outcomes of the application of the model via a ‘top and bottom 20’ listing of firms in relation to their value network. In positive terms, application of the model allows our research partner to see the network implications of decisions they make with respect to customers and opens up an arena for innovation re network-based products and services.",Lycett M.; Marshan A.,Conference Proceeding,AMCIS 2017 - America's Conference on Information Systems: A Tradition of Innovation,2017-01-01,"Brunel University London;Royal Holloway, University of London",Big Data ;  Business Analytics ;  Connected Customer Lifetime Value (CCLV) ;  Social Network Analysis
Technology,"Thoreau’s world was saturated with technology. For two hundred years, English settlement had been reshaping the Concord valley, turning Concord village into a hub of agriculture, commerce, and industry. Henry David Thoreau grew up in the heart of it, right next to the Mill Dam, where the wheels of the old grist mill still ground corn and rye amid a ramshackle collection of shops and factories, foundries, a saw mill, and a tannery, all busily turning out clocks, furniture, carriages, guns, shoes - and pencils, too, the local specialty that his father John Thoreau turned into the foundation for the family’s prosperity. Henry, the younger son, was so good with his hands that his parents almost apprenticed him to a cabinet-maker, but when he also proved good with his head, they sent him to Harvard instead, paying his tuition out of pencil factory profits. When the young college graduate lost his first job, he went to work in the family business, becoming a hand on the factory floor. But what if the hand had a brain? Thoreau decided to turn his labor into an intellectual challenge by tackling the engineering problem that had long bedeviled the American pencil industry. American pencils were gritty, greasy, and brittle, far inferior to those imported from Britain and France. Thoreau’s research resulted in a breakthrough: he figured out how to mix graphite and clay into a hard-fired ceramic pencil lead - the more clay, the harder the lead - and he invented a machine capable of grinding the graphite into the finest impalpable powder. Together, these two technological innovations made Thoreau pencils the finest in America, sought after by artists and engineers - and by Thoreau himself, who used his own pencils to take field notes in all weathers, notes he could, back at his desk, expand into the writings that made him one of America’s most iconic figures. For the rest of his life Henry Thoreau continued to tinker, and in a ferociously competitive industry, his improvements kept the Thoreaus at the leading edge of the market, first in the pencil industry, then in the manufacture of ground plumbago for the emerging mass print technology of electrotyping.",Walls L.,Book,Henry David Thoreau in Context,2017-01-01,University of Notre Dame,
The brazilian GMO regulatory system: A historical view and perspective,"Introduction. Brazil is a leading exporter of crops, which represent an important element in its trade balance. At the same time, the country has a solid infrastructure for research and development in agriculture, health, fuel production and innovation, and in many other important areas, which are also relevant for the trade balance and for Brazilian social and economic development. In this favourable scenario it is not surprising that products derived from modern biotechnology were welcome from the very beginning, as were the new technologies derived from genetic engineering, both in research and in innovation. As a consequence of the international consensus on regulating products derived from biotechnology and/or the technology itself, a long national discussion started in 1989 on the uses and regulation of biotechnology-derived products and how to assess risks associated with the intentional use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or arising from their accidental release. A plethora of different stakeholders contributed to the establishment of the first regulatory framework in 1995 and its refinement in 2005. Moreover, Brazil joined the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and has been a party to it since 2003, which has profound implications in its trade relations with other parties and countries, in general. The establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework enabled the country to quickly adopt biotechnology in agriculture and other productive sectors and, as a consequence, Brazil is now one of the leading crop exporters and has the second-largest cultivated area of genetically modified (GM) crops, 44.2 million hectares (ha), just behind the USA with 70.9 million ha in 2015 (James, 2015). This chapter describes the history of GMO regulation in Brazil, the biosafety regulatory framework and the contribution of agro-biotechnology to the Brazilian economy. A Brief History of GMO Regulation in Brazil. The establishment of a biosafety law in Brazil began with discussions in the Lower House in 1989. However, only after the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992 did the pressure to approve biosafety rules for the use of genetic engineering technologies increase. Scientists, government agencies, environmentalists and private companies urged that such rules should be adopted.",Velini E.; Dagli M.; Delfino De Souza G.; Nascimento R.; Paes De Andrade P.; Carrer H.,Book,Genetically Modified Organisms in Developing Countries: Risk Analysis and Governance,2017-01-01,"Ministerio da Ciencia e Tecnologia;Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""",
A novel tool for improving the data collection process during control room modernization human-system interface testing and evaluation activities,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) Program is developing a scientific basis to extend the existing U.S. nuclear power plant (NPP) operating life beyond the current 60-year licensing period and to ensure NPP long-term reliability, productivity, safety, and security. Under the Advanced Instrumentation, Information, and Control (II&C) Systems Technologies pathway, the LWRS Program conducts targeted research and development to address long-term aging and obsolescence of existing instrumentation and control technologies, as well as to implement and test new digital II&C technology that enables broad innovation and business improvement in the NPP operating model. To this end, the role of human factors engineering (HFE) is important as part of ensuring that the control room modernization (CRM) activities account for the operator's cognitive and physiological characteristics. Part of the HFE process for CRM entails conducting tests and evaluations (T&Es) that will inform the design of new human-system interface (HSI) technologies. Qualitative data that captures operator feedback and important human-system interactions are an important part of T&E. However, the analyzing this qualitative data in order to provide actionable design recommendations can be time-consuming and error prone. This paper presents an early version of a tool, which uses a combination of natural language processing and supervised machine learning to support the analysis of qualitative data. The objectives of this tool is to improve the process of (1) sifting through freeform text for improved design issue identification, (2) maintaining consistency in theme coding conventions, and (3) readily providing actionable design guidance that can be traceable to state-of-the-art HFE guidelines such as NUREG-0700.",Kovesdi C.; Joe J.,Conference Proceeding,"10th International Topical Meeting on Nuclear Plant Instrumentation, Control, and Human-Machine Interface Technologies, NPIC and HMIT 2017",2017-01-01,Idaho National Laboratory,Control room modernization ;  Evaluations ;  Human factors engineering ;  Qualitative data analysis ;  Tests

BYOD as one interdisciplinary response to address gaps between in-school and out-of-school learning in the 21<sup>st</sup> century,"BYOD or bring your own device generally describes the practice of bringing a personal learning device to the learning or work environment, and BYOD's widespread adoption continues to grow across all sectors. This investigation of BYOD research in interdisciplinary settings is designed to help organize key issues and opportunities afforded by BYOD implementation. Digital technology use is opening new learning spaces in K-12 and higher education, but enthusiasm for innovation is balanced with considerations of how these new technology-enabled learning spaces promote safe, well-managed, and enhanced learning. We examine the research on elearning with a specific lens on BYOD, 1-1, and pervasive technologies across disciplines and sectors of education. Our investigations have led to the design of a framework of possibilities and challenges that have been identified with BYOD.

Curriculum development for enhancing the imagination in the technology commercialization process,"The imagination capability in technology commercialization is the key success factor for innovation. However, higher education in general and engineering-related curricula in particular, has offered limited courses incorporating imagination. A complete and well-verified curriculum that will enhance the imagination capability in technology commercialization is critical and imperative to resolve the problem. Thus, this research summarizes possible course modules and the criteria for evaluating and selecting the core modules based upon a literature review. Final criteria were defined by using the modified Delphi method. The influence relationships of each criterion on the others were derived by the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). Subsequently, the derivation of critical criteria, a weight was defined for each criterion by using the DEMATEL-based Network Process (DNP). Finally, the correlations between the criteria and the course modules were derived by using the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA).

Promoting sustainability in engineering through EPICS program,"Future engineers must be able to incorporate sustainability into all aspects of their designs to meet the increasing demands for the world's resources. Consequently, engineering educators have been challenged to integrate sustainability into existing curricula. Sustainability is a particularly complex problem requiring innovation, which often stems from diversity. Service learning programs have been shown to be an attractive and effective method to blend sustainability into engineering education curricula while also encouraging diversity in engineering. In particular, Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) is a well-established service-learning program at 24 universities that has been known to accomplish this by presenting engineering in social context and engaging students in designing solutions to real world problems.

Governance of open innovation networks with national vs international scope,"Purpose: The realisation of joint innovation outcomes in open innovation networks is closely related to an efficient utilisation of governance mechanisms, which coordinate joint processes (e.g. knowledge sharing) and eliminate undesired behaviours (e.g. opportunism). Hence, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the complex effects of multiple governance approaches on outcomes of open innovation networks with a national and an international scope. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on a large-scale survey-based study of 100 mechanical engineering firms involved in open innovation networks. Hypotheses are tested by means of PLS structural equation modelling. Findings: The evidence shows that the three governance mechanisms: transactional governance, relational governance and institutionalised governance significantly foster innovation outcomes of open innovation networks. In national open innovation networks, only relational governance exerts positive effects, internationally transactional and institutionalised governance is necessary. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to research in multiple ways. First, it shows that governance of open innovation networks is crucial for their innovation performance, thereby providing some explanations for the performance differences between certain networks. Second, the results indicate that the effects of governance mechanisms depend on the scope of the network. By showing that the effect of governance mechanisms varies under different contextual conditions the study also contributes to the ongoing debate on combined effects of governance mechanisms. Originality/value: The paper fills important gaps in the existing research on the link between governance and performance in open innovation networks and delineates interesting areas for further research.",Clauss T.; Spieth P.,Journal,Journal of Strategy and Management,2017-01-01,Universität Kassel;Philipps-Universität Marburg,Institutionalized governance ;  Joint innovation generation ;  Open innovation networks ;  Relational governance ;  Transactional governance

Development of a complex control system for multiple fluid flow gradients,"Innovations in biomimetic engineering are inspired by the natural world, advancing technology and improving green manufacturing and environmental biomaterial stability. Structural biomolecules such as major ampullate spider silk and chitosan have proven sources of material science innovation for decades. Although chitosan is readily used in several biomedical applications, the potential of spider silk as a new biomaterial is just beyond our grasp, despite interest from a wide variety of STEM disciplines. Understanding, and ultimately manipulating, biomimetic fiber mechanics relies on integration of chemical and biological gradients with shear thinning forces, necessitating a multidisciplinary team approach to make significant progress. Unfortunately, although the genetic sequences of major ampullate spider silk proteins are known, the raw materials are limited and artificial production of silk fibers from protein is vastly different from natural silk, resulting in mechanically inferior fibers. Using chitosan as a model structural biomolecule, a device was engineered to mimic the natural process (i.e., pH gradients, ionic gradients, and mechanical fluid dynamics) found in the spider’s gland, making it possible to spin tailored mechanically superior biological fibers. Initial research considered (1) multiple fluid flow simulations and (2) prototype development of complex microfluidic chips to produce a high performance thin fiber from a dissolved natural biomolecule. Preliminary fibers have been successfully spun using an aqueous spider silk spin dope and mechanically tested. However, to ensure customizable biological fiber production, an artificial spinning device with multiple pumps and a focus on the complex control system to control fluid rates and biochemical gradients is necessary.",Hoffmann B.; Gruat-Henry C.; Mulinti P.; Jiang L.; Brooks B.; Brooks A.,Conference Proceeding,"54th Annual Rocky Mountain Bioengineering Symposium, RMBS 2017 and 54th International ISA Biomedical Sciences Instrumentation Symposium 2017",2017-01-01,NDSU College of Engineering;North Dakota State University,Biomaterials ;  Chitosan ;  Fluid Dynamics ;  Hydrodynamic Focusing ;  Microfluidics ;  Spider Silk
Multidisciplinary approach for a commercial transport aircraft rudder with morphing characteristics,"The history of aviation is linked to the research and development of different physical and mathematical scientific fields. In our historic aviation records good examples can be found of studies and implementations. These cover not only new unconventional and disruptive aircraft configurations, but also the research and introduction of new materials and processes to make the airframe lighter and stronger. Also there have been continuous developments are available in the prediction of the aerodynamic loads that size an airplane to be safe, stable, controllable, and with adequate flying qualities. Today there is a growing social demand to minimize environmental impact in all industrial sectors. Our aviation industry is also under this scrutiny. This is the reason why new requirements are emerging as eco- sustainability, in addition to compliance with the safety and certification requirements together with the challenges of being global economical competitive in an increasingly demanding world. In this line, it is remarkable to state that aircraft fuel consumption, and thus emissions of carbon dioxide, is directly linked by three key aircraft parameters, Breguet formula related: weight, drag and specific consumption of the power plant. The development of technology innovations in these three drivers must continue and this has to be approached from a multidisciplinary perspective. This keynote focuses on summarizing the influence of the improvements in different aeronautics disciplines enabled by novel materials and additive manufacturing process, based on the introduction of a non conventional morphing curved rudder in a transport aircraft configured with under the wing podded engines.

Predictive technology management for the identification of future development trends and the maximum achievable potential based on a quantitative analysis,"A company’s ability to find the most profitable technology is based on a precise forecast of achievement potential. Technology Management (TM) uses forecasting models to analyse future potentials, e.g. the Gartner Hype Cycle, Arthur D. Little’s technology lifecycle or McKinsey’s S-curve model. All these methods are useful for qualitative analysis in the planning of strategic research and development (R&D) expenses. In a new approach, exponential and logistic growth functions are used to identify and quantify characteristic stages of technology development. Innovations from electrical, mechanical and computer engineering are observed and projected until the year 2025. Datasets from different industry sectors are analysed, as the number of active Facebook users worldwide, the tensile yield point of flat bar steel, the number of transistors per unit area on integrated circuits, the fuel efficiency per dimension of passenger cars, and the energy density of Lithium-Ion cells. Results show the period of performance doubling and the forecast for the end of the technological achievement potential. The methodology can help to answer key entrepreneurial questions such as the search for alternatives to applied technologies, as well as identifying the risk of substitution technology.",Fries M.; Lienkamp M.,Journal,"Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems",2017-01-01,Technische Universität München,Big data ;  Computational intelligence ;  Data mining ;  Exponential growth ;  Innovation management ;  Logistic growth ;  Performance periods ;  Technology assessment ;  Technology management
The mechanics of life: A closer look at the inner workings of nature,"This book is devoted to current ideas and developments in the biological sciences which stretch into fields such as engineering, medicine, quantum physics, computer modeling and genetics. In the past couple of years, biology and medicine have significantly evolved. The picture of the solitary biologist taking samples from the field and working in a lab with test tubes and chemical apparatus is a thing of the past. Today, bio-labs are filled with scientists across various disciplines like physics, mathematics and engineering. Most equipment are completely automated and robotic. They are often controlled by powerful computers acquiring and processing vast amounts of data for rigorous analysis. These advances have sped up the rate at which research is done in those fields. The topics presented in this book are simplified versions of these advances. Focusing on the ""how it works"" explanation, the notions presented here are made easy and simple to follow. Besides current research, the book elaborates on novel innovations in bio-related research - e.g., ecosystem simulators, robotic surgery, natural experimentation and state-of-the-art instrumentation. Social and economic aspects of modern biology and medicine are also explored throughout this book; touching on issues related to disease spread, medical efforts and best scientific practices. The final part of this book walks through the mechanisms involved in the evolution of life on our planet. Along these lines, the evolution of Homo sapiens is briefly visited. In essence, this book involves taking a closer look at the mechanics of life",Ganesan T.,Book,The Mechanics of Life: A Closer Look at the Inner Workings of Nature,2017-01-01,Tenaga Nasional Berhad,
Digital revolution: How digital technologies will transform E&P business models in Asia-Pacific,"Disruptions, both to what the industry does and how it does it, have the potential to transform the oil and gas (O&G) industry. 3 main trends will impact future exploration and production (E&P) business models, namely: (i) lower oil price environment resulting in shrinking margins; (ii) changing energy mix towards natural gas and non-hydrocarbons; and (iii) increased level of connectivity that is driving digital technology adoption and automation. Digital is the latest buzzword, but what are the implications for an industry that is not new to digital technology? The increasing pace of innovation is driving opportunity for the sector to re-imagine their business models. Digital transformations could unlock USD 1.6-2.5 trillion for the industry, its customers, and wider society (World Economic Forum, 2017). Currently, only 6% of companies can be described as ""Digital High Performers"" – those who have successfully altered existing business models to capture opportunities for sustainable top-line growth (Accenture Digital, 2017). This paper identifies potential business models for the upstream sector that are built upon technologies such as advanced real-time 3D seismic studies, dynamic portfolio and margin management, well & facilities standardisation, and predictive analytics for flow assurance. Becoming a Digital High Performer requires a mindset shift, which results in completely different lifecycle processes (from workflow-driven to decision time-driven) and organisational structures (from rigid partnerships to a fluid capability ecosystem). Extracting resources faster and cheaper will replace maximising total recovery as a strategic goal; companies that achieve this have the potential to increase returns on invested capital by 3-10 times current levels (Refined, 2016). The path to capturing the future of O&G requires the right investments in technology and people, paired with flawless execution and governance. Economic scenarios suggest that the combined impact of technology and socio-economic factors could accelerate peak oil demand to as early as 2030 (World Energy Council, 2016). This increases the urgency for energy companies to rethink their strategic direction and how they generate competitive advantage in a rapidly changing world.",Volkenborn A.; Lea-Cox A.; Wei Yi Tan.,Conference Proceeding,Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition 2017,2017-01-01,Accenture,
Innovation in construction materials engineering versus sustainable development,"Innovation in construction is presented as a necessary aspect in the answer that the construction industry must provide to solve its negative impact on the environment. Original and innovative research is only part of the work to be accomplished. More important is the implementation of innovation in practice, where traditions are strongly rooted in society, and safety and long term reliability are required.

Changing R&D prospects in metal companies,"Managers of metal companies recognize the importance of continuous product development and engineering. Value chain integration, product platforms, digital business models and marketing are still less noticeable in metal companies but that may change fast as customers adopt new concepts. Managers have to respond to those changes with strategic initiatives, which are difficult to measure and control. I analyze changes in research and development expenditures focusing on industrial metals and mining companies. The decision to increase or decrease R&D expenditures in relation to changes in sales is strategic in metal companies as unprecedented stream of innovative products enter the market. In this paper, I propose to distinguish four basic management behaviors related to R&D expenditures and provide with graphical exemplification of market analysis based on two variables (growth in R&D expenditures and growth in sales). The results indicate differences in behavior of companies in developed and developing countries. Further differences can be observed between lower R&D intensity and higher R&D intensity companies. The proposed methodology can be used to map the company's R&D competitive position.",Pomykalski P.,Conference Proceeding,"METAL 2017 - 26th International Conference on Metallurgy and Materials, Conference Proceedings",2017-01-01,Lodz University of Technology,Corporations ;  Innovation ;  Metallurgy ;  R&D
Research on science and technology level of chemical industry in China based on the perspective of talent innovation ability - A case study of yangtze river delta in China,"At present, there is no industry without chemicals. Without the chemical industry, the economy and society can hardly maintain rapid growth. However, there are some problems in the development of chemical industry such as low chemical technology and slow technological innovation in chemical industry, which can be attributed to the innovation level of innovative talents in chemical industry in China. Therefore, based on the related research, the evaluation index system of technological innovation ability of regional chemical industry is constructed. Taking Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in 2016 as an example, the result found that: on the whole, in the comprehensive evaluation of innovation ability of chemical industry talents in science and technology, the evaluation results are as follows: Shanghai>Jiangsu>Zhejiang; the evaluation results of input in science and technology talents in chemical industry are as follows: Shanghai>Jiangsu>Zhejiang; the evaluation results of innovation output of science and technology talents in chemical industry are as follows: Zhejiang> Jiangsu> Shanghai; the evaluation results of innovation and development environment are as follows: Jiangsu> Zhejiang> Shanghai.

Analytical and experimental research on improvement of the ductility of buildings' R/C seismic walls through slip prevention with the use of stoppers,"Several researchers propose placing diagonal reinforcing bars at the base of the wall to treat the shear slip, while others have suggested various ways to address this problem associated with the halting of the effects incurred by the through-crack in the base of the wall during recycling of loading. An indicative proposal of the bibliography is using large diameter reinforcement bars in the web of the wall as vertical reinforcements, so that through the dowel action of these bars to be able to better control the shear action. The two aforementioned proposals, while adequately address the phenomenon of shear slip, present significant disadvantages: The use of diagonal reinforcement is very difficult to be constructed, because of the density of existing reinforcement in the base of the walls, which involves compromising good concrete condensation. Also, the use of large diameter vertical reinforcement along the length of the whole wall section, including its web, leads to a strongly uneconomical solution. This works examines a solution without the aforementioned side effects. Innovation of the present work is the fact that it positions stoppers in combination with the use of conventional reinforcing bars at positions of the critical zones of the walls, in order to further prevent the expected slip along the through-crack in the base of the rigidly supported wall. The work is mainly experimental and includes investigation of the seismic mechanical properties of a wall specimen with conventional reinforcement according to EC8. This study presents the investigation on the effect of the shear span as resistance parameter, on the design of concrete interfaces. In the first part of the study the shear transfer between concrete interfaces, in which the value of the shear span is equal to zero, is investigated. The experimental investigation is extended to include values of the shear span greater than zero. These values are usually observed at bridge seismic stoppers. The experimental results presented in this study are used to derive an analytical expression of the resistance of bridge seismic stoppers.",Chrysanidis T.; Tegou S.; Tegos I.; Spyridonidou S.,Conference Proceeding,COMPDYN 2017 - Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Computational Methods in Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering,2017-01-01,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Buildings ;  Ductility ;  Slip ;  Stoppers ;  Walls
Climate engineering: Responsible innovation or reckless folly?: Keynote address to RRI conference 2015,"Responsible innovation has been a longstanding concern for the social sciences: dating back at least as far as the 1980s, since when a succession of technologies have been introduced with grandiose claims of life-changing benefits, only to founder in the face of under-performance and public scepticism. This paper asks whether the emerging and already controversial field of climate geoengineering will prove to be yet another chapter in this litany or whether it represents an opportunity to develop a framework for responsible innovation according to a model of guiding societal principles and technology-specific protocols. It concludes by noting that geoengineering is currently at a research impasse as technologists await a green light from social scientists before proceeding with research, while social scientists are limited to commenting on highly speculative ideas about how geoengineering might turn out in practice. Under these conditions, the values underlying debates about novel technology are unusually transparent.",Rayner S.,Book,Responsible Innovation 3: A European Agenda?,2017-01-01,University of Oxford,
Responsible innovation 3: A European agenda?,"This book offers a comprehensive overview of current developments in the field of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). Divided into three parts, the book first presents reflections on the concept of RI from various angles: how did it come about, who is involved and how might in be applied in various contexts, such as the academic environment or in developing countries. The second part discusses the actual application of RRI to technology development: for climate engineering, water management and energy technology along with a general discussion on how to integrate RRI in innovation trajectories. The last part offers a closer look at the application of RRI to the business context. This part offers lessons from comparable concepts such as social and sustainability innovation as well as insights from two case-studies, one in the food sector and the other in data management.

It supports clear communications among engineers with different by translating requirements terms into software behavioral expectations, which can be used to drive test specifications and the reporting of test results. Also, because it helps translate the requirements into software behavior terms, it addresses some of the difficulties of testing autonomy requirements. Innovations in ART include a clear linking of requirements, expected software behavior, test plans, and test results. They also include the immersion of the Test Runner portion of the ART design within the Core Flight System (CFS) architecture, so that the application under test can be tested as it is intended to fly, even before the remainder of the flight software has been developed.

"Engineering the free world: The emergence of the OECD as an actor in education policy, 1957-1972","This chapter analyzes the OECDs emerging role in education policy and retraces the early history of the Center for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI), which has become highly influential through the launch of the famous Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). It argues that the OECD’s engagement in education policy was driven by a network of technocrats aiming to produce the “right kind of people,” or engineering the West. Paradoxically, the failure of this quantitative planning project opened the doors for the OECD to get involved with more qualitative aspects of education planning. Catalyzed by the United States, and in particular the Ford Foundation, goal-oriented sciences were used by the OECD as governing means, allowing an organization that lacked binding policy instruments to professionalize its soft-law governance.",Bürgi R.,Book,The OECD and the International Political Economy Since 1948,2017-01-01,Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz FHNW,
A web-based crowd sourcing data application in exploring the effect of collaborative we-intention on adoption of cloud-multimedia drive,"In modern multimedia data management, crowd sourcing and online collaboration are emerging ways of innovation and implementation for projects. Knowing why a group of people adopts a certain cloud-multimedia drive is the purpose of this research. In this research, besides the effect of usability which is the traditional cause of system adoption, the authors designed an 18 week long experiment to explore the effect of we-intention on adoption of cloud-multimedia drive. The result shows that we-intention is a cause of adoption, but if the effect of usability on adoption is controlled, we-intention seems to have little effect on adoption. Although usability remains the dominant factor, the exploration finds that we-intention can weaken the relationship between usability and adoption. The implication of this research is collective intention might substitute usability to some degree in system adoption, and managers could find ways more of social perspective to help system adoption.",Chen Y.; Chouis J.; Wuis C.; Chuis H.,Journal,International Journal of Applied Systemic Studies,2017-01-01,Hwa Hsia University of Technology;National Taipei University of Technology,Cloud drive ;  Collaboration ;  System adoption ;  Usability ;  We-intention
New methods for the design of smart products: Project based learning with industry,"In the last few years, IoT (Internet of Things) technology has been in full development. However, the market has not yet given rise to many concrete applications with high adoption since classic product oriented SMEs (Small to Medium-sized Enterprises) have difficulties with the integration of these IoT technologies in existing products. Simultaneously, our design education is shifting from knowledge based learning towards project based learning. Students need to be trained in the process of finding and applying new technologies rather than acquiring existing knowledge. Both technological and educational shifts present opportunities for educators to expose design and engineering students to new design paradigms, while also involving local industry. Companies are also increasingly relying on external Research and Development (R&D) organizations, such as Universities, to support innovation [1]. Additionally, as stressed by Chen & Hsu [2], fostering creativity among students is viewed as an important skill for engineering students. In order to achieve this, a new integrated design course has been presented to interdisciplinary teams of students with a background in industrial product design, electronics, and multimedia and information technology. In this course, we challenge them to come up with an idea and working prototype for a smart product. In this paper we give an overview of the course and present its strengths and pitfalls. We found our approach to be successful, with design cases that lead to novel research, technologies and commercial products. We discuss the impact of our results for design education and suggest areas for further research.",Neutens T.; Saldien J.; Verstockt S.; Wyffels F.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Building Community: Design Education for a Sustainable Future, E and PDE 2017",2017-01-01,Universiteit Gent,Project based learning ;  Prototyping ;  Smart products

Evaluation of knowledge work productivity – case distributed software development,"The increased attractiveness of knowledge work offerings in cost competitive countries has pushed companies to seek for even more intensive forms of outsourcing. Striving for higher competitiveness and productivity, companies are looking beyond their current ways of outsourcing to create partnerships related to their core operations like research, development and innovation (RDI). Today and in future the success of distribution of knowledge intensive efforts in globally operated businesses is dictated by game changing capabilities such as quality of services, dynamic competence building of individuals and teams, as well as management of decentralized work. Yet, these are just examples of a larger spectrum of factors manifesting the dynamism of distributed software development. The DD-SCALE research program (2014-2016) has been targeted at investigating especially the aforementioned matters. The lack of feasible evaluation practises for explaining productivity of knowledge organizations in a comprehensive way has been an important driver. Managing and measuring productivity in the global settings of knowledge work has been in the focus of the program. Thus far, a baseline concept of the DD-SCALE evaluation framework, containing some 90 aggregated indicators, has been constructed. These Capability Indicators are related to individual, team and organizational capabilities, aiming to explain productivity in software engineering organizations. The development work was supported by context related theories concerning distributed knowledge work and Intellectual Capital (IC), which has been a key in capturing the less visible elements of productivity. Intellectual capital lenses were utilized in analysing interviews and workshops conducted with managerial level software RDI professionals in two globally operating case-companies. The contribution of this study is finding new dimensions for complementing the rather short-term input-output approach in assessing productivity. Also further elaboration about factors underpinning productivity in building a comprehensive evaluation framework is exercised. Eventually, the emphasis of this article is to bring forth the practical uses for the DD-SCALE evaluation framework. Initial instantiations of the framework include assessing 1) the influence a change in an organization’s operation model has on software developers’ perceptions, and 2) organizational impacts of technology transfer activities. As further research, the plan is to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the framework and advance its development into an actual tool to support managerial decision making.",Kamaja P.; Löytty K.; Ruohonen M.; Ingalsuo T.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the European Conference on Intellectual Capital,2017-01-01,Haaga-Helia University Of Applied Sciences;Tampere University,Evaluation framework ;  Global software engineering ;  Intellectual capital ;  Knowledge work ;  Organizational capability ;  Productivity
Interferences of industrial design and engineering in future design education,"During the last years, the differences between industrial design and engineering design have become increasingly blurred. The two disciplines show interferences regarding their methods, problems and ideas. Fundamentally, they also share the term ‘design’ which addresses industrial design as well as engineering design. This is visible particularly in contemporary product development processes where a holistic understanding of the word design forms the base of successful communication and collaboration between designers and engineers [1]. Radical changes in industry regarding speed, cost efficiency and quantity influence the design process and thus design education. An acceleration of product life cycles requires the parallel development of product parts and systems. Customized industrial goods have to meet the specific needs of a small target group. Users need to be involved in their development. Within these complex systems digital and analogue design overlaps. With our contribution to the E&PDE conference 2017, we will present our education concept as an ongoing research project. It has a focus on product design education at tertiary - and thus university - level. We want to discuss interferences of industrial design and engineering and we will have a closer look at particular examples from our process, for instance at our newly established makerspace and virtual reality lab.",Frye A.; Gärtner F.; Pietzsch M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Building Community: Design Education for a Sustainable Future, E and PDE 2017",2017-01-01,Hochschule Aalen University of Applied Sciences,Creativity ;  Industrial design engineering education ;  Industrial experience ;  Innovation ;  Innovation in design education ;  Practice ;  Process ;  Topics: design education practice
"Crossing cultures: Creating a ph.D. Programme in engineering, art & design","In this paper, challenges and potential rewards of multi-disciplinary cooperation in engineering and design education are discussed with reference to the specific case of developing a joint PhD program in technology, engineering, art and design at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences. A point of departure for the discussion is C.P. Snow’s identification of a conflict between two academic cultures: science and humanities. Snow argued that the mutual ignorance of the other group’s world view had become a direct hindrance to our ability to cope with the grand challenges of the future, such as famine, overpopulation and poverty. Today, more than 50 years later, Snow’s pessimistic diagnosis has still not lost its relevance. Cooperation and genuine understanding across disciplinary boundaries is encouraged, but seldom realized. The paper describes the current status of a multi-disciplinary PhD program in development in which Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is applied as a unifying, program defining perspective. Explaining how RRI May attend to needs and shortcomings in both academic cultures, the supplementary method of “critical making” is introduced and discussed.

"Ready for succes, first year efficiency for industrial design engineering education.","The Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) bachelor program of the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences started a program in 2015. Its goal was to increase the study efficiency of the first-year students: we wanted more students to pass the first year successfully. The students, teachers, management and work field are very pleased by the IDE program and the level of the graduates. But the study efficiency was still negative. Of all first-year students in 2013, 22% succeeded to finish all first-year courses (60 ECTS), after the second year, 43% did not succeed and had to quit the program. In 2014, with a better teacher approach on building a learner’s community and a better organisation of the curriculum, the first-year efficiency increased to 45%. Still 38% did not succeed within 2 years and had to leave. After extensive research IDE increased the first year ECTS threshold, limited second changes by tests and added a small compensation in the first-year program. This as a goal to improve the student bonding to form a strong engaged learning community. In 2015, the results of the first year increased to 70% successful students to finish all courses (60 ECTS) in their first year, 10% was able to finish the first-year program in the second year, they achieved the increased threshold of 52 ECTS.

The creative engineering education imperative for twenty-First century living,"Engineering and design in the twentieth century were conventionally taught from opposite ends of an educational spectrum. Engineering education built certainty on a strong foundation of fundamental knowledge, with students engaging with applications only once those fundamentals were ingrained. Design, in contrast, involved challenging certainty, with divergent thinking, experience mapping, problem framing and exploratory research. Over the last twenty years, elements of creativity and design process education have progressed into the majority of engineering curricula, but change is still slow. Yet, meanwhile, the pace of technological change impacting engineering futures and has been rapid. Arguably, the ability to be open and responsive to radical changes in thinking will become increasingly vital for engineering educators and practitioners with the unknowns of rapid change, both technical and social. For future engineering professionals to be able to be responsive to each wave of disruptive technology, engineering educators will have to re-invigorate their efforts in the adoption of pedagogy that supports creativity and innovation in order to keep pace. In addition, engineering graduates need to be educated not only in how to respond creatively to new technologies but in retaining the human-centred focus of development in an environment where rapid technological change has the possibility of fracturing or supporting human centred and community development. This paper proposes a return to education aimed at producing holistic engineers who integrate social aspirations and technological innovation into their work, as in the nineteenth century, to safeguard human development in the digital era of the twenty-first.",Loy J.; Canning S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Building Community: Design Education for a Sustainable Future, E and PDE 2017",2017-01-01,Griffith University;University of Technology Sydney,Disruptive technology ;  Human-centred ;  Innovation
Design and innovation with problem based learning methods: An engineering perspective,"Of the many diverse and fascinating challenges we face today, the most intense and important is how to understand and shape the new technology revolution. One would assume that the educational systems in particular for undergraduate engineering students would follow the same trend and that educating engineers should be affected by this paradigm change. Recently, there has been a political wind that is blowing in the direction of problem based and in particular, research based learning methods. Problem based learning and problem based project are teaching methods in which the students initially are presented with a problem to be solved, prior to any form of lectures. The learning shall take place as the students try to solve the problem. They will have to find the information they need, structure the information and evaluate if it is sufficient to solve the problem. The tasks given to a graduated engineer will often be problem solving or to create new products or services. There are challenges to integrate these learning methods with other criteria that involves innovation and creativity. In our department, we have experience with problem based learning in single courses and we will share our learning points. In this paper, we are presenting a combinational problem based learning as it is comprehended from an engineer perspective, and specifically sketch how we could activate different cognitive levels in a learning model that uses problem based learning.",Mirtaheri P.; Sponheim N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Building Community: Design Education for a Sustainable Future, E and PDE 2017",2017-01-01,OsloMet – StorbyUniversitetet,Engineering education ;  Problem based learning ;  Project based learning
The representation of landscape: Some considerations on its origins,"Our era is decidedly that of the landscape, at least regarding its verbal and iconic reproduction. One definition, supported by the fields of geography, aesthetics, and law, describes it as a complex of natural and manmade elements that interact within a territory, considered not only from the aspects of function and quantity but also of morphology and quality. In particular, this article investigates the relationship between landscape and graphic language, in particular looking back at the actual situation in which the metric-representative problems manifested themselves that created a tangible crisis in primitive graphic language. It was this crisis that forced our ancestors to begin a cognitive process, which made it possible to formulate the first graphic transposition of visual elements made according to a logical procedure. For this discussion, the information is taken from work shared by the international scholarly community and the choice is guided by the archaeological finds housed in the museums of past civilizations. Particular attention is focused on the 'primordial' works that are considered representations of the territory, urban fabrics, or rural activities. For us, these finds are of fundamental interest as they mark the evolu-Tion of the representation of landscape. Indeed, they render comprehensible the break that sanctions the transition from the 'primitive' graphic system, which we consider spontaneous and personal, to the 'ancient' one, that of the first deductive thought, which if not collective is certainly to be considered corporative. The substantial numbers of archaeological finds, but above all the power of expression of some examples have convinced us that the innovation made to the graphic system by these drawings is of great intellectual weight. In fact, they have become the basis of the research, which today leads to the creation of increasingly more detailed representations, to the depiction of earth's finished image.",Barlozzini P.,Journal,International Journal of Design and Nature and Ecodynamics,2017-01-01,Università degli Studi del Molise,Landscape ;  Representation ;  Survay ;  Sustainability
Research of knowledge mapping construction method based on scientific research results,"Based on the fact that domestic and overseas knowledge mapping researches commonly used literature data as sample, this paper puts forward a new approach of knowledge mapping construction to supplement the traditional way. This construction approach uses scientific research results such as research projects, teams and awards which may reflect technological development as sample data, and add data cleaning, knowledge cell selecting and information mining methods to manage the research results data in disorder and without unified collection. In this paper, the computer science discipline is chosen as an example to illustrate feasibility, efficacy and innovation of this approach. The empirical result shows that the knowledge mapping constructed by using this approach gives a more comprehensive analysis of discipline development. This knowledge mapping construction approach provides a new idea of analyzing, supervising and evaluating discipline development from the perspective of multi-dimensional data analysis, also reveals more discipline development situation than the approach based on traditional literature data.",Zhang Y.; Lin G.; Li J.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of Science,2017-01-01,Beihang University,
Modularity in new market formation: Lessons for technology and economic policy and competence-based strategic management,"In this paper we appraise the ways in which use of closed-system proprietary product architectures versus open-system modular product architectures is likely to influence the dynamics and trajectory of new product market formation. We compare the evolutions of new markets in China for gas-powered two-wheeled vehicles (G2WVs) based (initially) on closed-system proprietary architectures and for electric-powered two-wheeled vehicles (E2 WVs) based on open-system modular architectures. We draw on this comparison to suggest ways in which the use of the two different kinds of architectures as the basis for new kinds of products may result in very different patterns and speeds of new market formation. We then suggest some key implications of the different dynamics of market formation associated with open-system modular architectures for both the competence-based strategic management (CBSM) of firms and for technology and economic development policies of governments. Specifically, we suggest how the use of open-system modular product architectures as the basis for new products is likely to result in dynamics of new market formation that call for new approaches to the strategic management of innovation and product creation. We also suggest technology and economic development policies favoring use of open-system modular architectures may stimulate new market formation and related economic development by providing platforms for accelerating technology development and dissemination, facilitating the formation of an industrial base of assemblers and component suppliers, assisting new firms in building customer relationships, enabling more geographically diffused economic development within countries, and facilitating development of export markets. We also suggest directions for further research into the potential for open-system modular product architectures to enable bottom-ofthepyramid innovation processes, frugal engineering in developing economies, and development of low-cost product variations more generally.",Sanchez R.; Hang C.,Book Series,Research in Competence-Based Management,2017-01-01,Copenhagen Business School;National University of Singapore,Economic development policy ;  Industry standards ;  Modularity ;  Technology development

High-Impact Practices in Materials Science Education: Student Research Internships Leading to Pedagogical Innovation in STEM Laboratory Learning Activities,"Traditional lecture-centered approaches alone are inadequate for preparing students for the challenges of creative problem solving in the STEM disciplines. As an alternative, learnercentered and other high-impact pedagogies are gaining prominence. The Wabash College 3D Printing and Fabrication Center (3D-PFC) supports several initiatives on campus, but one of the most successful is a computer-aided design (CAD) and fabrication-based undergraduate research internship program. The first cohort of four students participated in an eight-week program during the summer of 2015. A second group of the four students was successfully recruited to participate the following summer. This intensive materials science research experience challenged students to employ digital design and fabrication in the design, testing, and construction of inexpensive scientific instrumentation for use in introductory STEM courses at Wabash College. The student research interns ultimately produced a variety of successful new designs that could be produced for less than $25 per device and successfully detect analytes of interest down to concentrations in the parts per million (ppm) range. These student-produced instruments have enabled innovations in the way introductory instrumental analysis is taught on campus. Beyond summer work, the 3D-PFC staffed student interns during the academic year, where they collaborated on various cross-disciplinary projects with students and faculty from departments such as mathematics, physics, biology, rhetoric, history, classics, and English. Thus far, the student work has led to three campus presentations, four presentations at national professional conferences, and three peer-reviewed publications. The following report highlights initial progress as well as preliminary assessment findings.",Porter L.,Conference Proceeding,MRS Advances,2017-01-01,Wabash College,education ;  extrusion ;  polymer

"Flexible, user- and product-centered framework for developing Frugal products based on a case study of a vehicle for Sub-Saharan Africa","Through design thinking, a team of researchers and students from Nigeria, Ghana and Germany has identified rural transportation as a key enabler for addressing the most pressing challenges in the developing world. Since 2013, the team has been working together on designing a new vehicle concept for Sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of the project is to provide the rural population in Sub-Saharan Africa with an attractive mobility concept that helps to prevent the rural exodus and strengthens the independence of the rural regions. A promising concept must consider the specific market requirements and the resources available locally in order to address the heart of the problem as a ""First Mile Vehicle"". This paper aims to introduce a holistic framework for frugal innovation and to analyze the process of deriving the vehicle concept meeting regional requirements until it is ready for serial production. The focus, therefore, is demand-driven development of a multifunctional electric vehicle that primarily provides mobility for the individual and transport of people and goods as a possible commercial basis. The result of the research and design process is a vehicle concept that meets the needs of the people living in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The first fully functional prototype of this vehicle was presented to the public at the Technical University of Munich in May 2016.",Šoltés M.; Kappler D.; Koberstaedt S.; Lienkamp M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2017-01-01,Technische Universität München,

Overview of current hybrid propulsion research and development,"As dwindling federal funding continues to constrict the national space program, private entities have carried the torch of innovation in the aerospace industry. While the concept of hybrid rocket engines, systems where solid fuels and fluid oxidizers are used for combustion, was conceived during the mid-20th century, the aerospace industry only recently has substantially increased research and development of these engines. According to the literature, hybrids are safer and cheaper than their liquid counterparts due to the utilization of solid fuel and generally provide greater values of specific impulse, density specific impulse, and fuel energy density than traditional solid-fuel engines. This paper provides an overview of the design principles used to develop hybrid engines and discusses limitations currently faced by industry. Furthermore, development of hybrid engines to allow for both scalability and reusability are explored as private aerospace companies continue to demonstrate that reusable rockets are the future of rocket technology. With applications catering from low-payload cargo delivery to the increasing interest in space tourism and exploration, hybrid engines can provide a safer, less expensive solution than traditional and well-established engine selections. Suggestions for future design opportunities and methods are proposed and discussed to make the concept of hybrid engines a viable innovation in the future of rocketry.",Nguyen B.; Faruqui K.; Robles L.; Ho J.; Wagner G.; Surmi J.; Carter A.; Hinz T.; Kakish F.; Zousel Z.; Matthys K.; Piacenza J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2017-01-01,"California State University, Fullerton",

"Material testing, design & construction of a laboratory-scale FRP composite footbridge","Pedestrian loading on flexible structures such as footbridges, grandstands and lightweight floors is an area, which is receiving significant attention from the research community of late. One of the key parameters in determining the structural response is the frequency of the bridge. Separately, fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) (typically referred to as advanced composites) represent the greatest innovation in structural materials in the recent past. These materials offer advantages over traditional materials such as steel, concrete and timber, which include improved durability performance, flexibility of design, improved quality assurance in production, potential for use of recycled materials, etc. However, perhaps the most significant advantage for civil engineering structures is the increased strength to weight ratios offered in comparison to more traditional materials. These materials are growing in popularity in innovative structures and are gaining increasing acceptance among designers internationally. One of the major barriers to greater use is the lack of design guidance on the use of these materials in load-bearing structures. The authors are currently researching pedestrian-induced loading on flexible structures and also the use of advanced composite materials (ACMs) in construction. This paper describes the amalgamation of these two discrete research interests by detailing the material testing, design and construction of a unique, laboratory-scale FRP composite footbridge.",Mullarney B.; Archbold P.,Conference Proceeding,"Advanced Composites in Construction, ACIC 2017 - Proceedings of the 8th Biennial Conference on Advanced Composites in Construction",2017-01-01,Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (TUS),
Scientific association knowledge improvement activities in Construction Technology Management field,"The scientific association is an organization of students working in a higher education institution, whose purpose is the scientific and self-education of its members. Scientific circles can function as informal groups and as registered structures. The official condition of the existence of a circle at many universities is its enrollment in the special register of student organizations. Some circles gain a lot of independence by registering in court-but then they should be treated as non-governmental organizations. At the Poznan University of Technology there are currently 87 officially registered scientific circles, of which 7 are in the Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering. One of the circles that focuses on innovative technologies in building management is the Construction Innovations academic association. The paper presents a brief description and main interests of the ConInno scientific group, including the most important from the perspective of construction technology and the management of undertaken activities aimed at broadening the knowledge of students enrolled in the circle. In addition, the article explores interest in participating in the research circle by analyzing historical data on the number of people enrolled in the scientific field, including students of the third degree studies, to draw conclusions about future interest in participating in the mentioned student organization. Association activity has a very positive impact on raising the awareness and knowledge of members of the organization in the field of construction technology and management not only related to Polish local technological and technical solutions, but also to the world because of the number of foreigners who are in the circle.

Peculiar cases of pinion vibration in paralell shaft double helical gear units-identification and mitigation,"Speed increasing parallel shaft double helical gear units are commonly used in centrifugal compressors and high energy pump applications. Such turbo-gears are API 613 compliant (Titled as-Special Purpose Gear Units for Petroleum, Chemical, and Gas Industry Services) and have horizontal offset transmission line, with journal bearings on the high speed shaft and low speed shaft. When a full load full speed complete unit test is carried out, pinion dynamic behavior is found to be different than what observed during full speed no load condition as mandated in API 613 . During this test, gear box high speed pinion may show up with high vibration or combination of both during certain load and speed combination in spite of proper balancing and alignment. Since full load full speed test is kept as an option in API 613 , hence these type of vibration may not be detected during a no load test in gear box manufacturer's premises. These types of vibration patterns are not explicitly addressed in API 613 . The first objective of this paper is to cover analytical, design and diagnostic aspects which can be helpful to mitigate above issues before it is towed out from manufacturer's premises. The second objective of the paper is to suggest installation/innovation/design modification on high speed pinion as a pre-emptive approach which can save time to mitigate if encountered during any certain speed-load combination.",Bhattacharya M.,Conference Proceeding,MFPT 2017 Annual Conference: 50 Years of Failure Prevention Technology Innovation,2017-01-01,"Petrofac Limited, United Arab Emirates",FEM ;  Nodes ;  Relief ;  Sub-synchronous ;  Super-Synchronous ;  Tuning
Perceptions of academics on the difficulties for the promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship: The case of the FCFM of the University of Chile,"The aim of this research is to describe and analyze the teachers’ perception of the difficulties to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in a traditional higher education institution such as the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of the University of Chile. The qualitative study seeks to provide information on this topic in order to improve decision making by the institutions involved. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with faculty teachers. The results indicate that while the term innovation does not generate resistance among teachers, the term entrepreneurship does not produce the same consensus, mainly because for some of the academics, it relates to skills that do not fit with Universidad de Chile standards, given its seal of prestige and quality. This also implies that the exigence and academic load for students is very high, which disincentives the development of extracurricular innovation and entrepreneurship projects. Additionally, the interviewees recognize a highly academic character of the institution, with focus on the development of non-applied, highly specific and detached from issues of the milieu research, which responds mainly to the structure of incentives that defines the academic job. This academic culture permeates to students, who find little instances of connection with reality, teamwork and relation with other disciplines within their formation.",Zisis N.; Moya P.; Molina F.,Journal,Journal of Technology Management and Innovation,2017-01-01,Universidad de Chile,Engineering ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Teachers’ perceptions

Recent developments on intramedullary nailing: A biomechanical perspective,"Combining contributions from engineering and medicine, we highlight the biomechanical turning points in the historical evolution of the intramedullary nailing stabilization technique and discuss the recent innovations concerning increase in bone–implant system stability. Following the earliest attempts, where stabilization of long bone fractures was purely based on intuition, intramedullary nailing evolved from allowing alignment and translational control through press-fit fixation to current clinical widespread acceptance marked by the mechanical linkage between nail and bone with interlocking screws that allow alignment, translation, rotation, and length control. In an attempt to achieve an optimum interfragmentary mechanical environment, recent improvements considered the impact of different biomaterials on bone–implant stiffness. Another strategy considered the increase in the structural stability through the reduction of the number of movements between the different components that constitute the bone–implant system. Intramedullary nail improvements will most likely benefit from merging mechanics and fracture-healing biology by combining surface engineering with sensor tools associated with the innovative progress in wireless technology and with bone-healing biological active agents. Future research should aim at better understanding the ideal mechanobiological environment for each stage of fracture healing in order to allow for intramedullary nail design that satisfies such requirements.",Rosa N.; Marta M.; Vaz M.; Tavares S.; Simoes R.; Magalhães F.; Marques A.,Book Series,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2017-01-01,Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João;Instituto Politécnico do Cávado e do Ave;Universidade do Minho;Instituto de Ciência e Inovação em Engenharia Mecânica e Engenharia Industrial;Universidade do Porto,Biomechanics ;  Bone fracture ;  Intramedullary nail ;  Stability

This need is complicated by the “productivity dilemma”; that a focus on efficiency inhibits innovative activity. Operations management literature suggests that resolution of this dilemma is achieved through “organizational ambidex-terity,” balancing improvement (exploitation) and innovation (exploration). Building upon current theory, this article uses case study research to illustrate how improvement and innovation capabilities evolved, and how ambidexterity was achieved in an auto parts manufacturing organization, as it implemented novel assembly processes over a 4-year period. Results show how capabilities improve by altering underlying routines as a result of experiential learning, and that ambidexterity is achieved as a temporal sequencing among different levels within the organi-zation. Developing innovation capability in a mass production organization requires organizational alignment between the Management, Engineering, and Production groups, as each has a specific role in the process.",Dolsen M.; Chinnam R.,Journal,Journal of Enterprise Transformation,2017-01-01,College of Engineering;Inc,case study research ;  innovation capability ;  mass production ;  organizational ambidexterity ;  productivity dilemma

"Relationships between Venture Capital and listed firms' technology innovation: In the view of patent, growth stage, and industries","Patents signal a startup's technological and innovative capability. Venture Capital (VC) investors can evaluate the true potential and behaviour of startups through their patents. While, there are many factors might have effect on the amount of VC financing. Some scholars have researched this question in other countries, but the detailed interaction between VC and patent activities in China is different and attractive. This paper tries to explore this relationship in the view of patent, growth stage, and industries by hypothetical test. We first propose four hypotheses about influence factors to VC. Then we use multi-source to get patent and VC data of listed companies. By descriptive statistics, univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, we try to verify our hypotheses.

Philosophy of modern bioengineering,"This article investigates the philosophical foundations of modern bioengineering to articulate its rational framework. Engineering, as an ultimate mechanism to transform knowledge into practice, is essential for both physical and biological sciences. It reduces data, concepts, and designs to pictorial forms. Integration of engineering with newly emerging biosciences, has presented a unique opportunity to overcome major challenges to environmental ecology and human health. To harness the potential of modern bioengineering and establish a sustainable foundation for green technology, scientists and engineers should be acquainted with the normative questions of science and technology. Besides acquiring the general principles of scientific research and identification of the intrinsic goals of the endeavor, philosophy of bioengineering exposes scientists to both the descriptive ""how? questions of the physical world as well as the normative ""why? questions of values. Such an interdisciplinary approach is essential, not only for inspiration to acquire the genuine knowledge, but also to expose the scientists and bioengineers to their ethical and social responsibilities. Introducing the conceptual framework of bioengineering, this paper has investigated the three major philosophies that have been dominating the basic presuppositions of the scientific research method in the modern history of science, namely: (i) the mechanical approach of physical sciences, (ii) the functional (goal-guided) approach of biological processes, and (iii) the integrated approach. The paper also has conducted an analytical study on various branches of the emerging discipline of bioscience. It has concluded that adopting the interdisciplinary approach is essential to harness potentials of bioengineering and to establish foundations of green technology based on moral values. To materialize such a noble goal, both epistemological and normative knowledge must be acquired in bioengineering research and education. The former is essential for invention and innovation; while the latter exposes bioengineers to their ethical and moral commitments.",Shogar I.; Rahman S.,Journal,IIUM Engineering Journal,2017-01-01,International Islamic University Malaysia,Bioengineering ;  Causal explanation ;  Ethics ;  Goal-directed process ;  Integrated approach ;  Philosophy ;  Systems biology
Using agile approaches for breakthrough product innovation,"Purpose According to the authors research, Agile approaches are increasingly being deployed successfully alongside phase-gate processes in engineering and R&D functions outside software, with a very positive result. Design/methodology/approach An Agile approach to product development has been a mainstay of the software industry since the turn of the century. In recent years, some non-software product-based companies have successfully combined both Agile and non-Agile methods in a complementary way to pursue breakthrough innovation. The article reports on how to make this combination work. Findings The study found companies adopting two general approaches when trying to introduce Agile into an existing phase-gate process: integrating Agile into a single innovation process or adding a partly parallel Agile path. Practical implications As a measure of Agile’s potential, the software industry has consistently produced patents at three times the level of the next-most prolific sectors. Originality/value Arthur D. Little’s research reveals that companies that have successfully added Agile methods to their toolboxes and tailor their innovation approaches by the type of innovation – incremental or breakthrough–perform significantly better than those that stick to single phase-gate approach.",Beaumont M.; Thuriaux-Alemán B.; Prasad P.; Hatton C.,Journal,Strategy and Leadership,2017-01-01,San Francisco Division;Amsterdam Office;London Office,Agile innovation ;  Agile team processes ;  Breakthrough innovation ;  Combining Agile with phase-gate ;  Innovation governance ;  Phase-gate process
Is the smart safety vest a brutal innovation? Evaluation of microclimate performance using a thermal manikin,"Heat stress is a growing concern in the global construction industry due to its lifethreatening consequences. The Smart Safety Vest is a proposed 'internet of things' solution to the heat stress problem in construction. This innovative e-textile monitors the physiological parameters of construction workers in real time, communicates the data to the cloud, then visualises the data on the wearer's smart-phone, and in a web-based management system. Alerts warn of anomalies. The feasibility of this system has been validated through iterative design and by rigorous laboratory tests. This paper reports the experimental procedure used to investigate microclimate variations prior to field testing, which involved a sweating manikin placed in a thermal chamber. Various microclimate scenarios were tested on different layers of protective clothing, and during different activity levels with carefully chosen sweat rates and walking speeds to represent working conditions in construction. These tests showed variations in microclimates under different working and clothing conditions. This research provides initial evidence about microclimate variations, offering useful insights for regulators. The Smart Safety Vest has the potential to improve H&S in construction by addressing a key health risk. The research also significantly contributes to the application of innovations in a poorperforming sector.",Edirisinghe R.; Jadhav A.,Conference Proceeding,"Association of Researchers in Construction Management, ARCOM - 33rd Annual Conference 2017, Proceeding",2017-01-01,"RMIT University, School of Property, Construction and Project Management;RMIT University",Heat stress ;  Internet of things ;  Microclimate ;  Thermal manikin ;  Thermal stress
The compliance of project management with corporate's research and development strategies: DTI's virtual shooting range case study,"This original article was aimed to share with military simulation and training community how the project management of a military simulation and training project named 'Virtual Shooting Range' or VSR was carried out in line with corporate's research and development strategies. The B.E. 2551 Royal Decree of the Establishment of Defense Technology Institute (Public Organization) or DTI was quoted to reflect the strategies that follow the objectives, roles and responsibilities defined in the Royal Decree. The strategies were elaborated each in turn to give an idea that research and development projects of DTI have to include activities in order to align with the strategies. The activities of the VSR project were discussed in terms of compliance with the explained strategies. It further contributes to the project management community by introducing a Double Pyramid approach for non-profit organizations where knowledge and innovations are highly expected from the public. One of the achievements of the project was measured by research grant conferred to DTI by the National Research Council of Thailand in order for DTI to extend products of the defense technology research to a commercialized stage. Byproducts of the project apart from deliverable systems were adopted as a key performance indicator to demonstrate how this defense research and development project was managed to build knowledge and innovation, develop collaborative and cooperative network, and develop a sustainable organization in line with the strategies. The paper illustrates the activities carried out with partners and sectors outside DTI that were central to the philosophy of DTI's existence. It concludes that the VSR's research and development activities were defined, designed, developed and delivered to comply with DTI's research and development strategies that helped to partially improve the national competitiveness in building the potential and capabilities of hardware and software industry.",Kumsap C.,Conference Proceeding,"7th International Defense and Homeland Security Simulation Workshop, DHSS 2017, Held at the International Multidisciplinary Modeling and Simulation Multiconference, I3M 2017",2017-01-01,Defence Technology Institute (Public Organization),Corporate strategy ;  Defense research and development ;  Project management ;  Virtual shooting range
"""Smart"" motorway innovation for achieving greater safety and hard shoulder management","""Smart"" motorways are becoming more prevalent through technology-driven approaches such as active traffic management (ATM) systems, hard shoulder management (HSM) control systems and digital enforcement cameras. Such technologies are able to monitor and respond to fluctuating traffic conditions by altering the speed limit to smooth traffic flow, activate warning signs to alert users of hazards up ahead and permit the use of the hard shoulder, either permanently or at peak times. This paper investigates smart motorways as a way of reducing congestion achieving greater road safety and improving hard shoulder management. This research is one of the first which deals specifically with the topic of smart motorways, where much of the focus to date has been on smart cities alone. A questionnaire approach was undertaken with 124 members of the public relating to their knowledge of smart motorways. The results indicate that user knowledge of smart motorways was lacking in some areas and that there is an inclination to wilfully ignore some of the ""smart"" rules of the road which contrary to the intention of smart motorways, may increase the safety risk and CO2 emissions.",Callaghan N.; Avery T.; Mulville M.,Conference Proceeding,"Association of Researchers in Construction Management, ARCOM - 33rd Annual Conference 2017, Proceeding",2017-01-01,University of Greenwich;Technological University Dublin;Glasgow Caledonian University,Innovation ;  Management ;  Smart motorways ;  Sustainable infrastructure
Research on the construction of knowledge base oriented to aerospace knowledge management,"Knowledge base can store, organize and process knowledge and also is the foundation to provide knowledge services. The construction and applications of knowledge base are essential for the knowledge-intensive enterprises to carry out knowledge management (KM), which can greatly boost the accumulation of knowledge assets and improve the innovation ability of researchers. Due to the difference in knowledge structure and actual demand, each enterprise has its own focus on the design of knowledge base. In consideration of the particularity of aerospace enterprises, this paper puts forward the thoughts of constructing knowledge base for aerospace enterprises from three levels: knowledge acquisition, knowledge processing and knowledge application. In order to achieve the effective acquisition and organization of the firsthand resources, different solutions are adopted to deal with the internal and external resources respectively. On the one hand, for the resources within enterprise, unified templates are used to extract the internal knowledge, which can promote the mutual conversion between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. On the other hand, to realize effective and accurate information collection, external resources are collected based on theme crawler. We further put forward the knowledge processing architecture, including text processing system and data processing system, to extract useful knowledge from the first-hand resources. The knowledge processing architecture is studied in this paper based on big data technologies, such as text similarity measure algorithm, word segmentation technology, feature engineering and machine learning, etc. Finally, this paper discusses the possible applications of knowledge base in the field of aerospace through the association mapping of text knowledge and data knowledge. This research may also provide a reference for other military enterprises to carry out the construction of knowledge base.",Jiang Y.; Wang L.; Wang Y.; Guo D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2017-01-01,China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology,Aerospace enterprises ;  Big data ;  Knowledge base ;  Knowledge extraction
Risky business: The driving factors of creative risk taking attitudes in engineering design industry,"Designing breakthrough products comes at a great cost to the design industry due to the risk and uncertainties associated with creative ideas. However, without creative ideas, there is no potential for innovation. As such, companies need to appropriately embrace the risk associated with creative concepts in the fuzzy front end of the design process in order to build their value. While previous research has linked risk taking attitudes to creative idea generation and selection in engineering design education, there has been limited research focused on engineering design professionals' creative risk taking attitude and the corresponding driving factors. This is problematic because without this knowledge we do not know what factors inhibit or promote the flow of creative ideas in engineering design industry. In order to address this gap, a preliminary online survey was conducted with 46 design professionals from a global manufacturing company to understand the potential driving factors of creative risk taking, including educational training, job type (R&D, applied engineering, or management), and years of experience. The results suggest that there is a relationship between employee education level and years of experience and an engineering employee's willingness to take risks on creative ideas in the fuzzy front end of the design process. Interestingly, the results also show that those individuals primarily responsible for the development (R&D) and selection (management) of creative ideas tend to be more financially risk averse than individuals in traditional engineering positions. These results contribute to the prediction of professionals' design behaviors and have implications for the management of creative ideas in the early conceptual design stages of engineering design industry.",Zheng X.; Miller S.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2017-01-01,Penn State College of Engineering;Pennsylvania State University,Ambiguity aversion ;  Creativity ;  Engineering design ;  Engineering design industry ;  Financial risk aversion ;  Preferences for creativity scale (PCS)
"Applications of biocomposites in automotive, sports, structural and other industries","The sky rocketing price of petroleum along with its dwindling nature and coupled with climate change concern and continued population growth have drawn the urgency for the plastic industries in adapting towards sustainability. Human consumption has benefited tremendously from the use of plastics due to their extraordinary versatility and manufacturability. But, these breakthroughs come at a price of depleting fossil fuel and adverse effects on the environment. To minimize these undesirable consequences, scientists have been finding new sources (plastic) that are renewable, sustainable and biodegradable. This has led to the development of biocomposites. The rapid attention in research and development in the biocomposite field has been due to its better formability, abundant, renewable, cost-effective and eco-friendly features. Biocomposites and bioplastics are used in a wide variety of products, from advanced packaging to automotive sector to joint implants. In this chapter the application of biocomposites in automotive, packaging, sport, structural, and other industries will be discussed. Building and construction materials utilize about 23% of the world’s total plastic usage. With the advent of innovations in the field of medicine, new materials are being explored for usage into the broad spectrum of bio-medical applications such as implants, tissue engineering, drug delivery etc. Unlike before, when petrochemicals were available in plenty at a cheaper price, typical modern vehicles are made up of about 15,000 parts, of which approximately 600 are made of biopolymeric materials. Main classes of automotive applications for biopolymers are interior trims (47-50%), external parts (29-35%), structural parts and fuel systems (13%), and under-the-hood applications (12-15%). The major driving forces for growing demand of biocomposites in automotive applications include the need of car weight reduction for limiting the fuel consumption and easier assembling/dismantling and integration of parts and systems. In addition, among the total plastics usage, packaging occupies the top position with 41%, of which about 20% is used in food industry. Most of the packaging materials are made up of non-renewable and non-degradable synthetic plastics; packaging waste also occupies the top position in landfills. There have been many health related issues for using synthetic polymers for packaging, especially in food division. This has mandated the use of biobased and biodegradable or compostable materials in the packaging sector. Also, aquatic sport goods such as biocomposite material kayaks, gigs, sailing boards and surfboards, the ball game equipment such as tennis racket, badminton rackets, softball bats, and backboards of basketball stands, the winter sport equipment such as biocomposite material snow boards, ski-poles, sledges and ice-hockey sticks, the poles used in high jump goods, and the bows and arrows used in archery sport are now all made from biocomposite materials and it has been proven that many sport goods made from biocomposite materials show improved properties in usage, and help athletes create good performances.

Optimized generator designs for the DTU 10-MW offshore wind turbine using generatorSE,"Compared to land-based applications, offshore wind imposes challenges for the development of next generation wind turbine generator technology. Direct-drive generators are believed to offer high availability, efficiency, and reduced operation and maintenance requirements; however, previous research suggests difficulties in scaling to several megawatts or more in size. The resulting designs are excessively large and/or massive, which are major impediments to transportation logistics, especially for offshore applications. At the same time, geared wind turbines continue to sustain offshore market growth through relatively cheaper and lightweight generators. However, reliability issues associated with mechanical components in a geared system create significant operation and maintenance costs, and these costs make up a large portion of overall system costs offshore. Thus, direct-drive turbines are likely to outnumber their gear-driven counterparts for this market, and there is a need to review the costs or opportunities of building machines with different types of generators and examining their competitiveness at the sizes necessary for the next generation of offshore wind turbines. In this paper, we use GeneratorSE, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s newly developed systems engineering generator sizing tool to estimate mass, efficiency, and the costs of different generator technologies satisfying the electromagnetic, structural, and basic thermal design requirements for application in a very large-scale offshore wind turbine such as the Technical University of Denmark’s (DTU) 10-MW reference wind turbine. For the DTU reference wind turbine, we use the previously mentioned criteria to optimize a direct-drive, radial flux, permanent-magnet synchronous generator; a direct-drive electrically excited synchronous generator; a medium-speed permanent-magnet generator; and a high-speed, doubly-fed induction generator. Preliminary analysis of leveled costs of energy indicate that for large turbines, the cost of permanent magnets and reliability issues associated with brushes in electrically excited machines are the biggest deterrents for building direct-drive systems. The advantage of medium-speed permanent-magnet machines over doubly-fed induction generators is evident, yet, variability in magnet prices and solutions to address reliability issues associated with gearing and brushes can change this outlook. This suggests the need to potentially pursue fundamentally new innovations in generator designs that help avoid high capital costs but still have significant reliability related to performance.",Sethuraman L.; Maness M.; Dykes K.,Conference Proceeding,"35th Wind Energy Symposium, 2017",2017-01-01,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,

Collaborative innovation capability in IT-enabled inter-firm collaboration,"Purpose – With the increasingly collaborative nature of innovation and the expanding role of digital platforms on inter-firm collaboration, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impacts of digital platforms on collaborative innovation capability (CIC) under conditions of two distinctive governance mechanisms. Furthermore, the competitive benefits of CIC at different levels of environmental uncertainty are examined to clarify the performance of collaborative innovation. Design/methodology/approach – The research model is proposed based on dynamic capabilities theory, information technology (IT)-enabled organizational capability and governance mechanisms literature, and then validated by using partial least squares with data collected from 200 Chinese firms that engage in digital collaboration with their major channel distributors. Findings – Empirical results show that the enabling effect of digital platforms capability on CIC is positively moderated by relational governance while negatively moderated by formal governance, and both governance mechanisms directly and positively influence CIC; the positive relationship between CIC and competitive performance is stronger for higher level of environmental uncertainty; and CIC is the key mediator converting digital platforms capability into competitive performance. Originality/value – This study enriches the existing literatures in IT-innovation relationship by not only surfacing the interplay of digital platforms capability with two distinctive governance mechanisms in building CIC, but also clarifying the competitive benefits of CIC in an uncertain environment. Moreover, this study helps explain the controversial issue of the business value of IT capability by discovering the mediating role of CIC.",Wang F.; Zhao J.; Chi M.; Li Y.,Journal,Industrial Management and Data Systems,2017-01-01,Central China Normal University;China University of Geosciences,Collaborative innovation capability ;  Digital platforms ;  Environmental uncertainty ;  Governance mechanisms ;  Innovation ;  IT ;  IT-enabled inter-firm collaboration

Innovation in Continuing Engineering Education with focus on gender and non-traditional students' pathways,"The challenges of the 21st century call for supporting Continuing Engineering Education, a topic that is of increasing importance to universities worldwide. Furthermore, attracting new talents (women among others) into Engineering Education, is a key-element in contemporary higher education. Although the offer of studying programs alongside work has grown in recent years, there is still a need for research in context of accompanied studies and a lack of theory-based development in didactic concepts for learning professionals. This paper contributes to this research discourse and aims to generate new insights in a threefold way: (1) by specifying challenges and innovative approaches for accompanied studying programs in Business Engineering; (2) by explaining the theoretical framework for the methodical arrangement of exemplary engineering courses for non-traditional students; and (3) by describing first experiences with the concept during the development and implementation in selected engineering course. This paper also provides a new perspective on how to meet gender aspects.

Modeling the dynamics of innovation in engineered systems,"Innovation in engineering design remains a topic that lacks a formal and consistent framework. It is difficult developing a consistent definition of innovation since it is a phenomenon that is multidisciplinary in nature and present in every facet of our lives from engineering products to the performing and culinary arts. It is thus important to distinguish the general definition of innovation with its applicability in the engineering domain. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of innovation is oftentimes lost when designers try to model innovation in a complex system. The reality is that the perceived engineering innovation in a complex system can be influenced at various levels. It is thus important to provide a tool for designers that provides a clear understanding of the effects of technological progress on the overall performance capability of a complex system. This paper provides a framework to model engineering innovation in engineered systems by introducing an N-Dimensional Growth Model and applying it in the early stages of a design process in order to assist the designer in the selection of technologically innovative concepts.",Naim A.; Lewis K.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2017-01-01,School of Engineering and Applied Sciences,

The circular economy: In practice-focused undergraduate engineering education,"The growth of the planet's population makes the traditional industrial model of ""take, make and waste"" unsustainable. The circular economy, in which resources are continuously reused, offers a solution. For manufacturers of durable goods the circular economy requires a well-functioning circular supply chain that includes reverse logistics, product recovery operations, development of markets for recovered products, and integration of reuse and product recovery into the firm's daily operations. How to educate undergraduate practice-focused engineers in the design, implementation, and operation circular supply chains is un-explored and the purpose of the paper is to identify a suitable teaching method. Because courses in circular supply chain topics are currently non-existent, the paper first develops a set of learning goals based on the skillset necessary to design, implement, and operate a circular supply chain. Second, the paper examines whether the teaching method of a similar cross-disciplinary course in innovation can be successfully applied. This teaching method is based on crossdisciplinary team projects that work with innovation in cooperation with a participating firm. The study concludes that the teaching method can be (largely) applied. However, future research should test the paper's results with studies using data from circular supply chain courses.",Knudby T.; Larsen S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 45th SEFI Annual Conference 2017 - Education Excellence for Sustainability, SEFI 2017",2017-01-01,Technical University of Denmark,Circular economy ;  Circular supply chains ;  Engineering education ;  Undergraduate education
Fueling industry 4.0: A professional doctorate in technology,"Competitiveness, quality and sustainability critically determine the viability of enterprises on both sides of the Atlantic and around the world. Today's technologically advanced age requires systematic research and development - not the abstract theory-focused research so typical of university, basic and PhD research - but rather the use-inspired, agile and practically-focused research called for in Pasteur's Quadrant [1] and more recently the Swiss National Science Foundation [2]. The paper presents a model for a professional doctorate program that develops leaders with such skills at the very highest end of this capability spectrum. Such individuals are in demand, particularly by high-tech industries operating at new intersections of technologies.

Development of project-based learning (PBL) for Internet of Things,"An increasing number of physical objects are being connected to the Internet realizing the idea of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). A basic example is the idea of smart homes. There are also other domains in which the IoT can play an important role and improve the quality of our lives. These applications include transportation, healthcare, industrial automation, and emergency response. Since project-based learning (PBL) provides contextualized and authentic learning, which has been demonstrated to foster higher order thinking while promoting acquisition of content-area knowledge, this project applies PBL for learning of IoT application development. A PBL curriculum was designed to emphasize a real-world problem (specifically, designing a smart watch for monitoring the state of pressure and the quality of the sleep) while enhancing learning motivation, learning emotion and performance, and fostering the creativity and problem-solving skills necessary for innovation and excellence in the learners' future professional careers as IoT application developers. The study will adopt a pretest and posttest quasi-experimental design. Over an 16-week intervention, the control group will receive traditional instructions while the experimental group will receive PBL instructions. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the learning outcomes of the two research groups. This study will explore how different teaching strategies affect students' creativity and problem-solving skills and, at the same time, acquiring engineering knowledge for developing IoT applications.",Raknim P.; Lan K.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 45th SEFI Annual Conference 2017 - Education Excellence for Sustainability, SEFI 2017",2017-01-01,,Creativity ;  Internet of things (IoT) ;  Problem-solving ;  Project-based learning
Improving innovation and multidisciplinary competences among bachelor of engineering students,"From society and industry, there are increasing requirements for skilled and welleducated engineers who can develop new solutions through innovation and this have pushed universities to meet these requirements by having an increasing focus on developing innovation and entrepreneurship programmes within Engineering Education. Furthermore, there is also a demand for the graduates to be able to work multidisciplinary and to be able to use generic skills in their work. In this paper, the research question is how to enhance innovation and multidisciplinary competences of engineering students? This is a central question in order to educate engineers that can create sustainable solutions for the environment, for products and to secure future workplaces. In this paper, a new mandatory course for Bachelor of Engineering students at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) ""Innovation Pilot"", will be described and how the challenge to improve innovative competences and the ability to work in multidisciplinary teams with engineers from other disciplines are solved. Results from a survey regarding the students' innovation competences and interdisciplinarity show that we have succeed in creation of understanding of what innovation is. However interdisciplinary is still difficult for the students to handle.",Løje H.; Andersson P.; Grex S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 45th SEFI Annual Conference 2017 - Education Excellence for Sustainability, SEFI 2017",2017-01-01,Technical University of Denmark,Entrepreneurial minds-set ;  Multidisciplinary teams ;  Preparing professionals
Tipping your toe in the 'Emerging Technologies' pond from an educational point of view,"This paper is about an explorative research into the use of emerging technologies in higher engineering education. New technologies are poised to better prepare students for the labour market and therefore help to endow vital innovative and creative skills. It is not yet fully clear what these skills are, but technological innovations are a good indicator of what to expect. Emerging technologies are technologies not yet widely adopted like there are 3D printing, Virtual Reality and Internet of Things. The diversity and the complexity of these technologies require a better understanding to decide about the value of such technologies for education. The research aims at the development of an approach that will help teachers to investigate, test, and assess the usability of such a technology in their micro-environment of teaching and learning. This explorative research comprises an examination of the current use and experiences in education and the industry, an indebt analysis of some of the technologies and some small-scale experiments concerning the use of such technologies in daily educational practice. The paper summarizes the research results so far. Notably education is challenged to acquire an active role in assessing the usability and maximizing the opportunities of these technologies.",Klaassen R.; De Vries P.; Ioannides M.; Papazis S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 45th SEFI Annual Conference 2017 - Education Excellence for Sustainability, SEFI 2017",2017-01-01,Delft University of Technology;National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),Education ;  Emerging technologies ;  Internet of Things ;  Virtual reality
Engineering course specially designed to face retention issue,"Many engineering colleges have been facing the retention problem in engineering programs due to difficulties and lack of knowledge about what really means being an engineer. It is mainly due to the fact that the first 3 years are particularly intense and hard. A possible way to overcome this period is to implement a new kind of course more attractive and dynamic, which is the idea of COPEC's engineering education research team, to embed a course with a more interesting activity for students in the first year. It is a short-term workshop in order to show the students the possibilities of performing as engineers in a global environment - a project developed for a private university in order to augment the retention rate in their engineering courses.",Brito C.; Ciampi M.; Vasconcelos R.; Amaral L.; Santos H.; Barros V.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 45th SEFI Annual Conference 2017 - Education Excellence for Sustainability, SEFI 2017",2017-01-01,Universidade do Minho;IEEE;Science and Education Research Council - COPEC,Engineering retention ;  Innovations ;  International skills ;  Project development ;  Real world work
Establishment of EEDI baseline for inland ship of Bangladesh,"Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) [1] was introduced by the International Maritime organization (IMO) to stimulate innovation and technical development of all elements that increase the level of energy efficiency of a ship at design stage. Sea going ships over 400 gross tonnage are considered in the current regulation of EEDI. Inland ships are not covered by current EEDI regulations by IMO. As inland vessels share 0.6% of the global CO2 emission [2], the reduction attempt will not have bigger impact. But from the commercial point of view of a country the significance is very high, specially for under developed countries like Bangladesh. Inland self propelled ships face additional restrictions (shallow water/channel, low density water, restriction of ship's dimension, etc.) which increase the power requirement at the same speed, burning more fuel and emit more CO2. This paper is a continuation of the Ph.D research of the author where previous published paper's [3] results were updated and verified. The result of this paper would be one of the 1st attempts in the world was made to establish EEDI baseline for different types of self-propelled inland ships.",Karim M.; Hasan S.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2017-01-01,Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology,CO  emission 2 ;  EEDI ;  Energy Efficiency ;  IMO ;  Inland ships ;  MEPC
Education readiness levels (ERLS): A scale for assessing educational coursework and training modules,"There is renewed interest in workforce development and manufacturing education/training thanks to the establishment of the Manufacturing USA Institutes, originally called the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMIs). As part of their efforts to bridge the gap between basic research and technology commercialization, these institutes are nurturing curriculum development and outreach activities related to their technological foci. As community colleges and universities scramble to respond to the increased demand for a highlyeducated workforce with specific advanced manufacturing skills, the institutes are struggling to assess the educational artefacts that are being developed as part of their research funding to educate and (re)train the workforce. In this paper, we introduce Education Readiness Levels (ERLs) to evaluate the ""readiness"" of educational artefacts-courses, programs, modules, lesson plans, and hands-on activities-based on seven critical elements: class size, cost, instructors, depth of content, facilities, target audience and course material. We define 10 readiness levels for each element (0-9), and codify each level by extending the corresponding scale on the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) or Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL). Using our ERLs, courses can be evaluated based on the scores for each element, identifying areas performing well and those that need improvement. The ERLs are represented graphically, allowing for easy comparison between courses and established targets. One can also measure progress using the ERLs, especially for courses and training modules of upcoming areas of manufacturing. To demonstrate the scale, we apply the ERLs to several funded projects from America Makes, the first Manufacturing USA Institute, whose focus is on 3D printing and additive manufacturing.",Dinda S.; Simpson T.; Gluck L.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2017-01-01,Pennsylvania State University;America Makes,
Our oceans and the blue economy: Opportunities and challenges,"The Blue Economy is envisaged as an integration of short & long term economic activities and development following principles of social inclusion, environmental sustainability and innovations considered and concentrated on and around the sea. The attitude of achieving long-term prosperity by a country or a region befitting the wellbeing of all citizens and the mankind preserving the environment, especially the sea is the basis of the Blue Economy. The concept of the Blue Economy, a systematic way of utilizing ocean resources, is quite new in South Asia and Bangladesh. This paper is an instigating one, not the findings of rigorous researches but prepared using information, data and works which are available somehow related to the topic and relevant to thoughts and activities in this region. The paper cites a few highlights on how the Blue Economy Concept fit into the sustainability framework does, while balancing its economic, social and environmental benefits and how does it contribute in GDP. The paper aims at generating thoughts and actions towards investigating various opportunities of the Blue Economy, ways of cashing the benefits as well as identifying challenges and ways of overcoming them. The paper concludes that Bangladesh as well as the south Asia has the potentials to follow the Blue Economy Concept. However it requires strong political willingness, commitments, which already have been demonstrated in Bangladesh. It needs rigorous researches and promoting social awareness.",Bari A.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2017-01-01,Ananda Group,Blue Economy ;  Coastal tourism ;  Maritime Transportation
Little big team: Acquiring human capital in software startups,"Background – Resource-based-view and human capital theories have been used for decades when studying firms, their strategies, organizations, businesses, and successes. The value of the theories as general frameworks has commonly been recognized, especially because of their flexibility in adopting new perspectives, such as the dynamic character of the resources and human capital. Startup companies represent an interesting area on a map of firms because of their specific characteristics and tendency not to strictly follow the processes common in more established companies. Despite the differences, it is reasonable to assume that startups face similar phenomena as established companies do when building up their firms and operations. Aim – In this research, we studied software startups from the perspective of resource-based-view and human capital theories. We examined what human capital resources, capabilities, knowledge, and skills, were needed in the early stages of software startups and how the startups acquired such human capital. Method – We conducted a multiple-case study on a group of software startups in Norway and Finland. Results – We identified six high-level capability areas, nine means to acquire those capabilities, and nine drivers affecting the utilization of different means. We concluded that the capabilities in software startups are dynamic, evolving by growth and learning from the basis of the founders’ prior capabilities, and the utilization of different acquiring means is a case-dependent thing with a varying set of drivers. We also found the uniqueness of the resources, as proposed by the resource-based-view theory, was not reached in our case startups, but replaced with a combination of commonly-available resources, innovation, and application-specific capabilities.",Seppänen P.; Liukkunen K.; Oivo M.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2017-01-01,Oulun Yliopisto,Capability needs ;  Human capital theory ;  Initial team ;  Product development ;  Product development process ;  Resource-based-view theory ;  Software startup

Concept inventories for control engineering: Past and future,"There are many publications about innovations in control engineering education. However, in order to substantially advance control engineering education a deeper discourse about its teaching is needed. This discourse would greatly benefit from having a common instrument to measure the success of the innovations. This can be done by a concept inventory. In physics education, the Force Concept Inventory started such a process. This paper proposes properties of a suitable concept inventory in control engineering, compares them to existing concept inventories in control engineering and concludes that a new concept inventory has to be developed. A research design for the development of this concept inventory is proposed taking into account the control engineering-specific challenges.",Kieckhäfer F.; Direnga J.; Timmermann D.; Kautz C.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 Research in Engineering Education Symposium, REES 2017",2017-01-01,Hamburg University of Technology,

Coopetition of software firms in open source software ecosystems,"Software firms participate in an ecosystem as a part of their innovation strategy to extend value creation beyond the firm’s boundary. Participation in an open and independent environment also implies the competition among firms with similar business models and targeted markets. Hence, firms need to consider potential opportunities and challenges upfront. This study explores how software firms interact with others in OSS ecosystems from a coopetition perspective. We performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of three OSS projects. Finding shows that software firms emphasize the co-creation of common value and partly react to the potential competitiveness on OSS ecosystems. Six themes about coopetition were identified, including spanning gatekeepers, securing communication, open-core sourcing and filtering shared code. Our work contributes to software engineering research with a rich description of coopetition in OSS ecosystems. Moreover, we also come up with several implications for software firms in pursing a harmony participation in OSS ecosystems.",Nguyen Duc A.; Cruzes D.; Hanssen G.; Snarby T.; Abrahamsson P.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2017-01-01,SINTEF Digital;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Genus AS,Case study ;  Collaboration ;  Competition ;  Coopetition ;  SECO ;  Software ecosystem
Integrating creativity in the design of chemical products,"In this work, we would like to present a novel alternative in chemical engineering design that focuses on chemical process and product design and that we call the ""Integrated chemical process and product design"". When designing a chemical process or product all the considerations related to formulation, composition, properties (molecular, microscopic and macroscopic) and the energy required for such process are taken into account as a whole instead of individual elements (multi-scale). Using this multi-scale approach does not guarantee the success of a process or product at the industrial level, but it does guarantee that is adequately designed. To achieve success at the industrial level it is imperative to set the properties of the desired product from an innovation standpoint. With this, an opportunity in the given sector can be correctly identified. Once this step finishes, a working prototype (developed using the multi-scale approach) is analyzed from an entrepreneurship perspective to identify how the product would eventually perform in the open market. This coupled analysis of multi-scale properties, innovation and entrepreneurship is what we call the ""Integrated chemical process and product design"" or DIPP for its acronym in Spanish.",Alvarez O.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 Research in Engineering Education Symposium, REES 2017",2017-01-01,"Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia",

However, there are several factors that should be considered in the preparation of training courses for teachers. The authors consider the technology of the master classes as an alternative to long-term courses. This approach has several advantages: short term, productivity at work. During the master-class the main goal is not to teach how to use the technology perfectly but to show its advantages, persuade to use a particular technology, demonstrate the ease of use, and motivate teachers for the further use of the offered technologies in their professional activity.

Obtaining products in chemical engineering through reproducing an environment of innovation in the classroom,"Creativity and capacity for the implementation of products are today part of the bases of university education, aimed at training professionals who possesses skills and competencies to contribute to the development of the society in which they live. The teaching-learning process in traditional university education has used strategies that place the student as a receiver of information which is conceptualized as knowledge. This type of training has been shown to have deficiencies because in present days there is a global access to information, which can be found through different media, mainly electronic. This makes the main goal of education the development of the capacity to generate solutions in obtaining products and services that can meet the needs of people, known as development of skills or know-how. In this paper, various products obtained through the application of ""Reproducing an Innovation Environment in the Classroom"" (RAIS) in courses in the curriculum of Chemical Engineering at the Universidad de los Andes are presented. These include personal care products such as soaps, sanitizers, cosmetic creams, sun and lip balms; cleaning products; and foods such as liqueurs and beberages.

Novel tools to study socio-technical transitions in energy systems,"As the response to the financial downturn and arising social problems, eco-innovation flagship was elaborated as one of the main building blocks for sustainable, smart and inclusive growth. Nevertheless, the experts are increasing pointing out, that we are missing one important link, while focusing mainly on technical innovations and natural environment, social aspect is mostly disregarded. This social aspect includes human, economic, policy, organisational and other interactions in the system. By bringing together these three sectors - social, technical and natural environment - studies on so called socio-technical system is created. Currently, the studies using social and technical aspects for the research on transition processes are fragmented, both in terms of studied sectors, used methods and scientific fields. Especially, in the field of energy research the majority of the works study techno-economic aspects of the systems, while only few attempts have been made to incorporate socio-technical perspective as well. There are also identified clear lack of a holistic methodology, therefore the aim of this paper is to attempt to link engineering and social science study field to create such modelling approach. Socio-technical transitions are viewed from the perspective of various sectors, such as energy use, energy production and management, innovation diffusion and other. Also the transitions are looked from the scientific lenses of various possible methods and combinations of those.

Social and humanitarian dimensions of technoscience,"The article is dedicated to re-conceptualization of ideas, implied by the theories of technoscience. In particular, they imply our understanding of technologies as material artifacts and technics, which is not the only possible one. In the same time, the presence of social technologies and innovations, practices of social planning and engineering, humanitarian labs and applied socio-humanitarian knowledge can provide reasonable ground for changes in our ways of speaking about social and human sciences in techno-scientific discourse. The first part of the article presents an updated approach to the key ideas of technoscience theory. In the second part of the article the author develops the historical argumentation for this approach. The practical functions of social sciences are described as follows: professional training for specialists; social critics and applied research; production of ideological concepts; intellectual support for social engineering; enlightenment and formation of humanitarian culture. The author argues that there are close ties between social sciences and practices, and the impact of social knowledge on developing of modern technoculture is being specifically revealed in this context.",Argamakova A.,Journal,Epistemology and Philosophy of Science,2017-01-01,"Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences",Applied socio-humanitarian knowledge ;  History of social sciences ;  Institutionalization of social sciences ;  NBICS-technologies ;  Social demand in science ;  Social engineering ;  Social innovations ;  Social laboratories ;  Social planning ;  Social technologies ;  Technoscience
Unravelling creativity in engineers,"Creativity is the capacity to produce a thing which is novel which could be in the existing perceptions, designs, concepts, and evolving somethting entirely new. Engineers need to be creative and innovative but the present day engineering education does not cater to igniting the brain to take up challenges and problems and come up with creative solutions. Student engineers are loaded with more of theoretical and conceptual courses which drain of their energy and interest in evolving something new. In industrialised nations the government and educationists are exploring ways and means to inculcate and develop creativity and innovative problem solving skills in the students pursuing engineering curriculum. This has permeated engineering students to venture into many start-ups and very many are succeeding. Creative ideas though may be stupid initially, in due course with proper description and processing evolve to be a better thing than what was expected. The profession of Engineering ought to be a creative profession but students often are of the opinion that creative behaviour is not encouraged in their classes and teaching. This study aims to understand the kind of creativity that is present in the engineering graduates working in Information Technology sector. The study has been focused on the employees of software industry residing at Chennai, the Tier I city and Coimbatore, the Tier II city and the primary data were collected through the distribution of a pre-tested research questionnaire. Among the five levels of creativity as identified by Taylor it was analysed and found that the engineering graduates working in IT firms were proficient in expressive and technical creativity but lacking in other levels namely inventive, innovative and emergent creativity.",Cresenta Shakila Motha L.; Alamelu R.; Nalini R.; Amudha R.; Sharmila P.,Journal,International Journal of Applied Business and Economic Research,2017-01-01,SASTRA Deemed University,Behaviour ;  Creativity ;  Education ;  Engineering ;  Knowledge and innovation
Investigating the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on Croatian business,"Technological innovation plays a critical role in economic growth. The most advanced and new technologies are created by leading firms in developed countries. Global expansion, strategic outsourcing or off-shoring in leading companies has been growing to enrich their competitive advantage, while technology transfer of leading firms has been of more interest to emerging or developing countries for catching up and following the trajectory of economic growth proved in developed countries. Among various channels to acquire new technologies from leading firms, foreign direct investments (FDI) is one of the most effective channels through which technology can be transferred to subsidiaries in emerging markets. However, empirical study on the roles of technology transfer and the feedback loop from FDI remains still scarce. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of FDI on businesses in partial or complete foreign ownership, with a special emphasis on technology transfer, and to assess the impact of foreign companies on domestic firm performance through technology transfer from foreign companies. This paper aims at investigating the investment climate for foreign investments and intensifying technology transfers and innovations in the Croatian economy. 145 firms responded to the survey we conducted for foreign investment enterprises in Croatia. Structural equation model is employed to examine the hypotheses with respect to effects of FDI on innovation activities of domestic Croatian firms. This study identified critical factors affecting technology innovation to Croatian firms. The results provide empirical evidence that the innovation activities in subsidiaries have a positive influence toward technology transfer from multinational corporations.",Cho Y.; Daim T.; Dabic M.,Journal,Journal of High Technology Management Research,2017-01-01,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business;Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science",Foreign direct investment (FDI) ;  Multinational firms ;  Structural equation model ;  Technology innovation ;  Technology transfer
Student customized creative education model based on open innovation,"As the creative economy has developed, the university has been given an important role of nurturing creative talents that companies desire to have. The most important objective in creative education is to provide a support system and a good environment for fostering creativity. This will help students in obtaining results and profits through experimenting as well as gaining experience in each step of the process in performing innovation by developing their ideas through utilizing self-directed information and knowledge. There are various creative economy-related businesses being conducted in Korea, which have been supported by the government since 2008, the supporting environment has been constructed to utilize the internal and external systems of universities. However, there are a number of cases where supporting projects that are possible to utilize are overlapping each other or support for projects is not available, as these sorts of supporting systems are designed according to the purpose and drawing performances for each business. For this, creating a ""student customized innovation model"" has been attempted by linking internal and external support for universities with a process of steps from design thinking to commercialization. The education model in universities should be established by balancing the roles and needs of enterprises, universities, and governments. An open innovation based system should be built for students who are being nurtured the university. The research method for this is as follows: First, the research aim was determined by considering the relationship between creative economy and the concept of open innovation. Second, a new model was developed by analyzing and doing case investigation of university convergence education programs that nurtured creativity. Third, this proposed model (CHEESE program (CHEESE Program stands for Creativity Human Emotional Experience Solution Evaluation)) was customized and designed based on the linkages between the creative education programs and open-innovation. Then, the outcomes from the project's three years test run were analyzed and organized. The development of the model was intended for design-engineering students based on integrating design-engineering thinking and activities in the process of innovation. The main objective of this study was to create a model (CHEESE program) based on the needs-centered activities that students wanted. This model has been restructured by linking the model with internal and external supporting projects of the university. The model has achieved continuous growth for 3 years and the performance has been improved in various aspects, such as patents, competition awards, and exhibition presentations. This project has drawn meaningful results in terms of experiencing the whole process of innovation, from the stage of determining an idea to making a prototype and commercializing it thorough exchanges with the internal and external systems of the university.",Kim S.; Ryoo H.; Ahn H.,Journal,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",2017-01-01,Kumoh National Institute of Technology,Creative education ;  Open innovation ;  Student customized
"The impact of culture on the innovative strength of nations: A comprehensive review of the theories of Hofstede, Schwartz, Boisot and Cameron and Quinn","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the importance of cultural values, the organizational culture and management style for innovation. It also comparatively evaluates the actual performance of European countries in innovation. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the theoretical frameworks of the well-known scholars Hofstede, House, Schwartz, Boisot and Cameron and Quinn are critically evaluated and compared with each other. In addition, the authors compared the cultural rankings and the actual performance in innovation of selected European countries. Before addressing the impact of culture on the innovative strength of nations, different definitions of innovation are being described. The theoretical framework developed on the basis of the six Hofstede dimensions is composed; the nine House dimensions are supplemented and the Schwartz values for innovative strength of nations are also being discussed. Culture as a knowledge asset, the positioning in information space and its influence on innovation following the theories of Boisot and the different cultural types as defined by Cameron and Quinn have been studied and evaluated. The performance of European countries in innovation has been evaluated on the basis of the Global Innovation Index, the patent applications to the European Patent Office and the European Innovation Scoreboard. Findings: Based on literature review, one can conclude that there is a strong positive relation between several cultural characteristics of countries in question and their innovative strength. The results of this paper point out the importance of cultural values for innovation. Research limitations/implications: This research has assessed the relation between national culture in general on the innovative strength of nations. Future research on which cultural characteristics and management styles have the strongest correlation with the innovative strength of nations could provide valuable insights for both scholars in this research field and for institutions and companies that wish to improve their innovative strength. Practical implications: The results of this study provide us with the insight that the innovative strength of a nation or organization can be altered by changing (parts of) its culture. A practical implication of this finding is that a government can, for example, increase its nation’s innovative strength by encouraging cooperation between different institutions and by limiting rules and regulations which could cause barriers in the innovation process. Social implications: A social implication of the findings of this study is the knowledge that to improve the innovative strength of a nation, a government needs to pursue a pro-active policy of transforming national culture, for example, by changing the educational system and decreasing the power distance between teachers and students. Such an effort to influence the national culture addresses interesting issues regarding the concept of social engineering. Originality/value: By critically evaluating the qualitative cultural frameworks of several well-known scholars and relating them to quantitative statistical data about the innovative strength of nations, this study has combined the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies and produced non-trivial findings in an original manner.",Moonen P.,Journal,Journal of Organizational Change Management,2017-01-01,Universiteit van Amsterdam,Cultural values ;  Culture ;  Culture as a knowledge asset ;  Innovation ;  Leadership styles ;  Organizational cultures and structures ;  Performance in innovation

Dual education models as elements of corporate embeddedness in Hungary,"Reindustrialisation and the European Industrial Renaissance are strategic priorities of the current EU programming period (2014-2020). In parallel with the declining significance of national economies, the meso (local) level is becoming more and more powerful. Key actors of reindustrialisation are transnational companies (TNCs) and their locations, the specific settlements. Transnational companies are influential allies of local and regional communities from several aspects, such as society, economy, governance, environment, and most importantly from the perspective of the current study, science and education. Their contribution to secondary and higher level engineering education, starting from the international kindergarten level, continuing in dual education models and ending up in corporate PhD and MBA programs have become significant elements of the endogenous development potential of the host locations. The author considers the active participation of TNCs in these educational activities and life career model development as part of their local embedding process. Corporate embeddedness is a relatively new field of research and a phenomenon that raises several questions generating an ongoing debate between both practitioners and researchers. The current research focuses on the embeddedness of TNCs in the science and education sphere in the Central and Eastern European region, by analysing several case studies and process models from Hungary. The methodology is novel, process-based and empirical, building on the quintuple helix innovation model and the findings of recent desk-based and primary research. The contribution to the state of the art is twofold, firstly, the presentation of contemporary corporate embeddedness process models from the perspective of engineering education; and secondly, the analysis of how these processes could contribute to advanced economic growth and development path designation of an area.",Józsa V.,Conference Proceeding,Engineering for Rural Development,2017-01-01,Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences,Corporate embeddedness ;  Dual education ;  Transnational companies
Highly skilled migration as a source and a challenge for competitiveness of state,"The paper reviews the growing impact of highly skilled migration policies on the competitiveness of states. Highly skilled migrants (HSM) are regarded as valuable contributors to the knowledge economy, that the receiving countries are competing with each other for. The increase in HSM number (arriving with an H1B visa) had a positive effect on innovative development at macro and micro levels in the United States. A significant role in creation of innovations is played by foreign students, in particular those studying on the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics programs). At the same time, an overall contribution of HSM to the innovation development of host countries is much greater than the number of patents, grants and highly cited publications, given indirect effects of immigration which play an equally important role in creating innovations: ""the effects of knowledge spillover"" from immigrants to colleagues. The author gives an overview of a range of foreign studies which demonstrate a strong positive impact of HSM on creating of innovations, and analyses some successful national approaches to HSM selection (cases of the USA, Australia and Canada). In recent years, Russian government has introduced a set of initiatives in migration politics, aiming at HSM. However, there is still a lack of suficient public discussion on benefits HSM can bring to the Russian economy. Besides, low attractiveness of Russia for HSM challenges its capacity to compete with the leaders in a ""global race for talents"", and therefore, to manage highly skilled migration policy as a source for innovation development. Universities, research institutes and high-technology firms serve as the main centers of innovation creation and attraction for HSM. Therefore, high-skilled migration policy should focus on the involvement of these recruiters through strengthening the internationalization and competitiveness of Russian universities, R&D and business sector. Moreover, the policy will have a highly positive effect if HSM represent different cultures. This implies the necessity to elaborate and introduce effective multicultural practices in education, research and business activities.",Bol'shova N.,Journal,World Economy and International Relations,2017-01-01,Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO),Competitiveness of state ;  Globalization ;  High-skilled migrants ;  Innovations ;  Knowledge-driven economy ;  Migration policy ;  Multiculturalism ;  Russia ;  The USA ;  University

The 'Safety Gap' in buildings: Perceptions of Welsh Fire Safety Professionals,"This paper presents evidence of a 'Safety Gap' in buildings for fire performance and reviews different approaches to achieving Fire safety in England and Wales, UK, for a Research & Enterprise Innovation Funded project at Cardiff Metropolitan University. One aspect of the safety Gap is for potential defects in construction from incorrect installation, missing, inappropriate or defective components, that make up compartmentation, fire stoppings and workmanship errors, to enable rapid smoke spread across compartments, so preventing the safe evacuation of occupants. A questionnaire survey was conducted with fire rescue and safety professionals in South Wales, UK in 2016. Results show that more than 75% of the respondents think that in-built performance of fire safety measures including compartmentation are difficult to assess during fire risk assessments and fire risk audits, using current visual inspection methods. The majority of the participants agreed that a non-intrusive and non-destructive test method could help in ascertaining the integrity of building compartmentation and in-built performance of other fire safety measures and to ensure the safety gap is not present. It is discussed that these findings give fire industry backing for the non-destructive test, measurement and reporting protocol that the first two authors of this paper are developing for assessing the effectiveness of active and passive fire protection systems in buildings. This paper will be useful for academics, building owners and landlords, developers and fire and rescue services investigating and involved in ensuring the fire protection of buildings and of the health, safety and wellbeing of their occupants. .",Littlewood J.; Alam M.; Goodhew S.; Davies G.,Conference Proceeding,Energy Procedia,2017-01-01,Cardiff Metropolitan University;University of Plymouth;Sustainable Construction Monitoring and Research Ltd;Coastal Housing Group,Fire risk assessment & fire risk audit ;  Fire safety measures - Compartmentation ;  Occupant safety ;  Safey Gap ;  wellbeing

Optimisation of optical fibres for Structural health monitoring through micro-braiding,"Structural health monitoring (SHM) of composite structures has become paramount in aerospace industry in recent years. With advances in research and innovation, this can be achieved in real time by embedding optical fibre into the structure to be monitored. The optical fibre has been proven to be versatile for application in SHM due to its ability to measure strain and temperature. However, the optical fibres are brittle which makes their handling and integration difficult. This issue can be solved by micro-braiding the optical fibre, with the judicious type of reinforced fibre. Braiding is a textile forming (both tubular and flat) technique that is capable of producing near net shaped structures, in which the tow such as glass fibre can be interlaced at bias angle (braid angle). This paper presents the optimised material selection, fibre orientation and machine speed. Variation in braid angle is achieved by varying the take up speed while keeping the braider machine speed constant. The tensile properties of the conventional and micro-braided optical fibre are presented and compared. The improvement of tensile strength and strain is observed and discussed.",Rufai O.; Gautam M.; Potluri P.; Gresil M.,Conference Proceeding,"Structural Health Monitoring 2017: Real-Time Material State Awareness and Data-Driven Safety Assurance - Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring, IWSHM 2017",2017-01-01,The University of Manchester,
Design parameters for increased operability of offshore crane vessels,"Marine subsea operations are performed by highly specialized ships, referred to as Inspection, Maintenance, and Repair (IMR) and Ofshore Construction Vessels (OCV). Although the ships and their on-board equipment are designed to operate in harsh environmental conditions, the current practice often is to terminate operations when a rigid and conservative weather limitation is reached, often specifed in terms of the signifcant wave height as the exclusive criterion. Such general limitations do not account for vessel specifc motion behavior. Since the ofshore industry is aiming for all-year-round safe subsea operations, there is a strong interest amongst ship designers, owners and operators to establish vessel and task specifc criteria. The project Vessel Performance within the Norwegian Centre for Research-based Innovation on Marine Operations (SFI MOVE), is developing response-based procedures, that are leading to case-specifc operational ranges. This approach enables the full exploitation of vessel performance capabilities for safe and efcient ofshore operations. Two methods with diferent complexity levels are proposed. Firstly, on the higher level, detailed operability analysis for a feet and sea area of interest are performed by means of numerical tools. This level can be used to obtain detailed results for existing ships, but the procedure can also be applied as guidance in the design stage. Secondly, on the lower level, generic diagrams can be used to estimate and compare the operational performance of diferent vessels based on fact sheet parameters. This is especially relevant for decision making processes where a detailed study cannot be performed.",Gutsch M.; Sprenger F.; Steen S.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,2017-01-01,SINTEF Ocean;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,
The use of organizational and technological innovations in the process of managerial and engineering personnel's training,"Today in the Russian economy there is a shortage of highly skilled engineering personnel having innovative thinking, knowledge not only in the field of fundamental science, but also in the field of management and business. Given the presence in the Russian Federation of a number of highly prestigious technical universities, not all educational institutions in the country train professional staff at the required level, which determines the relevance of the study of the application of organizational and technological innovations in the process of preparing managerial and engineering personnel. In the process of studying this problem, research methods such as studying and generalizing the experience of training managerial and engineering personnel in higher education institutions, statistical methods of analysis, and the method of expert assessments were used. The study provides an assessment of the level of innovation development in the Russian Federation, highlights the most important from the point of view of innovation process competitive advantages of human capital, as the place of Russian graduates in the field of science and technology and universities in international rankings for 2015-2017. The study by the authors of the article of the best foreign and domestic practices made it possible to identify productive organizational and technological innovations in the process of preparing managerial and engineering personnel. The result of the study was the identification of the main elements of the model of the innovation-oriented process of managerial and engineering personnel's training.",Larionova A.; Zaitseva N.; Fadeev A.; Zhenzhebir V.; Filatov V.; Pshava T.,Journal,Eurasian Journal of Analytical Chemistry,2017-01-01,Moscow State University of Technologies and Management;The Kosygin State University of Russia;Bauman Moscow State Technical University;Plekhanov Russian University of Economics,Education ;  Engineering and technical personnel ;  Management personnel ;  Organizational and technological innovations ;  Training
From space food research and innovation to immediate advantages for Earth eating habits: An aerospace – food producer company case study,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse how the food innovation strategies carried out by an Italian firm, Argotec, responsible for the development and supply of space food (SF) for European astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS), can also be applied to food suitable to be eaten on Planet Earth. This study aims at showing the relationship between SF innovation and terrestrial strategies directed at implementing this kind of food also on terrestrial tables. Design/methodology/approach: This research focusses on a case study. The subject of the case study under analysis is Argotec, an internationally recognised Italian aerospace engineering company, dealing with research, innovation and development in various sectors, including engineering, information technology, system integration, small satellites and “Human Space Flight and Operations”. The company produces innovative SF for European astronauts performing long-duration missions on-board the ISS. Moreover, the SF is made available also for terrestrial beings as a solution for everyday eating necessities. Findings: Argotec is characterised by strong innovation in terms of products and processes. Throughout the case study, the authors focus on the relationship between SF innovation and its terrestrial applications, since this company also manufactures products, traded under the brand “ReadyToLunch”, suitable for daily meals on Earth. Innovation applied to SF can thus offer advantages also for terrestrial daily meals and therefore help the company achieve other competitive advantages: as to the authors’ knowledge, this is a unique case. Research limitations/implications: This study also has some limitations, typical of the applied methodology. In relation to the interview technique, further interviews would be required in order to fully understand the end-user perspectives regarding the importance and interest of this kind of “ready-to-eat” food. Practical implications: Practical implications relate to astronauts and to terrestrial consumers. For astronauts, SF is not any more intended only to satisfy humans’ basic needs, and to provide the necessary nutrients during space missions, but has become an important factor in the quality of life in space. For terrestrial consumers, SF may represent a healthy, tasty and nutritious “ready-to-eat” choice: single courses for the main meals and snacks for a break. Originality/value: This research fills a gap in literature: to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper presenting a case study on a company responsible for the development and supply of SF for European astronauts on-board the ISS, as well as encouraging the consumption of SF by terrestrial beings, as an ordinary “ready-to-eat” lunch/dinner.",Varese E.; Cane P.,Journal,British Food Journal,2017-01-01,Università degli Studi di Torino;Argotec,Astronauts ;  Consumers on Earth ;  Innovation ;  Marketing ;  Ready-to-eat healthy food ;  Space food
The significance of the results of crash-tests with the use of the models of the pedestrians' lower extremities for the prevention of the traffic road accidents,"The disabling injuries inflicted during road traffic accidents (RTA) create a serious challenge for the public health services and are at the same time a major socio-economic problem in the majority of the countries throughout the world. The injuries to the lower extremities of the pedestrians make up the largest fraction of the total number of the non-lethal RTA injuries. Most of them are responsible for the considerable deterioration of the quality of life for the participants in the accidents during the subsequent period. The objective of the present study was to summarize the currently available results of experimental testing of the biomechanical models of the pedestrians' lower extremities in the framework of the program for the prevention of the road traffic accidents as proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2004). The European Enhanced Safety Vehicle Committee (EEVC) has developed a series of crash-tests with the use of the models of the pedestrians' lower extremities simulating the vehicle bumperpedestrian impact. The models are intended for the assessment of the risk of the tibia fractures and the injuries to the knee joint ligaments. The experts of EEVC proposed the biomechanical criteria for the acceleration of the knee and talocrural parts of the lower limbs as well as for the shear displacement of the knee and knee-bending angle. The engineering solution of this problem is based on numerous innovation proposals being implemented in the machine-building industry with the purpose of reducing the stiffness of structural elements of the bumper and other front components of a modern vehicle designed to protect the pedestrians from severe injuries that can be inflicted in the road traffic accidents. The activities of the public health authorities (in the first place, bureaus of forensic medical expertise and analogous facilities) have a direct bearing on the solution of the problem of control of road traffic injuries because they are possessed of comprehensive and reliable objective information about all forms of the damage to health associated with vehicle-pedestrian collisions and their victims' condition. It is concluded that making use of the experience and professional knowledge of forensic medical experts and automotive specialists could considerably contribute to the enhancement of safety of all the participants in the vehicular traffic.",Smirenin S.; Fetisov V.; Grigoryan V.; Gusarov A.; Kucheryavets Y.,Journal,Sudebno-Meditsinskaya Ekspertiza,2017-01-01,D.I.

Innovation in high-level capture and diffusion of tacit architectural knowledge,"This paper focusses on an ‘Embedded Doctoral Design Program’ (EDDP), comprising a cohort of design PhD candidates who are ‘embedded’ outside the university for a substantial part of their candidature. Specifically, the paper details the framework and outcome for Australian doctoral candidates in architecture placed in contexts outside their experience and immediate expertise, and outside the traditional academic research setting. These contexts can be drawn potentially from professional practice, industry and commerce; in associated areas of interest as diverse as planning, property, construction, civil and infrastructure engineering, ecology, manufacturers, financial institutions and communication companies. They could also be placed within local government, NGO and NFP project teams involving community health, political science and policy definition, social science and anthropology, and even cultural sectors such as museums.",Burry M.,Journal,"Architecture, City and Environment",2017-01-01,Swinburne University of Technology,Architectural diffusion ;  Australian doctoral candidates
Learning and teaching architecture in times of change,"Due to the progressively heterogeneous array of today’s architect’s practices, both, as designers or specialised consultants, as well as other new inputs that requires transversal knowledge, we propose to review the adequacy of the Spanish Schools at new challenges. This article is also a framing introduction to the contributions to this special issue on Learning and Teaching in Architecture that are both from some Barcelona School ETSAB teachers and international. Comparing architecture with other professions that has better-established research contexts and methods trough the contribution of other fields’ authors. Relocating architecture among other professions with a designedly way of thinking. Reviewing the architectural practice (and its relation with theory) in the aftermath of modern movement’ post crisis. In order to make didactics more flexible it is compulsory to distinguish clearly between the undergraduate and master studies as well as to overcome the departmental utter division and return the capacity to lead studies and teachers to the schools. The accreditation systems of research must be clarified and distinctly differentiated from scientific disciplines. Research by design groups with multiple expertise and direct relation with practices has to be enhanced to respond to its diversity with a open and unified architectural method. We highlight the importance for the Spanish schools to recover the previously and partially missed opportunity to embed the European Higher Education System to harmonise them with other European countries, reshaping learning paths to design based professions like Architecture, Building Engineering or Planning.

A new quantitative predicting method for water-sensitivity damage,"The possibility that the productivity is seriously reduced if the producing formation is exposed to the fresh water has been recognized for many years. Many experiments and theoretical studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanism of water sensitivity. Despite years of field observations and laboratory research, methods of predicting quantitatively the susceptibility of formation to water-sensitivity have not been developed to complete reliability. Until now, there was no model to predict the productivity decreasing according to the experiment results except time consuming simulation. Based on the latest researches on water sensitivity characteristics and mechanism, core experiments were set up to analyze the permeability and relative permeability parameters changing along with the salinity decreasing under different reservoir properties. Based on material balance equation, analytical function of relative permeability, Backley Leverett theory and Welge equation, a new productivity decline model which can quantitatively predict water sensitivity influence is derived with all the coefficients clearly. The new model has been proven to accurately predict the production performance. The changing coefficients could be obtained through analyzing permeability loss and relative permeability changes through laboratory measurements. The most significant innovation is that the production performance could be quantitatively predicted rely on the laboratory results. It can be concluded from experiment analysis that the permeability loss was slow after the first fast, and the relative permeability parameters also changed (residual oil saturation and irreducible water saturation becomes bigger, and the relative permeability of both oil and water phase becomes smaller at the same water saturation) along with salinity decreasing because of the clay swelling and the colloidal clay particles captured at a local pore constriction. Then the change of the coefficients in new model could be calculated and the production performance could be predicted. The proposed model has been tested using production data from several reservoirs and the results have demonstrated that the proposed new model works satisfactorily. The novelty of the new dynamics model is in the ability to solve the production prediction approach for water-sensitive reservoirs according to experiment measurements without time consuming simulation.",Yang R.; Jiang R.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2017-01-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);CNOOC Research Institute Co.

Innovation in reservoir-driven shaped charges enhances productivity,"The performance of shaped charge jet perforators in complex downhole environments remains the status quo for successful cased-hole completions. Traditionally, these perforators have been evaluated using concrete targets under ambient conditions. The designs based on these evaluations were therefore optimized for conditions that don't reflect true downhole environments. Recent testing specifications in sandstone targets (API RP-19B Section 2) have also failed to consider the effects of complex well conditions and rock properties. In addition to the perforator itself, the overall completion design must be considered to properly optimize the perforating event. This is typically done using empirical correlations and first-order modeling software. While beneficial, these methods can misrepresent the complex interactions among the perforator, the reservoir, and the wellbore in the unique set of conditions. Ultimately, this can all lead to the deployment of a perforator optimized with conditions (not tailored to the reservoir) and utilizing generic practices, thereby leading to adverse implications on the overall well completion. The use of perforation flow laboratories and advances in shaped charge research and engineering have been employed in this study to understand and optimize shaped charge performance at downhole conditions. The perforators that result from a comprehensive test program in conjunction with multi-physics computational modeling are tailored for improved shaped charge performance under reservoir-specific conditions. These bespoke perforators undergo further testing as part of a more comprehensive optimization program to design the overall application on a well-specific basis. A similar scientific approach is also applied for the overall application optimization by integrating laboratory testing, CT imaging, computational flow dynamics, and dynamic event modeling to eventually upscale the results to the field applications. The results of these processes demonstrate the significant performance improvement in the shaped charge tailored for true reservoir conditions. Field applications examined in this study demonstrate specific uses of optimized perforators, as well as example workflows of how an integrated testing and modeling process can insure the perforators are applied properly. Comparisons demonstrate productivity improvements through these engineered processes. The new class of reservoir-driven shaped charges is aimed towards increasing production or injection by deeper formation connectivity with the wellbore as well as ensuring perforation contribution efficiency. The productivity gains in these case studies demonstrate the potential improvement in well completions through the use of engineered processes both for initial product design and specific application optimization in perforated completions.",Zuklic S.; Satti R.; Betancourt D.; Harvey W.; White R.; Sampson T.; Myers W.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2017-01-01,"Baker Hughes, a GE company",

"Aerospace Technology Demonstration: BLADE, the Flagship Laminar Flow Project within the Clean Sky Programme","In the year 2000 the Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE) was established in order to provide research and policy guidance to the European Commission. ""Flightpath 2050"" was published in 2011 to provide a long term frame for collaborative technology research, soon followed by a ""Strategic Agenda For Research and Innovation"". This agenda has been successful in providing a common and coherent reference for the 27 member states of the European Union, and others, to guide future actions in private and public research programs in order to meet societal and market needs. In June 2017 an update to the agenda was published at the Paris airshow, to reflect the rapid progress made in aviation technology and to respond multiplicity of changed circumstances which the agenda must address. The Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative is a key means of delivering the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, and it is the principal pre-competitive research and technology program in Europe. The Clean Sky program has been a public/private investment of 1.6€B by 600 partners over the period 2009 to 2017, which is now coming to a conclusion. It comprised six sub-programs working on civil technology demonstrations. This paper presents the progress made on the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft sub-program, notably on the BLADE laminar flow technology demonstrator. A commentary is given on the means of technology demonstrations that were employed during the eight years of the program, as the various technology readiness levels have been achieved. A short video is presented highlighting the physical progress on BLADE before its planned first flight in late 2017. The lecture concludes with a short discussion of the merits and challenges associated with the physical demonstration of aviation technology, notably as digitalization is more and more a driver in the industry.",Williams G.,Journal,SAE Technical Papers,2017-01-01,Airbus UK,
Personal entrepreneurial characteristics and economic literacy: A comparison between university students of Southern Chile,"Entrepreneurship is defined as the capacity to detect and act upon economic opportunities in the environment, to gain an individual or collective benefit. Interest in this subject has led to relate this construct with individual and social variables. How ever, few studies have focused on the characteristics of entrepreneurs and their level of knowledge about the econ omic world, known as economic literacy. This is relevant given that en tre preneurship cannot be solely understood from the concept of opportunity or the traits of the entrepreneur, and instead these elements must be understood in their interaction. From this point of view, economic literacy is fundamental. Understanding the economic world allows the entrepreneur to better manage resources and projects and to take informed decisions about daily economic problems. Following principles from Economic Psychology, this research aims to compare the personal entrepreneurial characteristics and the economic literacy of Chilean university students of two faculties. The design of this study is quantitative, non-experimental, with a descriptive scope. The Test of Entrepreneurial Personal Characteristics (PECs) and the Test of Economic Literacy for Adults (TAE-A) and was answered by 200 students from the faculties of Engineering, Science and Man agement (FICA) and Education, Social Sciences and Humanities (FESCH). A convenience sample was chosen, which comprised 57.5% men and 42.5% women, with a mean age of 22 years. The test PECs measures 10 dimensions, related to the three basic elements of entrepreneurship: innovation, risk-taking and proactivity. The TAE-A measures knowledge on General Economy, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and International Econ o my. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted over the PECs Test, and a following Student's t Test to compare the scores between students from both faculties. The exploratory factor analysis of the test PECs suggests a new nine-dimensional structure for the Chilean student population, thus changing the original structure and categories of the test. Both faculties showed a low level of economic knowledge. When comparing both faculties in the PECs test, significant differences were found in six out the nine dimensions, that is, the FICA students presented significantly higher scores for the following personal entrepreneurial characteristics: Risk anticipation, Persistence and confidence, Self-demand and quality, Search for control and excel lence, Propositivity and Foresight. Similarly, FICA students had higher levels of economic knowledge of International Economy, although no significant differences were found when comparing the overall performance on economic literacy. Neither faculty reached the degree of economic literacy expected for this education level. This should be a cause of concern because previous research asserts that a deficit in economic literacy in adults puts them at risk of compulsive economic behavior, consumerism, overspending and debt. In conclusion, although the emergent structure of the PECs test may be useful, a confirmatory factor analysis and further studies of its psychometric properties are suggested for its use in research and assessment of interventions on entrepreneurship in university populations. These results highlight the importance of strengthening economic literacy and the promotion of entrepreneurial personal char acteristics, as part of the personal and professional development of university students with emphasis on those careers that are explicitly linked to entrepre neurship. Limitations of the study are the convenience sampling method used and the lack of exploration of other sources of economic knowledge outside academia and also, the design and scope of this study does not allow to conclude if the differences found are due to the learning inside the university context or if students with different profiles are drawn to different careers and faculties. Drawing from both findings and limitations, suggestions for future research in the subject of economic literacy and entrepreneurship and related issues are outlined.",Sepúlveda Maldonado J.; Denegri Coria M.; Orellana Calderón L.; Criado N.; Mendoza J.; Salazar P.; Yung G.,Journal,Interdisciplinaria,2017-01-01,Universidad de la Frontera,Economic literacy ;  Economic literacy test ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Entrepreneurship traits ;  University students
A design process approach to strategic production planning for industry 4.0,The fourth industrial revolution confronts existing industrial organisations with fundamental manufacturing innovation challenges. The high levels of risk and uncertainty linked to corporate strategic planning activities are driven by the necessity of reacting to the rapidly increasing innovation pressure exerted on manufacturing companies in particular in technology-driven sectors such as automotive. This research deals with the creation of a structured methodological approach to strategic production planning that is essentially based on the systematic leveraging of the creativity and experience of a vast diverse network of employees in order to establish an actionable and living integrated manufacturing-driven innovation road mapping process. The process approach has strongly been inspired by process approaches to new product development (NPD). The results have been validated within the industrial environment of one of the biggest German automotive tier-1 suppliers.,Riel A.; Flatscher M.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2017-01-01,Université Grenoble Alpes;ZF Friedrichshafen AG,Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation planning ;  Planning process ;  Technology planning ;  Technology roadmapping
InnoTEACH – Applying principles of innovation in school,"The research and development of new and improved services, systems, and products is an important driver for the European market. Innovation requires people that can interact in innovation teams, innovative and new ideas, creative environments supporting the creation of innovation, and innovation processes that support the entire chain from idea creation to the implementation of an innovation project. Innovation is intimately linked with entrepreneurship. Ideas, Innovation and Entrepreneurship are considered the keys to a wealthy and sustainable economy [1, 3, 5, 6, 8]. The InnoTEACH project empowers the innovation mind-set in the European Union by establishing learning environments in schools which fertilize the grounds for young people to apply innovation principles in problem solving and learning about entrepreneurship concepts at the same time.

Incorporating innovation management practices to ISO/IEC 29110,"Studies on Innovation management are often focused on large companies and organizations. On the other side, small companies or VSE (Very Small Entities), constitute a significant part of the entrepreneurial landscape, and contribute – in a great extent – to the economic outputs of society and to the creation of employment. This is also valid for the system and software engineering business areas. Larger systems being built and deployed across Europe are usually built with the participation of small enterprises or research centers whose contributions have a key role in the resulting systems. Although these companies are sensitive to the importance of systematic innovation, most of the innovation models are targeted to large or medium enterprises and do not consider the specific characteristics of the system and software engineering industries. In this particular business area, innovation must consider two separate dimensions: (a) the opportunities to innovate that system and software development companies may offer to their customers and prospects, and (b) the application of techniques to innovate in the software development processes, to achieve better performance and leverage process capabilities and company productivity. Both dimensions require a systematic integration of the innovation management processes with the managerial and engineering processes of the organizations. This paper proposes an extension of the process model described in the ISO/IEC 29110 standard to enable innovation management processes and activities addressed to VSE. The innovation activities and tools incorporated into the resulting model are based on existing innovation models, and on the feedback collected through interviews and surveys with different software development companies. SPEM (System and Software Process Engineering Metamodel) has been used as a process design framework to encode the resulting model and formally integrate innovation, managerial and engineering processes for VSE.",Eito-Brun R.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2017-01-01,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,Innovation management R&D projects ;  ISO/IEC 29110 ;  SPEM
"Development of a video coding structure to record Active, Blended, and Collaborative pedagogical practice","Classroom observation protocols (COPs) are valuable tools for collecting information about and characterizing classroom instruction. The purpose of this work is to describe the development and final structure of a specialized COP for use in coding video recordings of an active, blended, and collaborative (ABC) learning environment known as Freeform. Coding these ABC elements in the context of the instructor's actions allows the research team to empirically describe what occurs in the Freeform classroom, generating a unique and rich dataset containing information about the duration and sequencing of these ABC instructional elements. This data informs ABC instruction, facilitates further implementation of Freeform, and can inform further innovation based on reliable and valid observation data. Additionally, we believe documentation about the development process itself will empower other researchers to explore the use of COPs in analyzing and characterizing their own pedagogical practices in undergraduate STEM education.",Evenhouse D.; Silva De Freitas C.; Patel N.; Kandakatla R.; Zadoks A.; Prebel T.; Stites N.; Berger E.; DeBoer J.; Rhoads J.; Krousgrill C.,Conference Proceeding,"2017 Research in Engineering Education Symposium, REES 2017",2017-01-01,Purdue University,
Fictionalizing & speculation: Innovating between science and policy - The case of nanomedicine,"Scientific actors are faced with one central problem of translation: there are different requirements on innovating, namely those of science and science policy, which scientific actors have to reconcile in a plausible way. Taking Nanomedicine as example this article shows how scientists mediate the political tension of Nanomedicine being both, a key technology and a potential risk for society at large. At the same time scientists have to fulfill the scientific deed of producing relevant knowledge for specific epistemic cultures. By means of ethnographic data about an EU funded project in the field of tissue engineering this article shows how the convergence of requirements of science and science policy on innovating is realized in research practice. Ethnographic observations draw on three research phases, which are defined as media of translation. In each of these media specific translational practices are necessary: addressing & re-formulatio (proposal), hybridization & re-configuration (experiment), staging & reconstruction (publication). The article's methodological argument is that these practices are media-specific practices of fictionalizing and speculation. In today's regimes of innovating, becoming an actor of innovation with societal relevance seems to be possible, only if the conflictual balancing act between fictionalizing and speculation succeeds.",Schröpfer A.,Journal,Soziale Welt,2017-01-01,Technische Universität München,
Industry Mix and 3D Urban Heterogeneity: Insights into Innovation Districts,"Economic heterogeneity is an inherent characteristic of cities. Such heterogeneity is generally mapped at broad scales and the specific physical interfaces between industries and the spaces they occupy are rarely addressed vertically as a 3D urban landscape. This paper examines vertical or 3D heterogeneity of different building types using the City of Sydney's fine grained GIS dataset from 2012. Different building types are examined for their ability to support different tenant mix ""ecologies"". The study finds that statistically different buildings support different mixes with variables such as building size, location and age playing an influential role in the tenant mix. 3D industry mix is an important factor for cities seeking to foster innovation and economic development. This research engages with current dialogues on innovation districts by providing quantitative evidence to help real-estate professionals, urban designers and city managers to make decisions concerning the shaping of specific industry mixes.",Scott H.; Hoon H.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2017-01-01,UNSW Sydney,3D GIS ;  commercial real-estate ;  industry heterogeneity ;  mixed-use ;  tenant mix
Smart Manufacturing,"Manufacturing accounts for a quarter of worldwide employment. Employees of this sector earn higher than the median income of a country.

Engineering value-effective healthcare solutions: A systems design perspective,"Our modern healthcare systems commonly face an important dilemma. While they depend on innovation to provide continuously greater healthcare value, they also struggle financially with the burden of adopting a continuous flow of new products and services. Although several disruptive healthcare models, i.e. decentralised, personalised, pervasive, connected, and stratified, promise to relieve some of this tension, they do not per se guarantee optimal value generation. We argue that systems thinking and engineering design can remedy this limitation. We support this claim by making the case of Design for Evolvability and by elaborating on two examples: MRI systems and Point-of-Care in-vitro diagnostics solutions. We specifically argue that Design for Evolvability can realign the agendas of various healthcare stakeholders, serving both individual and national interests.

Coping with the challenges of engineering smart product service systems - Demands for research infrastructure,"Driven by innovations of information and communication technologies as well as increasingly demanding customer expectations on individualized products and services Smart Product Service Systems become success factors for any enterprise acting on a globalized market. Increasing product complexity on the one hand as well as flexible autonomous (re)configurations and adaptations throughout the entire product lifecycle on the other hand call for dedicated research methodologies on supporting the inter- and mulitdisciplinary engineering process. Active experimentation and simulation of typical Smart PSS lifecycle situations are key to developing new methodologies. The approach specifically fosters the integration of customers into all steps of the engineering process, which is again key to meeting the characteristically interdisciplinary requirements to Smart PSS.

Design variation through richness of rules embedded in lego bricks,"Design rules govern the design process by imposing constraints on the development of a product. Examples of design rules include engineering standards, regulations, standard operating procedures and existing designs as protected by patents. They have the potential to over-constrain the design space and impact innovation. In this paper, an exploratory study is reported that investigates the link between richness of design rules and the resulting design variation in a LEGO model. Design rule richness describes the quantity and explicitness of constraints relating to a design. Design rules, relating to a model of a simple spaceship, were embedded in individual LEGO bricks. Twenty participants were tasked with constructing the spaceship while adhering to the set design rules. There were four levels of design rule richness and the participants constructed a model for each level. Measuring the design variation through Design Structure Matrices revealed that the richness of the design rules only had a significant effect on the design variation between the least and most rich design rules. This suggests that a point exists at which the richness of design rules limit design variation.",Mathias D.; Boa D.; Hicks B.; Snider C.; Bennett P.; Taylor C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2017-01-01,University of Bristol,Construction kits ;  Embedded rules ;  Human behaviour in design ;  Innovation ;  Requirements
Towards a model of the open-design process: Using the grounded theory for modelling implicit design processes,"The open-source approach arose in the computer industry. It now also impacts physical goods. In order to benefit from alleged benefit of open-design for tangible artefact, it appears needed to model this design process. We thus studied the 12 projects that took part to the PoC21 innovation camp, and construct a model based on interviews of projects stakeholders we have conducted. To develop the model, we followed the methodology of the grounded theory. The two main contributions of this paper are: first, the model of the open-design; and second, the methodology we used to construct this model. We have found that it is possible to use the grounded theory framework for formalizing implicit processes. Our model depicts the open-design process as a process, which features resemble to both traditional product design processes, and open-source software development processes. However, it also presents specifics that are not shown in any of these models detailed in literature. This model can serve as a basic for future prescriptive research on open-design. Moreover, we recommend a grounded-theory based methodology to model undocumented and implicit design processes.",Boisseau E.; Bouchard C.; Omhover J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2017-01-01,LCPI Laboratoire de Conception de Produits et Innovation,Grounded theory ;  Open source design ;  Open-design ;  Process modelling ;  Research methodologies and methods
Current state of practices in open source product development,"Open source innovation is a well-studied phenomenon of the ICT sector, but its evolution towards the field of tangible hardware product development is a newer phenomenon which remains mostly theoretical. Existing literature has identified that to push existing open source product development (OSPD) practice towards the achievement of high quality complex products, methods and tools adapted to this specific organisation of work are needed. The objective of this article is to explore the practices emerging from OSPD communities in order to support the development of appropriate process support in the future. It reports first observations made during a qualitative and comparative empirical study performed with participants of 23 OSPD projects through semi-directed interviews. Activating a formerly published framework, these observations address four themes: the organizational structure of OSPD's surrounding communities, their design process, their underlying business models and the supporting online tools they use. The preliminary results are delivered to the engineering design and management scientific community as an impulse for further research.",Bonvoisin J.; Thomas L.; Mies R.; Gros C.; Stark R.; Samuel K.; Jochem R.; Boujut J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2017-01-01,Université Grenoble Alpes;Technische Universität Berlin,Collaborative design ;  Open innovation ;  Open source design ;  Organisation of product development
Experiences of product engineering conceptual design with patent drafting,This paper reports an education experience on product engineering conceptual design and its relation to patent drafting conducted in a technical university. Students have been required to draft patents since the 1993/94 academic year. The experience shows that drafting a patent is a good help to improve product designs and also to obtain new alternative solutions. This teaching system is contrasted upon completion of courses with anonymous student opinion polls. This long research work has resulted in a Product Engineering course in product innovation through a structured process in order to obtain a patentable Conceptual Design and to draft a patent. The present paper summarises this process. A case study of an old patent shows several items that serve to improve the design and are frequently repeated in every new patent draft. Several patent applications were made with students. The Conclusions section provides a list of characteristics that improve this general process of conceptual design when including the drafting of a patent.,Lloveras J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2017-01-01,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Conceptual engineering design ;  Creativity ;  Design education ;  Early design phases ;  Patents

The scholarly potential of Russia's academic milieu: A comparative analysis of the current degree of academic staff involvement in innovation activity,"The currently observed decline in the efficiency of research-and-development and innovation activity in Russian universities may further aggravate the economic stagnation in the country. This negative trend could be overcome through the development and implementation of effective ways to interact within research universities based on unlocking as much of the scholarly potential of academic staff as possible. Through the example of several Russian universities, the authors demonstrate some of the discrepancies typical of the present-day research academic environment and identify some of the key factors involved in contributing to the effective use of the scholarly potential of academic staff in today's innovationoriented economy. The author's methodology is intended to help adjust the mechanism underlying self-actualization in research activity with a view to unlocking as much of the scholarly potential of academic staff as possible, stimulating research activity, and implementing all kinds of measures and techniques to facilitate the self-actualization of scientists in research activity regardless of the college's field of focus. The inferences drawn from this study are intended to help adjust and further develop innovation-related policy in present-day Russian universities. The author compared the expectations of academic staff (AS) from self-actualization across the hierarchy of positions.

Proposing a new product creativity assessment tool and a novel methodology to investigate the effects of different types of product functionality on the underlying structure of factor analysis,"The aim of study is to indicate a gap in creativity research arising from products with dissimilar capabilities requiring independent creativity indicators that are empirically formed according to their functionality. Initially, a hypothesis for a criterion-based tool comprising 9 criteria and 40 indicators is put forward for assessing functional products. Then, a novel experimental approach is presented to indicate this variation. The first experiment uses the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) to measure the product creativity as well as the relationship between creativity and the criteria proposed. Then, EFA is considered to extract the irrelevant items and provide the optimum underlying structures for the factors used in each assessment. The validity of the models will then be investigated using the comparison of the goodness of fit indices between the estimated factor loadings calculated by CFA measurement and the empirical data collected from the second study. It is anticipated that the findings of this experiment will result in three dissimilar tools, where each comprised of specific indicators that appropriately established with respect to various product functionality.",Hazeri K.; Childs P.; Cropley D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2017-01-01,University of South Australia;Imperial College London,Creativity ;  Evaluation ;  Innovation ;  Research methodologies and methods
Rise and fall of platforms: Systematic analysis of platform dynamics thanks to axiomatic design,"While platforms are multiplying across industries, the laws governing their dynamic are still poorly understood. The high diversity of disciplines covering the topic, spanning from strategy management to engineering design, made it difficult for any new model to integrate the numerous phenomena at stakes. In a new effort to bring them together, we exhibit Suh's Axiomatic Design as an ideal framework to systematically analyse platforms dynamics when market and technology forces meet and interact. Exporting the current description of platforms from Design Structure Matrices to Design Matrices, our research enables us to systematically explore platforms potential evolutions. While the model leads us to rediscover classical behaviours, it also uncovers new results, such as situations of split leadership and platform overthrow, in which complementors challenge the platform leader. Both can be linked to two necessary conditions: functional generativity and technical genericity. We then identify those behaviours in several cases.",Legrand J.; Thomas M.; Le Masson P.; Weil B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2017-01-01,Mines Paris - PSL,Design engineering ;  Design theory ;  Innovation ;  Market implications ;  Platform strategies
Elements to the development of a creativity technique,"Understood as a skill, and present at different levels in the human being, creativity can be developed spontaneously and not spontaneously. Spontaneously from the interaction between endogenous and exogenous factors. And already in its induced form, through creative techniques that aim to generate ideas to solve problems through the systematization of the creative process. The article aims to point out elements to the development of a creativity technique. To accomplish this goal, a literature review was carried out. After the analysis of the articles and with the use of affinity diagrams, fourteen elements were obtained that should be considered in the elaboration of a creativity technique. The elements identified were: Time, colors, multidisciplinarity, collaborative work, playfulness, creative profiles, positive humor, intrinsic motivation, convergent and divergent thinking, incubation, nonverbal language, qualification of ideas, intergroup competition and size of groups.

Heterogeneous engineering: Essential bridge implementing creative design,"This paper connects design creativity to engineering activities as means for smooth implementation of creative concepts. It applies C-K design theory and the IDER-innovation model as lenses to investigate three case studies. The results point to engineering activities as operators to transform the undecidable concepts in the C-space to objects with a logical status in the K-space. Engineering (E) knowledge as validated objects in the K-space supports the transformation process. If existing E-knowledge is sufficient, then this resembles single loop learning. If concepts in the C-space are too different from earlier concepts, then new E-knowledge needs to be developed which resembles double loop learning. The research for developing new E-knowledge unfolds in a similar fashion. Tentative theoretical insights in the C-space are 'engineered' by validated research methods from the K-space. Further research needs to address the complexity of real-life socio-interactive situations. The paper shows that the engineering act in a heterogeneous manner is at least of equal importance for innovation as the creative design act.",Smulders F.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2017-01-01,Delft University of Technology,Creativity ;  Design methodology ;  Engineering ;  Implementation ;  Innovation

Design finds a way: Creative strategies to cope with barriers to creativity,"Creativity is quintessential in design ideation, as it fuels innovation in an ever-changing world. However, designers often experience states of being stuck and fixated, either on their own solutions, on examples or on the design process. A think-Aloud protocol study and interviews were conducted with 31 novice designers in order to capture their strategies to cope with fixation and other types of hindrances to creativity. The findings corroborate past research on design fixation, adding a qualitative perspective to the existing growing body of knowledge on this topic. Furthermore, the study reveals the opportunistic and sometimes unexpected strategies designers apply in order to continue ideation. This paper contributes to the understanding of the opportunistic behaviour of designers in ideation and has implications for the study of design fixation and other barriers to creativity at the methodological level.",Gonçalves M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2017-01-01,Delft University of Technology,Creativity ;  Design fixation ;  Design methods ;  Early design phases ;  Opportunism

"Categorizing user pains, usage situations and existing solutions in front end of innovation: The case of smart lighting project","Companies make substantial R&D investments in early design stages to develop radically innovative products. However, despite abundant research work in the field of human-centered design, the front end of innovation is the least well-structured part of the innovation process. Radical Innovation Design (RID) methodology has put forward a structured process aiming at exploring, organizing and categorizing required knowledge to design a useful problem in the form of value buckets (i.e. overlooked problems of users) to be evaluated. In this paper, we aim at reinforcing the knowledge acquirement process in parallel with the problem design process to fine-tune the firm's R&D strategies, and to increase the likelihood of successfully reaching the mainstream markets.The contributions of this paper are twofold: i) to provide a set of knowledge acquisition rules in front end of innovation; and ii) to specify a set of problem design guidelines mainly by introducing a tool called Dependency Structure Modeling (DSM)-Value bucket algorithm, which enables a systematic identification of value creation opportunities.

A structural equation model for international market selection of Chinese construction enterprises,"Chinese construction enterprises (CCE) play a significant role in the international engineering contract markets. With the advance of The Belt and Road initiative, they are expected to expand to more countries. International market choice (IMC)is the first key decision-making contractors facing as they enter the international market. It is necessary to carry out a comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis of the factors that affect IMC decision. Based on existing researches, factors impact on IMC of CCE are classified into four categories: Attractiveness of target market, link between host country and China, distance from host country to China and strength of the company. Assumptions are proposed according to the theoretical analysis and the structural equation model (SEM) of IMS for CCE is established. Using the AMOS software, we measure the four unobservable factor categories (latent variables) through several observable variables, estimate their effects on explanatory variables in a structural model and analyze whether the effects are consistent with the hypothesis. SEM can be used to analyze the effect of factor system comprehensively, and the application of SEM in the empirical study of international engineering market selection is an application innovation.",Li L.; Chen C.,Conference Proceeding,"Conference Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Project Management, ISPM 2017",2017-01-01,Business School of Sichuan University;CQUPT,AMOS. ;  Chinese construction enterprises (CCE) ;  International engineering contract ;  International market selection (IMS) ;  Structural equation model (SEM)

The Australian South West Hub Project: Developing a Storage Project in Unconventional Geology,"The South West Hub project, through three generations of modelling based on new 2D and 3D seismic data and core/log information from four new wells is demonstrating that carbon dioxide storage is possible in an environment where there is no regional shale layer acting as a traditional seal. This paper summarises the work that has been undertaken in a collaborative manner into ""unconventional geology"" exploring migration assisted trapping in an on-shore saline aquifer by Government, private sector contractors and researchers in the south west of Western Australia. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), which involves capturing carbon dioxide that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere and injecting it to be stored in deep geological formations, is a potential stepping stone to maintaining energy security while reducing the carbon footprint of Australia's energy sources. CCS is the only technology available to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions while still using the fossil fuels that power much of today's energy infrastructure. At a State level, the Western Australian Greenhouse Strategy incorporates CCS and is helping to address the need for a long-term commitment to climate change and cleaner energy. The Western Australia Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) started investigating the Lesueur site, near large CO2 emission sources (the industrial centres of Kwinana and Collie in the South West of Western Australia) in 2007 and developed the South West Hub (SW Hub) project concept in 2010 with the support of local industrial partners. The project was designated an ""Australian Flagship"" project in 2011 and has received substantial funding and support from the Federal Government, through the Department of Industry Innovation and Science) the Western Australia State Government and industry. The SW Hub Project is progressing data acquisition and analysis aimed at establishing confidence in storage associated with migration assisted trapping (MAT) in unconfined saline aquifers. The storage complex has no regional shale layer and consists of the Lower Lesueur (Wonnerup Member) as the injection reservoir, the Upper Lesueur (Yalgorup Member) with its numerous paleosol baffles as the lower confining layer and the basal shale part of the Eneabba Formation as the upper confining layer. The injection reservoir is a heterogeneous sandstone that is over 1500 m thick with varying permeability layers that should support residual and solubility trapping. From the very onset, the SW Hub Project has followed a rigorous stage gated decision making program. The project has been divided into phases and each phase involves targeted data acquisition plans to address technical gaps or uncertainties. These uncertainties have been documented in an Uncertainty Management Plan (UMP) and drive all technical work. ""Decision Gates"" ensure that, only on increased confidence of success would the project move to the next phase. The project processes are consistent with the DNV CO2QUALSTORE steps and the workflows defined in the EU Directive 2009/31/EC guidance document. Under the first phase of the new data acquisition program (2011-12), new geological data was gathered through 100 km of targeted 2D seismic lines and one deep exploration well drilled to 2,945 metres. Multiple modelling scenarios with differing assumptions on the geological properties supported the storage concept and identified no ""show stoppers"". Notwithstanding, uncertainty planning required additional data to address the gaps identified. Under the next phase of the development program (2013-15), 3D seismic was acquired over 115 km2 and additional wells planned. The area of interest is dominated by farming activity and not all landowners provided consent to acquire the seismic data. As such, while high fold data has been acquired over the deeper Wonnerup Member reservoir sections, the shallower Yalgorup Member was not as well illuminated. The drilling strategy was adapted to maximise geological coverage particularly across the shallower reservoirs. Three wells were drilled using a combination of mineral and water well drilling rigs with a deeper well to be considered following model updates. Significant technical work has also been done to support this development through a range of research projects launched under the auspices of the Australian National Low Emissions Coal research and development program (ANLEC R&D). These projects are focused on reservoir characterisation and either consider more fundamental physics based questions or delve significantly deeper into specific geology and geophysics domains using laboratory and modelling efforts. Clear decision criteria to support additional investment in a drilling and testing program have been defined and will be addressed by modelling. The paper will explain the project challenges and the decision making rationale, highlighting the importance of good processes, long term planning, and extensive stakeholder management supported by a robust technical program. Results to date support MAT and validation of the SW Hub storage concept will substantially increase the number of geologic sites that can be considered for safe storage around the world. There is significant international interest in the project field and research activities.",Sharma S.; Van Gent D.; Burke M.; Stelfox L.,Conference Proceeding,Energy Procedia,2017-01-01,Carbon Projects Pty Ltd;Western Australia Department of Mines and Petroleum;Health Department of Western Australia,CCS ;  CO 2 ;  Community ;  Geosequestration ;  Legislation ;  Lesueur ;  Policy ;  Regulation ;  South West Hub ;  SWH ;  Wonnerup ;  Yalgorup

However, often OSS projects retain several different (or missing) licenses for the various components and files, which raise risks of violations and potential legal issues, if not correctly managed. This makes necessary to understand the characteristics and implications of licensing and their relation to the adopter's goals. In this paper we report the use of risk assessment techniques to make inference about license risk exposure associated with each business goal. We rely on existing knowledge, gathered from domain experts, and map it onto formal models that can be automatically analysed to provide some evidence about relevant license in- formation and related risk. Goals are used to drive the software license selection. We illustrate the approach for the case of a research and innovation action project funded under the H2020 framework.",Kifetew F.; Morandini M.; Munante D.; Perini A.; Siena A.; Susi A.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2017-01-01,Bruno Kessler Foundation;Delta Informatica SpA,Open source ;  Risk analysis ;  Software licenses
The new Brazilian automotive policy and its impact on the competitiveness of multinational automobile and auto parts manufacturers,"To enhance the competitiveness of the Brazilian automotive industry, the government approved a new automotive policy in October 2012. It is called the Inovar-Auto program and will be implemented over the course of five years from 2013 to 2017. This program encourages automakers and their suppliers to produce more efficient, technologically advanced vehicles and auto parts by investing in R&D and engineering. The objective of this paper is to determine whether the Inovar-Auto program will effectively improve the competitiveness of the Brazilian automotive industry. In this sense, the impact of each Inovar-Auto requirement in relation to the Porter's diamond model and flowchart approach model was investigated. Although the Inovar-Auto program represents an advance over previous industrial policies, particularly in relation to aspects concerning improvement in energy efficiency, encouraging innovation, increased local content, the traceability of auto-parts and supplier development policy, the result of this research indicates that its implementation has not been stimulating a substantial evolution on the competitiveness of the Brazilian automotive industry.",Pascoal E.; Delamaro M.; Ibusuki U.; Tsukada O.; Rocha H.,Journal,International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management,2017-01-01,"Kagawa University;Waseda University;Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho"";Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro",Brazil ;  Competitiveness ;  Flowchart approach model ;  New Brazilian automotive policy ;  Porter's diamond model

Towards reasoning about pivoting in startups with i-Star,"Software start-ups have embedded themselves in the economic zeit-geist as drivers of innovation and growth. 'Unicorns', such as Facebook, Uber, Pinterest, Dropbox, and Palantir, have ably demonstrated the market disrupting and industry transforming potential of upstarts that 'punch above their weight class'. These successful businesses began as start-ups and matured into enter-prises with multi-billion dollar valuations even though most start-ups fail or are abandoned within a few years of founding. A notable reason for the failure or abandonment of many start-ups is erroneous logic and faulty assumptions un-derpinning their products, business models, and engines of growth. The lean start-up approach encourages decision makers to test their fundamental hypoth-eses and effect strategic pivots to identify new and superior fundamental hy-potheses. This paper outlines exploratory research into the modeling of strategic pivoting using i∗. It discusses the key concepts that are relevant for developing a framework for analyzing strategic pivoting in a structured and systematic manner using i∗. Such a framework can support decision-makers in start-ups to test the fundamental hypotheses underlying their products, business models, and engines of growth.",Pant V.; Yu E.; Tai A.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2017-01-01,University of Toronto,Design ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Modeling ;  Review ;  Startup

An optoelectric professional's training model based on Unity of Knowing and Doing theory,"The ""Unity of Knowing and Doing"" (UKD) theory is proposed by an ancient Chinese philosopher, Wang Shouren, in 1508, which explains how to unify knowledge and practice. Different from the Chinese traditional UKD theory, the international higher education usually treats knowledge and practice as independent, and puts more emphasis on knowledge. Oriented from the UKD theory, the College of Opto-electric Science and Engineering (COESE) at National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) explores a novel training model in cultivating opto-electric professionals from the aspects of classroom teaching, practice experiment, system experiment, design experiment, research experiment and innovation experiment (CPSDRI). This model aims at promoting the unity of knowledge and practice, takes how to improve the students' capability as the main concern and tries to enhance the progress from cognition to professional action competence. It contains two hierarchies: cognition (CPS) and action competence (DRI). In the cognition hierarchy, students will focus on learning and mastering the professional knowledge of optics, opto-electric technology, laser, computer, electronics and machine through classroom teaching, practice experiment and system experiment (CPS). Great attention will be paid to case teaching, which links knowledge with practice. In the action competence hierarchy, emphasis will be placed on promoting students' capability of using knowledge to solve practical problems through design experiment, research experiment and innovation experiment (DRI). In this model, knowledge is divided into different modules and capability is cultivated on different levels. It combines classroom teaching and experimental teaching in a synergetic way and unifies cognition and practice, which is a valuable reference to the opto-electric undergraduate professionals' cultivation.",Qin S.; Wu W.; Zheng J.; Wang X.; Zhao Y.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2017-01-01,National University of Defense Technology China,Competence ;  Experiment ;  Knowledge ;  Opto-electric professionals ;  Training model ;  UKD theory

Forest road network and transportation engineering - state and perspectives,"The paper reviews traditional and computer-assisted road network layout approaches and brings them together in an overall stream of development. It results in the main finding that changes in the representation of the road network layout problem triggered major scientific advancements. A systematic, 2D transport geometry representation emerged in the 1870s and led to the mathematical derivation of optimal road spacing. The representation of road network and harvest layout problem as a mathematical graph and the solution of the corresponding linear programming problem, triggered a representational shift in the early 1970s. The broad availability of digital elevation models DEMs at the beginning of the 1990s was another representational innovation, enabling an automatic road route layout on the terrain DEM surface. The most recent shift consisted of systems to semi-automatically, concurrently laying out harvest/transport-network problems on DEMs in the mid-1990s. The review identifies challenges for future research, among which the extension of the concurrent harvest/road-network layout systems for multi-objective functions is the first importance. Considering that scientific advancement is mostly going along with changes in problem representations, research should explore improved representations for lattice type terrain representation, among which triangular irregular network (TIN) meshes seem to be the first interest. Additional paths for improvements are the integration of road network planning with detailed road engineering, the refinement of optimization problems formulations, and the cross-national adaptation of road network planning courses to operations-research-based approaches.",Heinimann H.,Journal,Croatian Journal of Forest Engineering,2017-01-01,Singapore-​ETH Centre,Computer-assisted network layout ;  Network layout ;  Road density ;  Road network ;  Road spacing

The effect of technology innovation on mobile communication and mobile products,"Purpose - In order to understand the influence of technology innovation on market demand diffusion in the ICT service market, the purpose of this paper is to examine technology innovation in the mobile product market, which keeps a complementary relationship with the mobile communication market. Design/methodology/approach - This study collected mobile communication user information of four leading countries in the ICT market - the USA, the UK, Korea, and Japan from 1981 to 2014. This study applies the Bass diffusion model to analyze the form of market demand diffusion and conducts white noise test to verify the hypotheses. Findings - Technology innovation of mobile communication leads to an increase in innovation effect and a decrease in imitation effect. Thus, technology innovation of mobile communication needs to be promoted continuously for the purpose of increasing adopters in the early stage. Besides, mobile product's technology innovation leads to an increase in imitation effect and a decrease in innovation effect, because individuals were aware of the usefulness of the products and services. Hence, the increase in the number of imitators caused a higher increase in imitation effect than in the mobile communication's innovation effect. Originality/value - Based on the results of this study, the role that product and service technology innovation plays in renewing the form of market demand diffusion in the ICT service market was defined. Also, since the strategies and plans to acquire competitive advantage of business were understood, it may help both companies and policy decision makers.",Lee E.,Journal,Industrial Management and Data Systems,2017-01-01,Sogang Business School;Big Data Service Department - Data Streams,Bass diffusion model ;  Complement goods ;  Mobile communication ;  Mobile product ;  Technology innovation

An empirical study on design-based vs. traditional approaches in capstone courses in engineering education,"This study focuses on the two main design approaches applied to the guidance of student product development during capstone design courses through a comparison of two major approaches: traditional design process (TDP) and design thinking (DT). The objective of this paper is to discuss the impact of these design approaches on student activities, outcomes, and learning. Our research, conducted over three years, compared two courses offered at the same university, one applying TDP and the other DT. The research method consisted of three phases: (1) a comparison of the course structures and materials; (2) an analysis of deliverables from 50 design projects developed by 274 students, which was based on documentation and prototypes; and (3) a quantitative survey of the students. Results show that the DT-based course characteristics, suchasextended time dedicated to prototy pingcycles, limit ed the possibility of addressing some of the TDP methods (e.g. Quality Function Deployment) in the course time frame shared by the two approaches. Results also suggest that, despite the shortcomings related to documentation, the DT-based course led to more innovative prototypes when comparedto the TDP-based course. It was also notable that the DT course led to increased student self-efficacy in terms of innovation and increased technical knowledge. The results of this study are applicable for supporting the selection of design approaches and the definition of course activities in capstone design project courses.",Zancul E.; Dos S Durão L.; De Deus Lopes R.; Nakano D.; Blikstein P.; Majzoub G.; Dalmon D.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2017-01-01,Stanford Graduate School of Education;Universidade de São Paulo,Capstone design course ;  Design thinking ;  Engineering design education ;  New product development process

The contradiction matrix in TRIZ theory serves as the patent knowledge extraction framework, while SQL Server 2000 database management system is employed to manage the extracted patent knowledge, TRIZ and user account information. Visual C++ 6.0 is adopted as the development tool. Findings: The developed system to manage construction patent knowledge integrates TRIZ with the database design, enabling the system users to be more problem-focused, systematic and efficient. The system provides a heuristic environment to help improve the innovation effectiveness by motivating knowledge workers’ innovative thinking. Further development of the system is proposed in the context of the age of big data. Originality/value: A new TRIZ-based patent knowledge management system for construction technology innovation was developed.",Ding Z.; Jiang S.; Ng F.; Zhu M.,Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2017-01-01,The University of Hong Kong;Shenzhen University,Construction patents ;  Database ;  Knowledge management ;  Technology innovation ;  TRIZ
Towards an efficient indoor navigation system: a near field communication approach,"Purpose: This research aims to focus on providing interventions to alleviate usability challenges to strengthen the overall accuracy and the navigation effectiveness in indoor and stringent environments through the experiential manipulation of technical attributes of the positioning and navigation system. Design/methodology/approach: The study followed a quantitative and experimental method of empirical enquiry and software engineering and synthesis research methods. The study further entails three implementation processes, namely, map generation, positioning framework and navigation service using a prototype mobile navigation application that uses the near field communication (NFC) technology. Findings: The approach and findings revealed that the capability of NFC in leveraging its low-cost infrastructure of passive tags, its availability in mobile devices and the ubiquity of the mobile device provided a cost-effective solution with impressive accuracy and usability. The positioning accuracy achieved was less than 9 cm. The usability improved from 44 to 96 per cent based on feedbacks given by respondents who tested the application in an indoor environment. These showed that NFC is a viable alternative to resolve the challenges identified in previous solutions and technologies. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation of the navigation application was that there is no real-time update of user position. This can be investigated and extended further by using NFC in a hybrid make-up with WLAN, radio-frequency identification (RFID) or Bluetooth as a cost-effective solution for real-time indoor positioning because of their coverage and existing infrastructures. The hybrid positioning model, which merges two or more techniques or technologies, is becoming more popular and will improve its accuracy, robustness and usability. In addition, it will balance complexity, compensate for the limitations in the technologies and achieve real-time mobile indoor navigation. Although the presence of WLAN, RFID and Bluetooth technologies are likely to result in system complexity and high cost, NFC will reduce the system’s complexity and balance the trade-off. Practical implications: Whilst limitations in existing indoor navigation technologies meant putting up with poor signal and poor communication capabilities, outcomes of the NFC framework will offer valuable insight. It presents new possibilities on how to overcome signal quality limitations at improved turn-around time in constrained indoor spaces. Social implications: The innovations have a direct positive social impact in that it will offer new solutions to mobile communications in the previously impossible terrains such as underground platforms and densely covered spaces. With the ability to operate mobile applications without signal inhibitions, the quality of communication – and ultimately, life opportunities – are enhanced. Originality/value: While navigating, users face several challenges, such as infrastructure complexity, high-cost solution, inaccuracy and usability. Hence, as a contribution, this paper presents a symbolic map and path architecture of a floor of the test-bed building that was uploaded to OpenStreetMap. Furthermore, the implementation of the RFID and the NFC architectures produced new insight on how to redress the limitations in challenged spaces. In addition, a prototype mobile indoor navigation application was developed and implemented, offering novel solution to the practical problems inhibiting navigation in indoor challenged spaces – a practical contribution to the community of practice.",Sakpere W.; Mlitwa N.; Oshin M.,Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2017-01-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;University of Zululand;University of Cape Town;Sheridan College,Indoor navigation ;  Indoor positioning ;  Near field communication (NFC) ;  NFC tag ;  Radio-frequency identification (RFID) ;  Wayfinding
Development of industrial-innovative clusters in Russia,"An important feature of the cluster is a factor of innovation orientation. Clusters usually form where there is ongoing or anticipated ""breakthrough"" progress in the field of engineering and technology, production and subsequent entering new market niches. In this regard, many countries in the economically developed and just starting to form a market economy - are increasingly using the cluster approach to support the most promising directions and forms of entrepreneurial activity in the formation and regulation of their innovation systems. In most cases, the industries included in the clusters are grouped based on the extent of intersectoral flows of products and knowledge, and include: technology flows due to the purchase of products and intermediate goods in other industries, as well as the interaction between their producers and users; technical cooperation, as expressed in patenting, development of patents, the use of scientific results in several related industries, as well as in joint research projects; staff mobility between the segments of the cluster to disseminate the best achievements control.",Litvinenko I.; Kireev S.; Panichkina M.; Shichiyakh R.; Tikhomirov E.,Journal,International Journal of Applied Business and Economic Research,2017-01-01,Moscow State University of Humanities and Economics;National Research Nuclear University MEPhI;Bauman Moscow State Technical University;Southern Federal University;Kuban State Agrarian University,Cluster ;  Concentration of resources ;  Industrial innovation cluster ;  Regional infrastructure

Resource scarcity in SMEs: effects on incremental and radical innovations,"Purpose: This study deals with the impact of resource scarcity on the innovation performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The purpose of this paper is to scrutinise whether resource scarcity among SMEs has an effect on their innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: The sample was based on panel data for 302 SMEs from the mechanical and electrical engineering sectors. Firms were divided into four groups by resource scarcity: human resource scarcity, financial resource scarcity, both types of resource scarcity and no resource scarcity. To test for significant inter-group differences in innovation performance, multivariate analysis of covariance and a multiple discriminant function analysis were carried out. Findings: The results indicated that resource scarcity can have a positive effect on incremental but not radical innovation performance in SMEs. However, the authors found this to be true for financial resource scarcity only. Research limitations/implications: These results may not be applicable to all SMEs, as the authors only focused on the industries of mechanical and electrical engineering. Future studies should focus on analysing the internal structures of SMEs that led to this study’s results. More research should also be conducted on ways that resource-limited SMEs can appropriately conduct radical innovations. Finally, resources should be made available for both practitioners and academics, explaining why the acquisition of resources is not always be the best option in response to limited resources. Practical implications: These results indicate that resource-constrained SMEs, especially those that struggle with limited finances, should concentrate their innovation activities on incremental rather than radical innovations. Originality/value: This study closes the knowledge gap as to whether it is beneficial for resource-limited SMEs to focus on either incremental or radical innovation. From the theoretical viewpoint, the resource-based view provides two strategies for resource-limited SMEs: acquiring new resources or recombining available resources. The authors were able to clearly demonstrate for the first time that the recombination of resources is especially important for SMEs that specifically wish to pursue incremental innovation.",Woschke T.; Haase H.; Kratzer J.,Journal,Management Research Review,2017-01-01,Fachhochschule Jena;Technische Universität Berlin,Incremental innovations ;  Radical innovations ;  Resource scarcity ;  Resources ;  SMEs
Scanning and design thinking: organizational roles for innovation,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to first suggest scanning focal areas in new product development (NPD) by comparing with design thinking and, second, to uncover what people in different occupations expect of NPD based on future scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: Authors place scanning and design thinking into a matrix of product-market strategies. In addition, this study adopts several open-end-type questionnaire surveys of employees at Japanese companies who have taken part in idea generation workshops that take a medium- to long-term perspective. Findings: Authors found that innovations generated through scanning can cover the most difficult and uncertain areas in practice compared with design thinking. This manuscript also reveals occupational categories can be divided into two groups according to different expectations of NPD: the rapid-fire NPD expectation group and late-bloomer NPD expectation group. The former group which consists of marketing and engineering experts tends to expect that NPD is simply a response to existing needs and that profit will be gained expeditiously through NPD, while the latter, which comprising design and research experts, tends to expect that NPD will realize future innovations. Originality/value: This study shows some common and different points between scanning and design thinking by using a theoretical framework of product-market strategies. Also, this study reveals who will lead innovation based on foresight in business.",Furue N.; Washida Y.,Journal,Foresight,2017-01-01,Hitotsubashi University,Design thinking ;  Foresight ;  Future innovation management ;  New product development ;  Occupations ;  Scanning

Review&Forecast: Resilience through research: Innovations for tackling coastal risk,"The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) Vicksburg, Mississippi, has grown tremendously in the field of research and development in different fields. With seven laboratories and field offices across the United States and abroad, ERDC is tasked with a combination of military and civil works missions that cover diverse fields of engineering and science that require a unique combination of expertise. A key tool ERDC is developing to serve the increasingly large amount of data available to help planners, engineers and coastal communities evaluate risk is the Coastal Hazard System. The Coastal Hazard System serves as a nationwide archival and mining system for coastal storm hazard data. It stores comprehensive, high-fidelity, storm-response computer modeling results including winds, waves, surge, total water levels and currents as well as field measurements of these quantities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) recently completed the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study, an extensive two-year study to address coastal storm and flood risk to vulnerable populations, property, ecosystems and infrastructure affected by Hurricane Sandy in the North Atlantic region. To solve the complex problem of modeling and measuring the costs and benefits of protecting existing infrastructure against erosion, inundation and wave attack damages, researchers at ERDC's Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory and the U.S. Army Engineer Institute for Water Resources developed the combined engineering and economic model Beach-fx. Also developed at ERDC's Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory is the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CSTORM), a comprehensive system of models used to simulate coastal storms to accurately assess risk to coastal communities.",Smith J.,Trade Journal,Sea Technology,2017-01-01,U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center,
So Much Data; So Little Value: A multi-case study on improving the impact of data-driven development practices,"The amount of customer and product data that is collected by companies across domains is exploding. Today, connected software-intensive products permeate virtually every aspect of our lives and the actions we take generate data revealing what products we use, when we use them and how we use them. Still, companies struggle with extracting value from the data they collect, and although data collection and analysis techniques exist the impact of data is low. Typically, insights generated from data influence only smaller feature improvements and optimizations at the team level. However, as soon as decisions concern new product development and innovation at a business level, companies fall back on opinions and internal assumptions on what constitutes customer value. In this paper, and based on case study research in six embedded systems and six Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies, we identify the key challenges that hinder companies in leveraging the impact of data and we present a systematic approach to value modeling that help companies address these challenges.",Olsson H.; Bosch J.,Conference Proceeding,CIbSE 2017 - XX Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering,2017-01-01,Malmö Universitet;Chalmers University of Technology,Customer value ;  Data-driven development ;  Value modeling

Transforming telecommunications service execution,"A recent estimate suggests 60% of global software spend (approximately $50Bn) is on software maintenance. Thirty percent of this is associated with software comprehension dealing with the inherent complexity of software. Other factors include insufficient governance of the software development process and a lack of comprehensive documentation of the final software product. Often the only comprehensive documentation of software, essential to plan new versions and undertake maintenance, is the software source code itself. The latest developments in the software industry are aimed at improving software governance and the automation of documentation creation. One such technology is Software Product Line (SPL). SPL is an innovative software governance and reuse approach. It introduces a robust technique which enables the planning and creation of reusable software units at the start of the software development. It is distinguished from most other software development methodologies by the comprehensive scope of reuse - not just source code but all the types of software assets involved in the development lifecycle, such as user requirements, architectures and test plans. SPL is defined by two development processes, 1) domain engineering and 2) application engineering. Domain engineering creates a reusable software platform whereas application engineering derives different versions of the product from this platform. The reusable software platform consists of different software assets such as requirements models, architectural models, software components, test plans, and test designs. A group of software assets defining a specific capability or functionality are grouped as a feature. Each new software product created by SPL is defined by a unique combination of features. The relationship between features are captured in a feature model which defines the product line. The feature model and the reusable software assets are fed to the application engineering process. Here, different features are selected to determine which software assets will be included and configured in a new product. The output of this process is a collection of configured software assets, typically a new (version of) product or software, ready to be deployed. Many organisations are using SPL to achieve extraordinary gains in productivity, time-to-market, and product quality. A good application area of the use of SPL in the telecommunications industry is in Network Function Virtualisation (NFV). NFV aims to address cost reduction and flexibility in network operations - network functions are implemented as software running over a virtualised infrastructure and provisioned on a service-by-service basis. NFV can benefit from SPL by adopting a systematic method for customising network services to accommodate diverse requirements. Not only does this enable the proper planning of NFV platform software artefacts, but it also enables a robust customisation of the chain of service functions that can adapt rapidly to situations, such as fluctuations in the network execution environment, and service failures. The challenges of SPL methodology include managing the variability information; lack of suitable tools to fully support the methodology; legacy systems where knowledge of the architecture and software components is not available. To address this, BT and Etisalat commissioned research by EBTIC (an ICT research and innovation centre established by Etisalat, BT, and Khalifa University and supported by the United Arab Emirates ICT fund) into the development of the EBTIC-SPL tool. The tool is currently being trialled and has demonstrated the potential for improved software comprehension and governance. As software increasingly underpins the services that telcos deliver, the importance of understanding and applying the best software engineering practices is critically important to service quality, speed of new service delivery and service flexibility. SPL is one of the most important approaches that telcos should be considering.",Alzahmi S.; Shakya S.; Boyd I.,Journal,Journal of the Institute of Telecommunications Professionals,2017-01-01,Khalifa University of Science and Technology,
Innovation and development of gel dressings in bone exposed wound repair,"BACKGROUND: Bone exposed wounds are frequently required to deal with in orthopaedic surgeries, involving the treatment of open fractures, bone tumors, osteomyelitis, and many other diseases, in which the defect of soft tissue caused by open fractures is the most difficult to deal with. Conventional debridement or negative pressure closed drainage technology is difficult to make bone exposed wounds heal, and the process is extremely cumbersome, during which, patients suffer a lot of pain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the various types of dressings, and review the application of new hydrogel dressing in bone exposed wounds based on its advantages, such as keeping wound environment moisture, restoring skin physical barrier, contributing to routine dressing change. METHODS: A computer-based online retrieval of PubMed and CNKI databases was performed to search papers published between 2000 and 2016 using the key words “hydrogel dressing, bone exposed wound, traditional wound dressing, antibiotic” in English and Chinese, respectively. A total of 55 papers suitable for final analysis from the application of traditional and new dressings in bone tissue engineering were reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The treatment of bone exposed wounds involves the treatment of many diseases, such as open fractures, bone tumors, osteomyelitis, which is still an orthopedic problem to solve. The novel hydrogel dressings with unique advantages are able to provide better plans for bone exposed wounds, and the use of these dressings solves the regeneration and repair of exposed bone, and improves the infection of antibiosis.

Research on the form design of mini car in perceptual consumption times,"Except for the basic function to replace walk, current customers also desire mini car can reflect the trends of the time. So it has been an important consideration for enterprises to meet customers’ emotional needs. The research will understand the preference for mini car production among different age groups of consumers in depth by Miryoku engineering theory. Evaluation Grid method provides a way to analyze attractive factors of the products among related researches on Miryoku engineering, which extracts the median original evaluation (customers’ demands), the lower specific reason (product details) and the upper abstract reason (users’ emotions) by deep interviews to experts and thus sorts out the structure network map of the evaluation of the products from respondents. At last, the quantification theory I establishes a functional relationship between the abstract upper emotions and the specific design details in the kansei data, and analyzes the influence weight among the attractive factors. Four attractive factors related to mini car were concluded. Among such attractive factors as “fashionable”, “delicate” and “elegant”, red car color maximally stimulates the consumer’s positive emotions while the thick car body has the greatest negative correlation with the “light” attractive factor. The innovation method proposed by this research can rapidly obtain user’s needs, shorten the overall operation steps and improve the development efficiency.

Technology experience café—enabling technology–driven social innovation for an ageing society,"Effective technology innovation process management in the context of active healthy ageing has the potential to improve older adults’ quality of life, allowing them to maintain their independence and age in their own homes for longer. But as older adults significantly differ from the general population in technology use and its impact on their quality of life, tools are needed that (1) involve this target group into the innovation process, as well as (2) capture the diverse needs of technology for various stakeholders involved in this process. This paper presents the framework called Technology Experience Café (TEC), developed within the European project SIforAGE, answering exactly this need. Detailed information on the methodology and its implementation in five sites, in four different countries across Europe, focusing on participating stakeholders, general design of the TEC, and used evaluation tools, is provided. Preliminary results show, that (1) the target group’s perception of the TEC as a framework was thoroughly positive and TECs had a positive impact on older adults’ technology related attitudes and (2) that stakeholders’ benefits affiliated with their involvement in the TECs are manifold. Implications and limitations are discussed.",Tröger J.; Mariano J.; Marques S.; Mendonça J.; Girenko A.; Alexandersson J.; Stree B.; Lamanna M.; Lorenzatto M.; Pierrelmikkelsen L.; Jørgensen U.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2017-01-01,German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI);Iscte – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa;CEA Grenoble;InvestorNet–Gate2Growth;ASL Città di Torino,Innovation process management ;  Older adults ;  Productive interactions ;  Social innovation ;  Technology acceptance
The rise of hackathon-led innovation in the MENA region: Visualizing spatial and temporal dynamics of time-bounded events,"Hackathons are poised to accelerate technological progress and redefine the technology innovation lifecycle. Time-bounded events have spawned a raw form of creativity that is rarely seen elsewhere in the digital innovation landscape. Efficient monitoring and analysis of data emerging from time-bounded events - and trends in the technology innovation process that emerge from encouraging developers, designers and entrepreneurs to go from the drawing board to a working demo - is of interest to both professional analysts and the general public. This research identifies the distinguishing characteristics of hackathons in the MENA region. It also introduces a visual analytics platform for uniquely identifying the technical, socio-cultural and contextual differences that define hackathon practices and the emerging hacking communities in the MENA region. The benefit of such understanding not only supports the continued growth of such activities in these countries, it also helps to disambiguate hackathon activities from other productive practices for software development, entrepreneurship and computing education.",Almishari S.; Salamah N.; Alwan M.; Alkhalifa N.; Al-Wabil A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2017-01-01,King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology;Massachusetts Institute of Technology,CSCW ;  Hackathon ;  Information visualization ;  Knowledge engineering ;  Software engineering ;  Time-bounded events

Collaboration increase through monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of the collaborative learning process,"Computer supported collaborative learning is a research area that is concerned with collaborative activities that generate learning, through the use of software for interaction between its participants. This area focuses mainly on how people can learn together with the help of computers, being one of the most promising innovations to improve teaching and learning with the help of modern information and communication technologies. In many situations, it has been believed that the availability of the technological infrastructure guarantees an effective collaboration, but for this, it is necessary to go beyond providing a set of class practices, laboratories and the respective technological tools. For there to be collaboration in the execution of an activity is necessary to learn how to do it, not everything is a matter of putting in the same place a group of people, provide them with a software tool and advise them to collaborate. This is why, it is important to define strategies to increase collaboration and it is necessary to analyze some external factors such as group of people, activities and technological infrastructure, besides taking into account the monitoring and evaluation of the learning process by the teacher, who must be in continuous attention that the collaboration is carried out. In this paper shows a project that was carried out through the monitoring of general phases of improvement of software processes, where the collaborative learning process was analyzed, finding some improvement opportunities that were applied and later validated in different case studies. Finally, a strategy was developed to increase collaboration through a set of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of the collaborative learning process that were consolidated into a formal specification. From this research it was concluded that the definition of the different monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of the collaborative learning process is useful and helps to increase the collaboration although its application is moderately complex, for which we analyze some other strategies that can be taken into account for subsequent projects and how they can help in the increase of the collaboration in these processes.",Agredo Delgado V.; Collazos C.; Fardoun H.; Safa N.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2017-01-01,Université Libanaise;Universidad del Cauca;King Abdulaziz University;Corporación Universitaria Comfacauca - Unicomfacauca,Collaborative learning ;  Collaborative process improvement ;  Education ;  Mechanisms ;  Modelling
Usability evaluation plan for online annotation and student clustering system – a tunisian university case,"When students learn in schools, they usually annotate words and concepts that they think important in the text. Sometimes students might overlook some important information while studying and they might not be able to answer questions of quizzes or exams properly. If they can be reminded about the potentially important words and concepts, they may achieve better academic performance. The research team develops an online annotation and student clustering system which not only allows teachers can create online reading activities for students and review students’ annotations on the e-text but also clusters students into different groups based on their annotations via bio-inspired clustering approach.

An enquiry into potential graduate entrepreneurship: Is higher education turning off the pipeline of graduate entrepreneurs?,"Purpose: In today’s global economy, high in talent but low in growth, the capability and skills mismatch between the output of universities and the demands of business has escalated to a worrying extent for graduates. Increasingly, university students are considering alternatives to a lifetime of employment, including their own start-up, and becoming an entrepreneur. The literature indicates a significant disconnect between the role and value of education and healthy enterprising economies, with many less-educated economies growing faster than more knowledgeable ones. Moreover, theory concerning the entrepreneurial pipeline and entrepreneurial ecosystems is applied to graduate entrepreneurial intentions and aspirations. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Using a large-scale online quantitative survey, this study explores graduate “entrepreneurial intention” in the UK and France, taking into consideration personal, social and situational factors. The results point to a number of factors that contribute to entrepreneurial intention including social background, parental occupation, gender, subject of study and nationality. The study furthers the understanding of and contributes to the extant literature on graduate entrepreneurship. It provides an original insight into a topical and contemporary issue, raising a number of research questions for future study. Findings: For too long, students have been educated to be employees, not entrepreneurs. The study points strongly to the fact that today’s students have both willingness and intention to become entrepreneurs. However, the range of pedagogical and curriculum content does not correspond with the ambition of those who wish to develop entrepreneurial skills. There is an urgent need for directors of higher education and pedagogues to rethink their education offer in order to create a generation of entrepreneurs for tomorrow’s business world. The challenge will be to integrate two key considerations: how to create a business idea and how to make it happen practically and theoretically. Clearly, change in the education product will necessitate change in the HE business model. Research limitations/implications: The data set collected was extensive (c3500), with a focus on France and the UK. More business, engineering and technology students completed the survey than others. Further research is being undertaken to look at other countries (and continents) to test the value of extrapolation of findings. Initial results parallel those described in this paper. Practical implications: Some things can be taught, others need nurturing. Entrepreneurship involves a complex set of processes which engender individual development, and are highly personalised. Higher Education Enterprise and Teaching and Learning Strategies need to be cognisant of this, and to develop innovative and appropriate curricula, including assessment, which reflects the importance of the process as much as that of the destination. Social implications: The global economy, propelled by the push and pull of technology, is changing at a speed never before seen. This is having profound political, social and economic effects which necessitate fundamental change that we organise ourselves and our activities. Current models and modus operandi are proving increasingly unfit for purpose. Nurturing and encouraging agile mindsets, creativity, supporting the testing of new ideas and ways of doing things and adapting/adopting to innovation are all critical future employability factors. Our future prosperity and well-being will be dependent on creating new learning models. Originality/value: This work builds on an extensive literature review coupled with original primary research. The authors originate from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines, and the result is a very challenging set of thoughts, comments and suggestions that are relevant to all higher education institutions, at policy, strategy and operational levels.",Birch C.; Lichy J.; Mulholland G.; Kachour M.,Journal,Journal of Management Development,2017-01-01,University of Greenwich;Abertay University;IDRAC Business School,Educational innovation ;  Employability ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Management strategy ;  Pedagogy
Achieving high renewable energy penetration in Western Australia using data digitisation and machine learning,"The energy industry is undergoing significant disruption. This research outlines that, whilst challenging, this disruption is also an emerging opportunity for electricity utilities. One such opportunity is leveraging the developments in data analytics and machine learning. As the uptake of renewable energy technologies and complimentary control systems increases, electricity grids will likely transform towards dense microgrids with high penetration of renewable generation sources, rich in network and customer data, and linked through intelligent, wireless communications. Data digitisation and analytics has already impacted numerous industries, and its influence on the energy sector is growing, as computational capabilities increase to manage big data, and as machines develop algorithms to solve the energy challenges of the future. The objective of this paper is to address how far the uptake of renewable technologies can go given the constraints of existing grid infrastructure, and provides a qualitative assessment of how higher levels of renewable energy penetration can be facilitated by incorporating even broader technological advances in the fields of data analytics and machine learning. Western Australia is used as a contextualised case-study, given its abundance and diverse renewable resources (solar, wind, biomass, and wave) and isolated networks, making a high penetration of renewables a feasible target for policy makers over coming decades.",Tayal D.,Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2017-01-01,Curtin University,Data ;  Innovation ;  Renewable penetration ;  Solar ;  Storage
"Characterization, Analysis, and Recommendations for Exploiting the Opportunities of Cyber-Physical Systems","Leveraging on a comprehensive analysis of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in Europe, this chapter presents overall findings focusing on (1) a characterization of CPS, (2) opportunities and challenges in representative CPS application domains, and (3) recommendations for action resulting from a cross-domain analysis. The characterization enables a high-level description of a CPS, or classes of CPS, according to their technical emphasis, cross-cutting aspects, level of automation, and life-cycle integration. We illustrate how these characteristics can be used to relate to design issues, systems, and related terms.The recommendations are to: (1) strengthen cross-disciplinary research collaboration, (2) foster CPS education and training, (3) stimulate public-private partnerships for CPS technology experimentation and to ensure dependable information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, (4) promote interoperability of CPS technology, (5) anticipate new business models and support open innovation, (6) ensure trustworthiness including safety and security, and (7) favor human-centered approaches to CPS.",Törngren M.; Asplund F.; Bensalem S.; McDermid J.; Passerone R.; Pfeifer H.; Sangiovanni-Vincentelli A.; Schätz B.,Book,"Cyber-Physical Systems: Foundations, Principles and Applications",2017-01-01,"Fortiss GmbH;Université Grenoble Alpes;University of California, Berkeley;Technische Universität München;University of York;Università di Trento;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)",Automation ;  Cross-domain integration ;  Cyber-physical systems ;  Disruptive innovation ;  Embedded systems ;  Internet of things ;  Life-cycle integration ;  Socio-technical systems ;  Systems of systems ;  Technological paradigm shift
Factors influencing user acceptance of public sector big open data,"In recent years Government departments and public/private organisations are becoming increasingly transparent with their data to establish the whole new paradigm of big open data. Increasing research interest arises from the claimed usability of big open data in improving public sector reforms, facilitating innovation, improving supplier and distribution networks and creating resilient supply chains that help improve the efficiency of public services. Despite the advantages of big open data for supply chain and operations management, there is severe shortage of empirical analyses in this field, especially with regard to its acceptance. To address this gap, in this paper we use an extended technology acceptance model to empirically examine the factors affecting users’ behavioural intentions towards public sector big open data. We outline the importance of our model for operations and supply chain managers, the limitations of the study, and future research directions.",Weerakkody V.; Kapoor K.; Balta M.; Irani Z.; Dwivedi Y.,Journal,Production Planning and Control,2017-01-01,"Faculty of Management, Law and Social Sciences;School of Management;Kent Business School;Brunel University London",Big open data ;  operations ;  public sector ;  supply chains ;  use

Identifying innovative documents: Quo vadis?,"The number of new research documents and patents published each year is steadily increasing. Despite this development, identifying innovative documents in a timely manner has received only little attention in research. Nevertheless, this use case is important for companies that strive to keep up with current innovations in their field. However, since existing solutions do not take context and background of the particular firm or researcher into account, they fall short in supporting the user in his search for suitable documents. In this paper, we describe an industrial case study we conducted within sheet-metal working companies and related research institutes in Germany. We i) report a qualitative study on innovation research, ii) provide a list of features that industrial researchers demanded, and iii) discuss implementation challenges for systems that support interactive retrieval of innovative documents. Based on the initial results, we argue that existing systems fall short to provide an integrated workflow. Overall, we discuss how to implement such a system and the corresponding problems.",Schröter I.; Krüger J.; Ludwig P.; Thiel M.; Nürnberger A.; Leich T.,Conference Proceeding,ICEIS 2017 - Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems,2017-01-01,"Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg;Hochschule Harz, Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften (FH);METOP GmbH",Empirical study ;  Enterprise information system ;  Requirements engineering ;  Survey ;  User questionnaire

"Trust, integrated information technology and new product success","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the combined roles via trust relationships of the two technology cores of the firm: information technology (IT) and R&D and their impact on new product success. Design/methodology/approach: A model was tested whereby trust and the integrated IT strategy account for a significant amount of the variance in a broad range of new product development (NPD) outcomes for a survey sample of 223 manufacturing firms. Respondents said design practices and quality methods like Six Sigma accounted for a total of over 25 percent of the reports of the most helpful approaches in promoting effective NPD. At the same time their biggest challenges were having a clear strategic direction within which to operate and resolving cost and resource issues which accounted for over a third (34 percent) of barriers to success. Findings: Respondents reported that a total of over 25 percent of the reports of the most helpful approaches in promoting effective included these quality methods. At the same time their biggest challenges were having a clear strategic direction within which to operate and resolving cost and resource issues which accounted for over a third (34 percent) of barriers to success. High-tech firms were less likely to report integrated IT strategies, but this tended to be counterbalanced by high levels of trust in the IT function and adoption of organizational innovations for execution of strategic intent. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. Research limitations/implications: Survey methods produce broad results with low response rates in most studies involving R&D and NPD, and this study is no exception. Practical implications: With the challenge of strategy alignment reported by many of these firms, it seems clear that the top management team cannot afford to leave NPD challenges to engineering teams and NPD programs without guidance and general vision. Social implications: NPD has become the staple of most manufacturing firms as a way of meeting and beating the competition worldwide. However, trust between functional areas often starts before people are even employed and should begin in training and educational programs. Originality/value: Designing NPD programs is at the heart of many firms’ competitive strategies and the fast learning companies are the winners. Very little is known about the trust relationship between IT and R&D and their combined effects on new product success which we have found to be significant and unexpected in their impacts.",Ettlie J.; Tucci C.; Gianiodis P.,Journal,European Journal of Innovation Management,2017-01-01,Rochester Institute of Technology;Palumbo-Donahue School of Business;College of Management of Technology,Information technology ;  New product success ;  Organizational innovation ;  Trust

A classification and summarization method for analysis of research activities in an academic faculty,"Nowadays, more and more scientific research activities are carried out in different laboratories and universities, which not only play an important role in the development of science and technology, but also show a significant inference on education. The improvement of the research capability of an academic faculty can directly impact the quality of education, bring innovations to Industrial Engineering curriculum proposals, and guarantee the subjects are up to date. The investigation of the existing issues in the current research activities is usually considered as the primary and challenging step. As the output of research activities, academic articles are often considered as a kind of evidence-based resources for the investigation. Despite some methodological efforts have been made by existing article review methods, less attention has been paid to discover the implicit academic relationships among the academic staffs and to investigate their research expertise. The objective of this study is to address this existing drawback through the proposition of an Academic Information Classification and Summarization method. A case study is carried out in the Industrial and System Engineering Graduate Program (PPGEPS), PUCPR, Brazil. The result not only highlights the advantages that can be obtained from this proposition from the education perspective related to Industrial Engineering, but also can be used as evidence to balance and compare an academic staff's research expertise and his/her teaching disciplines.",Loures E.; Liao Y.; Junior O.,Journal,Production,2017-01-01,Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná,Academic relationship ;  Evidence-based analysis ;  Industrial engineering education ;  Research capability ;  Research expertise

The Grandest Challenge of All: The Role of Environmental Engineering to Achieve Sustainability in the World's Developing Regions,"The environmental engineering discipline has focused much of its historical efforts in developing regions of the world on advancing environmental sustainability through improving provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. However, the skills and expertise that reside within the discipline of environmental engineering are fundamental to achieve a much broader range of sustainable development goals, including those related to health, climate, water, energy, and food security; economic development; and reduction of social inequalities. Accordingly, this article critically reviews several focus areas where environmental engineering should assume a more active presence in the global community that seeks to achieve sustainability in developing regions of the world. The 10 environmental engineering Grand Challenges for the developing world covered are: (1) understand the historical perspective of the discipline's connection with public health as the field transitions forward; (2) integrate the differences encountered when operating over rural to urban locations; (3) address emissions of greenhouse gases and other important carbon-containing pollutants; (4) understand the link between development and health to better connect health outcomes and reduction in risk with ecosystem management and other development interventions; (5) address the complex interactions of water energy systems; (6) integrate the synergy inherent in development/sustainability goals of WASH, food security, and resource recovery; (7) transition to a green economy; (8) advance monitoring, evaluation, and assessment activities that include life cycle assessment, (9) integrate culture, perception, and behavior with advances in science and technology, and (10) educate globally competent engineers.

"Circadian blood pressure pattern in positive drug responsive hypertensives, hypertensives and normotensives, and gender influences.","Circadian rhythm is a characteristic behavior of human physiology and it is known that, in healthy subjects, blood pressure (BP) increases during the day and decreases during the night, as a result of sleep-wake changes. Some studies highlighted that female had lower office BP values than male and this should be considered for define the threshold of hypertension. With the introduction of the Holter Blood Pressure Measurement, it has been possible to record the blood pressure for 24 hours. This innovation allowed to analyze the circadian Blood pressure pattern (CBPP) and some studies identified the differences between normotensives and hypertensives subjects. In this study, we examined the circadian pattern in positive drug responsive hypertensive patients in respect of negative ones and of normotensive subjects and the differences due to gender. The results demonstrated that positive drug responsive hypertensive patients had the same circadian blood pressure pattern as normotensives. Moreover, the difference in circadian blood pressure values between male and female was about 2-4 mmHg.",De Dea F.; Pascazio L.; Guerra M.; Sabbadini G.; Accardo A.,Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2017-01-01,Università degli Studi di Trieste;Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Giuliano Isontina,Ambulatory pressure ;  Circadian rhythm ;  Gender ;  Office pressure ;  Treated hypertensives
The evaluation of medical devices: Are we getting closer to solve the puzzle? a review of recent trends,"Over the last decades, the fast pace of innovation, high profile regulatory failures and updates in the medical devices directives, together with intrinsic or environmental characteristics of the products and industry, have turned the attention to the evaluation of medical devices. Medical devices are recognized to be different from drug technologies, however it is still not entirely clear whether these differences really matter with respect to their evaluation. In the title we ask the question of whether we are getting closer to solve the puzzle of the evaluation of medical devices. Thanks to years of research work, debates, discussion, experimentation and learning from errors, we have certainly made progress and developed a better understanding of what it is needed for a better evaluation of medical technologies. In this manuscript we present innovative approaches and promising trends, from in silico trials to early HTA, parallel submissions and, overall, adaptive pathways to evidence generation that could enable better, safer, and faster regulatory and patient access to devices. In the next future, it will be important to monitor the development and diffusion of these approaches and assess their impact. If the regulatory and HTA evaluation of medical devices is to continue to improve, establishing inter-disciplinary collaborations between clinicians and engineers, policy makers, patients and industry representatives will become key.",Ciani O.; Federici C.; Pecchia L.,Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2017-01-01,University of Exeter Medical School;University of Warwick;Università Bocconi,Adaptive pathways ;  Early dia-logue ;  HTA ;  In silico trials ;  Regulation
Evidence-gathering across industry and academia on early health technology assessment (HTA) of medical devices: Survey design and piloting,"The adoption and reimbursement of a new or novel medical device frequently occurs after an economic evaluation of the innovation. One important factor for reimbursement rejections by the English National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP) appears to be the scarce or no attention to early assessment. This protocol describes a mixed methods research strategy employed to develop and test the quality, validity and consistency of two survey questionnaires aiming to explore the early Health Technology Assessment (HTA) level of adoption, and potential barriers to its adoption, across industry and academia. Qualitative interviews involved two types of key stakeholders: people working in the R&D or market access departments of small and medium enterprises, and academics working in the field of health economics, across England and Italy. We analysed the content of 25 informant interviews, constructed, and piloted two different academia and industry-tailored questionnaires. We then piloted the revised questionnaires with 15 professionals (5 developers and 10 academics) and re-piloted both a month later. To our knowledge, this study is the first to develop and test a survey that investigates the views in academia and in private companies on how conducting early HTA might affect the introduction of new medical devices to the market. Due to few original research papers on early HTA in the published literature and limited application of the guidance for early HTA in reimbursement claims, the incorporation of a more robust analytical framework including a societal perspective is necessary to understand whether early assessment can be effectively embedded into all aspects of the development process.",Manetti S.; Burns R.; Turchetti G.,Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2017-01-01,Sant'Anna Scuola Universitaria Superiore Pisa;University of Oxford Medical Sciences Division,Early HTA ;  Medical device ;  Mixed methodology ;  Stakeholder involvement ;  Survey

Selecting an appropriate alternative for a major infrastructure project with regard to value engineering approach,"Purpose: Road construction projects are one of the strategic industries in each country and their construction and development requires spending huge funds. Regarding the increased demand and resource constraints; a technique which reduces costs by maintaining and improving the functioning is of great importance for the authorities of each country. Value engineering is a comprehensive and coherent means based on innovation and team work which, in addition to maintaining the quality and improving the project function, reduces its cost and is not limited to the design and construction phase; however, it includes exploitation and maintenance as well. This study aims to present a practical model for the implementation and application of value engineering process in a construction project located in a special region (in terms of tourism, positioning in an economic growth path, and the East-West strategic axis of the region). In this regard, after reviewing the advisor's design, considering the interests of the project stakeholders, reviewing design criteria and assessment methods and with the use of value engineering techniques, a new option was presented which led to a significant reduction in costs and time and an increase of quality, safety, and environmental factors. Finally, including initial costs, repair, maintenance, income and expenses, the relative value index of this option, compared to the advisor's option, increased from 0.9 to 3.5. Based on the increased need for development of roads in the country, exploiting this model in similar projects can significantly improve the project value and the effectiveness of investments. Design/methodology/approach: This research project was selected with regard to the extremely high credit of the project and its potential in terms of Value Engineering implementation. In this study, technical and financial information were first collected after forming a value engineering team including a value engineering expert who was responsible for coordinating the work, some representatives of the employer, designer, executor, and budget estimator. In functional analysis phase with the use of FAST graph, advantageous, costly, and risky functions were identified. In the creativity phase, ideas related to selected functions were created and investigated and developed in the evaluation phase. Finally, calculating the value index, two variants with higher value index than the baseline plan, were proposed and implemented. Findings: Since the determining criteria of designing and implementation of road construction projects including increased safety, reduced travel time, user satisfaction, ease of implementation, cost of construction and maintenance and so on are almost similar in most projects, using this study results and implementing its practical framework in other construction projects can be beneficial. These parameters lead to an increase in quality, value, and safety of the project. With regard to done steps and resulted incomes, this essay can be known as a practical and theoretical model to promote the value of crucial projects especially in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: Sanandaj-Hamedan road with the length 176km connects central provinces of Iran. This study is regarding the first part of this route. Based on the specific topography of the region and the existing road limitations, selecting a good variance with all the features of an ideal road from geometric, economic, and safety aspects is a difficult task. Originality/value: Employers and project sponsors are always looking for products with greater value and lower cost; therefore, present a practical model for the implementation and application of value engineering process in a construction project and providing a similar work experience can encourage the use of value engineering techniques and significantly improve the project value and the effectiveness of investments.",Mousakhani E.; Yavarkhani M.; Sohrabi S.,Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2017-01-01,Amirkabir University of Technology;Taaghafrand Company;The Department of Urban and Architecture,Cost of construction ;  Functions analysis ;  Infrastructural projects ;  Road construction ;  Value engineering ;  Value index

The risks of hydraulic fracturing and the responsibilities of engineers,"One third of U.S. natural gas is extracted by injecting fluid at high pressure into shale formations, a process associated with a number of possible hazards and risks that have become the subject of intense public controversy. We develop a three-part schema to make sense of risks of hydraulic fracturing and the responsibilities of engineers: the lab, the field, and the forum. In the lab, researchers seek to answer basic questions about, for example, the behavior of shale under particular conditions; there uncertainty seems to arise at every turn. In the field, engineers and others work to implement technological processes, such as hydraulic fracturing and the subsequent extraction of oil and gas; hazards may arise as natural and social systems respond in sometimes surprising ways. In the forum, the public and their representatives deliberate about risk and acceptable risk, questions that are framed in ethical as well as technical terms. The difficulty of characterizing - and in living up to - the responsibilities of engineers lie in part in the apparent distance between the lab and the forum. We examine in turn uncertainties in the lab, hazards in the field, and deliberation in the forum, leading to the conclusion that scientists and engineers can and should help to inform public deliberation but that their research cannot, on its own, resolve all controversies. Scientists and engineers who seek to inform deliberation should be mindful of the scope and limits of their authority, clear and modest in communicating research findings to the public, and careful to avoid even apparent conflicts of interest wherever possible. We close by drawing from the lab-field-forum schema to suggest a direction for pedagogical innovations aimed at the formation of responsible engineers in the context of college-level degree programs.",Kirkman R.; Arson C.; Stewart L.; Harris R.; Francis A.,Journal,Elementa,2017-01-01,College of Engineering;Georgia Institute of Technology,Acceptable risk ;  Engineering ethics ;  Hydraulic fracturing
Surface water in temporary humanitarian settlements,"In the Humanitarian Innovation Fund Gap Analysis for water, sanitation, and hygiene issues, field staff identified environmental management of surface water as an area of concern, although this was not reflected at a head office level. This difference of perspectives could be an under-reporting of this aspect of environmental sanitation to the global humanitarian community or a failure of experts to communicate the required response to surface water management in camps for displaced people. Reviewing core humanitarian engineering texts and global standards, this paper sets out the current state of the art and shows that there is a lack of clarity on the 'ownership' of the problem and the established responses are disjointed and poorly articulated, especially at field staff level. Since the core texts have been written, there has been a change in the way surface water is being managed in urban areas. Sustainable urban drainage practices may have potential in resource-poor but densely populated situations such as some refugee camps. The paper highlights the lack of adequate advice in both content and delivery mechanisms. More gaps and challenges were identified than solutions, but this research narrowed down the gaps identified in 2013 to more specific issues, which is a step further towards solving the problem.",Reed B.,Journal,Waterlines,2017-01-01,Loughborough University,Drains ;  Humanitarian engineering ;  Surface water

Non-financial factors of performance: The case of mechanical engineering companies in the Czech Republic,"Successful achievement of strategic goals requires an effective performance management system, i.e. determining the appropriate indicators measuring the rate of goal achievement. These indicators are known as key performance indicators or value drivers according to the principles of value-based management. Performance is monitored by both financial and non-financial indicators. In order to gain further insight into the topic, this paper presents the results of research identifying the non-financial factors that affect the performance of mechanical engineering enterprises in the Czech Republic. The data were obtained from a questionnaire survey of the enterprises' senior management. The results of the survey were evaluated on the basis of response rate. The evaluation also included a comparison of the managers' opinions and the performance of their enterprises - measured by return on equity. The results of the analyses show that the factors most detrimental to enterprise performance include the incompetence of responsible employees and the disregard of the customers' requirements. Factors most frequently shown to increase the value of the enterprise are the product quality, product innovation and flexibility in meeting customers' requirements.",Režňáková M.; Karas M.; Strnadová M.,Journal,"Scientific Papers of the University of Pardubice, Series D: Faculty of Economics and Administration",2017-01-01,"Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Management",Financial ratios ;  Mechanical engineering enterprises ;  Performance measurement ;  Value drivers ;  Value-based management
Automatic emotional text annotation using facial expression analysis,"Sentiment analysis calls for large amounts of annotated data, which are usually in short supply and require great efforts in terms of manual annotation. Furthermore, the analysis is often limited to text polarity and writer's emotions are ignored, even if they provide valuable information about writer's feelings that might support a large number of applications, such as open innovation processes. Our research is hence aimed at developing a methodology for the automatic annotation of texts with regard to their emotional aspects, exploiting the correlation between speech and facial expressions in videos. In the present work we describe the main ideas of our proposal, presenting a four-phase methodology and discussing the main issues related to the selection of input frames and the processing of emotions resulting from facial expressions analysis.",Mircoli A.; Cucchiarelli A.; Diamantini C.; Potena D.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2017-01-01,Università Politecnica delle Marche,Automated text annotation ;  Emotion detection ;  Facial expression analysis ;  Sentiment analysis

Proposals for Improving Innovation and Technology Transfer Policies in Romania,"Starting from the interdependence between innovation and technology transfer, as indicators of competitiveness at both micro and macroeconomic levels, this paper aims to highlight a number of ways of optimizing innovation and technology transfer policies in Romania in a European context, which places Romania in the category of modest innovators. The paper is based on the assumption that the need for technology transfer originates from a markets failure, i.e. a significant imbalance between supply and demand for innovation. A smooth technology transfer is likely to correct this market imbalance, while difficulties in achieving technology transfer generates lack of competitiveness, inability to generate added value, especially in the economic sector and the impossibility to achieve the innovative potential, both within SMEs (main sources of innovation in a functional market economy) and institutions which operate in research-development-innovation field.",Caramihai M.; Tǎnase N.; Purcǎrea A.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2017-01-01,University Politehnica of Bucharest;National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation (NASRI),innovation ;  market ;  optimization ;  technology transfer policies
Construction of scientific and technological innovation resources based on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration,"Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei have a wealth of innovative resources and are rich in innovation and technology personnel.

Cloudy with a chance of usage? - Towards a model of cloud computing adoption in German SME,"While Cloud Computing has become an important topic in research and practice in recent years and widely adopted by consumers and companies around the globe, especially German small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are reluctant with the respect to using cloud services. Scientific literature on cloud adoption in German SMEs is still scarce, in particular with respect to the use of PaaS solutions. Therefore, in this paper a research model for the organizational adoption of Cloud Computing and especially PaaS solutions is proposed, which is based on the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Technology, Organization and Environment (TOE) theories. The proposed model is derived from an explorative qualitative empirical study among German SMEs. Within this model, security and privacy concerns and fast broadband internet access have been identified as the most important technological influencing factors for cloud adoption.",Deil R.; Brune P.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2017-01-01,Fachhochschule Neu-Ulm,Adoption ;  Cloud computing ;  Organizations ;  PaaS ;  SME

Finding evidence for effectual application development on digital platforms,"The development of novel software applications on digital platforms differs from traditional software development and provides unique challenges to software development managers and teams. Platform-based applications must achieve application-platform match, application-market match, value propositions exceeding platform’s core value propositions, and novelty. These desired properties support a new vision of the software development team as entrepreneurs with a goal of developing novel applications on digital platforms. In this research study, we look for evidence on an open-source software development project – Apache Cordova – that development teams use effectual thinking. Over one thousand user stories are analyzed for the use of constructs from a proposed effectual software development research model.

"Social Product Development: The Democratization of Design, Manufacture and Innovation","With increasing globalization and 21st century trends such as the personalization and commoditization of technology, product design has become a level playing field for both engineering professionals and members of the maker's communities. Terms associated with this shift in the industry include crowdsourcing, cloud-based design and manufacture, mass collaboration and Open Innovation. While academics have considered the impact of these phenomena individually, there has yet to be a discussion on how these terms work together to influence the process of product development. This paper serves as an introduction to a new area of research that treats these terms as tenants of a multi-faceted term labelled Social Product Development. By considering the relationships and impacts of these modern phenomena as a group for the first time, progress can be made in evolving traditional product development frameworks to take advantage of the tools the 21st century has to offer. In this paper, the authors present an overview of the tenants of Social Product Development and discuss what they actually mean in the context of 21st century product development. Future work is then discussed which considers how an SPD framework could be formed.",Forbes H.; Schaefer D.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2017-01-01,"University of Bath, Department of Mechanical Engineering",Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing (CBDM) ;  Crowdfunding ;  Crowdsourcing ;  Customization by Masses ;  Globalization ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation ;  Makers Community ;  Mass Collaboration ;  Mass Customization ;  Social Product Development (SPD)
Life Cycle Engineering and Management - Fostering the Management-orientation of Life Cycle Engineering Activities,"Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) is a promising approach for directing engineering activities towards sustainability. Although LCE includes not only technical and ecological but also economic target figures, management-orientation is rather limited and issues affecting the success of innovation processes are neglected. This is shown based on a literature review. For contributing towards closing this gap, this paper presents suggestions to foster the market-, customer-, and supply chain-orientation of LCE: its extension by business modeling and integration with Target Costing. Elements of these approaches are illustrated by the research activities of the Cluster of Excellence MERGE.",Götze U.; Peças P.; Schmidt A.; Symmank C.; Henriques E.; Ribeiro I.; Schüller M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2017-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Electronic Nano Systems ENAS;Instituto de Engenharia Mecânica;Technische Universität Chemnitz,Business Modeling ;  Life Cycle Engineering and Management ;  MERGE ;  Target Costing ;  Target Ecology and Cost Management
Assessing self-organization in agile software development teams,"Self-organization, based on the Socio-Technical Design (STS) work design principles, is considered a hallmark of agile software development (SD) teams and an antecedent of motivation and innovation at work. However, while self-organization is considered a salient success factor in agile SD, past research has shown that there are many hurdles in self-organizing. Yet, the actual level of self-organization practiced in agile teams has not been investigated. In this study we develop a measure to do so using the nine principles of STS work design by Cherns [15]. We found that while the level of self-organization varies across agile projects, on each of the nine dimensions the level of self-organization in agile teams was found to be significantly higher than those using plan-driven methods. Furthermore, self-organization was found to positively affect the motivation and innovativeness of SD teams.",Kakar A.,Journal,Journal of Computer Information Systems,2017-01-01,Alabama State University,Agile methods ;  Cherns principles ;  Plan-driven methods ;  Self-organizing teams ;  Socio-technical systems design
The open experiment: An experimental graduate course in electronics communications engineering,"This paper mainly discussed the novel open experiment graduate course in electronic information and engineering. The course is designed to teach postgraduates how to design, test, and simulate some basic experiments related to wireless communication systems and microwave transmission systems using modern instruments and computer-Aided design (CAD) software. One of the objectives of the course is to assist postgraduates to understand the theoretical concepts of wireless systems, parallel DSP, embedded systems, electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic compatibility and optical communication systems through hands-on experiments and to make them more confident both in system design and analysis. The course also aims at increasing the interest of postgraduates in engineering and technology. Therefore, laboratory experiments that are complementary to the materials discussed in the theoretical part of the course are designed specifically to incorporate the use of several common instruments that students probably use extensively in their research fields. Complementing and expanding upon the materials covered in six basic courses is another merit of this laboratorybased course. Meeting the course requirements also helps students improve their oral presentation and report preparation abilities. The laboratory has provided more than 2000 postgraduates during the past ten years with the opportunity to acquire both in-depth theoretical understanding and hands-on experience in this rapidly growing discipline. The evaluation of the course indicates that most of the objectives are achieved.",Congying H.; Zhaowen Y.; Youguang Z.; Donglin S.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2017-01-01,Beihang University,Innovation ;  Laboratory courses ;  Open experiment
The internationalisation of new technology-based firms from emerging markets,"This paper offers an analysis of the factors influencing the accelerated internationalisation of new technology-based firms (NTBFs) from emerging economies. This type of firm is typically called 'born global', and they have been reported primarily in high-tech sectors. Existing international business (IB) theories have focused consistently on NTBFs from developed countries, however NTBFs from emerging markets remain under-studied. A survey was applied to small Brazilian NTBFs. The results indicate that NTBFs that have an entrepreneur, or a group of executives with international management skills, are more likely to have an accelerated internationalisation. In contrast to previous research in the field, the results demonstrate that NTBFs that take more than five years to enter the international market capitalise on their competence for innovation and abilities in international marketing, in the internationalisation process. Therefore, this research contributes new perspectives on studies on NTBFs from emerging markets.",Cahen F.; De Miranda Oliveira M.; Borini F.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2017-01-01,Centro Universitario da FEI;Universidade de São Paulo;ESPM,Born globals ;  Emerging economies ;  Small and medium firms ;  Technology-based firms
The intrinsic-motivation course design method,"Because engineering faculty seldom use research-based instructional strategies, the engineering education community has become increasingly concerned with how to help faculty sustainably integrate education research into their teaching practices. We developed the Intrinsic-Motivation (IM) Course Design Method to make motivation theory accessible to faculty and to help faculty think more concretely about the costs that demotivate them and make their course designs untenable. Our course design method complements existing course design methods by providing an approach to designing for motivational outcomes. In this paper, we describe the IM Course Design Method and then illustrate how this method was used to refine the design of a sophomore-level engineering course that enrolled over 200 students. We then present evaluation evidence from this course to suggest that application of the method can increase students' intrinsic motivation in engineering courses.",Herman G.; Goldberg D.; Trenshaw K.; Somerville M.; Stolk J.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2017-01-01,Franklin W.

Promoting technological innovations: Towards an integration of traditional and social media communication channels,"The aim of this study is to examine how the mechanisms of consumer adoption of technological innovations have been affected by the advent of social media. For this purpose, a list of major adoption determinants is derived from previous research, including theories such as innovation diffusion theory, the technology acceptance model, and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. Findings from empirical research are used to show which adoption determinants can be influenced through firms’ communication efforts and how this can be done. After outlining how social media jumbles the established routines and mechanisms of marketing communications, this article explains how these new circumstances in the social media landscape can assist firms to facilitate innovation adoption. The main contribution of this article is to connect the established research field of technology and innovation adoption with the new and emerging field of social media research.",Wagner T.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2017-01-01,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Diffusion theory ;  Innovation ;  Marketing communications ;  Social media ;  Technological innovation ;  Technology acceptance model ;  UTAUT2
Graduate attributes in an electrical engineering curriculum: A case study,"Industry and accreditation bodies around the world require graduates to be able to demonstrate specific graduate attributes. Universities in this 21st century have responded to that call by embedding graduate attributes into their curricula. However, how can individual academics ensure that they are incorporating and assessing graduate attributes in their respective modules, which form part of the overall curriculum? This research question necessitates reflection as many academics are struggling to come to terms with what many of these graduate attributes really mean or entail. Moreover, a dearth of research publications exists on trying to define and explain these graduate attributes. The purpose of this article is to determine to what extent have the 10 graduate attributes, adopted by the Central University of Technology been embedded into the curriculum of the National Diploma in Electrical Engineering. A qualitative case study was used and data was collected using documentary review. All 36 study guides of the Electrical Engineering qualification were analysed. Results of this study show that 9 out of 10 graduate attributes are spread across the entire curriculum. The four most dominate graduate attributes were found to be Innovation and Problem Solving; Technical and Conceptual Competence; Numeracy, and Technological Literacy. Certain graduate attributes are clearly discerned in the learning outcomes while others are hidden in different teaching and learning activities. A key recommendation of this study is for academics to structure their learning outcomes in a way that addresses the incorporation and assessment of key graduate attributes required.",Meda L.; Swart A.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2017-01-01,"Central University of Technology, Free State;Cape Peninsula University of Technology",Engineering ;  Graduate attributes ;  Indicators ;  Outcomes
Problems and prospects of the development of the national innovation system in Kazakhstan,"The article presents the results of the author's research in the field of the formation and prospects of the development of the national innovation system in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The objective of the article is to analyze the problems and the prospects of the development of the national innovation system of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The study results suggest that despite the numerous programs and strategies for the industrial-innovative development adopted by the country since 2003, the progress in this area is quite modest. It is stated that the most important components of the NIS have already been created in Kazakhstan. The problems constraining the development of the innovative activities in Kazakhstan, such as the structural deformity of the economy, institutional problems, inconsistency and imbalance of technological, ecological, economic and social aspects, are highlighted in this paper. The dynamics of the major indicators of the innovation activity of the country and the regions indicates that the innovative system existing at this stage does not contribute to the innovative development of the country and its regions to the fullest extent.",Shakirtkhanov B.,Journal,International Journal of Applied Business and Economic Research,2017-01-01,Almaty Technological University,Engineering ;  Innovation ;  Innovation activity ;  Innovative economy ;  Innovative environment ;  Institutional and physical infrastructure ;  National innovation system ;  New technologies ;  Scientific and technological potential ;  Technology transfer
How do first year Malaysian chemical engineering students approach learning?,"Dynamic technology development and innovation of the 21st century have challenged chemical engineers in their working aspects. Future engineers are required to have high competitiveness in knowledge and skills in a fast changing world, requiring them to adapt and learn fast at a deep level. Consequently, education becomes a crucial means in developing matured learners who can efficiently adapt and acquire new knowledge and skills. Determining the students' approach to learning as early as possible, whether deep or surface learning, is important to assist the students in their learning. Their approach to learning can reflect their academic performance. The objective of this study is to determine the learning approach of first year chemical engineering students in a Malaysian research university. To achieve this objective, a pre-post quasiexperimental design was used to determine the approach to learning of 57 first year chemical engineering students. Revised Study Process Questionnaire (RSPQ-2F), a 20-item instrument developed by John Biggs and colleagues was used to measure the student's learning approach at the beginning and at the end of the first semester. The quantitative data were analyzed using pair-sample t-Test to measure the mean RSPQ-2F scores. A p-value < .05 was considered as significant. The findings show that the students mostly use deep approach compared to surface approach to learning at the beginning of the semester. At the end of the semester, there was a slight increase in their deep approach to learning, although the increase is not significant. Similarly, there was a slight decrease in surface learning, although the decrease is not significant.",Jumari N.; Yusof K.; Phang F.,Journal,Chemical Engineering Transactions,2017-01-01,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,
Evaluating relative benefits of different types of R&D for clean energy technologies,"Clean energy technologies that cost more than fossil fuel technologies require support through research and development (R&D). Learning-by-doing relates historical cost decreases to accumulation of experience. A learning investment is the amount of subsidy that is required to reach cost parity between a new technology and a conventional technology. We use learning investments to compare the relative impacts of two stylized types of R&D. We define curve-following R&D to be R&D that lowers costs by producing knowledge that would have otherwise been gained through learning-by-doing. We define curve-shifting R&D to be R&D that lowers costs by producing innovations that would not have occurred through learning-by-doing. We show that if an equal investment in curve-following or curve-shifting R&D would produce the same reduction in cost, the curve-shifting R&D would be more effective at reducing the learning investment needed to make the technology competitive. The relative benefit of curve-shifting over curve-following R&D is greater with a high starting cost and low learning rate. Our analysis suggests that, other things equal, investments in curve-shifting R&D have large benefits relative to curve-following R&D. In setting research policy, governments should consider the greater benefits of cost reductions brought about by transformational rather than incremental change.",Shayegh S.; Sanchez D.; Caldeira K.,Journal,Energy Policy,2017-01-01,Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei;Carnegie Institution of Washington;Near Zero,Clean energy technology ;  Curve-following ;  Curve-shifting ;  Learning curve ;  Learning investment ;  Research and development
The cultivation of ethics and morals values among Malaysian university students: A case study at a Malaysian technical university,"In line with the emphasis on developing first class human capital for the nation, professionalism and ethics have become one of the essential values to be developed among Malaysian undergraduate students. The development of these values among Malaysian students are considered as crucial for the development of the nation regardless whether they are part of the nation's workforce or entrepreneurs contributing to the economic development of the nation. This research investigated how ethics and moral values are embedded in engineering programmes offered by a Malaysian technical university. Specifically, the elements of ethics and moral values as well as the mechanism used by the university to inculcate the values of moral and ethics among its engineering students were investigated. Data were collected through survey questionnaires, interviews and observations involving 371 students and 16 lecturers. Three elements related to moral and ethics were identified, namely, the innovation, integrity and effort. Additionally, the mechanisms used to inculcate these values were lectures, tutorials and group projects. It was also found that the effectiveness of the inculcation of ethics and professionalism values through courses are based on knowledge, habits and attitude. Obstacles to the said purpose are also mentioned from the perspectives of lecturers and students. It can be concluded that these elements are prevalent in the engineering programmes and universities need to have effective strategies to ensure that engineering students are equipped with these values so that they can perform effectively as professional engineers as well as engineers entrepreneurs with strong moral values.",Mohamed S.; Sidek S.; Kudus N.; Hassan M.,Journal,Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences,2017-01-01,Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,Challenges ;  Cultivating ;  Ethics and morals values ;  Teaching approaches ;  University subjects
EcoData: Architecting Cross-Platform Software Ecosystem applications,"Software Ecosystems (SECOs) have been receiving an increasing amount of attention from both academia and industry. That could be explained by the open challenges pointed out by the Software Engineering community, as well as by the fact that many organizations adopt a more open and collaborative strategy to achieve innovation. While observing an evolution in the way platforms are used for developing applications, a specific type of SECO, which is centered on data, was identified: EcoData. It emerged in the “third model of computing platform”, recognized by industry as the confluence of new technologies such as Cloud Computing, Big Data and Analytics, Mobility and Social Business – CAMS. By reviewing the literature, non-functional requirements for EcoData applications were identified, but without a reference architecture (RA). While a RA would be useful for new solutions, the research’s goal is to provide a means for architecting and improving cross-platform SECO applications.",França M.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2017-01-01,International Business Machines;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,CAMS ;  Software architecture ;  Software ecosystem
A cross-strait comparison of innovation policy under industry 4.0 and sustainability development transition,"While the advent of Industry 4.0 is emblematic of national strategy for industrial revitalization, the proliferation of technology has drastically changed the landscape of many major sectors of global industries. Industry 4.0 encompasses multi-dimensional concepts- including computerization, digitization, and intelligentization-of business operations based on cyber-physical-systems (CPS) and the Internet-of-Things (IoTs). The vision of Industry 4.0 will bring about improvements in industrial processes, ranging from engineering, material usage, supply chains, and product lifecycle management, to the horizontal value chain. This research project adopts a descriptive analysis with descriptive statistics under the innovation policy framework proposed by Rothwell and Zegveld. This report also informs a comparative policy analysis across China and Taiwan. From the perspectives of industry coalition and competition, this cross-strait comparison lends itself to being a policy-making reference. Results reveal that China, in terms of policy-making, concentrates on 'political' and 'legal/regulatory' aspects of environmental policy, as well as the theme of 'public service' of the demand-side policy. Taiwan also emphasizes the 'environmental-side' policy like China, whereas Taiwan focuses more on 'education/training' of the supply-side policy.",Lin K.; Shyu J.; Ding K.,Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2017-01-01,National Chiao Tung University;Dalian University of Technology,Cross-strait sustainability development ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Industry revitalization ;  Innovation policy
Microbial ecology at rhizosphere: Bioengineering and future prospective,"Rhizosphere, the interface between soil and plant roots, is a chemically complex environment which supports the development and growth of diverse microbial communities. Studies in rhizosphere science have undoubtedly improved our ability to steer the knowledge into technological applications in agricultural industry, ecological engineering, and nature restoration. In this chapter we provide a holistic perception of rhizosphere functioning with a highlight on the ecological drivers that promote colonization of coherent functional groups of microorganisms influencing plant life through several direct and indirect mechanisms. We also discuss how the activities of the indigenous microbes from rhizosphere may be exploited toward developing profitable techniques or methods in sustainable agriculture, biotechnology, and environmental management. In this context, we emphasize on the need for high degree of innovation and active collaboration between basic research and technology development wings for the best use of the knowledge in order to meet the increasing global demand for food, fiber, and bioenergy.",Haldar S.; Sengupta S.,Book,Plant-Microbe Interaction: An Approach to Sustainable Agriculture,2017-01-01,University of Calcutta;Goa University,
Green symbiotic cloud communications,"This book intends to change the perception of modern day telecommunications. Communication systems, usually perceived as ""dumb pipes"", carrying information / data from one point to another, are evolved into intelligently communicating smart systems. The book introduces a new field of cloud communications. The concept, theory, and architecture of this new field of cloud communications are discussed. The book lays down nine design postulates that form the basis of the development of a first of its kind cloud communication paradigm entitled Green Symbiotic Cloud Communications or GSCC. The proposed design postulates are formulated in a generic way to form the backbone for development of systems and technologies of the future. The book can be used to develop courses that serve as an essential part of graduate curriculum in computer science and electrical engineering. Such courses can be independent or part of high-level research courses. The book will also be of interest to a wide range of readers including both scientific and non-scientific domains as it discusses innovations from a simplistic explanatory viewpoint.",Mustafa H.; Merchant S.; Desai U.; Baveja B.,Book,Green Symbiotic Cloud Communications,2017-01-01,Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad;Ministry of Communications and Information Technology Government of India;Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,

An application of a double bootstrap to investigate the effects of technological progress on total-factor energy consumption performance in China,"This paper proposes a total-factor energy consumption performance index (TEPI) for measuring China's energy efficiency across 30 provinces during the period 1997 to 2012. The TEPI is derived by solving an improved non-radial data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, which is based on an energy distance function. The production possibility set is constructed by combining the super-efficiency and sequential DEA models to avoid “discriminating power problem” and “technical regress”. In order to explore the impacts of technological progress on TEPI and perform statistical inferences on the results, a two-stage double bootstrap approach is adopted. The important findings are that China's energy technology innovation produces a negative effect on TEPI, while technology import and imitative innovation produce positive effects on TEPI. Thus, the main contribution of TEPI improvement is technology import. These conclusions imply that technology import especially foreign direct investment (FDI) is important for imitative innovation and can improve China's energy efficiency. In the long run, as the technical level of China approaches to the frontier, energy technology innovation and its wide adoption become a sustained way to improve energy efficiency. Therefore, it is urgent for China to introduce measures such as technology translation and spillover policies as well as energy pricing reforms to support energy technology innovation.",Li K.; Lin B.,Journal,Energy,2017-01-01,Xiamen University;Hunan Normal University;Changsha University of Science and Technology,China ;  Double boot-strapping ;  Energy consumption performance ;  Non-radial DEA model ;  Technological progress

Latent semantic indexing for capitalizing experience in inventive design,"The growing complexity of the design activity in an innovation and sustainable context requires experience reuse as a means to limit unsustainable investments. It is a crucial task for both academic and industrial communities to find ways to efficiently capture and reuse past experience. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a research paradigm that stores experience as a knowledge unit to solve a new problem from the previous design experience. A well-established method for inventive design is IDM (the Inventive Design Methodology). Its most widely used tool to solve a problem is the “Contradiction Matrix” associated with forty inventive principles. The correct use of these tools needs the mapping from freely expressed text (Specific Parameters or SPs) into a well-established set of Generic Engineering Parameters (or GEPs). This mapping requires expertise and may, if inappropriately used, lead to weak results. This paper introduces the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) algorithm to discover the implied semantic relations between SPs and GEPs coming from past experience. A semantic space based on the LSI results is built for guiding retrieval in case-based reasoning.",Zhang P.; Zanni-Merk C.; Cavallucci D.,Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2017-01-01,"LITIS - Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Traitement de l'Information et des Systèmes;INSA Strasbourg;Design Engineering Laboratory",Case-based reasoning ;  Experience capitalization ;  Inventive design ;  Latent semantic indexing ;  TRIZ
Learning by failure vs learning by habits: Entrepreneurial learning micro-strategies as determinants of the emergence of co-located entrepreneurial networks,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explain the emergence of collaboration networks in entrepreneurial clusters as determined by the way entrepreneurs exchange knowledge and learn through business transactions needed to implement temporary supply chains in networks of co-located firms. Design/methodology/approach: A socio-computational approach is adopted to model business transactions and supply chain formation in Marshallian industrial districts (IDs). An agent-based model is presented and used as a virtual lab to test the hypotheses between the firms’ behaviour and the emergence of structural properties at the system level. Findings: The simulation findings and their validation based on the comparison with a real world cluster show that the topological properties of the emerging network are influenced by the learning strategies and decision-making criteria firms use when choosing partners. With reference to the specific case of Marshallian IDs it is shown that inertial learning based on history and past collaboration represents in the long term a major impediment for the emergence of hubs and of a network topology that is more conducive to innovation and growth. Research limitations/implications: The paper offers an alternative view of entrepreneurial learning (EL) as opposed to the dominant view in which learning occurs as a result of exceptional circumstances (e.g. failure). The results presented in this work show that adaptive, situated, and day-by-day learning has a profound impact on the performance of entrepreneurial clusters. These results are encouraging to motivate additional research in areas such as in modelling learning or in the application of the proposed approach to the analysis of other types of entrepreneurial ecosystems, such as start-up networks and makers’ communities. Practical implications: Agent-based model can support policymakers in identifying situated factors that can be leveraged to produce changes at the macro-level through the identification of suitable incentives and social networks re-engineering. Originality/value: The paper presents a novel perspective on EL and offers evidence that micro-learning strategies adopted and developed in routine business transactions do have an impact on firms’ performances (survival and growth) as well as on systemic performances related to the creation and diffusion of innovation in firms networks.",Cannavacciuolo L.; Iandoli L.; Ponsiglione C.; Zollo G.,Journal,International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research,2017-01-01,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,Agent-based modelling ;  Entrepreneurial learning ;  Innovation ;  Networks ;  Situated learning
A case study exploring suitability of bottom up modelling and actor-based simulation for decision making,"Traditionally, the top-down design method and analysis techniques, such as system dynamic model, have been used extensively for understanding complex systems. In top-down approach, a system is specified in terms of global state and the desired analyses are performed using aggregated macro-behaviour that represents the overall system. Essentially, the individual elements and their peculiarities are not differentiated with an assumption that the inherent dynamics of the overall system is precisely known to the system modellers. This paper, in contrast, presents a case wherein the system behaviour emerges from the individual elements and their interactions. The paper further demonstrates the usability of bottom up approach, actor based modelling abstraction, and actor based simulation technique to understand complex systems (with emergent behaviour) using a case study on decision making of a Research and Innovation (R&I) organisation.",Barat S.; Rajbhoj A.; Kumar P.; Kulkarni V.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2017-01-01,TCS Research,Actor-based simulation ;  Bottom-up modelling ;  Complex dynamic decision making ;  Enterprise modeling ;  Simulation
The AUSS FIREfly: A distributed sensing and coordination platform for first-year engineering education,"This paper describes an embedded computing and sensing system developed to serve the needs of the Autonomous Unmanned Systems Stream (AUSS), a two-semester sequence at the University of Maryland that provides first-year students with an inquiry-based introduction to concepts in engineering and autonomy. AUSS is part of the UMD First-year Innovation and Research Experience program (FIRE), a campus-wide initiative that provides course-based undergraduate research experiences for first-year students. FIRE aims to propel students towards planning, conducting and reporting research that is relevant to the scientific community. To serve its educational mission, the AUSS needs to equip incoming freshmen with the necessary technical capabilities to pursue engineering research in autonomous systems. The AUSS FIREfly is a robotics kit designed to be a training tool and a research platform. Each device is assembled and programmed by an individual student, exposing the builder to topics such as circuit design, information theory, and computer science. Once completed, the FIREfly uses onboard infrared transceivers to emulate the photic system of a firefly, supporting group-led experiments in multi-agent synchronization. The devices are also designed to serve as nodes in a distributed sensor network when equipped with additional measurement modules such as airspeed probes. This paper presents the design features of the AUSS FIREfly system within the context of the challenges faced by a first-year research education experience. It presents student experience evaluations from the first cohort of AUSS students and describes two FIREfly student projects as case studies.",Yeo D.; Paley D.,Conference Proceeding,AIAA SciTech Forum - 55th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting,2017-01-01,A.

The instrumentalisation of the MOOCS vector of educational innovation and consecration of the academic training quality,"The new technologies of information and communication constitute a lever drawing strategic development put forward by the national pact for the industrial emergence. This new orientation aims to sustain the industrial competitiveness of the country. Jointly the system of higher education appears in this perspective, that puts devices of open massive formation in place from a far of which the stake of massification and educational innovation Bernard [Majoie] [1]. Of this fact the quality of the trainings mediatized [Chanier98] [2] depends of the instrumentalisation of this virtual environment.

Clair model for better work life balance and empowerment of women faculty in professional colleges of Kerala,"Work-life balance is a concept including proper prioritizing between career and ambition and personal life. The expression ""work-life balance"" was first used in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s to describe the balance between an individual's work and personal life. The shift in working patterns, the necessity to learn and relearn and be tech savvy, longer working hours, more erratic work schedules, need to develop and impart soft skills and life skills, the increasing prevalence of two career families, the demands of constant accessibility and global collaboration; has made long lasting impact on the work life balance of teachers in the professional colleges. A healthy work environment is very essential for a teacher to be productive and successful. Work life imbalance leads to poor performance, poor concentration, reduced efficacy levels and work family conflict; which could be detrimental to the health of the individual in the long run. Prior research points out that a women teacher struggles hard to strike the balance between being a caring homemaker and a responsible teacher. Hence there is a pertinent need to analyze and study the issues and factors associated with work life balance of women faculty in Professional colleges offering various courses. It is an inevitable requirement to compare and contrast the work life balance across educational institutions and bring to light any inadequacy of the initiatives taken by the authorities and colleges to achieve a healthy work life balance for Professional college teachers in the chosen disciplines of Engineering, Architecture, MBA, MCA, Pharmacy and Hotel Management offered by AICTE affiliated institutions. Sample size of the study was 350, which included women faculty across professional colleges in Kerala under AICTE. Systematic Random Sampling was used. A pilot study was conducted in Thriruvananthapuram district and the final data collection was done from January-June, 2016. Structured Interview schedule was used for data collection. The dependent variables in the study are Satisfaction, Job Engagement and Work Life Balance. The independent variables include personal variables, family variables and work related variables. The analysis was conducted using chi-square test, ANOVA test, Regression analysis and Correlation analysis. The women faculty were found to have moderate satisfaction and moderate work life balance, which was relatively high in Engineering and pharmacy domain and least in Hotel Management domain. The study has explored and determined the extent of job engagement, job satisfaction, dual role conflict, gender inequality, Glass ceiling and Sexual harassment of women faculty in professional colleges.

Navigating the “paradox of openness” in energy and transport innovation: Insights from eight corporate clean technology research and development case studies,"Using an inductive case study approach drawn from original interview data, this article investigates the innovation approaches among a sample of international energy companies, or corporate firms. It first presents a conceptual framework synthesized from the business studies, entrepreneurship, evolutionary economics, innovation studies, management science, organization studies, political science, and sociology literature. This framework suggests that corporate approaches to clean technology innovation will cut across the four dimensions of organizational multiplicity and stakeholder involvement, information sharing, coordination and control, and market orientation. It then explores how eight firms—the Algal Carbon Conversion Flagship and Aurora Algae (biofuel), DONG and Statoil (carbon capture and storage), Tesla and Volkswagen (electric vehicles), and Siemens and Vestas (offshore wind turbines)—approach clean technology development with “open innovation” attributes mixed with “closed” attributes. Although the study finds striking similarities among the particular approaches embraced by each corporate actor, it also notes that approaches are technology and firm specific, and the potential for different permutations leads to an almost endless number of possible stylistic combinations. The innovation profiles depicted also reveal conflict and competition among various stakeholders, the implication being that corporate innovation in the energy sector remains a conflicted, disjointed, and messy process.",Sovacool B.; Jeppesen J.; Bandsholm J.; Asmussen J.; Balachandran R.; Vestergaard S.; Andersen T.; Sørensen T.; Bjørn-Thygesen F.,Journal,Energy Policy,2017-01-01,University of Sussex Business School;Aarhus Universitet,Corporate research style ;  Energy systems ;  Open innovation ;  Transport

The introduction of a competing business model: The case of eBay,"In today's highly competitive business environment, the reasons for companies to engage in business model innovation (BMI) are manifold. The pressure on firms to innovate their business models results in either an adaptation of the incumbent business model, or the introduction of a new competing business model. Based on extant theory, we found that the reasons for a firm to engage in BMI can be clustered into three categories: 1) increased profitability; 2) improved strategic positioning; 3) customer attraction. By conducting an exploratory single case study approach, we confirmed these categories by identifying the distinct reasons for eBay to introduce a competing business model. We then highlight the impacts on the focal firm as a result of the new business model. We find that the introduction of a competing business model can create novel sources of value for the company and its customers. In total, the study emphasises that when firms launch competing business models, intended and unintended consequences can be both positive and negative.",Comberg C.; Velamuri V.,Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2017-01-01,Handelshochschule Leipzig,BMI ;  Business model innovation ;  Case study research ;  Competing business models ;  E-commerce ;  Service firms

Charting a course for a STEM future,"The 2016 National SeaPerch Challenge held at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge on May 21 was the sixth underwater robotic competition, with 196 middle and high school teams from all over the United States, including nine international teams, two of which traveled from as far away as South Australia. All teams competed in two complex underwater events and an engineering poster competition that day for a series of trophies in the three events, and for those teams with the highest point totals in each category, the title of national champion. SeaPerch is a K-12 in-school and out-of-school robotics program, sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the science and technology arm of the United States Navy, and managed by the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation (AUVSIF). The program trains teachers and group leaders to inspire their students to build their own ROVs following an academic curriculum consistent with national learning standards supporting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects with a marine engineering-based theme. SeaPerch is a hands-on activity where students actually build their own vehicles in teams of two to five. Complete kits, containing all of the components needed to build a vehicle as well as tool bags containing the necessary hand and power tools, are available through the SeaPerch Web site. The actual build is facilitated by the illustrated step-by-step build manual and supplemented by PowerPoint files and videos of more challenging portions of the construction. Once construction is complete, the students verify their vehicle's system functionality by testing switch positions with propeller rotation; balancing their vehicles for transverse and longitudinal stability; and adjusting for near neutral stability by varying the amount of foam flotation to offset the vehicle's weight. SeaPerch is developing two new innovations, a data gathering module and a virtual SeaPerch. Students will be able to analyze the data over selected time periods to detect trends and formulate conclusions.",Kimball P.,Journal,Marine Technology,2017-01-01,SNAME,

Myocardial regeneration for humans — modifying biology and manipulating evolution —,"Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide and developing novel therapies to treat and cure the disease remains a high priority in the healthcare research community. Adult stem cells were successful in entering numerous clinical trials over the past 15 years in attempts to regenerate the heart. First-generation adult stem cell therapies for myocardial regeneration were highly promising in small animal models but realized benefits in humans were far more modest. Consequently, second-generation therapeutic approaches in early implementation phases have focused on enhancing cellular properties with higher survival and regenerative potential. Genetic programming dictates cellular fate, so understanding genetic composition and responses at the gene level to influence the outcome of the cell is essential for successful outcomes in regenerative medicine. Genetic editing is at the forefront of scientific innovation and as basic scientific research continues to expand upon understanding eukaryotic regenerative themes, a clearer vision of the possible future therapeutic approaches can be realized. Ultimately, enhancing biology and manipulating evolutional selection of cellular properties will be critical to achieving clinically relevant and biologically meaningful cardiac regeneration.",Broughton K.; Sussman M.,Journal,Circulation Journal,2017-01-01,San Diego State University,Cardiomyopathy ;  Gene therapy ;  Regeneration ;  Stem cells

Pathways towards the entrepreneurial university for creating entrepreneurial engineers: An Italian case,"Innovation and entrepreneurship are crucial processes for economic growth and regions' competitiveness. A key element to succeed in the entrepreneurial economy is the development of a new archetype of human capital, the 'entrepreneurial engineer', who is capable to match technology innovation with business challenges and societal development, assuring economical, technological and environmental sustainability. The development of such professionals requires to universities a deep reconfiguration towards the 'entrepreneurial university' model, by integrating research, education and innovation, and promoting public-private partnerships. Framed in these premises, and based on a longitudinal case study carried out within an Italian university, the paper proposes the principles, actors and processes that should characterise a higher education system engaged in experimenting the entrepreneurial university model. A set of guidelines is also provided to educators, professors and practitioners involved into the experimentation of innovative learning environments conducive for the development of entrepreneurial attitudes in engineering and technical profiles.",Elia G.; Secundo G.; Passiante G.,Journal,International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management,2017-01-01,Università del Salento,Entrepreneurial education ;  Entrepreneurial engineer ;  Entrepreneurial university ;  Higher education systems ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge triangle ;  Technology entrepreneurship ;  Triple helix

Evolutionary design: The application of biological strategies in the product design process,"The research aimed at understanding how strategies developed by nature endure and sustain organisms and the environment in which they are placed. Accordingly, this understanding of biological strategies led to the development of a product design process that enhances both the innovation and sustainability of the product and its surroundings. An in-depth comparison was discussed of two main strategic directions that shape existing nature-inspired design process; outcome-focused strategies and process-focused strategies. Two processes were developed that follow nature's method of adapting to survive in changing environments which were tested in the product design field. The approach of experimentation was divided into two main parts; case studies and interactive participant labs to experiment and apply the research outcome. Participants from different disciplines and professional backgrounds were involved in both experimentation methods. The methods were analysed using observation, interviews, questionnaires, and focus group discussions. The experiments showed that participants from the design, engineering, and management fields produced sustainable outcomes by applying the proposed processes in their projects. By introducing nature-inspired processes during the start of project development, participants were able to create sustainable solutions. The proposed framework can be applied in the education sectors for design students. It can also be applicable for professional design projects to achieve advanced sustainable outcomes.",Lotfi N.,Journal,International Journal of Design and Nature and Ecodynamics,2017-01-01,German University in Cairo,Evolution ;  Processes ;  Product design ;  Strategies ;  Sustainability
"The de Mestral project: Using macro photo-journaling to stimulate interest in bio-inspired design and science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines","Bio-inspired design (BID) and its many variants (biomimetics, biomimicry etc.) continues to be a promising innovation methodology in which practitioners from industry and academia search nature's evolutionary diversity for meaningful design opportunities. However, despite BID's potential to contribute greater value to society, it remains an obscure field. In this paper, we present a case demonstrating how a novel educational exercise could play an important role in advancing the field by stimulating student interest in BID and the more broadly associated Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields which drive it. Specifically, we discuss a cross-disciplinary university seminar that uses an experimental photo journaling exercise called the ""de Mestral Project"" which aims to recreate the successful invention process of Velcro by Engineer Georges de Mestral. This exercise cultivates observation skills, or the ability to look closer at the natural world as a foundation for uncovering new opportunities for design. Critical to the activity is the use of macro photography to help facilitate this discovery process.

Findings: Should you teach an engineering student about Marxist interpretations of Jane Austen? Or a philosophy student about how to fix a broken leg? Well, unless you were desirous of an especially rounded education, then this would seem pretty pointless. However, it has been the lament of many specialists that mainstream education simply follows the paths established centuries before, and do not reflect modern needs of students. Could this also be true of the highly regarded Masters of Business Administration and the students paying tens of thousands of dollars to put themselves through it? Practical implications: This study provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world’s leading organizations. Originality/value: The briefing saves busy executives and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy-to-digest format.",Linacre S.,Journal,Human Resource Management International Digest,2017-01-01,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,Development ;  Innovation ;  Leadership ;  Learning ;  Management
Investigación e innovación responsables: Retos teóricos y políticos,"The present article postulates the value of the new ways of looking at the relations between science, technology, public / policies and society. On the one hand, Science and Technology Studies / foreshadow / alternative models for understanding the governance of science. On the other, within the institutional framework at the heart of the ""Horizon 2020"" strategy, the political language associated with responsible research and innovation (RRI) is gaining in importance, arguing that those who engage in research and engineering activities should do a better job of aligning their processes and outcomes with the values, needs and expectations of European society. The article offers a critical dialogue between the theoretical advances and the new political language, and suggests that the significance, scope and application of an RRI-based focus will depend on the economic and sociopolitical dynamics by which science and technology are instrumentalised and regulated.",Eizagirre A.,Journal,"Sociologia, Problemas e Praticas",2017-01-01,Mondragon Unibertsitatea,Governance ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Science ;  Society
"Chapter 2: Bioactive Glass-ceramics: Processing, Properties and Applications","Bioactive glass-ceramics (BGCs) are among the biomaterials that elicit a particular biological reaction at the interface of the material, which stimulates cell proliferation, gene response and the formation of a bond between living tissue and the material. Conventionally, BGCs have been tested to fill and restore bone defects, which led to commercial products such as Cerabone®, Biosilicate®, Ceravital® and Bioverite®. This category of biomaterials has become an emerging research field for bone and soft tissue engineering applications. This book chapter outlines the compositions, processing, properties and applications of commercial and promising types of BGCs. Some valuable reports dealing with magnetic BGCs, radiopaque BGCs, composites, coatings, gel-derived BGCs, scaffolds and their relevant issues are reviewed and discussed.

Using innovation contests to promote the development of generic technologies,"Many technology firms organize innovation contests to discover ideas for new goods, services, and business models. This article investigates an innovation contest during its early phases regarding designing generic technologies. Generic technologies empower the design of several technological applications for multiple markets, create value across several domains, and contribute to the disruption of existing industries. Actors involved in generic technology innovation contests are confronted with double uncertainties in which the scopes of both technologies and markets are uncertain. Based on in-depth analysis of a case study conducted at a leading semiconductor manufacturer, STMicroelectronics, findings describe various phases of generic technology innovation contests, highlighting how such phases support generic potential of ideas to obtain technological platforms. Implications for innovation contests in high-tech environments are discussed.",Kokshagina O.; Gillier T.; Cogez P.; Le Masson P.; Weil B.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2017-01-01,Grenoble Ecole de Management;Mines Paris - PSL;AENEAS;STIM,General purpose technology ;  Generic technology ;  Innovation contest ;  Semiconductors ;  Uncertainty
Modelling of the age-hardening behavior in AA6xxx within a through-process modelling framework,"The manufacturing of AA6xxx car body panels typically consists of rolling, ageing and forming processes. Thus, multiple simulation tools can be coupled to set up a through-process modelling (TPM) framework for predicting the evolution of microstructure and the final mechanical properties of these products. In order to realize such a TPM concept, various industrial processing phenomena were studied and modelled in the open innovation research cluster “Advanced Metals and Processes” (AMAP♯). This work focuses on the age hardening behavior which takes place during the industrial paint bake process. To reflect the microstructure evolution of this processing step, a multi-component precipitation model is developed. So far, the influences of thermomechanical processes, i.e. annealing temperature on the kinetics of MgxSiy precipitates during artificial aging were implemented. The precipitation model was linked to a yield strength model in order to simulate the evolution of mechanical properties within the TPM framework. For validation, the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties of an AA6016 alloy during artificial ageing was investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and tensile testing. The simulation results are in agreement with experimental observations.",Mao F.; Bollmann C.; Brüggemann T.; Liang Z.; Jiang H.; Mohles V.,Book Series,Materials Science Forum,2017-01-01,Hydro Aluminium Rolled Products GmbH;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Novelis Research and Technology Center Göttingen;Aleris Rolled Products Germany GmbH,Age hardening ;  Al-Mg-Si ;  Modelling ;  Precipitation
The emergence and diffusion of grassroots energy innovations: Building an interdisciplinary approach,"This paper highlights the role of grassroots innovations in enhancing the use of renewable energy sources and proposes a conceptual interdisciplinary framework to analyze their emergence and diffusion in future empirical studies. Drawing on previous literature on grassroots innovations and preliminary empirical studies, our approach contributes to grassroots innovation and energy research and highlights the connections between culture, everyday life and community energy initiatives. We stress the need to study individual and community level behavior and everyday practices in multiple cultural contexts in order to gain deeper understanding on how grassroots innovations emerge.

A study on metadata structure and recommenders of biological systems to support bio-inspired design,"Bio-inspired design was introduced as an alternative method to encourage breakthrough innovations during design projects by stimulating analogical reasoning and thinking of designers. However, the method did not perform as well as researchers expected because most designers, who are novices in the fields of biology and ecology, cannot infer the proper analogue (i.e. biological system) from nature. To resolve this fundamental problem, a causal model based representation framework for ‘analogical reasoning’ – searching and selecting the biological systems to apply – have been developed. In addition, ontology based repository structures and retrieval systems have been proposed to support ‘analogical thinking’ of designers. Nevertheless, these systematic approaches still restrict the candidates and inevitably lose potential biological systems relevant to the design project, due to the ‘physical relation’ biased problem and the ambiguity of the indexing mechanism of both current representation frameworks and retrieval systems. For example, the causality based support system known as a robust representation framework for a single biological system, stores information of a biological system only by its internal ‘physical relations’ and retrieves biological systetabms only by the physical relevance. However, from the perspective of ecological thinking, the further relatedness of ‘physical, biological, and ecological relations’ composes the holistic concept used to identify an organism in the flow of evolution because the ‘biological and ecological relations’ are also involved in the traits that designers may be interested in. Therefore, the supplementary information for ‘biological and ecological relations’ must be added to index the biological and environmental interactions, and to use the connectivity among entire organisms in the retrieval process. In this research, a causality based holistic representation framework for biological systems and an ‘all-connected’ ontology based repository and retrieval system are developed as a knowledge-based recommendation system to support bio-inspired design. The knowledge-based system we developed allows engineering designers to search and select a particular biological system and extract design strategy without much biological knowledge. This effort provides more opportunities in a bio-inspired design process by adding potential biological systems that might previously not have been considered.",Kim S.; Lee J.,Journal,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2017-01-01,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Bio-inspired design ;  Biological system metadata modeling ;  Knowledge-based system ;  Ontology ;  Recommendation system

Research on the technology transfer efficiency evaluation in industry-university-research institution collaborative innovation and its affecting factors based on the two-stage DEA model,"The traditional technical efficiency measurement regards the technology transfer system as a “black box” and doesn’t penetrate the internal operation mechanism of the system. This paper opens the technology transfer system “black box” of industry-university-research institution (IUR) collaborative innovation, researches the internal structure of the system, and deconstructs the system into two stages: technology innovation stage and industrial value creation stage. On this basis, this paper calculates the technology transfer efficiency based on the two-stage DEA model. The result shows that the overall technology transfer efficiency in IUR collaborative innovation is low, and the bottlenecks for improving the technology transfer efficiency are different for different provinces. Through analyzing the internal and external factors of the system, this paper finds that the good cooperative relationship between enterprises and scientific research institutions can improve the efficiency of technology transfer.

Technology innovation-oriented complex product systems R&D investment and financing risk management: An integrated review,"Increasingly software and embedded intelligence products are integrated in various industrial systems to promote the continuous deepening of the industry 4.0, especially for the complex product systems (CPS). Definitely, the development of CPS is driven by technology innovation-oriented research and development (R&D). Besides, investment and financing have been widely acknowledged as a crucial link in R&D to ensure and sustain the development of CPS and even industry 4.0. However, CPS R&D activities are characterized by complexity and high uncertainty so that risks of the investment and financing are more complex and changeable. Thus, effective risk management for CPS R&D is becoming particularly important. Risk management is a process of determining what risks exist in an investment and then handling those risks in the best-suited way. Therefore, the paper aims at summarizing and analyzing research status for different objects in existing literatures about investment and financing risk management of CPS R&D. And studies are mainly from three aspects: risk assessment, risk early warning, management and control. Based on the past literatures, the future research directions have been proposed and it might be able to serve as a preliminary guide for investment and financing risk management of CPS R&D.",Xu L.; Tang S.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2017-01-01,Xihua University,CPS ;  Financing ;  Investment ;  R and D ;  Risk management

Integrated service and product innovation on life cycle business co-evolution,"The business of manufacturing companies is evolving towards knowledge-intensive industrial services. It is important to stay as near to the customer process as possible in this evolution to enable the growth of efficiency of customer business over the life cycle. In this type of business, in addition to managing material and financial flows, information and knowledge flows have to be managed much better. However, complexity is also increasing because of the new offerings and the need to network all operations and manage distributed information and competence. It is obvious that the business model and other supporting business structures of partners in the value network are in constant transition. It is thus important to master innovation in the customer process over its life cycle. The objective of this article is to introduce a concept of integrated service and product development during various types of innovation in life cycle business evolution routing. When business is changing, various types of innovations tackle it: business, market and life cycle innovation.

Innovativeness through time management,"As an imperative resource, time and the usage of it should be analyzed and planned in a proper way to maximize the individual effectiveness, and thus make the time management as a functioning tool. Innovativeness is not any easier issue to master, but if a time personality is understood and taken account, a person’s innovativeness can be effectively utilized. Innovativeness as a concept must be seen from a wider perspective, including both capability and willingness to act, resulting different kinds of target oriented activities in different stages of an innovation process. In this process, individual and group or network level can be separated and the meaning of a time personality for innovativeness can be analyzed to enhance an overall innovation performance of an organization. Research discussed in this paper was done by utilizing applications called Chronos & Kairos and Pursoid. Research results show that there are some very interesting combinations with conscious awareness of individuals towards time and innovativeness.

Capturing Essential Information to Achieve Safe Interoperability,"In this article, we describe the role of ""clinical scenario"" information to assure the safety of interoperable systems, as well as the system's ability to deliver the requisite clinical functionality to improve clinical care. Described are methods and rationale for capturing the clinical needs, workflow, hazards, and device interactions in the clinical environment. Key user (clinician and clinical engineer) needs and system requirements can be derived from this information, therefore, improving the communication from clinicians to medical device and information technology system developers. This methodology is intended to assist the health care community, including researchers, standards developers, regulators, and manufacturers, by providing clinical definition to support requirements in the systems engineering process, particularly those focusing on development of Integrated Clinical Environments described in standard ASTM F2761. Our focus is on identifying and documenting relevant interactions and medical device capabilities within the system using a documentation tool called medical device interface data sheetsa and mitigating hazardous situations related to workflow, product usability, data integration, and the lack of effective medical device-health information technology system integration to achieve safe interoperability. Portions of the analysis of a clinical scenario for a ""patient-controlled analgesia safety interlock"" are provided to illustrate the method. Collecting better clinical adverse event information and proposed solutions can help identify opportunities to improve current device capabilities and interoperability and support a learning health system to improve health care delivery.

Preventing accidental residential fires: the role of human involvement in non-injury house fires,"Research to date has focused on causal descriptions of residential fire fatalities and injuries, with an emphasis on ignition factor. This paper examines if, how and why human actions or inactions lead to accidental residential fires and identifies the risk factors most closely associated with those fires caused by human unsafe behaviours. Interviews of 182 people who had survived accidental residential fires without serious injury were conducted. Each fire was classified as either of the following: (1) directly caused by human unsafe behaviours; (2) directly caused by human long-term inactions; or (3) involved no human actions. Frequencies and odds ratio values were presented. Slightly less than half (46%) of the non-injury fires were directly caused by human unsafe behaviours, 40% involved no human actions and 14% were associated with long-term human inactions. Examination of the fires caused by human unsafe behaviours compared with no human involvement using odds ratios showed that individuals in the former group were significantly more likely to be mentally ill, physically disabled, asleep, not in full-time paid employment and more intimate with ignition. Many non-injury fires do not directly arise from unsafe activity, and most of them were caused by electrical or ignition system failure. New design innovations and/or improvements in appliances may reduce those fires due to appliance maintenance negligence or electrical faults. Identification of the most high-risk individuals for unsafe behaviours can help inform fire safety educational programmes.
