Technology innovation's region nonlinear research: Evidence from China's OFDI,"The paper uses threshold test method to measure the regional absorptive capacity which based on economic development, R&D level and human capital. Results show that GDP, per capita GDP and the development of higher education level have single threshold. R&D spending has double threshold as well as R&D density. Human capital stock exists triple threshold. Absorptive capacity over a certain threshold, the effect of OFDI technology innovation will be improved significantly in some parts of China. A small number of eastern coastal areas can effectively absorb the OFDI technological innovation effect. The vast majority of central and western regions still not across the high threshold of absorptive capacity.",Su W.; Chen F.; Chen G.; Shi L.; Shao J.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 International Conference on Logistics, Informatics and Service Science, LISS 2015",2015-12-30,Cixi Administration School,absorptive capacity ;  OFDI ;  technological innovation ;  threshold test

Mass transfer coefficient in ginger oil extraction by microwave hydrotropic solution,"This research aims to obtain mass transfer coefficient data on the extraction of ginger oil using microwave hydrotropic solvent as an alternative to increase zingiberene. The innovation of this study is extraction with microwave heater and hydrotropic solvent,which able to shift the phase equilibrium, and the increasing rate of the extraction process and to improve the content of ginger oil zingiberene. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Separation Techniques at Chemical Engineering Department of Diponegoro University. The research activities carried out in two stages, namely experimental and modeling work. Preparation of the model postulated, then lowered to obtain equations that were tested and validated using data obtained from experimental. Measurement of experimental data was performed using microwave power (300?W), extraction temperature of 90 ° C and the independent variable, i.e.: type of hydrotropic, the volume of solvent and concentration in order, to obtain zingiberen levels as a function of time. Measured data was used as a tool to validate the postulation, in order to obtain validation of models and empirical equations. The results showed that the mass transfer coefficient (Kla) on zingiberene mass transfer models ginger oil extraction at various hydrotropic solution attained more 14 ± 2 Kla value than its reported on the extraction with electric heating. The larger value of Kla, the faster rate of mass transfer on the extraction process. To obtain the same yields, the microwave-assisted extraction required one twelfth time shorter.",Handayani D.; Ikhsan D.; Yulianto M.; Dwisukma M.,Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2015-12-29,Universitas Semarang;Muhammadiyah University in Semarang,extraction ;  ginger oil ;  hydrotropic ;  microwave ;  zingiberene
The modern methods for designing of medium voltage switchboards technology of power plant's refineries: Technical Solution for Double Bus-bar Systems,"Any refinery needs an independent power plant which is most important for running all of the processing units under steady state conditions [1]. We are still considering the constructions of medium voltage switch gears (MVSWGR's) in the conventional way although the vacuum theory has proved. Digital relays with their automation are offering good facilities for sending on the power of medium voltage distribution systems. But, it is still needed for these innovations to be more qualified. This research paper deals with the involvement of a binary function for receiving 11KV either from the extra high voltage National Grid distribution network of 220 kV which is called the modified IEEE 21 bus-Test-case or sending the floating power generation from the refinery to the grid which is called the modified IEEE 23 bus-Test-case and is based on the MATLAB/MATPOWER testing system [2], [3]. Moreover the designing of circuit breaker shall be further tested using existing parameters of the MATLAB switching system. This paper explains many recommendations and conclusions.",Gatan S.,Conference Proceeding,"Advances in Information, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, AIEEE 2015 - Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 3rd Workshop",2015-12-28,Riga Technical University,Electrical engineering ;  oil refineries ;  power generation planning ;  power system control ;  Switchboard ;  switchgear
An ontology of online user feedback in software engineering,"Online user feedback is principally used as an information source for evaluating customers' satisfaction for a given goods, service or software application. The increasing attitude of people towards sharing comments through the social media is making online user feedback a resource containing different types of valuable information. The huge amount of available user feedback has drawn the attention of researchers from different fields. For instance, data mining techniques have been developed to enable information extraction for different purposes, or the use of social techniques for involving users in the innovation of services and processes. Specifically, current research and technological efforts are put into the definition of platforms to gather and/or analyze multi-modal feedback. But we believe that the understanding of the type of concepts instantiated as information contained in user feedback would be beneficial to define new methods for its better exploitation. In our research, we focus on online explicit user feedback that can be considered as a powerful means for user-driven evolution of software services and applications. Up to our knowledge, a conceptualization of user feedback is still missing. With the purpose of contributing to fill up this gap we propose an ontology, for explicit online user feedback that is founded on a foundational ontology and has been proposed to describe artifacts and processes in software engineering. Our contribution in this paper concerns a novel user feedback ontology founded on a Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) that supports the description of analysis processes of user feedback in software engineering. We describe the ontology together with an evaluation of its quality, and discuss some application scenarios.",Morales-Ramirez I.; Perini A.; Guizzardi R.,Journal,Applied Ontology,2015-12-15,Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo;Università di Trento;Istituto Trentino di Cultura-Centro per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica,communication ontology ;  requirements engineering ;  software engineering ;  speech act theory ;  user feedback analysis ;  User feedback ontology
A new multi-functional true triaxial fluid-solid coupling experiment system and its applications,"A new multi-functional true triaxial fluid-solid coupling experiment system was designed, fabricated, calibrated, and successfully tested to better simulate in-situ triaxial stress conditions and reveal geomechanical properties and seepage laws for rocks and coals subjected to these conditions. The experiment system comprises a load frame, a true triaxial pressure vessel, a high pressure loading system, an internally sealed seepage system, a control and data acquisition system and an acoustic emission monitoring system. The advantages and innovations of the experiment system include: (1) Geomechanical and seepage experiments can be performed for different stress-strain paths under uniaxial, biaxial or true triaxial stress conditions. (2) Three new stress and strain control modes(Trace-F, Trace-D and Trace-Df) are implemented to ensure that the center point of the specimen stays in the same position during experiments. (3) The internally sealed seepage system is designed to accomplish the independent control and monitoring of fluid flow in the specimen under true triaxial stress conditions. (4) To reduce the specimen end friction effect, stiff loading mode is applied in two directions and either flexible or stiff loading mode is applied in the third direction. In addition, high frequency dynamic control is implemented for the load system, therefore experiments with complex stress-strain paths can be performed. (5) New multi-functional loading platens are designed to accommodate hydraulic fracturing experiments. (6) The experiment system can apply a force of up to 6 000 kN in each of two directions and 4 000 kN in the remaining direction. The applied fluid pressure can be up to 60 MPa based on a servo-controlled supercharger. A series of testing methods and experiments were performed to verify the accuracy and reliability of the experiment system. This system will provide a comprehensive new tool to study geomechanical properties and seepage laws for rock and coal under true triaxial stress conditions, which can be further applied to research in areas such as geological storage of CO2, efficient oil-gas exploitation and deep underground rock engineering applications.",Yin G.; Li M.; Xu J.; Wang W.; Li W.; Li X.; Song Z.; Deng B.,Journal,Yanshilixue Yu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Rock Mechanics and Engineering,2015-12-15,Chongqing University,Fluid-solid coupling ;  Hydraulic fracturing ;  Permeability ;  Rock mechanics ;  True triaxial stress conditions
Mass participation in innovation - The foundation of a modern organization and beyond,"In this practice reflection paper I share hands-on experiences on innovation ecosystems. They have taught me that if we want innovation to be the core catalyst of value creation, we need an advanced set of tools, mechanisms and approaches to encourage horizontal cooperation and mass engagement in generation of innovative propositions that can turn into innovation. Even more, I stress that only mass innovation can ensure the appropriate culture and conditions for innovative breakthroughs. At the same time it is important that we do not merely transfer an effective model for mass innovation from one environment to another. Instead, we should first consider observing and learning about the evolution phase, the level of absorptiveness, the existing innovation experiences, and the structural and human capital present in an environment. Based on those observations we should create the model, which should be authentic, unique and adjusted to the local environment and local idiosyncrasies. Only with such adjustments one can hope to achieve optimal results. I will support my arguments with examples and experiences from the field.",Bulc V.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,d.o.o.,absorptive level ;  business evolution ;  horizontal structures ;  Mass innovation ;  safe environment
Living labs in health innovation: Critical factors in their application,"The focus of this paper is on living labs for health innovation. Health care (cure) systems are under pressure as a consequence of the ageing population and fast increasing population with chronic conditions, in a situation of decreasing financial budgets. At the same time, the valorization of health inventions is stumbled by many blocks. Living labs as an innovation tool, whether conceived as delimited environments for co-creation and development or as local/regional platforms, may offer various solutions. The paper identifies factors that hamper the valorization of knowledge in general and it identifies critical factors in the application of medical living labs, using the literature and five case studies.",Van Geenhuizen M.; Guldemond N.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,"Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management, TU Delft;Delft University of Technology",Critical Factors ;  Health ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge Valorization ;  Living labs
Organizational innovation for institutional growth: Findings from a sustained initiative at IIT Bombay,"India has traditions of sustainable practices and economics, but innovations for more sustainable industrial and information society are quite challenging. Leading institutions of learning such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are expected to provide ideas for innovations that address vexing issues related to health and sustainability. Institutional excellence is gradually gaining importance as select IITs travel in third quarter of their journey towards century. Taking a context of IIT Bombay, we search for initiatives related to organizational innovations After considerable interactions, we select for case study a major initiative that has sustained for a quarter of a century and has potential to make impact. Based on factual data and interaction from concerned professionals we have tried to identify elements of such sustaining innovations.",Momaya K.; Manthri P.; Reddy P.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Shailesh J.

Towards evolutionary management framework for technological catching-up,"Ambitions of developing countries for technological catching-up are increasingly rooted in their commitment and competence to rapidly build up capabilities. This places national knowledge systems at the core of technological development strategies. As a result of the cumulative nature of learning and differences in the rate of accumulation of technological capabilities, there is an inherent expansion in the economic prosperity gaps across the developing countries comparing to their industrialized counterparts. Narrowing these gaps requires sustainable catching-up efforts of various kinds. Pivotal among these is the swift accumulation of technological capabilities within a deliberate management framework for technological catching-up. Therefore, this research work aims at originate an evolutionary management framework for technological catching-up based on developing an empirical understanding of technology development implications in Libyan oil sector - as being the case study of interest - and through exploring the experiential stock of research organizations, firms and business sectors involved in technological innovation in both industrialized and developing countries.",Shenbarow A.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Libyan Petroleum Institute,developing countries ;  knowledge ;  national innovation system ;  Technological catching-up
A model for intangible assets management as a catalyst for product-service innovation in manufacturing,"Product-service (P-S) bundles in manufacturing are becoming more and more pervasive in literature and practice. Consequently, the capability of managing and exploiting the intangible part in alignment with the tangible part of the P-S bundle has become essential. However, only a paucity of tools is available to practitioners. Therefore the aim of this paper is to help single manufacturing enterprises and networked ones to manage and exploit their tangible and intangible assets by proposing a dynamic P-S management model on an enterprise and network level. By linking key intangible assets with key business activities and the needed resources to perform them, three management models based on business models will be conceptualized: a) for classical manufacturing enterprises that are mainly product oriented, b) for those that have a Product+Service strategy and c) for those that have a Product2Service strategy.",Opresnik D.; Zanetti C.; Wiesner S.; Taisch M.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Politecnico di Milano;BIBA - Bremer Institut für Produktion und Logistik GmbH,business model ;  intangible assets ;  management ;  Product-service system ;  servitization
Industry-wide technology roadmapping in double unknown - The case of the semiconductor industry,"Many companies face today a dilemma of double unknown when deciding where to put their research dollars: ignorance of which one among many possible technologies is most likely to emerge and similar ignorance of which one among many possible applications will most likely be a driver for the technology. Generic technologies are widely recognized to be beneficial for various market applications ([Bresnahan, Trajtenberg, 1995]; [Maine, Garsney, 2006]) and recent research results show that double unknown can lead companies to organize design activity to develop generic technologies suitable for several emerging markets application [Kokshagina, et al. 2012a]. However, the investigations so far focused on the level of the individual firm, while a double unknown situation is typically characterizing an industrial sector as a whole. This is in particular the case of the semiconductor industry: While the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) primary focus has been and still is the continuation of Moore's law, it introduced recently the More than Moore concept, to account for technologies which do not necessarily follow the CMOS miniaturization trends, and represent a growing part of the total silicon-based semiconductor market. The sheer diversity of both those technologies and their potential applications renders a roadmapping exercise very challenging. Nevertheless, given the benefits that roadmapping has brought to the semiconductor industry, the International Roadmap Committee (IRC) of the ITRS has decided to extend its activities to this new field. Which strategies do the ITRS experts implement to select which technologies to roadmap and which applications to target in double unknown? In this paper, we show that to design roadmaps for More than Moore technologies, the ITRS experts apply a strategy of common unknown [Kokshagina, et al. 2012a], along with additional community building activities specific to the situation of inter-firm collaboration.",Cogez P.; Kokshagina O.; Le Masson P.; Weil B.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,"STMicroelectronics SA, France;Mines Paris - PSL",double unknown ;  innovation ;  Roadmap ;  semiconductor ;  technology
A fourfold typology of living labs: An empirical investigation amongst the ENoLL community,"Living Labs can be seen as a means to structure user involvement in innovation processes. However, in this rather young research domain, there is no consensus yet regarding supporting theories and frameworks. This has resulted in a wide variety of projects and approaches being called 'Living Labs', which leaves a clear conceptualization and definition a task in progress. Within this research paper we propose a fourfold categorization of Living Labs based on a literature review and validated by an empirical investigation of the characteristics of 64 ICT Living Labs from the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL). The four types are Living Labs for collaboration and knowledge support activities, original 'American' Living Labs, Living Labs as extension to testbeds and Living Labs that support context research and co-creation with users.",Schuurman D.; Mahr D.; De Marez L.; Ballon P.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Universiteit Gent;Vrije Universiteit Brussel;Universiteit Maastricht,Co-creation ;  Living Labs ;  Open innovation ;  User involvement
A model to guide organizational adaptation,"Successful organizations anticipate the need to change. They do so with minimal effort and a focus on improving outcomes. This paper describes a systems-based approach by which organizations can become more adaptive and thus more agile, proactive, and innovative. The key idea is the alignment of vision and strategy, culture and beliefs, processes, plans, people, and desired outcomes. Such organizations have senior leadership that consistently and effectively communicate the vision and strategy (i.e., why the organization does what it does). The organization has a shared set of beliefs about why the vision and strategy are important. The organizational culture embraces innovative thought rather than rejecting such behavior. The resultant model is a codification of best practices based on a thorough review of the innovation, strategic management, leadership, and adaptive organization literature. The model was applied successfully in the transformation of a large, applied research organization.",Cross S.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Georgia Institute of Technology,Adaptation ;  alignment ;  culture change ;  transformation
Achieving cleaner production in SMEs batik toward innovation in production process,"This study aims to analysis and identify some options of innovation in the process of making batik in order to implement the concept of cleaner production by presenting the result-type of research of one Small Medium Enterprise (SMEs) Batik which is located in the Pekalongan. Based on the types and the amount of waste generated at each stage, this study proposes a set of alternative of innovation for the implementation of cleaner production in the process of making batik, namely recycle the collected wet wax from pelorodan process, reuse the wastewater from the dyeing process, reuse the droplets of wax from the process stamping, reuse the water from pelorodan process as long as 3 days before disposal, reuse the water from washing and flushing process as long as 2 days before disposal, and reduce the use of synthetic dyes with natural dyes. Unless the last alternative, all alternatives of innovation which were proposed in this study could give positive net benefit to the enterprise.",Susanty A.; Puspitasari D.; Rinawati D.; Monika T.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Universitas Diponegoro,Cleaner production ;  innovation ;  recycle ;  reduction ;  reuse ;  SMEs Batik
Fostering serendipity in online information systems,"Serendipity, the process of making fortunate discoveries for which someone was not looking for, plays a critical role in leveraging creativity and innovation. In this paper we propose a framework for facilitating serendipity in web information systems. We focus on three main technological areas which use the World Wide Web as a space for information seeking and knowledge creation: search, browse (navigation) and recommender systems. We argue that there are five factors that, individually and jointly, facilitate serendipity: novelty (or unexpectedness); diversity; personalization; visualization; and social collaboration. The paper reviews methods and techniques for each factor in each of the three technological areas and argues for a research agenda that addresses them in an effort to foster surprising discoveries and creative insights in the online world.",Taramigkou M.; Bothos E.; Apostolou D.; Mentzas G.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,University of Piraeus;National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),browsing ;  creativity ;  recommendations ;  search ;  serendipity
Technological support for managing collaborative innovation projects in SME networks,"For small and medium-sized enterprises, a collaboration with partners is one of the key success factors for staying competitive in dynamic, globalised markets. Within flexible networks, they combine resources and competences, and they share risks to conjointly develop innovative products and services. However, it is an imminent challenge for concerned enterprises to successfully manage such collaborative developments. Even though common obstacles and theoretical ways of overcoming them are well covered in fundamental research and best practices from the industry show the tremendous success of collaborative innovation, still many projects lack effectiveness and efficiency. Based on a collaboration model, which describes the structural and procedural foundation for innovation in networks, this paper presents concepts and early prototypes for easily applicable instruments. The artifacts significantly facilitate planning, execution, and control of collaborative innovation processes by proving rule-based integration, structuring, and visualizing means for documented knowledge in networks.",Matheis H.; Lau A.; Hirsch M.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,DITF Denkendorf,collaborative innovation ;  diverse teams ;  innovation method ;  SME networks ;  technological support
Visualizing the evolution of bioinformatics: Chronological networks created by textual analysis of intelligent systems for molecular biology 1998-2006,"This study aimed to uncover the evolutionary processes behind the developments in the field of bioinformatics by analyzing prestigious conference presentations reflecting the prominent research in the field. Bioinformatics was selected as a representative interdisciplinary research field. Textual analyses on the abstracts of proceedings papers produced chronological networks of conference sessions. In those networks, divergent session nodes corresponded to practical papers that proposed fundamental technologies promoting new research. Convergent session nodes corresponded to papers that combined various theories and methodologies proposed in the past. The convergent session nodes play a significant role in innovation, which brings together complementary knowledge derived from different backgrounds. A joint chronological network shows a differentiation between pure scientific research and applied research, contributed to the benefit of the general public. These findings were obtained by assessing the chronological networks that reflect future perspectives on session titles in scholarly communities.",Furukawa T.; Okuwada K.; Hayashi K.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Japan Science and Technology Agency;Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;National Institute of Science and Technology Policy,Bioinformatics ;  Conference session ;  Evolutionary process ;  Textual analysis ;  Visualization
"Information flows and risk management in innovation-driven, collaborative ventures","Risk management intertwines with information exchange in any collaborative venture. We consider four aspects of risk management (standard, compliance, security and disaster/catastrophe) with very different types of handlers, and often with different teams being responsible. Comprehensive assurance requires satisfaction of the criteria for each aspect, but each has its own perspective and knowledge base, and these are not always well-aligned or easily integrated. Creating a comprehensive risk management plan requires correlation of these aspects, and we therefore examine the information flows needed between their handlers and their respective teams. We then analyze the interaction of information flows and risk analysis in collaborative projects involving innovation, knowledge-rich environments, and knowledge-generating products such as software-intensive systems. In particular, we focus on inter-organizational ventures, in which organizational interests and perspectives form another obstacle to effective risk management, and consider other impacts on collaboration.",Marlowe T.; Kirova V.; Jastroch N.; Ku C.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Nokia Corporation;Seton Hall University;William Paterson University;MET Communications,collaborative software development ;  information flow ;  Knowledge management ;  risk management
An empirical investigation of living lab ageing care innovations adoption in Chinese healthcare industry,"Living Lab is an emerging user-driven open innovation approach. Although innovation adoption has been an active research area for quite a long time, it seems that little empirical studies have been done on the Living Lab innovation adoption research. In this paper, we present empirical results from a study of Living Lab ageing care innovations adoption in Chinese healthcare industry. Our empirical findings from analyses of a survey data suggest that partners' readiness and government support are two major determinant of adoption. Security, cost and usefulness were also found to have a strong effect on the adoption intention. Given the rapid development of Living Lab innovations in healthcare areas, our findings have both practical implications to Living Lab innovations practitioners and theoretical implications to innovation adoption.",Tang T.; Hamalainen M.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Aalto University,ageing care ;  healthcare ;  Innovation adoption ;  Living Lab
Scanning the technological environment for supporting radical innovation: A case from the Italian machinery industry,"Technology intelligence is becoming increasingly relevant in this economic crisis, as a managerial process that stimulates and supports radical innovation and the creation of new business. Technology scanning, i.e. learning about any technological development which could have an impact on the future (Mortara et al., 2008) is probably the most difficult type of technology intelligence process. At the moment, the literature on technology intelligence does not yet provide a model for technology scanning aimed at supporting radical innovation. The paper aims at filling this gap and proposes a theoretical model for technology scanning. The model is then applied and tested in an Italian company operating in the industrial machinery industry, in the context of radical innovation. The results of the application allows to discuss the applicability and generalization of the model, and give some suggestions for future research on the topic.",Manzini R.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Università Carlo Cattaneo,machinery industry ;  open innovation ;  radical innovation ;  Technology intelligence ;  technology scanning
Education for responsible technology transfer in Kenya: Towards a conceptual underpinning for HE in the development of the Jua Kali sector,"Creativity and innovation, fundamental elements upon which Kenya's economy is expected to grow, are embedded in Kenya Vision 2030, the country's blue print for economic growth and industrialisation. Though expected to play a role in this process, the production oriented informal sector employs a large number of semiskilled artisans that have little formal education. Calls for empowering and capacitating the informal sector have led to the problematisation of the creative and cultural industry, but the Jua Kali sector has not had direct mention in terms of quality addition for its creative and production enterprises. This paper presents a response to the challenges of technological education, highlighting various government policy initiatives and the special role that higher education can play in responsible skills and technology transfer. Using the Technical University of Kenya (TU-K) as a case, the proposed intervention may be suitable for similar institutions of technology in Kenya and elsewhere.",Akuno E.; Kidenda M.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Technical University of Kenya,Jua Kali ;  policy ;  Technology ;  training
Agents and rules for the negotiation of interoperability solutions,"Competitiveness in the specialised and diversified global markets keeps pushing enterprises to abandon their traditional product centrism and instead concentrate their efforts in very narrow specialisation fields, relying on networks of other providers that are able to fulfil their needs towards the development of complete solutions. In that vision, given the heterogeneity of the globalised collaborations and the constant demand for change, innovation, and compliance to more exigent rules, it becomes very difficult for enterprises to cope with the pace of change. This paper proposes the implementation of a framework based on agents and rules to achieve solid and stable integration of solutions, via the use of a strong and formal negotiation mechanism. This negotiation will be the basis for increasing the enterprise interoperability in the supply chain for the development of solutions.",Santos T.; Coutinho C.; Cretan A.; Jardim-Goncalves R.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Universitatea Nicolae Titulescu;Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa;Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias,Agents ;  Interoperability ;  Negotiation ;  Rules engine
In-/tangible assets as a service in manufacturing service ecosystems,"To compete in dynamic, globalized markets manufacturers shift from product-centric to service-oriented engineering paradigms and join forces in Manufacturing Service Ecosystems. They combine technological competences, knowledge about materials, as well as production capabilities in order to offer innovative product-services to existing or emerging markets. Even though best practices as well as scientific reports proof huge advances in concurrent engineering and collaborative innovation, recent studies show economic necessity for increasing effectiveness and efficiency of managing in-/tangible assets in manufacturing ecosystems. By taking advantage of formal semantics, the virtualization method outlined in this paper allows for transforming real-world in-/tangible assets into In-/Tangible Assets as a Service. Evaluation within four industrial use cases demonstrates that In-/Tangible Assets as a Service significantly facilitate identification, communication, and finally composition of in-/tangible assets in Manufacturing Service Ecosystem and thus empower its members to deploy highly innovative product-services to the market.",Hirsch M.; Opresnik D.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Politecnico di Milano;Centre for Management Research,In-/Tangible Asset as a Service ;  Manufacturing Service Ecosystem ;  Service-Orientation ;  Virtualization

A structured team building method for collaborative crowdsourcing,"The traditional crowdsourcing approach consists in open calls that give the access to a worldwide crowd potentially able to solve particular problems or perform small tasks. However, over the years crowdsourcing platforms have started to select narrower groups of skilled solvers basing on their expertise, in order to ensure quality and effectiveness of the final result. As a consequence, the selection and allocation of the most appropriate team for the resolution of different types of problems have become a critical process. The present research aims to highlight the main variables to assess solvers capabilities and provides a skills-based methodology for advanced team building in collaborative crowdsourcing contexts. The method focuses on selecting the most suitable team to face a determined problem as well as on tracking the evolution of individuals skills over the performed challenges.

"Innovative system to determine hidden cost of poor quality to enhance labor productivity and profitability for construction entrepreneurs, a case study","Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ) would not have been expended if the job is done right the first time. Some researchers claim that COPQ ranging between 22 to 32% of total revenues remains hidden and project managers fail to initiate corrective actions. COPQ is an un-necessary burden; it reduces productivity and profitability. Therefore, an innovative system is required to identify and measure COPQ at construction projects to initiate prompt corrective actions. The researchers innovated a COPQ system and tested on a public sector construction project to find its effectiveness in reducing COPQ and enhancing labor productivity and profitability. After the sixty-days study project the COPQ reduced from 40.43% to 16.65%, labor productivity improved by 16.88% and profitability increased by 10.45%. This study validated the COPQ system for use on construction projects to bring continuous improvement in labor productivity and profitability of construction companies.",Mahmood S.; Shahrukh.; Ishaque A.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,University of Engineering and Technology Taxila,Construction Industry ;  Cost of Poor Quality ;  Innovation ;  Productivity ;  Profitability
Dusting off Social innovation system,"In reference to the Innovation System theory of inter-connected and process oriented innovation, the Social Innovation System concept in our study is an inter-connection of things in developing, diffusing and utilizing innovation targeting social issues or needs. The growing popularity and support for Social Innovation, has triggered us to analyse the scholarly contributions with the aid Innovation Systems theory. We assumed that the Innovation System theory might broaden our understanding of the emerging Social Innovation System concept. The corpus review of 15 peer-reviewed articles resulted in a Cartesian plane with four axes namely: institutional, organizational, and social - public good and quality of life. The study indicates that Innovation System theories do not account for Society or Social as a passive or an active participant in the Innovation process. Therefore we posit that current theories must go beyond Local, Regional, National, Sectoral, and Technological to include Social.",Fulgencio H.; Le Fever H.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Universiteit Leiden,Innovation system ;  social innovation system
"Innovation capability, entrepreneurial orientation and performance within European network of living labs (ENoLL)","A survey instrument has been designed to capture basic demographics of the unit of observation - an individual living lab (LL) and to study the relationships between: 1. perceived LL Innovation Capability 2. perceived LL Entrepreneurial Orientation, 3. perceived LL Business Performance. This paper focuses on reducing the number of items across all the dimensions of the survey instrument by using unweighted least squares ULS solution. A total reduction of items from 109 to 65 across the entire survey instrument has been achieved. A link to an online survey has been sent to ∼320 Living Lab managers within the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL). Roughly 10% of responses from the entire population have been obtained through the process. On average, living labs are fairly opened and user centred innovation ecosystems characterised by strong, yet surprisingly risk-averse innovation cultures with rather flat management structures, relatively low internal and external competitive pressures, lack of sufficient resources for further development and relatively low scores related to perceived performance.",Krawczyk P.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Jyväskylän ammattikorkeakoulu,ENoLL ;  Entrepreneurial Orientation ;  Innovation Capability ;  Living Lab ;  Performance
The matching process for innovation partnerships: A multi-sided market perspective,"Many studies exist about open innovation as transfer of innovations inside and outside of the firm or as joint projects in collaborative partnerships. In this paper, we investigate the matchmaking between innovation seekers and innovation providers, with the focus on asymmetric partnerships between incumbent large companies and young entrepreneurial firms. In particular, we introduce the matchmaking problem as a multi-sided market with different internal and external agents and describe the phenomenon. Furthermore, the matching process on a multi-sided market is presented based on existing literature and an in-depth participatory action study.",Holzmann T.; Sailer K.; Katzy B.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Hochschule München;Universität der Bundeswehr München;Strascheg Center for Entrepreneurship,Asymmetric Partnerships ;  Collaborative Innovation ;  Matching Process ;  Multi-Sided Markets
Engineering innovation methodology using evolutionary game theory,"In the production industry, the development speed of new product has increased after the introduction of CAE tools and the modularization of product structure. In this situation, it is more difficult to keep corporate businesses profitable through developing new products based on the competitive differences in product concept. Most of commercially available innovative products are created by combining current technologies. There are, however, a few discussions about the methodology of technology combinations. In this paper, the authors present a product innovation model of the technology combination that successfully implicates the Evolutionary Game Theory to describe the technology and product innovation process. As illustrative example, Apple iPod was selected to explain the methodology.",Kato T.; Nishida A.; Koshijima I.; Umeda T.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Chiba Institute of Technology;Nagoya Institute of Technology,Engineering Innovation ;  Evolutionary Game Theory ;  Product Innovation
Spaces for responsible innovation in entrepreneurship - A conceptual analysis,"Responsible research and innovation (RRI) is a concept that is currently being heavily promoted by research funders, led by the European Commission. Research undertaken in the next Framework Programme, Horizon 2020, is expected to be led by RRI which will be a cross-cutting theme of all European funded research. National funders (e.g. the Dutch NVO or British EPSRC) are similarly experimenting with RRI. One problem of this current discourse is that it is heavily weighted in favour of publicly funded research and innovation activities. It mostly neglects the important role that entrepreneurs outside of publicly funded research can play. This paper therefore explores the relationship of RRI and entrepreneurship in a technological environment. It does so by offering a comparison of an entrepreneur, a technology entrepreneur, an intrapreneur and a manager. It then moves to the description of the space of RRI which is constituted by the three axes of actors, activities and normative foundations. This space of RRI is then explored to locate possible roles of entrepreneurship. This provides a conceptual basis for future empirical research as well as policy interventions in an international context.",Stahl B.; Brem A.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,De Montfort University;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,entrepreneurship ;  intrapreneur ;  management ;  Responsible research and innovation

Ten niche strategies to commercialize new high-tech products,"There are serious gaps in the scientific literature relating to niche strategies as a means for commercializing new high-tech products. In particular, there is no clarity about what types of niche strategies can be distinguished, or how a niche strategy can be selected to suit a certain situation. In this paper, we identify generic actors, factors and functions that play a role in the commercialization of high-tech products, and that can form barriers to large-scale diffusion, thereby necessitating the implementation of a niche strategy. We analyse thirty-six different market situations and assess historical cases to identify the niche strategies that emerged. We find ten generic niche strategies, each of which can be applied in a number of situations. We present a model to aid managers in purposefully selecting an appropriate niche strategy.",Ortt J.; Langley D.; Pals N.,Conference Proceeding,"2013 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE 2013 and IEEE International Technology Management Conference, ITMC 2013",2015-12-10,Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek- TNO;Delft University of Technology,barriers ;  high-tech ;  Innovation systems ;  large-scale diffusion ;  niche strategies
Collaborative trend scouting and roadmapping,Trend scouting and roadmapping is no longer the task of a small team of specialists. As participation of the crowd can be fostered by applying Web 2.0 technologies the innovation process has become more collaborative. User generated content together with proper navigation and visualization features enables such a process. In this paper two different but similar types of radars are introduced. The future radar gives an overview on socio-economical long-term trends while the innovation radar includes roadmaps of technological developments and business ideas.

Preparing ECE students for research career in nanotechnology via track program,"This paper details the research participation of undergraduate students from the freshman to the senior year. Four courses were designated to prepare students for a nanotechnology research career. New modes of instructions leading to research participation followed in this curriculum have been reported. This covers integration of knowledge, just in time approach, and project portfolio based curriculum. Courses developed in this track emphasize research and applications in health sciences and renewable energy areas. The structure of the track program was presented before with emphasis on the senior level courses of the track. The work in this paper, however, emphasizes research participation in nanotechnology of the junior students within the electrical engineering, computer engineering, and mechanical engineering disciplines. The multidisciplinary components in nanotechnology research topics were attractive to students to work in team. The topics covered in this course included nanotechnology applications in diabetes, cancer research, and neurosciences. Lecture materials were all from up-to-date research papers, and can be altered with the course updates. Students registered for this course were required to emphasize two research topics seven week each, and prepare research posters in a research day where industrial representatives are invited to participate in the discussions with students. Students who completed this course were interested to continue with nanotechnology individual research and get enrolled in upper level courses. The course starts with introducing students to the nanotechnology applications in various fields, including environment, society, consumer electronics, computers, health sciences, optics, electromagnetics, energy, and medical imaging. The course then introduces students to research issues emphasizing health sciences and renewable energy. Students will be required to expand their research to cover in depth one or two research issues that fall within their interests. In the research projects, students work in team, two students/team, and assignment is given to bath to share the contribution of the project. The course was assessed with student satisfaction, and the objectives and the outcomes of the course were met.",Rizkalla M.; Agarwal M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-12-02,Purdue School of Engineering and Technology;Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,innovation ;  multidisciplinary ;  research career in nanotechnology ;  undergraduate research projects ;  undergraduate track
Design and practice from the micromouse competition to the undergraduate curriculum,"This article has probed an innovative conversion from micromouse competition to a systematic curriculum design that integrates practice with theory. Micromouse competition is an event where small robot mice are designed to solve a 16×16 maze. The process includes multi-disciplinary knowledge such as electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering and algorithm design. Limited by the competition rules, micromouse is easy to learn but difficult to master, which provides a high suitability with the teaching processes of foundation courses of embedded system for undergraduate students. This paper elaborates the emphasis, difficulties and innovation of the conversion process, of which the core is student engagement. In the class, students must take part in the whole micromouse design progress to comprehend the interactive method of hardware and software of embedded devices and strengthen the ability of applying professional skills. Students are required to participate in the entire micromouse building process, including welding, assembling, environment building, debugging and finishing the competition in groups. This curriculum focuses on training students' research interests, competition skills and teamwork spirit. Final examination scores are mainly based on each group's ranking in the final round, and technology innovators will be given appropriate incentives.",Dai S.; Zhao B.; Li Z.; Dai M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-12-02,Beijing Jiaotong University,Academic competitions ;  Innovative teaching ;  Micromouse ;  Practice course
"The experiences of setting up, developing and implementing a mobile learning project in Croatia: The SCOLLAm project","This paper problematizes the challenges of setting up a new mobile learning project in a Croatia, a country where technology-enhanced tools in classrooms are not often used due to a number of reasons, two of which are the lack of infrastructure and no teacher professional development. There are three focal points of this paper: designing scalable and durable mobile learning solution, working with teachers in order to ensure an adequate teacher development and creating appropriate digital contents to match primary school level 2, 3 and 4 curriculum. Scalable and durable mobile learning solutions in the context of this project include two main platforms: (1) a mobile learning tablet application for primary school students and (2) a designer application mainly aimed at digital contents designers and producers, to also be easily used by the teachers. On the other side, it describes the processes of strengthening digital competences of the participating school teachers, including technology competence, leadership capacity and technology supported curricular innovation processes. Thirdly, the issues of design and implementation of digital lessons are explored with a special focus on digitalization of the existing non-digital lessons together with the teachers, wherever appropriate and feasible. As a result, conceptual prototypes of digital lessons are produced to be analyzed and discussed amongst teachers and researchers, after which the selected ones get integrated into digital lessons for tablet computer. In addition to describing the threefold process and the accompanying issues, the paper presents preliminary experiences and results in this novel research initiative, sets up mid-term goals and proposes and adequate methodology in achieving the project goals.",Jagušt T.; Mekterović I.; Botički I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-12-02,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing",educational technology ;  informal learning ;  mobile applications ;  mobile learning ;  tablet computers
Landscape analysis as a tool in the curricular change process,"The Center for Engineering Pathways to Innovation (Epicenter)'s initiative for faculty development and institutional change - called Pathways to Innovation (Pathways) - is working with U.S. engineering schools to embed innovation and entrepreneurship learning opportunities into the undergraduate experience. Pathways' program design is grounded in the literature that identifies 'best practices' in faculty development and institutional change. Each participating institution begins its work with a process of documenting resources (assets) and identifying gaps at their school to create a 'landscape analysis.' That analysis then becomes the basis for identifying well-defined objectives for focused work to create meaningful change over a short period. The mapping process itself becomes a vehicle through which a large number of stakeholders throughout the institution are engaged. While this process of asset mapping is well-referenced in change literature, its application to curricular change is novel. The specific objectives of the Epicenter project are to increase the access to innovation and entrepreneurship learning opportunities for undergraduate engineering students; however, aspects of the landscape analysis process are relevant to a much wider audience of faculty and administrators seeking to implement curricular change beyond one instructor and/or one course. This paper reviews the research underpinnings of the landscape tool and describes its evolution based on early formative evaluation. Further, the paper illustrates the tool's use in more than 35 engineering schools with widely-varying profiles (i.e., public/private, small/large, rural/urban) and reports on how the tool has been used by teams to identify appropriate change strategies and increase engagement in their project by stakeholders. Finally, the paper identifies future directions and uses for the tool as well as possible topics for future research.",Nilsen E.; Matthew V.; Besterfield-Sacre M.; Monroe-White T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-12-02,University of Pittsburgh;SageFox Consulting Group;VentureWell,curricular change ;  entrepreneurship ;  evaluation ;  faculty development ;  innovation ;  institutional change

Connecting and expanding the emerging engineering education research & innovation (EER&I) communities,"Currently there is a lot of emphasis on engineering education research (EER) and engineering education innovation (EEI). In the EER domain, several universities have established or are considering establishing engineering education research centers and PhD programs. In the EEI domain, the National Academy of Engineering launched the Frontiers of Engineering Education (FOEE) symposium and NSF recast CCLI as TUES, and more recently IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education). In 2014 NSF funded a pilot implementation of the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning (I-Corps™ L) and additional cohorts have been conducted and are planned. The growth of interest in the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) has great potential to contribute to EER and EEI as indicated by the response to the ASEE Virtual Communities of Practice (VCP) project. Faculty and graduate students interested in engineering education research and innovation (EER&I) are widely distributed and often isolated in their department and institution. Many are eager to meet and interact with colleagues who have similar interests.

Exploring the black box of dissemination: The role of professional and organizational development,"The field of engineering education has initiated a focus on ensuring engineering education research is disseminated and implemented within the classroom. Numerous researchers have investigated the reasons for the adoption of evidence-based practices, or, more often, the lack thereof. The Professional and Organizational Development (POD) network community is an underutilized potential ally for ensuring the implementation of engineering education research due to their focus on organizational change and improving teaching practice. Using the Diffusion of Innovation framework and best practices for adoption, this session will guide faculty in envisioning a wide variety of channels for moving engineering education research into the classroom. Participants in this special session will brainstorm ways to encourage collaboration between these two communities culminating in a 'message in a bottle' to the POD community to help them understand the activities and needs of engineering education researchers. This message will be delivered to faculty development professionals, centers for teaching and learning, organizational change specialists, and others in the POD community at their annual conference in November 2015.",Cutler S.; Strong A.; Chua M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-12-02,College of Engineering;Franklin W.

Student evaluations of team members: Is there gender bias?,"The ability to work effectively in teams is a critical learning outcome for engineering students. It is among the ABET requirements and a skill desired by employers for it is integral to innovation, product development, and to a positive working environment. Many engineering courses provide students with opportunities to develop their team skills through projects, in-class activities, and other assignments. Peer assessment of team skills increases student accountability to teammates, helps students gauge what is expected from them, and assists instructors in assigning course grades. However, there are few studies examining whether gender bias occurs during peer assessment. This work aims to address this gap. Using a randomized experiment, this study examines whether there are differences in how students evaluate the performance of male and female team members. The survey participants include 590 first-year engineering students at a research institution in the Midwest. Each participant rated and evaluated the skills and qualities of a fictional team member. The description of the fictional team member is exactly the same, except the name assigned to the fictional member was randomly depicted as female or male. The results indicate that there is no difference in how students evaluate male and female fictional team members. The female team members, however, received higher ratings related to their contributions and punctuality. These findings are consistent with previous research on gender bias on teaming evaluations at the undergraduate level, and suggest that peer assessments may be a useful method to provide students with additional feedback regarding their team skills.",Main J.; Sánchez-Peña M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-12-02,Purdue University,gender bias ;  peer evaluation ;  team skills ;  undergraduate students
Enterprise architecture of Colombian Higher Education,"Colombian Higher Education Enterprise Architecture is a framework for managing the system-of-systems lifecycle of Higher Education Programs. With this framework is possible to model scenarios about the government as a regulator of Higher Education services, the educational institutions as providers of higher education services and the different business and social sectors, and individual citizens as clients of higher education services. Under this perspective all the stakeholders can participate in the planning, development, transfer, use and control of all the products and services lifecycles of higher education in order to prioritize improvement alternatives and measure progress when it is moving towards excellence in training processes, research, innovation, development and knowledge transfer. CHE2A is a supportive environment for the management of higher education as a public service, which hosts the vision of 'Global Coalition Intelligent Network Services (-GIUNC-) to analyze and evaluate systematic, systemic and logistically, the characteristics of processes, outputs and outcomes and risks through key factors such as those proposed by the - GIUNC- itself, Registry of Qualification established by the Ministry of Education of Colombia or other similar factors established by national or international entities, from which, the stakeholders in the Higher Education services, interpret, evaluate, argue, propose, define, plan, implement and measure strategies, tactics and actions for improvement, innovation and development higher education programs. CHE2A is a knowledge management system that is enriched by the experience of organizations and supports innovation in higher education toward a high performance service.

Multifaceted assessment of ideation: using networks to link ideation and design activity,"Ideation is core to the innovation process, and has been the subject of study across a range of fields, from psychology to engineering. However, despite substantial progress in outcome-based descriptions of idea generation, research has often resulted in more questions than answers. For example, open questions remain with respect to the differences in behaviour related to ideation between novices and experts, the change in rates of ideation over time in different design teams, and the changing role of ideation from conceptual to detailed design. In each of these cases, robust explanation has proved elusive due to difficulties in characterising the ideation process itself. This paper discusses a major new approach for elucidating ideation and its related design processes through direct observation. A novel network visualisation approach is demonstrated in practice for the first time. This uses network analysis to link ideas dynamically to both the engineering context and the wider design process. This linking analysis gives a substantial new insight into what drives ideation and how previously inscrutable results can potentially be explained by linking ideation into other design processes.",Cash P.; Štorga M.,Journal,Journal of Engineering Design,2015-12-02,Technical University of Denmark;University of Zagreb,creativity and innovation ;  descriptive models of the design process ;  empirical study ;  human creativity ;  psychology of creativity

Review of supporting and refuting evidence for Innovation Engineering practices,"Innovation Engineering (IE) is an educational training program that presents tools and advice on product innovation in three main categories: Create, idea generation; Communicate, communicating ideas; and Commercialize, selecting ideas to invest in further. The concepts taught in IE include common suggestions for early-stage product innovation. This paper addresses a challenge of implementing the IE program, specifically that it does not provide peer-reviewed sources or adequate data to substantiate its approach. This lack of substantiation limits effective implementation at companies. This paper also takes a step in examining IE's claims that it is 'a new science' and a 'new field of academic study', a topic motivated by the Design Science Journal's aim to serve as the archival venue of science-based design knowledge across multiple disciplines. This paper provides a compilation of academic literature that has tested the tools and advice espoused by IE. Almost all included papers contain test-versus-control experimental evidence. A mix of supporting and refuting evidence was found. Overall, the work provides a useful compilation of evidence-of-effectiveness related to common innovation and design practices that spans different design stages and is applicable for multiple disciplines and industries. This evidence comes from a variety of sources, including design, engineering education, psychology, marketing, and management. The work can also serve as an approach to evaluate overarching approaches to design in general, specifically, testing the foundations by vetting related test-versus-control experimental studies.",Du P.; Miller C.; Macdonald E.; Gormley P.,Journal,Design Science,2015-12-01,NC State College of Engineering;College of Engineering;Stanford Engineering;Iowa State University,creativity ;  idea generation ;  ideation ;  innovation ;  product development
Supporting sustained adoption of education innovations: The Designing for Sustained Adoption Assessment Instrument,"Background: Every year, significant effort and resources are expended around the world to develop innovative instructional strategies and materials to improve undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education. Despite convincing evidence of efficacy with respect to student learning, most will struggle to become successfully propagated to reach widespread use. To help developers improve their propagation plans and to encourage sustained adoption, we have developed an assessment instrument that supports development, analysis, evaluation, and refinement of propagation plans. Results: Based on our synthesis of the literature, our analysis of successfully propagated innovations, and our analysis of a subset of funded NSF CCLI proposals, we argue that a primary reason for the lack of adoption is that developers focus their efforts on dissemination (spreading the word) instead of propagation (promoting successful adoption). To help developers focus on development of more effective propagation plans, the Designing for Sustained Adoption Assessment Instrument (DSAAI) is based on three primary bodies of literature: (1) change theory, (2) instructional systems, and (3) effective propagation strategies. The assessment instrument was designed in the form of a rubric to help education developers identify strengths and areas for improvement of their propagation plans. Based on extensive testing across several different groups of users, the DSAAI is divided into four main sections: identification of product type, features of target instructional strategies and/or materials, a propagation activities checklist, and aspects of the propagation plans that influence likelihood of successful propagation. Conclusions: The instrument has proven useful for a variety of audiences to evaluate and improve proposals and current research projects. Education developers who provided feedback during the development of this assessment instrument found it useful because it helped them not only evaluate their propagation plans but also become aware of other strategies they could use to help develop and disseminate products of current projects, as well as strategies for supporting future adopters. Grant writing consultants can use it to provide feedback to their clients, and funding agencies can use parts of the DSAAI framework to evaluate grant proposals.",Stanford C.; Cole R.; Froyd J.; Friedrichsen D.; Khatri R.; Henderson C.,Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2015-12-01,College of Liberal Arts and Sciences;College of Engineering;College of Engineering;Western Michigan University,Change theory ;  Educational innovations ;  Effective propagation strategies ;  Instructional system ;  Proposal writing
Tissue engineering and regeneration using biodegradable scaffolds,"A number of people across the world suffer from various diseases or genetic defects and many of these patients die because of the lack of the availability of ideal tissue substitute and/or treatment. An important aspect of the disease is its association with the loss of tissue function. Many end-stage diseases and/or complete organ failure often require total or partial organ transplantation to restore functionality. However, such transplantation surgeries are not always successful because of the organ/ tissue rejection and also the scarcity of donors. Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering aim to improve or repair the function of a dysfunctional tissue or organ. In spite of the many advances in tissue engineering methods, the ield of regenerative medicine still awaits acceptable designs of bioscaffolds that are clinically tenable. Design of scaffolds and the nature of biomaterial used to make the scaffolds dictate cell behavior and function. Several approaches are currently being tried to optimize the design and improve the quality of the biomaterials. Innervation, vascularization and proper cell differentiation that are inluenced by the biomaterials, are few challenges that need to be optimized along with the choice of stem cells that can be employed. Extracellular matrix scaffolds have proven to be a better choice for cartilage and bone repair while the ibrin, polyglycolate and polylactate etc are still being developed. Future research and technological innovations are still needed for a better choice of biomaterials that can support the tissue regeneration without causing any immune or inflammatory response from the host and which last for longer periods.",Zhang X.; Zhang Y.,Journal,Panminerva Medica,2015-12-01,Xiangya Hospital Central South University,Biocompatible materials ;  Extracellular matrix ;  Fibrin ;  Regenerative medicine ;  Stem cells ;  Tissue engineering
"Temporal trends in motor vehicle fatalities in the United States, 1968 to 2010 - a joinpoint regression analysis","Background: In the past 40 years, a variety of factors might have impacted motor vehicle (MV) fatality trends in the US, including public health policies, engineering innovations, trauma care improvements, etc. These factors varied in their timing across states/localities, and many were targeted at particular population subgroups. In order to identify and quantify differential rates of change over time and differences in trend patterns between population subgroups, this study employed a novel analytic method to assess temporal trends in MV fatalities between 1968 and 2010, by age group and sex. Methods: Cause-specific MV fatality data from traffic injuries between 1968 and 2010, based on death certificates filed in the 50 states, and DC were obtained from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER). Long-term (1968 to 2010) and short-term (log-linear piecewise segments) trends in fatality rates were compared for males and females overall and in four separate age groups using joinpoint regression. Results: MV fatalities declined on average by 2.4% per year in males and 2.2% per year in females between 1968 and 2010, with significant declines observed in all age groups and in both sexes. In males overall and those 25 to 64 years, sharp declines between 1968 and mid-to-late 1990s were followed by a stalling until the mid-2000s, but rates in females experienced a long-term steady decline of a lesser magnitude than males during this time. Trends in those aged <1 to 14 years and 15 to 24 years were mostly steady over time, but males had a larger decline than females in the latter age group between 1968 and the mid-2000s. In ages 65+, short-term trends were similar between sexes. Conclusions: Despite significant long-term declines in MV fatalities, the application of Joinpoint Regression found that progress in young adult and middle-aged adult males stalled in recent decades and rates in males declined relatively more than in females in certain age groups. Future research is needed to establish the causes of these observed trends, including the potential role of contemporaneous MV-related policies and their repeal. Such research is needed in order to better inform the design and evaluation of future population interventions addressing MV fatalities nationally.",Bandi P.; Silver D.; Mijanovich T.; Macinko J.,Journal,Injury Epidemiology,2015-12-01,NYU Steinhardt,
Using Triz-based innovation principles and a process as problem solving methods for hosiery tourism factories,"The objective of this study is to establish an innovation principles and a problem solving process for tourism factories. During the process for innovative and improving the service quality, this study can provide a feasible scientific method. In this study, purposively sampling was adopted and the research object was the hosiery tourism factories. Firstly, the PZB service quality model with five factors was adopted to estimate the service quality. Secondly, the TRIZ-Based Innovation Principles was employed; also, the original TRIZ engineering parameters was transformed into service parameters of tourism factories to establish TRIZ service quality parameters. Finally, the contradiction matrix and the 40 TRIZ-based Innovation Principles were employed to design and propose an innovative problem solving process for service quality of tourism factories. The results showed that the application of TRIZ-Based Innovation Principles can be used to solve the service quality of tourism factories. For example, the service quality, listening voice of the customer and personalized services quality could be improved at the same time by Using TRIZ-based innovation principles for hosiery tourism factories. According to the proposed matrix and innovation principle, it is useful to investigate and analyze the conflict of service quality, and provided scientific basis for the improved and innovative service quality and innovative activities.",Lin M.; Chuang T.,Journal,Journal of Quality,2015-12-01,MingDao University,Hosiery tourism factory ;  PZB service quality model ;  TRIZ-based innovation principles
"The importance of context: an exploration of factors influencing the adoption of student-centered teaching among chemistry, biology, and physics faculty","Background: Research at the secondary and postsecondary levels has clearly demonstrated the critical role that individual and contextual characteristics play in instructors’ decision to adopt educational innovations. Although recent research has shed light on factors influencing the teaching practices of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty, it is still not well understood how unique departmental environments impact faculty adoption of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) within the context of a single institution. In this study, we sought to characterize the communication channels utilized by STEM faculty, as well as the contextual and individual factors that influence the teaching practices of STEM faculty at the departmental level. Accordingly, we collected survey and observational data from the chemistry, biology, and physics faculty at a single large research-intensive university in the USA. We then compared the influencing factors experienced by faculty in these different departments to their instructional practices. Results: Analyses of the survey data reveal disciplinary differences in the factors influencing adoption of EBIPs. In particular, the physics faculty (n = 15) had primarily student-centered views about teaching and experienced the most positive contextual factors toward adoption of EBIPs. At the other end of the spectrum, the chemistry faculty (n = 20) had primarily teacher-centered views and experienced contextual factors that hindered the adoption of student-centered practices. Biology faculty (n = 25) fell between these two groups. Classroom observational data reflected these differences: The physics classrooms were significantly more student-centered than the chemistry classrooms. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that disciplinary differences exist in the contextual factors teaching conceptions that STEM faculty experience and hold, even among faculty within the same institution. Moreover, it shows that these differences are associated to the level of adoption of student-centered teaching practices. This work has thus identified the critical need to carefully characterize STEM faculty’s departmental environment and conceptions about teaching before engaging in instructional reform efforts, and to adapt reform activities to account for these factors. The results of this study also caution the overgeneralization of findings from a study focused on one type of STEM faculty in one environment to all STEM faculty in any environment.",Lund T.; Stains M.,Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2015-12-01,University of Nebraska–Lincoln;Oregon Institute of Technology,Beliefs about teaching ;  Biology ;  Chemistry ;  Contextual factors ;  Diffusion of innovation ;  Evidence-based instructional practices ;  Physics ;  Research-intensive institution ;  Student-centered teaching

A quantitative study of influencing factors on crowd participation in a crowdsourcing project for consumer product design,"Nowadays, crowdsourcing has become a popular concept and is widely used in many social, economical and technological areas. For consumer product design, crowdsourcing is implemented extensively with many cases. Although there has been a lot of research on the application of crowdsourcing for product design, the big picture of how factors influence the participartion of individuals from the crowd in a crowdsourcing project for product design has not yet been understood. This paper aims to investigate the relationships of crowd participation and influencing factors including: process, product, and reward. To do this, we conducted a survey on a crowd of engineering individuals and analyzed the collected data with data mining techniques. Main findings include the relationships of crowd participation versus process, product, and reward factors as well as regression models to predict crowd participation.",Tran T.; Park J.,Journal,Industrial Engineering and Management Systems,2015-12-01,"Dongguk University, Seoul",Crowd participation ;  Crowdsourcing ;  NPD ;  Open innovation ;  Product design and development
High-Modulus Geocells for Sustainable Highway Infrastructure,"Technological innovation in geosynthetics such as high modulus (stiff) geocells (cellular confinement systems) can help achieve a more sustainable highway infrastructure. Research, testing, field trails, and case studies demonstrate how geocells increase pavement performance on one hand, while achieving sustainable goals on the other. Recent published research and testing of high-modulus Novel Polymeric Alloy (NPA) geocell-reinforced bases are briefly reviewed in this paper. NPA geocells improved strength and rigidity of flexible pavements as indicated by: increased modulus of structural layers, reduced stresses to the lower layers and decreased surface degradation. Field trials validate that NPA geocells improve the modulus of road base layers, even while reducing the structural thickness and utilizing on-site or recycled materials for structural infill. Sustainable roads can be built with less virgin resources and a smaller environmental footprint, while extending the pavement service life and decreasing maintenance.",Kief O.; Schary Y.; Pokharel S.,Journal,Indian Geotechnical Journal,2015-12-01,PR,Base reinforcement ;  Cellular confinement system ;  Geocell ;  Reinforced pavements ;  Sustainable highways ;  Sustainable roads ;  Unpaved roads
"Applications of newly developed nanostructural and microporous materials in biomedical, tissue and mechanical engineering","Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to present the main results of own research in 3 principal aspects indicating that the research is up to date and modern. This relates to nanotechnologies, modern biomedical materials and rapid manufacturing techniques used for the production of, in particular, microporous materials applied for medical and dental purposes. The paper comprises the explanation of structural mechanisms and phase transformations taking place in newly created engineering nanostructural and microporous materials under the influence of the applied, advanced technological processes newly developed, and especially nanotechnological processes, using the most modern scientific and research equipment being at disposal of modern materials engineering, in particular with the common use of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The results of investigations into the formation of the structure and surface properties results according to a different thickness scale of coatings or surface zone, from several hundred nanometres to several millimetres, are presented in the paper, including PVD and CVD coatings and laser treated surface on the steels and light alloys substrates. The paper also describes the nanostructural effects in solid materials, and especially the counteraction of cracking of new-developed high-manganese austenite steels Fe-Mn-Si-Al by twinning or/and martensitic transformation induced by the cold plastic deformation. The article also outlines the results of research of the development of special micro and nanocomposite materials designed mainly for use in regenerative medicine and regenerative dentistry. The studies of the structure and the properties of newly obtained materials and originally developed technologies are included to present the author’s contribution into materials science, nanotechnology, surface engineering and biomedical engineering including the usefulness of the newly developed nanoengineering materials and their applicability, in particular, in regenerative medicine, as well as tissue engineering. The described outcomes of the research constitute a basis for creating, apart from rigid porous implant-scaffolds, an innovative generation of rigid and elastic biological-engineering composite materials for regenerative medicine. Design/methodology/approach: The article discusses the key aspects of own research performed over the last decade in scope of nanotechnologies, modern biomedical materials and rapid manufacturing techniques used for the fabrication of, in particular, microporous materials applied for medical and dental purposes.

Affective engineering applied to emotional texture design for assertive differentiation of industrial wood boards,"The present study research is focused on innovation in the use of MDF (medium-density fiberboard) for indoor coating in waiting areas, incorporating texture as a differentiation factor for surface finishings marketed under highly technical and aesthetical requirements. Methods used in affective engineering are incorporated in the design process to devise products that satisfy user's emotional needs. The evolution of product development from a functional/practical design to an emotional design that creates links with users is observed, where the way to collect perceptual reactions to stimuli becomes an important weighting tool integrated into the design process. The semantic differential method, one of the most used ones in affective en gineering to collect emotional data is validated as one of the most reliable and trustworthy in the design ideation process. Interviews to 108 individuals were carried out to know about the emotions they felt and would like to feel in waiting areas. With this information, 16 textures consistent with the expected emotions were designed and prototypes manufactured to be subjected to focus groups. The results confirm the existing correlation between predetermined emotions and textures for waiting areas, demonstrating that the design ideation process can be improved by integrating a methodology from affective engineering, such as the semantic differential applied to the study of users.",Castro J.; Vargas A.; Araya H.,Journal,Interciencia,2015-12-01,Departamento de Arte y Tecnologías del Diseño,

Cell-based therapies of liver diseases: Age-related challenges,"The scope of this review is to revise recent advances of the cell-based therapies of liver diseases with an emphasis on cell donor’s and patient’s age. Regenerative medicine with cell-based technologies as its integral part is focused on the structural and functional restoration of tissues impaired by sickness or aging. Unlike drug-based medicine directed primarily at alleviation of symptoms, regenerative medicine offers a more holistic approach to disease and senescence management aimed to achieve restoration of homeostasis. Hepatocyte transplantation and organ engineering are very probable forthcoming options of liver disease treatment in people of different ages and vigorous research and technological innovations in this area are in progress. Accordingly, availability of sufficient amounts of functional human hepatocytes is crucial. Direct isolation of autologous hepatocytes from liver biopsy is problematic due to related discomfort and difficulties with further expansion of cells, particularly those derived from aging people. Allogeneic primary human hepatocytes meeting quality standards are also in short supply. Alternatively, autologous hepatocytes can be produced by reprogramming of differentiated cells through the stage of induced pluripotent stem cells. In addition, fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells can be directly induced to undergo advanced stage hepatogenic differentiation. Reprogramming of cells derived from elderly people is accompanied by the reversal of age-associated changes at the cellular level manifesting itself by telomere elongation and the U-turn of DNA methylation. Cell reprogramming can provide high quality rejuvenated hepatocytes for cell therapy and liver tissue engineering. Further technological advancements and establishment of national and global registries of induced pluripotent stem cell lines homozygous for HLA haplotypes can allow industry-style production of livers for immunosuppression-free transplantation.",Yarygin K.; Lupatov A.; Vkholodenko I.,Journal,Clinical Interventions in Aging,2015-12-01,"V.N.

Emerging technologies in civil security-A scenario-based analysis,"Civil security is a major issue on the European policy level and for the European market as a future lead market. Civil security technologies and their implementation are generally characterized by high complexity, multi-stakeholder involvement and a high level of regulation. Due to these characteristics and the influence of societal aspects, it is extremely difficult to evaluate the future developments and applications of emerging security technologies. This is why only a small number of studies have addressed this issue so far and empirical insights into these aspects are still scarce. Our paper addresses this research gap by applying scenarios to consider different societal aspects and their impacts on emerging security technologies and their applications. Based on quantitative and qualitative data and are used as the evaluation background for emerging security technologies. The results show that this approach is suitable to consider technological and non-technological drivers and barriers, and to derive measures and recommendations. The paper contributes to research on technology innovation systems from a challenge-oriented policy perspective and gives new impulses for future research, especially in the field of civil security.",Bierwisch A.; Kayser V.; Shala E.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2015-12-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI,Foresight ;  Scenario technique ;  Security technology ;  Societal needs ;  Technology assessment
Managing potentially disruptive innovations in software companies: Transforming from On-premises to the On-demand,"The software industry faces a fundamental change from delivering software On-premises to delivering software On-demand. Well-established companies have to shift their focus from the (still) profitable On-premises market to an, as yet unprofitable, On-demand market to survive.

Turning Regenerative Medicine Breakthrough Ideas and Innovations into Commercial Products,"The TERMIS-Europe (EU) Industry committee intended to address the two main critical issues in the clinical/commercial translation of Advanced Therapeutic Medicine Products (ATMP): (1) entrepreneurial exploitation of breakthrough ideas and innovations, and (2) regulatory market approval. Since January 2012, more than 12,000 publications related to regenerative medicine and tissue engineering have been accepted for publications, reflecting the intense academic research activity in this field. The TERMIS-EU 2014 Industry Symposium provided a reflection on the management of innovation and technological breakthroughs in biotechnology first proposed to contextualize the key development milestones and constraints of allocation of financial resources, in the development life-cycle of radical innovation projects. This was illustrated with the biofuels story, sharing similarities with regenerative medicine. The transition was then ensured by an overview of the key identified challenges facing the commercialization of cell therapy products as ATMP examples. Real cases and testimonies were then provided by a palette of medical technologies and regenerative medicine companies from their commercial development of cell and gene therapy products. Although the commercial development of ATMP is still at the proof-of-concept stage due to technology risks, changing policies, changing markets, and management changes, the sector is highly dynamic with a number of explored therapeutic approaches, developed by using a large diversity of business models, both proposed by the experience, pitfalls, and successes of regenerative medicine pioneers, and adapted to the constraint resource allocation and environment in radical innovation projects.",Bayon Y.; Vertès A.; Ronfard V.; Culme-Seymour E.; Mason C.; Stroemer P.; Najimi M.; Sokal E.; Wilson C.; Barone J.; Aras R.; Chiesi A.,Journal,Tissue Engineering - Part B: Reviews,2015-12-01,ReNeuron Ltd;University College London;University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth;London Business School;Université Catholique de Louvain;Sofradim Production;PROMETHERA Biosciences;London Regenerative Medicine Network;NxR Biotechnologies GmbH;Holostem Terapie Avanzate S.r.l.;Juventas Therapeutics;CellCoTec,
Case Study of R-1234yf Refrigerant: Implications for the Framework for Responsible Innovation,"Safety and care for the natural environment are two of the most important values that drive scientific enterprise in twentieth century. Researchers and innovators often develop new technologies aimed at pollution reduction, and therefore satisfy the strive for fulfilment of these values. This work is often incentivized by policy makers. According to EU directive 2006/40/EC on mobile air conditioning since 2013 all newly approved vehicles have to be filled with refrigerant with low global warming potential (GWP). Extensive and expensive research financed by leading car manufacturers led to invention of R-1234yf refrigerant with GWP < 1, which was huge improvement. For the proper understanding of this case it will be useful to refer it to the idea of responsible innovation (RI), which is now being developed and quickly attracts attention. I proceed in the following order. Firstly, I present the relevant properties of R-1234yf and discuss the controversy associated with its marketing. Secondly, I examine framework for responsible innovation. In greater detail I discuss the notions of care for future generations and collective responsibility. Thirdly, I apply the offered framework to the case study at hand.

"Terminal experimentation: The transformation of experiences, events and escapes at global airports","Recent debates in aeromobilities research have focused on global shifts in airport socialities generated by the redesign of airport terminals (Cwerner et al., 2009). This article examines transformations to identity and social relations arising from the reinvention of airport infrastructures and facilities, especially the experience of airport services. We suggest here that the arrival of ‘smart airports’, or how we use the term ‘Airport 3.0’, involves an experimentalist orientation deriving from contemporary economic and cultural life. The general argument is that the reinvention of global airport spaces is producing three key transformations: (1) experimentalist orientations arising from the deployment of new information technologies; (2) an experimental business engineering of consumer worlds, or ‘worlding’; and (3) travel-time use geared to a world of infinite innovation. Finally, the article reviews transformations in passenger experience in the light of these conceptual claims.",Elliott A.; Radford D.,Journal,Environment and Planning D: Society and Space,2015-12-01,University of South Australia,Aeromobilities ;  Airport 3.0 ;  experience ;  experimentation ;  globalisation ;  reinvention
Measuring the performance of university technology transfer using meta data approach: the case of Dutch universities,"The objective o this study is to empirically measure the performance of Dutch university’s technology transfer. Dutch universities are ranked high on research output but there is scarce evidence about the commercialization of research-based innovation. We present a novel approach to measure the performance of university technology transfer using meta data analysis. We use data on research output as meta-data to estimates the potential for technology transfer, and data about the actual technology transfer projects as measured by patents, license agreements and spin-offs. We tested our model for Dutch universities and validated it using data from private and state universities in the US. Our results suggest that most Dutch research universities have poor performance while technical Dutch universities and academic medical center perform well. We pilot-tested our model for selected US universities and the result confirm the validity of our approach. Our approach contributes to the literature on university technology transfer by adding a novel approach for measuring performance of university technology transfer while taking into account university research as the potential for technology transfer.",Vinig T.; Lips D.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2015-12-01,Amsterdam Business School;Amsterdam University College,Commercialization ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Technology transfer ;  TTO ;  Valorization

Situated novelty: Introducing a process perspective on the study of innovation,"This paper introduces a process perspective to innovation studies to answer the research question: What is innovation and how are different meanings ascribed to it in a healthcare setting? Drawing on four ethnographic case studies of projects in a public-funded innovation program in rehabilitation care in the Netherlands, we challenge some well-known assumptions about innovation that have long inspired traditional understandings of innovation. The findings are based on data derived from observations and interviews with managers, project leaders, and (para) medical professionals involved in the four innovation projects. The results indicate that (1) people often assign other meanings to innovation than mere 'novelty'; (2) that innovation usually entails extensive work that also constructs the value of an innovation; and (3) this has major implications for the management of innovation in organizational practice. This paper builds an argument for introducing an alternative ontological perspective on innovation based upon the notion of 'situated novelty'. In proposing the contextual perspective, we aim to extend current understanding of innovation processes.",Janssen M.; Stoopendaal A.; Putters K.,Journal,Research Policy,2015-12-01,Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam,Healthcare innovation ;  Innovation management ;  Process theories ;  Situated novelty
Comparison among U.S. industrial sectors by DEA environmental assessment: Equipped with analytical capability to handle zero or negative in production factors,"A green image is recently an important component of corporate sustainability in modern business. By extending the two previous works (i.e., Wang et al., 2014; Sueyoshi and Wang, 2014a), this study discusses a new use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment by incorporating an analytical capability to handle zero and/or negative in a data set. The proposed approach provides us with not only new quantitative assessment on unified (operational and environmental) performance of firms but also information regarding how to invest for eco-technology innovation for abating an amount of their industrial pollutions. According to the previous studies, the energy industry is an attractive investment target if desirable outputs are measured by Return on Assets (ROA) as a short-term concern and an amount of CO2 emission reduction. The selection on a desirable output combination is important in understanding the corporate sustainability of the energy industry because it is the largest emitter among seven industry sectors examined in the previous studies. However, if the ROA is replaced by a corporate value, measured by Tobin's q ratio as a long-term concern, the energy industry is not so attractive because it uses a very large production process so that green investment does not immediately increase the corporate value. An empirical problem of these previous studies is that they have investigated only successful companies with positive ROA or Tobin's q ratios. The analytical feature clearly indicates a methodological drawback of their studies. In contrast, this study pays attention to both successful companies with positive net incomes and unsuccessful companies with negative net incomes, so being able to measure all aspects of their performance in a short-term concern. This study finds that the energy industry exhibits a high level of potential on green investment. However, the energy industry may be not attractive even in the short-term concern (i.e., net income), partly because governmental regulations on their operation and pollution prevention efforts are stricter than the other industrial sectors. This result may be seemingly inconsistent with Wang et al. (2014). Rather, the result indicates that successful energy firms can attain the corporate sustainability by investing eco-technology innovation, but unsuccessful ones cannot attain the sustainability, even in the short-term concern, because they do not have large capital accumulation for eco-technology investment whose importance has been first discussed by Sueyoshi and Goto (2010a). In other words, the eco-technology investment for enhancing a high level of corporate sustainability depends upon an amount of net income generated by each energy firm.",Sueyoshi T.; Yuan Y.,Journal,Energy Economics,2015-12-01,New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology,Corporate sustainability ;  DEA ;  Energy ;  Environment ;  Investment ;  Technology innovation
Software quality construction in 11 companies: an empirical study using the grounded theory,"This paper investigates software quality construction in 11 software companies using the Grounded Theory research method. Our analysis shows that software quality construction is influenced by the development context, which is affected by customer involvement; agility, which enables cooperation among the development teams; outsourcing; and human factors i.e., developers’ creativity, innovation, experience and art, which are not limited by development methods but customer demand and feedback systems. We claim that these findings may be applied in software development companies in the areas of prioritization of human and non-human resources.",Seth F.; Mustonen-Ollila E.; Taipale O.; Smolander K.,Journal,Software Quality Journal,2015-12-01,LUT University,Art ;  Creativity ;  Experience ;  Human factors ;  Innovation ;  Quality ;  Quality construction
A fuzzy ANP with interval type-2 fuzzy sets approach to evaluate enterprise technological innovation ability,"In order to overcome the drawbacks of AHP in solving complex decision-making problems, ANP is applied in the evaluation of enterprise technology innovation ability. Due to Interval type-2 fuzzy sets can handle uncertainty of linguistic variables in a more flexible and precisely way than Type-1 fuzzy sets with their fuzzy membership functions, a fuzzy ANP method with interval type-2 fuzzy sets is proposed to evaluate the enterprise technology innovation ability. A new ranking method based on the centroid is applied in processing relationships between interval type-2 fuzzy sets.

"The WGM(1, 1) model based on the function of γ+δi and its application in the technology innovation","The weight behind the sequence xˆ(0)(n) is unknown in the previous literature about WGM (1, 1) model by the method of arti_cial empowerment, and it leads to be unable to restore the predictive value behind xˆ(0)(n). In view of the above problem, this paper proposes the empowerment based on the linear function of γ+δi. It firstly proves the basic form of WGM(1, 1) model; Secondly, based on the basic form of the WGM(1, 1) model, it builds the linear WGM(1, 1) model by using the least squares method to estimate its parameters of γ, δ, a; b; Thirdly, for comparative analysis, the WIGM(1, 1) model has been built; Fourthly, it is carried on the empirical research for the built models through the instance of technology innovation. The results show that the WGM(1, 1) model can reduce the sequence's MAPE(mean absolute percent error). If there is still large value of MAPE by the fitting of WGM(1, 1) model, then the WIGM(1, 1) model can also be used for the fitting again; Finally, it states the effectiveness and best conditions of usage for WGM(1, 1) and WIGM(1, 1) models from the theoretical and empirical aspects.",Su X.; Xie F.,Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2015-11-25,Antai College of Economics and Management,"GM(1, 1) ;  Technology innovation ;  WGM(1, 1) ;  WIGM(1, 1) ;  γ+δi empowerment"
Research on zero-finding method for the incremental encoder of hydraulic position servo motor,"Incremental encoders are widely used for position measurement in angular position hydraulic position motor servo system for its simple structure and low cost. While in the situation that need absolute positioning, a relatively long time is needed to find the zero position. In this paper a special distance-coded mechanism of incremental encoder is addressed, as well as the zero-finding algorithm based on it. The proposed algorithm is applied in a hydraulic servo control system which is presented in the paper. Both theoretical analysis and experimental study show that the method is of good characteristics in speed, precision and robustness. This method finds the zero position without passing by the zero reference mark and is equivalent to use an incremental encoder as an absolute encoder, which means its theory innovation value and great extended significance in engineering.",Yuan F.; Wang X.; Tao J.; Luo B.; Dai Y.; Miao Z.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2015 International Conference on Fluid Power and Mechatronics, FPM 2015",2015-11-24,Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Shanghai University,hydraulic position servo motor ;  incremental encoder ;  servo control system ;  zero-finding method

Developing a Creative Idea Generation System for Innovative Software Reliability Research,"Reliability is one of the important aspects of any software, which has been studied for decades with many techniques proposed and developed. In software engineering, software reliability cannot be ignored in any application. However, it is still hard to measure and difficult to ensure the reliability of software, which means that it is necessary to find new ways to study on the software reliability, especially for researchers. Naturally, idea generation has to be involved in the process of getting innovative ideas. Although a considerable number of applications and research studies have been made in the past years in order to increase the effectiveness of idea making process, it is lack of efforts working on creativity in the idea generation process particularly. Moreover, creative computing is suitable to be employed to enhance the innovation of research studies on the software reliability, as it emphasises being creative in the whole software lifecycle. Therefore, the objective of this research paper is to propose an idea generation process to inspire new studies on software reliability. This paper first represents an idea generation framework. Then, after critically reviewed the creativity features and attributes, three creativity elements are proposed with corresponding sub-dimensions to support on balancing new and value of the ideas. Formal algorithms are designed to calculate and incorporate the creativity elements and their sub-dimension. Furthermore, a prototype of the proposed idea generation system is developed that is named as Research Topics Generation System (RTGS), in which a set of new research topics on software reliability are generated to inspire further studies, whilst creative computing ontology is created as the basis of the idea generation.",Jing D.; Yang H.; Xu L.; Ma F.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2nd International Conference on Trustworthy Systems and Their Applications, TSA 2015",2015-11-23,Nanjing University;Bath Spa University;Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology,creative computing ;  creativity ;  idea generation ;  research topics ;  software reliability

"SPIDER SENSE: Software-engineering, networked, system evaluation","Today, many of the research innovations in software visualization and comprehension are evaluated on small-scale programs in a way that avoids actual human evaluation, despite the fact that these techniques are designed to help programmers develop and understand large and complex software. The investments required to perform such human studies often outweigh the need to publish. As such, the goal of this work (and toolkit) is to enable the evaluation of software visualizations of real-life software systems by its actual developers, as well as to understand the factors that influence adoption. The approach is to directly assist practicing software developers with visualizations through open and online collaboration tools. The mechanism by which we accomplish this goal is an online service that is linked through the projects' revision-control and build systems. We are calling this system SPIDER SENSE, and it includes web-based visualizations for software exploration that is supported by tools for mirroring development activities, automatic building and testing, and automatic instrumentation to gather dynamic-analysis data. In the future, we envision the system and toolkit to become a framework on which further visualizations and analyses are developed.

Harnessing Hierarchical Nano- and Micro-Fabrication Technologies for Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering,"Cells within a tissue are able to perceive, interpret and respond to the biophysical, biomechanical, and biochemical properties of the 3D extracellular matrix environment in which they reside. Such stimuli regulate cell adhesion, metabolic state, proliferation, migration, fate and lineage commitment, and ultimately, tissue morphogenesis and function. Current scaffold fabrication strategies in musculoskeletal tissue engineering seek to mimic the sophistication and comprehensiveness of nature to develop hierarchically assembled 3D implantable devices of different geometric dimensions (nano- to macrometric scales) that will offer control over cellular functions and ultimately achieve functional regeneration. Herein, advances and shortfalls of bottom-up (self-assembly, freeze-drying, rapid prototype, electrospinning) and top-down (imprinting) scaffold fabrication approaches, specific to musculoskeletal tissue engineering, are discussed and critically assessed. Bottom-up (freeze-drying, self-assembly, rapid prototype, electro-spinning) and top-down (imprinting) scaffold fabrication technologies are at the forefront of research and innovation for the development of biomimetic implantable devices.

Experiences from field research on technology education at ISCED level 2,"In 2008 in Slovakia a school reform became into a force. A key part of it was introduction of a curricula reform of primary and secondary education. Currently the results of this reform are analyzed within a project Analysis of the consequences of the curricula reform on technology education in primary and lower secondary schools which is carried out with the support of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of Slovak Republic. Methodology of the analysis is based on questionnaire inquiry. A pilot research of the project showed some weaknesses of the used methodology. The need to find out some additional information to obtain a deeper view on the solved issues and to gather data to reinforce the qualitative aspects of the analysis to its factual aspects led to a decision of the project team to carry out also personal inquiry. There were carried out two kinds of the personal inquiries. One of them were personal interviews with qualified teachers teaching the subject technology at lower secondary schools and the other one was a panelling (focus groups interviews), participants of which were technology teachers acting also in the school leadership.

Accomplishment of quality-based objective for Social Integration and Regionalization in Minerva Academic Model,"Social Integration and Regionalization are two of six axes considered in the Minerva Academic Model (MAM) proposed by the 'Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla' (BUAP). This innovative collaborative academic model is a product of internal collective elaborations, considering the own previous experiences with the academic Fenix project, and international and national education trends. The MAM aims at reaching a strong relationship of the BUAP community with regional, national, and international communities. In this perspective, our research focuses in the structuration of effective process for the accomplishment of MAM objectives. For that, it is not enough the enunciation of objectives, strategies, and desirable quality attributes, but their translation in meaningful and manageable processes. In order to give complete sense to MAM expressions, in the work referred in this paper, the quality features included in propositions of Social Integration and Regionalization axes are converted in direct and expressive objectives. For an effective implementation of these objectives in social realities, this paper proposes pertinent, realistic, and manageable processes. The quality-based objectives constitute a way to concrete the effective contribution of Non-Functional Features of the Model and to offer an alternative for validating the explicit objectives proposed in the MAM formulation. The Construction of educational objectives derived from quality features of an academic model and the conversion of objectives in effective and manageable processes constitute a way to affront the changes in the context and to contribute to the development of the resilient engineering concept. The application of this concept in education matches the objectives and action axes of the MAM, and it aids also to introduce and to materialize particular exigencies, such as sustainability, innovation, etc. in education models.",Urrego-Giraldo G.; Giraldo G.; Lopez E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2015 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning, ICL 2015",2015-11-04,Universidad de Antioquia;Universidad Nacional de Colombia Medellin;Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla,education processes ;  Quality features ;  quality-based objectives

Science Technology and Innovation (STI) Challenges of Biomass Implementation,"This paper provides an in-depth review and analysis on the science technology and innovation (STI) barriers in order to achieve bioenergy implementations in Thailand. Though, Thailand appears to have clear targets on alternative energy in the next 10 years according to the master plan formulated by Ministry of Energy but these ambitious-bioenergy targets are based solely on the potential of resources existing and planned planting in the country. In order to transform biomass to end-used consumption, it is a need to define the STI platform for actions. However, there is no study on the STI policy for bioenergy implementations. Yet, there are several concepts of best-practices in difference prospects but there is no integration of science technology and innovation policy as a whole.

Microfoundations of innovative capabilities: The leverage of collaborative technologies on organizational learning and knowledge management in a multinational corporation,"Microfoundations of dynamic capabilities have become a central concept for strategy and innovation research. Yet, despite recent developments in information technologies which facilitate data flow and information management in firms, little is known about how organizational learning and knowledge management nurture microfoundations of innovative capabilities. Our case research addresses this gap by examining how the use of collaborative technologies in a globally leading industrial corporation leverages intra-firm processes of learning and knowledge sharing, fostering innovative capabilities. We combine top-down theorizing and evidence-based exploration to systematically trace microfoundations that undergird a firm's innovative capabilities. Drawing on multiple data sources, we categorize these microfoundations as organizational and managerial structures, systems, processes, and procedures. Our findings show that innovative capabilities result from specific interactions and interdependencies between microfoundations residing in the four categories. The complex and dynamic interplay of corporate knowledge sharing and organizational learning processes nurtures microfoundational sources of innovative capabilities and enables the firm to sustain a competitive advantage in rapidly changing environments. Our findings have important implications for the role of organizational learning and knowledge management in the dynamic capabilities framework.",Schneckenberg D.; Truong Y.; Mazloomi H.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2015-11-01,Rennes School of Business,Collaborative technologies ;  Dynamic capabilities ;  Knowledge management ;  Microfoundations ;  Multinational firm ;  Organizational learning
Enhancing social acceptance in marine governance in Europe,"In this article we address social acceptance in marine governance. Public support and opposition are critical to any future developments of marine areas, and are often neglected aspects. Whilst one of the main new developments in European marine areas is the increase in sites for offshore wind, social acceptance of renewable energy developments in Europe is shown to be low in a series of on-going studies. There is perhaps often a sense that renewables such as wind, wave and tidal will be 'out of sight, out of mind' when developed offshore but the empirical research evidence from across Europe suggests otherwise. People are protesting against offshore wind, and doing so very effectively, preventing and delaying the development of projects. This article articulates the term 'social acceptance' as a goal in marine policy implementation in European waters in general, and provides illustrations of the implications of social acceptance of offshore wind in a series of case studies. The experiences of social acceptance, together with theoretical insights, should be taken into account in future innovations for blue energy at sea, including the wind farms, but also wave and tidal devices and other technological developments.",Soma K.; Haggett C.,Journal,Ocean and Coastal Management,2015-11-01,The University of Edinburgh;Wageningen University & Research,Blue growth ;  Marine governance ;  Offshore wind farms ;  Public engagement ;  Social acceptance
On the effectiveness of patenting strategies in innovation races,"Which, if any, of a firm's inventions should it patent? Should it patent at all? Many companies engaged in an innovation race seek a patenting strategy that balances protection of their intellectual property against the knowledge spillovers resulting from disclosure requirements. Not much is known about factors that determine the patenting strategy best able to resolve this trade-off. Although scholars in various management, economics, and engineering disciplines have researched patents and patenting regimes, little work has addressed the normative issues that pertain to forming an appropriate firm-level patenting strategy. We develop an inventory of real-life patenting strategies and integrate them into a coherent framework. Our simulation model characterizes the optimal patenting choices for different environmental and firm-level contingencies while capturing the dynamics between competing firms. We identify the firm's research and development strategy as the most salient determinant of its optimal patenting strategy. Our research contributes to establishing a contingency theory of patenting strategies.",Mihm J.; Sting F.; Wang T.,Journal,Management Science,2015-11-01,"Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University;INSEAD, Europe;Dataesp Private Ltd.",Games on NK landscapes ;  Innovation races ;  NK modeling ;  Patent strategies ;  Strategic interaction on NK landscapes
Forecasting consumer perception of innovativeness,"How innovative is a new product to consumers? Why is it perceived to be innovative and does perceived innovativeness affect consumer intention to adopt new products? Some investigations have explored consumers' perceptions of innovativeness, but this research is fragmented and contains no comprehensive definition and examination of the construct of ""consumer perceived innovativeness"" (CPI - how innovative the product is from the consumer's perspective). This study proposes a new conceptualization for CPI based upon extant theory, qualitative research and two quantitative pilot studies. It then identifies and tests key causes and consequences of CPI on a national sample of consumers using a range of different innovations. This allows addressing the ""so what?"" (consequences) and the ""how do you manage it?"" (causes). The research extends work in the new product development area by (i) defining CPI within its nomological net and proposing an operational measure based on psychometric testing, (ii) suggesting that affect is more usefully viewed as a consequence of CPI rather than a dimension, and (iii) highlighting the important, yet often overlooked role, of perceived technology newness. These findings provide managers with a useful and practical theory for understanding and influencing consumer perceptions of a product's innovativeness.",Lowe B.; Alpert F.,Journal,Technovation,2015-11-01,Kent Business School;The University of Queensland Business School,Consumer perceived innovativeness ;  Innovation adoption ;  Newness ;  Relative advantage
Technology for Innovation in Radiation Oncology,"Radiation therapy is an effective, personalized cancer treatment that has benefited from technological advances associated with the growing ability to identify and target tumors with accuracy and precision. Given that these advances have played a central role in the success of radiation therapy as a major component of comprehensive cancer care, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored a workshop entitled ""Technology for Innovation in Radiation Oncology,"" which took place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, on June 13 and 14, 2013. The purpose of this workshop was to discuss emerging technology for the field and to recognize areas for greater research investment. Expert clinicians and scientists discussed innovative technology in radiation oncology, in particular as to how these technologies are being developed and translated to clinical practice in the face of current and future challenges and opportunities. Technologies encompassed topics in functional imaging, treatment devices, nanotechnology, and information technology. The technical, quality, and safety performance of these technologies were also considered. A major theme of the workshop was the growing importance of innovation in the domain of process automation and oncology informatics. The technologically advanced nature of radiation therapy treatments predisposes radiation oncology research teams to take on informatics research initiatives. In addition, the discussion on technology development was balanced with a parallel conversation regarding the need for evidence of efficacy and effectiveness. The linkage between the need for evidence and the efforts in informatics research was clearly identified as synergistic.",Chetty I.; Martel M.; Jaffray D.; Benedict S.; Hahn S.; Berbeco R.; Deye J.; Jeraj R.; Kavanagh B.; Krishnan S.; Lee N.; Low D.; Mankoff D.; Marks L.; Ollendorf D.; Paganetti H.; Ross B.; Siochi R.; Timmerman R.; Wong J.,Journal,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,2015-11-01,Institute for Clinical and Economic Review;Massachusetts General Hospital;University of Colorado School of Medicine;Princess Margaret Cancer Centre;University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston;University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health;UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center;West Virginia University;Brigham and Women's Hospital;University of Washington;UT Southwestern Medical School;National Cancer Institute (NCI);Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center;Henry Ford Hospital;Michigan Medicine;Johns Hopkins University;David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA;UNC Health,
Utilizing online serious games to facilitate distributed requirements elicitation,"Requirements elicitation is one of the most important and challenging activities in software development projects. A variety of challenges related to requirements elicitation are reported in the literature, of which the lack of proper communication and knowledge transfer between software stakeholders are among the most important. Communication and knowledge transfer are becoming even bigger challenges with the current increase in globally distributed software development projects due to the temporal, geographic, and sociocultural diversity among software stakeholders. In this study, we propose a new approach to requirements elicitation, which employs online serious games for gathering requirements from distributed software stakeholders. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach were evaluated in an empirical study with encouraging results. These results especially reveal that our suggested approach enables less-experienced individuals to identify a higher number of requirements. Our results also reveal that for the majority of subjects, especially individuals with less technical experience, this approach was a pleasant and easy way of participating in requirements elicitation. Based on these results we suggest that using online serious games not only enhances innovation and creativity among end-users but also facilitates collaboration and communication among software stakeholders. Implications for both research and practice are considered.",Ghanbari H.; Similä J.; Markkula J.,Journal,Journal of Systems and Software,2015-11-01,Oulun Yliopisto,Global software development ;  Innovative requirements elicitation ;  Serious games
Factors influencing local decisions to use habitats to protect coastal communities from hazards,"Coastal hazard mitigation policy in the US has historically focused on construction of hardened, or gray, infrastructure. Recently, there is increased public interest and policy supporting the use of habitats, or natural infrastructure (NI), following decades of increasingly supportive ecological, engineering, and economic evidence. This trend suggests that behavioral and institutional factors may also be important for mainstreaming NI. To understand what factors affected decisions to use NI, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a total of 16 individuals associated with three NI cases: Ferry Point Park Living Shoreline, Maryland (MD); Surfer's Point Managed Retreat, California (CA); and Durant's Point Living Shoreline, North Carolina (NC). Our grounded theory analysis of the interview transcripts revealed four common themes across the decisions: 1) perception of benefits (N = 45) and costs (N = 31), 2) diffusion of innovation led by innovators (N = 34), 3) local champions (N = 46), and 4) social networks and norms (N = 30). This grounded theory suggests that the decisions to use NI were driven by innovators (citizens, local non-governmental organization (NGO) staff, and/or state government resource managers) who were influenced by seeing NI successes implemented by trusted experts and perceived NI benefits beyond protecting coastlines (e.g., maintaining coastal heritage and sense of place). Innovators also acted as local champions, getting others ""comfortable"" with NI and connecting to local interests. In addition, our analysis shows the role of regulatory permitting requirements in perpetuating or controlling biases against innovations like NI. In 2008, MD passed a policy that helped address biases against NI by changing NI from a preferred option to the required option except in places where scientific analysis suggested that gray infrastructure would be needed, while in CA and NC gray infrastructure remains only a preferred option. These results suggest an opportunity to harness heuristics, such as visual demonstrations and messaging from trusted persons, in addition to policy tools to mainstream NI in places where there is evidence that it would be effective. These results also suggest that heuristics could result in biases that not only lead to underuse but also to inappropriate use of NI; and, policies, similar to the policy in Maryland, are needed to control these biases.",Kochnower D.; Reddy S.; Flick R.,Journal,Ocean and Coastal Management,2015-11-01,Scripps Institution of Oceanography;Nature Conservancy,Coastal realignment ;  Decision making ;  Hazard management ;  Heuristics ;  Natural infrastructure ;  Policy
"Development and results of a cross border network project, aimed at the engineering of eco-compatible products","Sustainability is nowadays a milestone in government, administrative, business, manufacturing and educational policies. In the current difficult economic context, small and medium enterprises represent the most disadvantaged realities concerning environmental innovation, basically because they cannot invest in and consequently benefit from Research and Development units. This paper deals with the objectives, methods and collective short and medium-term results of a cross border network project, aimed at the engineering of eco-compatible products, led in cooperation with universities, public authorities and research centres. This applied research aims at disseminating the possible results obtained by a technology transfer to a selection of Italian and French case studies that, at the end of the biennial tutoring path, will represent some possible best practices able to integrate the theories of ecodesign into practical reality. The paper will illustrate the accompanying pathway undertaken by the Politecnico di Torino, with an overview of five Italian case studies, and a deeper focus on the most significant one in terms of qualitative and quantitative results achieved with this project. The effectiveness of this international research will be discussed, by highlighting the potential of creating an international comparison on the topic of how to implement eco-innovative strategies for small and medium enterprises. Finally, in conclusion some considerations on short, medium and long-term benefits will be presented, pointing out the added value of cross-border collaborations that may be shifted to other productive and geographical realities. Results focus on an Italian context even if the theme is also relevant outside of Italy: considerations could be made about how this method could be applied to other contexts and countries, where this kind of research and approach could be adopted.",De Giorgi C.; Dal Palù D.; Allione C.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2015-11-01,Politecnico di Torino,Eco-innovation ;  Ecodesign strategies ;  Exploring design approach ;  Small and medium enterprises ;  Sustainability principles ;  Technology transfer
Industrial engineering analysis of chinese manufacturing industry in transition period based on grey predictions,"In order to explore the characteristics and development strategies of Chinese manufacturing production system, the grey forecasting model GM (1, 1) and the grey verhulst dynamic model were built firstly. The prediction results show that Chinese manufacturing productivity would reach $32806 per person in 2018, which indicates rapid development and lays the foundation for China to become the world's manufacturing power since the reform and opening up. However, it is predicted that Chinese manufacturing productivity would peak in 2018 based on the grey verhulst dynamic model, which reveals the resource configuration mode of Chinese manufacturing system could not prop up its increasing manufacturing capability. Furthermore the main reasons of this phenomenon were explored, which could be summarized as the lack of accumulation, integration of industrial engineering (IE) and information technology (IT), promoting mechanism of IE application as well as integration model of management innovation and technology innovation, etc. Finally, a series of strategies based on IE theory to solve these problems were given. This study provides an effective way to deal with the challenges and opportunities facing the Chinese manufacturing industry, meanwhile, it may contribute to the theoretical system of IE.",Huang Y.; Li Q.; Pan Y.; Liu H.; Qi E.,Journal,Journal of Donghua University (English Edition),2015-10-31,Tianjin University,"China ;  Forecasting ;  GM (1, 1) ;  Grey verhulst model ;  Manufacturing industry ;  Paradigm ;  Strategy"

Protection design for ±200 Mvar cascade STATCOM,"In order to protect the safety of 100 Mvar static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), a complete and reliable protection system must be built. Based on technology innovation and engineering practice of the 35 kV/±200 Mvar cascade STATCOM in China southern power grid, this paper focuses on the protection design of the high-voltage and high-capacity STATCOM in the power system. The power unit protections are classified by the difference in the export strategy, and the converter chain protections are arranged using the external signal source. According to the severity of different faults, three different export strategy of bypass, blocking and tripping should be executed. In consideration of the special operation characteristics of STATCOM, the dual overcurrent protection and 35 kV breaker failure protection are designed, to increase the STATCOM running safety. With the design of power unit online bypass function and converter chain overcurrent blocking restart function, the integration of protection and control is achieved, thereby greatly enhancing the operation reliability of STATCOM.",Zhang Y.; Liu Y.,Journal,Dianli Xitong Zidonghua/Automation of Electric Power Systems,2015-10-25,Guangdong Power Grid Corporation,Cascade static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) ;  Converter chain ;  Online bypass ;  Power unit ;  Protection design

Managing requirements knowledge in business networks: A case study,"In the last two decades, research on knowledge management (KM) has shifted its focus to understanding the role of knowledge management tools in achieving business objectives. However, KM initiatives often remain dispersed, especially in highly distributed organizational settings, such as business networks. Existing research on cross-organizational knowledge management focuses primarily on efficiencies through shared services while neglecting a knowledge sharing and creation perspective. Here we take a knowledge maturing perspective to propose a model for requirements knowledge which-instead of looking at single activities of retrieval-considers a continuous cycle where the knowledge intensive processes and requirements shape each other. We develop the model using the insight from a case study of a European business network. Our findings for meeting innovation requirements reflect that the selective access to communication platforms due to the less formal network structure needs to be substituted by process based roles and tasks of employees. Considering efficiency requirements diverse data sources result in the need to capture and incorporate the semantics of concepts for elimination of duplicated process related effort. Regarding quality requirements the guidance role of matured knowledge, such as standards, best practices, controls etc. needs to be integrated.",Jaanus J.; Sihver M.; Ley T.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2015-10-21,Tallinna Ülikool,Business Networks ;  Cross-organizational Requirements Engineering ;  Knowledge Maturing ;  Knowledge Organization Systems ;  Process Development ;  Requirements Knowledge
Estimating the value of decisions relating to managing and developing software-intensive products and projects,"The software industry's current decision-making relating to product/project management and development is largely done in a value neutral setting, in which cost is the primary driver for every decision taken. However, numerous studies have shown that the primary critical success factor that differentiates successful products/projects from failed ones lie in the value domain. Therefore, to remain competitive, innovative and to grow, companies must change from cost-based decision-making to value-based decision-making where the decisions taken are the best for that company's overall value creation. Our vision to tackle this problem and to provide a solution for value estimation is to employ a combination of qualitative and machine learning solutions where a probabilistic model encompassing the knowledge from different stakeholders will be used to predict the overall value of a given decision relating to product management and development. This vision drives the goal of a 3-year research project funded by the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes), with the participation of several industry partners.",Mendes E.; Turhan B.; Rodríguez P.; Freitas V.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2015-10-21,Oulun Yliopisto,Bayesian network ;  Software product and project management ;  Value-based decision making ;  Value-based software engineering

Dormitory of physical and engineering sciences: Sleeping beauties may be sleeping innovations,"A 'Sleeping Beauty in Science' is a publication that goes unnoticed ('sleeps') for a long time and then, almost suddenly, attracts a lot of attention ('is awakened by a prince'). The aim of this paper is to present a general methodology to investigate (1) important properties of Sleeping Beauties such as the time-dependent distribution, author characteristics, journals and fields, and (2) the cognitive environment of Sleeping Beauties. We are particularly interested to find out to what extent Sleeping Beauties are application-oriented and thus are potential Sleeping Innovations. In this study we focus primarily on physics (including materials science and astrophysics) and present first results for chemistry and for engineering &computer science. We find that more than half of the SBs are application-oriented. To study the cognitive environments of Sleeping Beauties we develop a new approach in which the cognitive environment of the SBs is analyzed, based on the mapping of Sleeping Beauties using their citation links and conceptual relations, particularly co-citation mapping. In this way we investigate the research themes in which the SBs are 'used' and possible causes of why the premature work in the SBs becomes topical, i.e., the trigger of the awakening of the SBs. This approach is tested with a blue skies SB and an application-oriented SB. We think that the mapping procedures discussed in this paper are not only important for bibliometric analyses. They also provide researchers with useful, interactive tools to discover both relevant older work as well as new developments, for instance in themes related to Sleeping Beauties that are also Sleeping Innovations.

Combining Lean and Six Sigma in the context of Systems Engineering design,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a combined framework for system design using Six Sigma and Lean concepts. Systems Engineering has evolved independently and there are numerous tools and techniques available to address issues that may arise in the design of systems. In the context of systems design, the application of Six Sigma and Lean concepts results in a flexible and adaptable framework. A combined framework is presented here that allows better visualization of the system-level components and their interactions at parametric level, and it also illuminates gaps that make way for continuous improvement. The Deming’s Plan-Do-Check-Act is the basis of this framework. Three case studies are presented to evaluate the application of this framework in the context of Systems Engineering design. The paper concludes with a summary of advantages of using a combined framework, its limitations and scope for future work. Design/methodology/approach – Six Sigma, Lean and Systems Engineering approaches combined into a framework for collaborative product development. Findings – The present framework is not rigid and does not attempt to force fit any tools or concepts. The framework is generic and allows flexibility through a plug and play type of implementation. This is important, as engineering change needs vary constantly to meet consumer demands. Therefore, it is important to engrain flexibility in the development of a foundational framework for design-encapsulating improvements and innovation. From a sustainability perspective, it is important to develop techniques that drive rationality in the decisions, especially during tradeoffs and conflicts. Research limitations/implications – Scalability of the approach for large systems where complex interactions exist. Besides, the application of negotiation techniques for more than three persons poses a challenge from a mathematical context. Future research should address these in the context of systems design using Six Sigma and Lean techniques. Practical implications – This paper provides a flexible framework for combining the three techniques based on Six Sigma, Lean and Systems Engineering. Social implications – This paper will influence the construction of agent-based systems, particularly the ones using the Habermas’s theory of social action as the basis for product development. Originality/value – This paper has not been published in any other journal or conference.",Sreeram T.; Thondiyath A.,Journal,International Journal of Lean Six Sigma,2015-10-12,Indian Institute of Technology Madras,Continuous improvement ;  Lean ;  PDCA ;  Quality ;  Six Sigma ;  Systems Engineering
Engineering knowledge and information needs in Italy and Japan: bridging the gap between theory and practice,"Purpose – This study aims to identify and compare the knowledge and information retrieval needs from past projects and for future work among Italian and Japanese engineers. Engineering work, which is knowledge-intensive, is all the more critical as it both uses and generates knowledge for product and process innovation. Design/methodology/approach – This research uses data collected from engineers in Italy and Japan from an online survey using open-ended questions in their native language. Answers were then translated into English and coded into pre-determined categories; statistical analyses including factor analysis were conducted. Findings – For knowledge to be retrieved from past work, both Italian and Japanese engineers identified mainly experiential and systemic knowledge assets. For knowledge to be captured for future work, both groups picked experiential as well as conceptual knowledge related to the competitive environment of the firm absent from knowledge needs from past work. Finally, this research uncovered almost twice as fewer meta-categories for knowledge needs to be captured for future work compared to knowledge to be retrieved from past projects, as the former are by nature speculative and, therefore, difficult to foresee. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited to the engineering domain and to two countries. Further research should extend the scope beyond these two countries. Practical implications – The study identified information and knowledge needs that could help inform the design of procedures to capture and document engineering work and the development of supporting information systems. Originality/value – This research contributes to an increased understanding of the substance of information and knowledge needs in a knowledge-intensive environment such as engineering work and product/service development.",Secundo G.; Magnier-Watanabe R.; Heisig P.,Journal,Journal of Knowledge Management,2015-10-12,Graduate School of Business Sciences;Leeds University Business School;Università del Salento,Engineering ;  Information need ;  Knowledge asset ;  Knowledge management ;  Knowledge need
Autoclave design for high pressure-high temperature corrosion studies,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop an autoclave that can be used to assess corrosion behaviour of suitable material in high-pressure–high-temperature (HPHT) environments. Many new discoveries of oil and gas field are in HPHT environments. The development of such fields requires appropriate selection of materials that are able to withstand not just the service loads but also corrosive production fluids in the HPHT environment. Design/methodology/approach – The exposure of material samples to elevated pressure and temperature is usually done using an autoclave. The suitability of an existing autoclave for HPHT corrosion studies is provided together with suggestions on necessary design modifications. An alternative design of the autoclave is proposed based on functionality requirements and life cycle cost assessment. Findings – It is concluded that the existing autoclave was unsuitable for HPHT corrosion tests, and modifications were very expensive to implement and/or not foolproof. A new autoclave was designed, manufactured, tested and successfully used to study the effect of aqueous solution on the corrosion of a pipe subject to a combination of axial tension, internal pressure and elevated temperature. Research limitations/implications – The maximum design pressure of 15 MPa is more than sufficient for high-pressure corrosion studies in aqueous solution where partial pressure of the dissolved gas is one of the main controlling parameters. However, the design pressure is only suitable for corrosion studies in a seawater environment of up to 1,500 m water depth. Originality/value – A new design of autoclave together with all the necessary piping, assembly and control system is proposed for HPHT corrosion studies. The autoclave can be used as standalone or integrated with a mechanical testing machine and thus enables corrosion studies under a wide range of loading.",Lasebikan B.; Akisanya A.; Deans W.,Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2015-10-05,University of Aberdeen,Component and systems performance ;  Design ;  Experimental mechanics ;  Implementing ;  Managing and practicing innovation ;  Material ;  Systems design ;  Whole life costing

Adoption and use of open source infrastructure software by large corporations: The case of MySQL,"Adoption and continuance of use of open source infrastructure software by large business organizations is not well understood. This study fills this gap in research by conducting a longitudinal investigation of the adoption and use of MySQL by two large corporations. One organization, an early adopter, adopted and used MySQL for several years before reverting back to a proprietary product. The other, a late adopter, made an initial adoption decision but didn't deploy it in mission critical applications. Interestingly, free software and freedom to access and modify the source code, the hallmark of the open source model, were not found to be significant in promoting adoption. In contrast, high quality maintenance support and timely product enhancement to keep up with user needs were considered critical for initial adoption and continued use of software. The study also demonstrates the need to investigate continuance of use to get a complete picture of open source software adoption and use by organizations.",Mahapatra R.; Manzar R.; Bhadauria V.,Journal,Journal of Database Management,2015-10-01,Southern Arkansas University;The University of Texas at Arlington,Continuance of Use ;  Diffusion of Innovation ;  MySQL Adoption ;  Open Source Software ;  Open Source Software Adoption
Non-destructive characterization of materials and components with neutron and X-ray diffraction methods,"The availability of advanced characterization techniques is integral to the development of advanced materials, not only during development phases, but in the manufactured components as well. At Necsa, two modern neutron diffractometers equipped with in-situ sample environments, as well as complementary X-ray diffraction instruments, are now available as User Facilities within the National System of Innovation in support of the South African research and industrial communities. Neutrons and X-rays, owing to their different interaction mechanisms with matter, offer complementary techniques for probing crystalline materials. Both techniques enable nondestructive investigation of phenomena such as chemical phase composition, residual stress, and texture (preferred crystallite orientation). More specifically, the superior penetration capabilities of thermal neutrons into most materials allows for the analysis of bulk or localized depth-resolved properties in a wide variety of materials and components. Materials that can be investigated include metals, alloys, composites, ceramics, and coated systems. In particular, depth-resolved analyses using neutron diffraction complements surface investigations using laboratory X-rays in many scientific and engineering topics. The diffraction techniques can add significant downstream value to the anticipated nuclear industry development activities.",Venter A.,Journal,Journal of the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy,2015-10-01,NECSA,Chemical phase identification ;  Crystallographic texture ;  Neutron and X-ray diffraction ;  Residual stress

Causal dynamic effects in regional systems of technological activities: a SVAR approach,"This paper analyzes the causal relationships in regional technological systems within a structural vector autoregression framework. Applying a data-driven independent component analysis, it shows how the regional dynamics of economic, research, innovation and educational activities affect each other instantaneously and over time. By matching differently classified data on employees, patents and graduates, the analysis is based on a unique database which embraces multi-dimensional aspects for five clearly separated industries. The findings on how industry specific growth processes unfold are explained by referring to the type of industry and its knowledge base. For instance, it is found that more engineering-oriented industries like machine tools show a success-driven pattern, whereas science-based industries show a stronger dependence on universities. Such knowledge on the causal relations is of utmost relevance to the design and implementation of policy instruments.",Brenner T.; Duschl M.,Journal,Annals of Regional Science,2015-10-01,Philipps-Universität Marburg,C33 ;  O30 ;  R11
Probabilistic transmission expansion planning considering risk of cascading transmission line failures,"Recent studies have shown that power system blackouts occur much more likely than might be expected, and their probability distribution follows power law. Cascading outages have been reported as the major cause of the large blackouts; therefore, the risk of cascading outages is significant and should be considered in operating and planning assessments of the power systems. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Power Systems Engineering Research Center and University of Alaska (OPA) is a model developed on the basis of self-organized criticality to study cascading outages of transmission lines. In this paper, a modified version of the OPA model is used for considering risk of cascading transmission line outages in transmission expansion planning. The proposed method finds a set of effective candidate lines having higher capability for suppressing cascading outages; then, the original OPA is exploited over the planning horizon to analyze long-term reliability of the system. The benefit of each prospective transmission line is derived by the following two innovations in calculating the risk of blackouts: (i) the power law for finding the probability of blackouts; and (ii) a nonlinear estimation of the cost of the blackouts. Accordingly, the savings associated to each candidate line is calculated. These values are used to find the optimal plan using benefit/cost analysis. Two IEEE test systems are investigated to examine the applicability and scalability of the proposed method. The investigations revealed that the proposed method provides more effective scenarios, which entail considerable saving to society.",Karimi E.; Ebrahimi A.,Journal,International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems,2015-10-01,Isfahan University of Technology,blackout risk ;  cascading outages ;  power law ;  self-organized criticality (SOC) ;  transmission expansion planning

Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT): A review of the current status and applications,"Summary The applications of conventional computed tomography (CT) have been widely researched and implemented in clinical practice. A recent technological innovation in the field of CT is the emergence of four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), where a three-dimensional computed tomography volume containing a moving structure is imaged over a period of time, creating a dynamic volume data set. 4DCT has previously been mainly utilised in the setting of radiation therapy planning, but with the development of wide field of view CT, 4DCT has opened major avenues in the diagnostic arena. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive narrative review of the literature regarding the current clinical applications of 4DCT. The applications reviewed include both routine diagnostic usage as well as an appraisal of the current research literature. A systematic review of the studies related to 4DCT was conducted. The Medline database was searched using the MeSH subject heading 'Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography'. After excluding non-human and non-English papers, 2598 articles were found. Further exclusion criteria were applied, including date range (since wide field of view CT was introduced in 2007), and exclusion of technical/engineering/physics papers. Further filtration of papers included identification of Review papers. This process yielded 67 papers. Of these, exclusion of papers not specifically discussing 4DCT (cone beam, 4D models) yielded 38 papers. As part of the review, the technique for 4DCT is described, with perspectives as to how it has evolved and its benefits in different clinical indications.",Kwong Y.; Mel A.; Wheeler G.; Troupis J.,Journal,Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology,2015-10-01,Peter Maccallum Cancer Centre;Monash University;Monash Health,diagnostic imaging ;  four-dimensional computed tomography ;  humans ;  radiation oncology
The NIEHS superfund research program: 25 years of translational research for public health,"Background: The Superfund Research Program (SRP) is an academically based, multidisciplinary, translational research program that for 25 years has sought scientific solutions to health and environmental problems associated with hazardous waste sites. SRP is coordinated by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). It supports multi-project grants, undergraduate and postdoctoral training programs, individual research grants, and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Technology Transfer Research (STTR) grants. Results: SRP has had many successes: discovery of arsenic’s toxicity to the developing human central nervous system; documentation of benzene toxicity to hematologic progenitor cells in human bone marrow; development of novel analytic techniques such as the luciferase expression assay and laser fragmentation fluorescence spectroscopy; demonstration that PCBs can cause developmental neurotoxicity at low levels and alter the genomic characteristics of sentinel animals; elucidation of the neurodevelopmental toxicity of organophosphate insecticides; documentation of links between antimicrobial agents and alterations in hormone response; discovery of biological mechanisms through which environmental chemicals may contribute to obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cancer; tracking the health and environmental effects of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Hurricane Katrina; and development of novel biological and engineering techniques to facilitate more efficient and lower-cost remediation of hazardous waste sites. Conclusion: SRP must continue to address the legacy of hazardous waste in the United States, respond to new issues caused by rapid advances in technology, and train the next generation of leaders in environmental health science while recognizing that most of the world’s worst toxic hot spots are now located in low- and middle-income countries.",Landrigan P.; Wright R.; Cordero J.; Eaton D.; Goldstein B.; Hennig B.; Maier R.; Ozonoff D.; Smith M.; Tukey R.,Journal,Environmental Health Perspectives,2015-10-01,"Universidad de Puerto Rico;University of California, San Diego;University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food and Environment;University of California, Berkeley;School of Public Health;University of Washington;Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai;The University of Arizona;University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health",
Electronic supply chains: Status & perspective,"The area of e-commerce based supply chains (or e-supply chains) has received significant attention in the last two decades. Despite the high level of activity, the most recent reviews on this topic date back to the beginning of this century. In this paper, we analyzed the state of e-supply chain research published during January 2000-January 2015 AD, covering 165 articles from 47 ISI indexed journals. The analysis is performed using a five-dimensional framework comprising Topic-of-Study, Unit-of-Analysis, Research Perspective, Industry Type, and Research Method. Within these dimensions, Topic-of-Study plays a pivotal role, whereas the other four dimensions are analyzed around its sub-classification scheme. Our main objective is to establish a broader interdisciplinary understanding of the e-supply chain research domain, and to identify trends and gaps in contemporary e-supply chain theory and practice. The findings indicate that problems are addressed from different perspectives with varying levels of interest from researchers belonging to several academic disciplines including business, economics, engineering and social sciences. Our analysis also identified two distinct periods (2000-2006 and 2007 onwards) with different foci of research attention. The problems that received significant attention in the earlier period include innovation, adoption and barriers, and supply chain integration; while in the latter period, the focus seemed to have shifted towards supply chain integration and collaboration issues. Problems that received minimum interest across the two periods include customer relationship, economic and environmental impact.",Siddiqui A.; Raza S.,Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2015-10-01,Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University,E-commerce ;  E-supply chain ;  Supply chain management
Strategic agility of Korean small and medium enterprises and its influence on operational and firm performance,"This study explores the nature and role of agility as a strategic intent and its influence on operational and firm performance. Combining field interviews with the literature review, we develop theoretical connections between strategic agility of Korean small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and its underlying dimensions (technology capability, collaborative innovation, organizational learning, and internal alignment). Then, we propose a conceptual model for investigating the nomological network of influences among strategic agility, operational performance (responsiveness), and firm performance. Firm performance is measured as two alternative dimensions - customer retention and financial performance. Using structural equation modeling, we conduct a group of confirmatory analyses to test the empirical associations hypothesized in the structural models. The analysis results indicate that Korean SMEs' strategic intent toward agility has a positive influence on their operational performance and customer retention, but not on financial performance. Implications of the results are discussed in detail along with theoretical contributions and future research directions.",Shin H.; Lee J.; Kim D.; Rhim H.,Journal,International Journal of Production Economics,2015-10-01,Korea University Business School,Firm performance ;  Korean small and medium enterprises (SMEs) ;  Operational responsiveness ;  Strategic agility ;  Structural equation modeling

Cross-national analysis of the relation of eGovernment maturity and OSS growth,"The aims of this research are to explore and evaluate the nature of the relationship between open source software (OSS) and eGovernment maturity, as well as the factors impacting their development at a national level. The study proposes a theoretical framework, under the prism of which socio-economic, technological and institutional factors critical to eGovernment and OSS are revealed. The hypotheses are evaluated by means of an econometric model of simultaneous equations. In order to better gauge the results of the hypotheses, the model is evaluated over economic environments at different stages of development.Social development and OSS growth were found to be the most important facilitators for eGovernment maturity, across countries of all stages of development. Institutional quality, technological openness, freedom in press and the macro-economic environment exerted different weights of importance across different country groupings. Findings also suggest that technological infrastructure and innovation are important drivers for OSS growth across countries at all stages of development.

Symbolic Innovation in Agile Transformations,"Much of the empirical research on agile transformations concentrates on the success factors for effective change management. Although these factors are essential in establishing beneficial norms and practices, the existing research does not adequately address the importance of language in distinguishing the current plan-driven processes from their agile counterparts. The labels in agile and plan-driven processes represent practices that are well established. Accurate process labeling is the foundation for creating any inter-organizational lessons. This paper establishes the link between linguistic manipulation and how it might lead to a form of symbolic innovation that can impede a greater understanding of transformational challenges. During an agile transformation some organizational actors re-label deterministic plan-driven processes using agile language. The symbolic innovation leads to no improvement and as a result is more easily abandoned without meaningful process change.",Rose D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2015 Agile Conference, Agile 2015",2015-09-29,School of Information Studies,agile ;  language ;  project management ;  re-labeling ;  software development ;  symbolic innovation ;  transformation
Integrating Science and Engineering to Implement Evidence-Based Practices in Health Care Settings,"Integrating two distinct and complementary paradigms, science and engineering, may produce more effective outcomes for the implementation of evidence-based practices in health care settings. Science formalizes and tests innovations, whereas engineering customizes and optimizes how the innovation is applied tailoring to accommodate local conditions. Together they may accelerate the creation of an evidence-based healthcare system that works effectively in specific health care settings. We give examples of applying engineering methods for better quality, more efficient, and safer implementation of clinical practices, medical devices, and health services systems. A specific example was applying systems engineering design that orchestrated people, process, data, decision-making, and communication through a technology application to implement evidence-based depression care among low-income patients with diabetes.

The impact of platforms in product development: A case study in the Brazilian software industry,"The role of product platforms within companies and in mediating the activities of business conglomerates or ecosystems has been widely recognized as being of great importance to the management processes of new businesses, to the development of new products, and to innovation. The objective of the present work is to help understanding what the benefits found by Brazilian software companies are in the use of platforms for software development and associated services. Firstly, an analysis of the evolution of the scientific research on the concept of 'platform' was carried out. A bibliometric methodology was employed for a quantitative analysis and identification of the most relevant references, and a subsequent qualitative content analysis allowed establishing an analysis model that supported the case study. Analyzing a leading Brazilian company in the national market of software production, the benefits gained by this company, which uses a platform as the basis of its products, were observed go beyond the improvement of its capacity to produce software efficiently, also allowing the construction of a business model that stimulates external suppliers to develop solutions that complement the company's product portfolio.",Facin A.; De Mesquita Spinola M.; De Vasconcelos Gomes L.,Conference Proceeding,Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology,2015-09-21,Universidade de São Paulo,

"Cooperation models as success factor for interdisciplinary, inter-organizational research and development in the automotive industry","The automotive industry faces three major challenges - shortage of fossil fuels, politics of global warming and rising competition from new markets. In order to remain competitive companies have to develop more efficient and alternative fuel vehicles that meet the individual requirements of the customers. Functional integration combined with new technologies and materials are the key to stable success in this industry. The sustaining upward trend to system innovations within the last ten years confirms this. The development of complex products like automobiles claim skills of various disciplines e.g. engineering, chemistry. Furthermore, these skills are spread all over the supply chain. Hence the only way to stay successful in the automotive industry is cooperation and collaborative innovation. Interdisciplinary and interorganizational development has high demands on cooperation models especially in the automotive industry. In this case study cooperation models are analyzed and evaluated according to their applicability to interdisciplinary, interorganizational development projects in the automotive industry. Following, the research campus ARENA2036 is analyzed.

Project management in product development: Toward a framework for targeted flexibility,"As a discipline, project management has been accused of having lost its relevance for innovative initiatives because it emphasizes planning and control over the flexibility and learning-based strategies that are needed to succeed under uncertainty. Several authors therefore recommend adaptive project management practices - sometimes named 'targeted flexibility' - that respond to project characteristics commonly found in innovation, namely novelty, complexity, speed and - as a result - uncertainty. This paper investigates how this proposed adaptation of project management occurs in a context with high levels of novelty that organizes work in projects and needs to accommodate projects of different pace, complexity and innovativeness: product development in small and medium enterprises that do research and development work in the same organizational unit. Results of a literature review and two exploratory studies, covering a total of 8 companies with multiple projects each, are presented. Implications for a future framework for targeted flexibility are developed, leading to the identification of the following needs for project management: (1) better understanding of the many ways in which project management impacts exploration and exploitation activities, (2) improved attention for the currently poorly supported pre-project and early initiation stages, (3) a shift of focus from monitoring against plans toward monitoring against achieved learning, and (4) the formulation of transition paths from current new product development practice to higher project management maturity.",Jetter A.; Albar F.,Conference Proceeding,Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology,2015-09-21,Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science,

Multiple science data-oriented Technology Roadmapping method,"Since its first engagement with industry decades ago, Technology Roadmapping (TRM) is taking a more and more important role for technical intelligence in current R&D planning and innovation tracking. Important topics for both science policy and engineering management researchers involves with the approaches that refer to the real-world problems, explore value-added information from the complex data sets, fuse the analytic results and expert knowledge effectively and reasonable, and demonstrate to the decision makers visually and understandable. Moreover, the growing variety of science data sources in the Big Data Age increases these challenges and opportunities. Addressing these concerns, this paper proposes a TRM composing method with a clustering-based topic identification model, a multiple science data sources integration model, and a semi-automated fuzzy set-based TRM composing model with expert aid. We focus on a case study on computer science related R&D. Empirical data from the United States National Science Foundation Award data (innovative research ideas and proposals) and Derwent Innovation Index data source (patents emphasizing technical products) provide vantage points at two stages of the R&D process. The understanding gained will assist in description of computer science macro-trends for R&D decision makers.",Zhang Y.; Chen H.; Zhang G.; Zhu D.; Lu J.,Conference Proceeding,Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology,2015-09-21,University of Technology Sydney;Beijing Institute of Technology,
Fuzzy cognitive research on influencing factors of technology innovation: In view of path dependence,"Technology innovation promotes the economic growth of an enterprise. Innovation is not only an adaptive learning and cultural evolvement process but a market error trial process, during which there are a large number of random factors available with obvious unconformity and accumulation. Therefore, there are path dependences during the technology innovation. Based on the path dependence theory, this paper aims to establish a technology innovation evaluation frame and emphasize the important influence effects of path dependence factors on the enterprise technology innovation. Fuzzy cognitive map method is thereby used to identify causal relations among factors and describe FCM structural diagram for evaluation on the enterprise technology innovation. Meanwhile, a fuzzy feedback system of technology innovation evaluations is hereby established integrating with non-linear Hebbian learning algorithm, and the dependence on expert opinions may be avoided through learning and practice of the cognitive map. Finally, under the assistance of computer software platform, a dynamic simulation on any complex index system is realized accordingly, from which stable conditions can provide path references for an enterprise in carrying out technology innovations and improving the integral efficiency and effect of any realistic technology innovation activity.",Hu J.; Zhang Y.; Wang Y.,Conference Proceeding,Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology,2015-09-21,"China Jiliang University;Zhongchao Ink Co., Ltd.",

Fluidic origami: A plant-inspired adaptive structure with shape morphing and stiffness tuning,"Inspired by the physics behind the rapid plant movements and the rich topologies in origami folding, this research creates a unique class of multi-functional adaptive structure through exploring the innovation of fluidic origami. The idea is to connect multiple Miura folded sheets along their crease lines into a space-filling structure, and fill the tubular cells in-between with working fluids. The pressure and fluid flow in these cells can be strategically controlled much like in plants for nastic movements. The relationship between the internal fluid volume and the overall structure deformation is primarily determined by the kinematics of folding. This relationship can be exploited so that fluidic origami can achieve actuation/morphing by actively changing the internal fluid volume, and stiffness tuning by constraining the fluid volume. In order to characterize the working principles and performance potentials of these two adaptive functions, this research develops an equivalent truss frame model on a fluidic origami unit cell to analyze its fundamental elastic characteristics. Eigen-stiffness analysis based on this model reveals the primary modes of deformation and their relationships with initial folding configurations. Performances of the adaptive functions are correlated to the crease pattern design. In parallel to analytical studies, the feasibility of the morphing and stiffness tuning is also examined experimentally via a 3D printed multi-material prototype demonstrator. The research reported in this paper could lead to the synthesis of adaptive fluidic origami cellular metastructures or metamaterial systems for various engineering applications.",Li S.; Wang K.,Journal,Smart Materials and Structures,2015-09-18,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",adaptive structures ;  applied origami ;  cellular structures ;  metamaterials ;  metastructures ;  morphing ;  variable stiffness
SOLMED: solar energy and polymers for seawater desalination,"Abstract: Combining thermal solar energy and polymer materials allows seawater desalination while fossil fuels are saved and use of chemicals against fouling and corrosion is reduced. SOLar Multi-Effect Desalination (SOLMED) meets recommendations of the US National Research Council and Middle East Desalination Research Center of Oman regarding the future of water desalination. Water cost reduction and development of technologies with low environmental impact are the main guidelines of SOLMED. Thermal efficiency is at the heart of SOLMED. Process is based on low-temperature multi-effect distillation (LT-MED) powered by a thermal solar collector field, or better, by heat recovery at the outlet of a solar power plant. Heat transfer surfaces are made of thin wall polymer tubes to ensure a high thermal duty in spite of low thermal conductivity of polymers. Targeted capacities lie within 500–1,000 m3/d. The objective is to develop a LT-MED prototype made of polymers and to operate the system plugged to a solar heat source. To reach these objectives, SOLMED gathers a consortium of six partners, merging experts of thermal systems and components, experts in polymers and transformation, and engineering partners in the field of solar energy and processes. Social aspects are also taken into account through acceptability, sustainability, design, management of innovation, market, and life cycle assessment. SOLMED is a three years project funded by the French National Research Agency. The first step is to build a 10 m3/d prototype to bring a proof of concept. The prototype will be operated with a 100 kW peak solar heat source. Developments are related to the modeling of the process itself and its integration in a solar system including heat storage, thin-wall tubes fabrication, optimization of tubes fixing, investigations related to heat transfer, and hydraulic. Regarding polymer materials, the challenge is to combine high thermal rate with long lifetime. Commercial step has to consider new optimization approach, taking into consideration the whole process, including heat source.",Bandelier P.; d’Hurlaborde J.; Pelascini F.; Martins M.; Gonda A.; Alonso D.; Berlandis M.; Pigni F.,Journal,Desalination and Water Treatment,2015-09-18,Laboratoire Réactions et Génie des Procédés (LRGP);Grenoble Ecole de Management;CEA Grenoble;Epteau;Sophia Antipolis Energie Développement (SAED);CRITT Matériaux Alsace,Desalination ;  Distillation ;  Life cycle assessment ;  Low temperature ;  Multi-effect ;  Polymer ;  Solar energy

"Present situation, problems and countermeasures of cotton production mechanization development in Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps","The historical data analysis has showed that for the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (hereinafter referred as the Corps), its leading role of cotton production in the autonomous region and the nation is very clear. The reason is that the Corps cotton production mechanization has played a key role. Farming herd of the Corps are distributed in a typical arid region, and so agricultural harvest fertility should rely on not only the development of water-saving agriculture mechanization, but also the innovation of cotton production mechanization technology. First of all, mulch planting mechanization promotes the ascension of the Corps cotton production level for the first time, which has set the Corps cotton cultivation free from the traditional manual work into mechanical work. Cotton planting area and yield has greatly increased. On the basis of the mulch planting mechanization, the Corps integrated the drip irrigation under membrane, the precise seeding above membrane and the high density cultivation, and realized the second promotion of the Corps cotton production level. Two promotions, i. e. mulch planting mechanization and water-saving mechanization have realized high yield of cotton production in arid regions. Second, the cotton production mechanization technology innovation has basically achieved the Corps cotton planting mechanization in the whole process of the production. The water-saving agricultural mechanization development and the cotton production mechanization technology innovation, make the Corps cotton production develop towards the directions of large scale, mechanization, informatization, intelligentization and social service, and lead to the mechanization of cotton production in the full implementation. Also it fully shows that the improvement of agricultural equipment is a solid foundation for the development of modern agriculture, and especially in the arid region, the improvement of agricultural equipment level is more important for agricultural development. The Corps cotton production mechanization development is a good example to the agricultural mechanization development for not only China, but also the countries all over the world, especially in arid regions. But during the Corps cotton production mechanization development process, there are also some problems to be solved, such as residual membrane pollution to the environment and agricultural production, breeding new cotton varieties that adapt to mechanical harvesting and topping in cotton production mechanization. The solutions of these problems are badly in need of agricultural, biological, chemical, physical experts and management experts to overcome difficulty. Through the review of the history of the Corps cotton production mechanization development, on the basis of the summary of the Corps cotton production mechanization technology innovation, this paper combs some problems appearing in the process of cotton production mechanization, and then according to the development trend of agricultural machinery technology, puts forward some countermeasures for the Corps cotton production mechanization development in the future.",Wu J.; Chen X.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2015-09-15,Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences;Xinjiang Shihezi Vocational Technical College,Cotton ;  Countermeasure ;  Mechanization ;  Production ;  Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region
"Flipping, engaging, and teaming, oh my!

Critical design and evaluation factors of mobile business models: “Road block” eradicators for mobile networks operators,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to define critical design and evaluation factors of business models (BM) for mobile network operators (MNOs) in general, and more specifically for mobile data services. Design/methodology/approach – This paper follows a qualitative approach. Aiming to identify critical design factors for mobile BMs, this research, as a part of larger research, examines three real-life cases related to mobile data service BM design and engineering. These cases are Orange Business Services (OBS); Apple’s iPhone services and applications, and NTT DoCoMo’s i-mode service. Findings – In this paper, the authors provide a framework for designing and developing Market-Aligned, Cohesive, Dynamic, Explicit, and Unique BMs with Fitting Network-Mode, which, if adopted by MNOs, would ensure their long-term success by improving the sustainability and innovation capabilities of their BMs. These critical design factors address different spheres of the mobile business: “Cohesion” and “Explicitness” are operator-oriented, whereas “Market-Alignment,” “Dynamicity,” “Uniqueness,” and “Fitting Network-Mode” are industry-oriented. Research limitations/implications – Although the paper provides in-depth analysis of three case studies in the context of mobile telecommunications, the authors cannot claim that the developed framework can be generalized to all services in the mobile telecommunications industry. Further validation through empirical testing is preferred and this could be done in future research. Practical implications – The developed framework is of value to MNOs as it provides them with a holistic approach for designing and also evaluating successful BMs over time. This is because the developed framework defines critical design factors for BMs in the contexts of their environments. Originality/value – The domain of BMs is still emerging within the field of information systems. The majority of prior studies either tackled the issue of BM definition or provided taxonomies and classifications of this concept. The originality of this paper comes from the fact that it takes further steps in developing the concept by providing a comprehensive framework which encapsulates critical design and evaluation factors of mobile BMs.",Al-Debei M.; Al-Lozi E.; Al-Hujran O.,Journal,Journal of Enterprise Information Management,2015-09-14,Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan;The University of Jordan;Princess Sumaya University,Business model ;  Design factors ;  Mobile business ;  Mobile network operators
FISH and GISH: molecular cytogenetic tools and their applications in ornamental plants,"Key message: The innovations in chromosome engineering have improved the efficiency of interrogation breeding, and the identification and transfer of resistance genes from alien to native species. Abstract: Recent advances in molecular biology and cytogenetics have brought revolutionary, conceptual developments in mitosis and meiosis research, chromosome structure and manipulation, gene expression and regulation, and gene silencing. Cytogenetic studies offer integrative tools for imaging, genetics, epigenetics, and cytological information that can be employed to enhance chromosome and molecular genomic research in plant taxa. In situ hybridization techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), can identify chromosome morphologies and sequences, amount and distribution of various types of chromatin in chromosomes, and genome organization during the metaphase stage of meiosis. Over the past few decades, various new molecular cytogenetic applications have been developed. The FISH and GISH techniques present an authentic model for analyzing the individual chromosome, chromosomal segments, or the genomes of natural and artificial hybrid plants. These have become the most reliable techniques for studying allopolyploids, because most cultivated plants have been developed through hybridization or polyploidization. Moreover, introgression of the genes and chromatin from the wild types into cultivated species can also be analyzed. Since hybrid derivatives may have variable alien chromosome numbers or chromosome arms, the use of these approaches opens new avenues for accurately identifying genome differences.",Younis A.; Ramzan F.; Hwang Y.; Lim K.,Journal,Plant Cell Reports,2015-09-14,"University of Agriculture, Faisalabad;Sahmyook University;Kyungpook National University (KNU)",Banding techniques ;  Chromosome characterization ;  In situ hybridization ;  Physical mapping ;  Polyploidization

Asynchronous Brainstorming in an Industrial Setting,"Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the effectiveness of brainwriting in an industrial setting. Background: Research has demonstrated that group interaction can inhibit idea generation. Written exchanges of ideas in groups have been found to be an effective way to increase idea generation. To our knowledge, no study has examined the potential of brainwriting for group idea generation in work settings or the impact of different sequences of group and individual idea generation. Method: Participants in a high-technology company participated in two brainwriting studies. In one study, participants generated ideas either first alone and then in a group or in the reverse order. In a second study, participants either generated as a group during the entire session or alternated individual ideation with a periodic review of the groups ideas. Results: In the first study, participants who generated ideas first as a group and then as individuals performed best. In the first session, group writing also tended to lead to more ideas than did individual writing. In the second study, participants with periodic reviews performed best. Conclusion: The results suggest that alternation in individual and group brainwriting can enhance the number of ideas generated. The group-to-alone sequence is also beneficial since it allows group members to build on shared ideas. Application: This research indicates that collaborative idea sessions can be beneficial in work sessions if the brainwriting paradigm is used with an appropriate alternation of group ideation or review sessions with individual idea generation sessions.",Paulus P.; Korde R.; Dickson J.; Carmeli A.; Cohen-Meitar R.,Journal,Human Factors,2015-09-08,Tel Aviv University;The University of Texas at Arlington;Tmurot Ltd.,brainstorming ;  brainwriting ;  collaborative innovation ;  creativity ;  groups ;  idea selection

It increased their reported measures of learning and retention by an average of 0.66 on a five-point Likert scale, and revealed positive correlations between attention, enjoyment, ongoing interest and learning and retention. The study also contributed to innovation management research by revealing the influence of different data visualisation methods on decision quality, providing an example of research-integrated education that forms part of the research process. Such a dovetailing of different research studies demonstrates how engineering educators can enhance educational impact while multiplying the outcomes from their research efforts.",Killen C.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2015-09-03,University of Technology Sydney,decision simulation ;  engineering innovation ;  experiential learning ;  learning ;  retention
Successful or unsuccessful open source software projects: What is the key?,"This paper aims to analyse the key factors influencing knowledge sharing in open source software projects. Four deep cases are analyzed to develop a conceptual framework based on within-case and cross-case analysis. In terms of data collection, online (including skype meeting, email, email-list, IRC, forum, group meeting, etc) and offline (mainly with face-to-face discussion) activities are two major platforms. The research framework is that distributed innovation (independent variable) will influence shared knowledge (medium variable) and continue to affect the performance of OSS projects (dependent variable). During distributed innovation, developers located on the supply side will affect the shared knowledge from the aspects of Participative Motivation, Social Network and Organizational Culture. Meanwhile, users situated on the demand side will function from the view of user innovation.",Chen X.; Probert D.; Zhou Y.; Su J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2015 Science and Information Conference, SAI 2015",2015-09-02,University of Cambridge;Tsinghua University,Influencing Factors ;  knowledge Sharing ;  Open Source Software Projects ;  User Innovation
‘Necessary to engineers of the new generation’: what is important for engineers to know?,"Interest in establishing programs of Liberal Studies in Engineering that are not designed to be accredited by Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) necessarily intersects with the larger issue of how understandings of the liberal arts and social sciences should be incorporated into B.S. engineering programs. Debate over how (or how much) engineering education should focus on science and mathematical instruction is a long one; it stretches back to the early twentieth century and encompasses the proselytizing of Vannevar Bush (1890–1974), a leader at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and in the post-World War II creation of the National Science Foundation. Above all, Bush advocated ‘basic science’ as the root source of technological innovation in the modern world and he heralded science and math as the essential components of engineering education. The danger that engineering education which emphasizes – or gives credence to – the humanities and social sciences can be viewed as ‘engineering lite’ is not illusory and represents a perspective commonly held by leaders in engineering education. Unfortunately, a danger that might accompany the proliferation of programs in Liberal Studies (B.A.) in Engineering is that B.S. program administrators will perceive such programs as the only place where non-mathematical and non-scientific concerns and issues should be engaged within a broad-based engineering curriculum.",Jackson D.,Journal,Engineering Studies,2015-09-02,Lafayette College,engineering education ;  John R.

The role of serendipity in legal education: A living curriculum perspective,"This article evaluates the challenges of modular redesign and the potential contribution of serendipity in legal education by advancing a “living” curriculum model. The archaeology of the curricular redesign process is excavated by exploring the conditions influencing and constraining curricular redesign. Whilst this study is primarily located within the theoretical context of curricular redesign, it is also rooted in both the practice of law and higher education literature. A key concern of this research is to consider the under-explored interaction between serendipity and curricular design with a particular focus on how the surrounding serendipitous conditions proved timely and welcome in creating an unanticipated opportunity for such redesign. There remains a surprising dearth of research evaluating the influence of serendipity in legal education generally and, more specifically, with respect to the challenges of module redesign and delivery. This article uncovers a research agenda with themes concentrated on the role of serendipity in curricular design and how “real world” relevance can be incorporated into module redesign and delivery. It is suggested that serendipity-sensitive curricula which acknowledge current debates within law and the contemporary contexts within which law operates enhance students’ capacity to recognise the relevance and applicability of their legal knowledge. By remaining alert to the potential for serendipitous innovation in curricular redesign and by re-engineering curricula to facilitate serendipity, legal academics can enhance the incorporation of “real world” relevance into academic teaching.",Kelly G.,Journal,Law Teacher,2015-09-02,Faculty of Humanities & Social Sciences,
The impact of social capital on mass customisation and product innovation capabilities,"Social capital with customers has three dimensions: structural, relational and cognitive capital. We propose a research model on the joint effects of the three dimensions of social capital on mass customisation capability (MCC) and product innovation capability (PIC). The hypotheses are empirically tested using structural equation modelling and data collected from 276 manufacturing firms in China. The results show that the three dimensions of social capital contribute to MCC and PIC development through different mechanisms. In particular, cognitive capital has a significant impact on MCC; relational capital significantly influences PIC; and structural capital indirectly associates with both MCC and PIC. We also find that structural capital enhances both relational and cognitive capital. MCC improves PIC and fully mediates cognitive capital's effect on PIC. The findings extend current understanding about the complex interrelationships among structural, relational and cognitive capital and how to develop MCC and PIC by investing in social capital.",Zhang M.; Lettice F.; Zhao X.,Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2015-09-02,Norwich Business School;China Europe International Business School;South China University of Technology,mass customisation ;  product innovation ;  social capital
Bridge research and development for 30 years,"This book introduces 53 bridges that the author designed during his period teaching at Dalian University of Technology (1984-2014). The bridges have unique features; some bridges are the first of their kind in China, while the others are the biggest in size. For example, Jinma Bridge is the longest single concrete, single-plane, cable-stayed bridge in the world and Xinghai Bridge is the first double-deck, steel truss suspension bridge being constructed in the Sea of China. Innovation and reasonable structure designs must meet the requirements of applicability, economy, safety, artistic appearance and endurance. Innovation and rational stress are the main concern when considering bridge functionality. Only innovation can make new bridges surpass previously designed bridges. Only rational stress can save materials and reach the requirements of economy, safety and endurance. Teachers, students and engineers engaged in bridge engineering will be inspired from the designing concepts and methods within this book. The author compiles thirty years of work and dedication in the field and shares his discoveries with the readers who are interested in bridge design and functionality.",Zhe Z.,Book,Bridge Research and Development for 30 Years,2015-09-01,Dalian University of Technology,

From Evidence to Impact: Recommendations for a Dissemination Support System,"While finding effective solutions to child and adolescent health problems is very much a scientific endeavor, getting those solutions into widespread practice largely is not. This paper applies lessons from business and engineering to highlight the shortcomings of current approaches to science translation. In challenging the status quo, the paper introduces and defends three propositions: that many evidence-based programs are not worth disseminating; most research-tested versions of programs are not ready for widespread use; and most intervention developers and testers make poor disseminators. These propositions provide the basis for recommending three components of an enhanced dissemination support system, and the conceptualization of a new model to disseminate evidence-based solutions to promote child and adolescent health.",Kreuter M.; Wang M.,Journal,New directions for child and adolescent development,2015-09-01,"Washington University in St. Louis, George Warren Brown School of Social Work;Harvard T.H.

Comprehensive evaluation of the technology innovation capability of China's high-tech industries based on fuzzy borda combination method,"Technology innovation capability is a main driver in improving a country's industrial competitiveness. Development prospects and development speed are strongly dependent on industry innovation capability. Therefore, how to effectively and correctly evaluate the innovation capability of industry is of great importance. On the basis of previous research, this paper establishes an index system for evaluating the technology innovation capability of China's high-tech industries. The index is characterized by the objective evaluation of objects with measurable indexes. The fuzzy Borda method uses precise digital methods to handle fuzzy evaluation objects; therefore, more scientific and pragmatic quantitative criteria are obtained with qualitative and quantitative evaluation results. This paper is the first attempt to apply the fuzzy Borda combination method to high-tech industry innovation capability evaluation. We establish a fuzzy Borda combination model based on four kinds of single evaluation models. By making a combination evaluation, the disadvantages of a single evaluation method are avoided. In the end, based on the fuzzy Borda combination evaluation model, the real technology innovation data of 2013 is analyzed and the innovation capability of individual industry is ranked, which will provide useful guidance for decision-making administrators.",Hong Y.; Niu D.; Xiao B.; Wu L.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2015-09-01,North China Electric Power University,
Intellectual capital and technological innovation: The mediating role of supply chain learning,"This paper analyzes the influence of intellectual capital on firms' technological innovation, and the intermediary effect of supply chain learning in the relationship between different dimensions of intellectual capital and technological innovation. Using a questionnaire to survey 167 Chinese high and medium-high technological manufacturing firms, our research provides a new insight with interesting results. (1) Among the four dimensions of intellectual capital, only two dimensions, internal social capital and external social capital, exert positive effect on technological innovation; (2) Among the two dimensions of supply chain learning, learning from both suppliers and customers exerts a significant effect on technological innovation, and learning from the customer has a more significant effect; (3) A complete intermediary effect occurs from supply chain learning in the relationship among human capital, structural capital and technological innovation, while an incomplete intermediary effect occurs from supply chain learning in the relationship among external social capital, internal social capital, and technological innovation.",Zhang H.; Lv S.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2015-09-01,Tianjin University,
The commercialisation of university engineering projects: Entrepreneurship processes and practices,"The wider context in which technology innovation takes place includes innovation that occurs at various levels within a national innovation network. The national innovation network recognises the role of Universities and other public sector organisations in developing more basic research. However, universities and government agencies may also contribute to more practical technological developments by better utilising students' projects. The focus of this chapter is the commercialisation of university student engineering or design projects including examples of developmental processes and practices in the UK and Malaysia.

The Role of Human Capital in University-Business Cooperation: The Case of Mexico,"The interaction between industrial firms and academia has long been extremely weak in Mexico in spite of the manufacturing revival sparked by NAFTA since 1994. This situation is paradoxical given the persistent efforts from the Mexican State to encourage university-industry linkages. Over the years, this uncoupling has produced two effects: on the one hand, university research has followed its own agenda, mainly driven by scientists’ interests based on their career tracks, and on the other hand, most firms lack research and development capabilities because they have preferred to seek abroad for technological advice. Because human capital plays a crucial role in this phenomenon, we then focus on answering the following question: to what extent are Mexican industrial firms able to harness university knowledge? Analyses carried out on a survey of 39,336 enterprises, which were collected by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), suggest that larger firms are more capable of absorbing the knowledge generated by universities thanks to their higher level of human capital, whereas smaller firms face harder challenges to harness academic knowledge because of their lack of qualified engineers and technicians that can help them to address their innovative endeavours. The implication of these results for public policy is that collaboration between industry and academia in Mexico can be encouraged by selectively supporting the hire of relatively low-trained engineering graduates and technicians, whereas universities should also be able to promote key programming skills, technical training, infrastructure skills and even sales training and negotiation skills, much earlier in the academic process.",Merritt H.,Journal,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,2015-09-01,Instituto Politécnico Nacional,Absorptive capacity ;  Human capital ;  Industrial innovation ;  Mexico ;  University-industry cooperation
Status and challenges of intellectual property rights in agriculture innovation in India,"The present study is an attempt to analyse the overview and impact of intellectual property rights (IPRs) on agricultural innovation in India. This paper examines the patenting activity to identify current innovations in crop farming in India. In the case of granted patents, majority of the patents belong to the area of plant growth. It explores the specificities of patent portfolios and its scope of future innovations in the agriculture engineering sector. But there are still unanswered questions about whether emerging and evolving IPR regimes in developing countries will contribute to enhance agricultural productivity. This paper attempts to answer some of these questions by tracing the effects of IPRs on private investment in crop genetic improvement and in turn, on agricultural productivity. However, the research looks at the prospect of India as a developing country to boost its current intellectual property (IP) framework and legislation in order to develop its agricultural technology. Hence, it focuses on whether there is a single system as a model of IP regime to enhance agriculture production in India. The research is based on secondary data.",Kumar V.; Sinha K.,Journal,Journal of Intellectual Property Rights,2015-09-01,Central University of Gujarat,Agricultural innovation ;  Intellectual property rights ;  Patent ;  Research and development ;  Technology
Security tests and attack experimentations of ProtoGENI,"Tests and experiments to investigate selected security issues through ProtoGENI are conducted throughout this paper. The ProtoGENI is through its Spiral 1 time period, which primarily focuses on developing control and aggregating functions, up to the beginning of Spiral 4 time period now. Spiral 4 focuses on the transition from a rapid-prototyping effort to a 'real GENI' that supports network research experimentation. Owing to the lack of security related functions in the ProtoGENI's initial status, there is a necessity to explore the security vulnerabilities of ProtoGENI. Throughout the past several Spiral time periods, we designed four major sets of security tests and experiments, to examine certain types of its security vulnerabilities. All of the above tests and experiments showed that it is very possible that ProtoGENI nodes may render vulnerabilities to these attacks.",Gao J.; Xiao Y.; Rao S.; Shalini F.,Journal,International Journal of Security and Networks,2015-09-01,Department of Computer Science,Attacks ;  GENI ;  Global environment for network innovations ;  ProtoGENI ;  Security

How to thrive in the era of collaborative services entrepreneurship,"Services have been steadily displacing products in industrialized economies for a half century-which is not to say that products are going away; rather, they are going into services. Cheap sensors and ubiquitous connectivity are accelerating this trend. For technology-based firms, these conditions create many opportunities to participate in productservice business ecosystems. For industrial firms to thrive in this environment, they must be able to explore in the market with partners and customers. That is, they must learn to navigate partner uncertainty and end user uncertainty at the same time. This balancing act can be thought of as collaborative services entrepreneurship. The keys to success are establishing the fi rm's strategic boundaries and developing early business-model validation methods. This article illuminates those capabilities and shows how two (or more) firms can act in concert while each acts in its own self-interest.",Ogilvie T.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2015-09-01,Peer Insight,Business model innovation ;  Platform strategy ;  Product-services ecosystem ;  Services innovation
Innovation and Wearable Computing: A Proposed Collaborative Policy Design Framework,"The rapidly expanding market for wearable computing devices (wearables), driven by the confluence of information and communication technology and public acceptance of a design aesthetic, suggests nearly limitless potential for consumer uses. As adoption of wearables spreads, there are cultural and social impacts that represent both barriers and opportunities, with subsequent public policy ramifications. All too often designers, technologists, and policymakers operate independently; consequently, often products are out of sync, lack interoperability, or are hindered by well-meaning (but obstructive) policy. This article proposes a collaborative policy design framework, based on initial trials undertaken at a multidisciplinary collaborative engineering center, the Wireless Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center. The proposed collaborative policy design process will enhance the development of wearable devices and guide interdisciplinary collaborators as they explore the various implications and effects of device design in social, technological, and regulatory contexts.",Baker P.; Gandy M.; Zeagler C.,Journal,IEEE Internet Computing,2015-09-01,Georgia Institute of Technology,design for wearability ;  Internet/Web technologies ;  public policy issues ;  social issues ;  wearable computers

A molecular pharmacologist's guide to G protein-coupled receptor crystallography,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structural biology has progressed dramatically in the last decade. There are now over 120 GPCR crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank of 32 different receptors from families scattered across the phylogenetic tree, including class B, C, and Frizzled GPCRs. These structures have been obtained in combination with a wide variety of ligands and captured in a range of conformational states. This surge in structural knowledge has enlightened research into the molecular recognition of biologically active molecules, the mechanisms of receptor activation, the dynamics of functional selectivity, and fueled structure-based drug design efforts for GPCRs. Here we summarize the innovations in both protein engineering/molecular biology and crystallography techniques that have led to these advances in GPCR structural biology and discuss how they may influence the resulting structural models. We also provide a brief molecular pharmacologist's guide to GPCR X-ray crystallography, outlining some key aspects in the process of structure determination, with the goal to encourage noncrystallographers to interrogate structures at the molecular level. Finally, we show how chemogenomics approaches can be used to marry the wealth of existing receptor pharmacology data with the expanding repertoire of structures, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanistic details of GPCR function.",Piscitelli C.; Kean J.; De Graaf C.; Deupi X.,Journal,Molecular Pharmacology,2015-09-01,Heptares Therapeutics Ltd;Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences;Paul Scherrer Institut,
Technology and external conditions at play: A study of learning-by-licensing practices in China,"Abstract Learning-by-licensing is a widely used strategy to build technological capabilities.

Relatively little is known about the interactions between cross-level factors. In this study, we look at both the attributes of licensed technology and the external conditions in which the licensee operates, investigating how they interact in the learning-by-licensing process.

Quo vadis cyber-physical systems: Research areas of cyber-physical ecosystems,"Many technological innovations from the research area of dynamic adaptive systems or IT ecosystems are already established in current software systems. Especially cyber-physical systems should benefit by this progress to provide smart applications in ambient environments of private and industrial space. But a proper and methodical engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems (CPES) is still an open and important issue. Traditional software and systems engineering facilities (system models, description languages, or process models) do not consider fundamental characteristics of these ecosystems as openness, uncertainty, or emergent constitution at runtime sufficiently. But especially these aspects let blur the line of system boundaries at design time. The diverse components of CPES have essential impacts on the engineering of CPES as well, concerning time synchronizing, execution control, and interaction structure. Self-balanced control in CPES promises new application possibilities, but also needs new engineering techniques concerning the overall engineering process, including requirements engineering and runtime verification.

Placental growth factor deficiency is associated with impaired cerebral vascular development in mice,"Study hypothesis: Placental growth factor (PGF) is expressed in the developing mousebrain and contributes to vascularization and vessel patterning. study finding: PGF is dynamically expressed in fetal mouse brain, particularly forebrain, and is essential for normal cerebrovascular development. what is known already: PGF rises in maternal plasma over normal human and mouse pregnancy but is low in many women with the acute onset hypertensive syndrome, pre-eclampsia (PE). Little is known about the expression of PGF in the fetus during PE. Pgf -/- mice appear normal but recently cerebral vascular defects were documented in adult Pgf -/- mice. study design, samples/materials, methods: Here, temporal-spatial expression of PGF is mapped in normal fetal mouse brains and cerebral vasculature development is compared between normal and congenic Pgf -/- fetuses to assess the actions of PGF during cerebrovascular development. Pgf/PGF, Vegfa/VEGF, Vegf receptor (Vegfr)1 and Vegfr2 expression were examined in the brains of embryonic day (E)12.5, 14.5, 16.5 and 18.5 C57BL/6 (B6) mice using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. The cerebral vasculature was compared between Pgf -/- and B6 embryonic and adult brains using whole mount techniques. Vulnerability to cerebral ischemia was investigated using a left common carotid ligation assay. main results and the role of chance: Pgf/PGF and Vegfr1 are highly expressed in E12.5-14.5 forebrain relative to VEGF and Vegfr2. Vegfa/VEGF is relatively more abundant in hindbrain (HB). PGF and VEGF expression were similar in midbrain. Delayed HB vascularization was seen at E10.5 and 11.5 in Pgf -/- brains. At E14.5, Pgf -/- circle ofWillis showed unilateral hypoplasia and fewer collateral vessels, defects that persisted post-natally. Functionally, adult Pgf -/- mice experienced cerebral ischemia after left common carotid arterial occlusion while B6 mice did not. limitations, reasons for caution: Since Pgf -/- mice were used, consequences of complete absence of maternal and fetal PGF were defined. Therefore, the effects of maternal versus fetal PGF deficiency on cerebrovascular development cannot be separated. However, as PGF was strongly expressed in the developing brain at all timepoints, we suggest that local PGF has a more important role than distant maternal or placental sources. Full PGF loss is not expected in PE pregnancies, predicting that the effects of PGF deficiency identified in this model will be more severe than any effects in PE-offspring. wider implications of the findings: These studies provoke the question of whether PGF expression is decreased and cerebral vascular maldevelopment occurs in fetuses who experience a preeclamptic gestation. These individuals have already been reported to have elevated risk for stroke and cognitive impairments. large scale data: N/A.study funding and competing interest(s): This work was supported by awards from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Canada Research Chairs Program and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation to B.A.C. and by training awards from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil to R.L.L.; Queen's University to V.R.K. and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to M.T.R.

Value measurement on performance in global software development: An industry study on how R&D can influence 'value for money',"GSD is a fact for internationally operating software engineering companies. The Economic Value Added (EVA) provides an overview of the cost and revenue of such projects and the R&D teams influence the cost position and revenue to a huge extent. The measurement of impact of R&D and it's influence on 'value for money', however is a less ventured region. The actual outcome of a product in terms of value for money provides insights on the role of R&D (Research & Development) to increase revenue and reduce cost of the product. In any software engineering project this is difficult, but in a globally distributed setting measuring the value is even more important in order to make balanced decision considering for example short and long-term value creation or future development settings (e.g. How and where to distribute the development teams). This paper presents a model for measuring the value of a software product in software development projects. We have identified different factors, which should be taken into account when looking for the value of a software product, based on a literature review, available data within the company and several stakeholder interviews. These factors are quantitative (e.g. Number of defects) and qualitative factors (e.g. Innovation). Next, we mapped these factors to a value curve to show the value performance within a globally distributed software product development project. Additionally, we have applied these factors to a globally distributed project in order to understand the value evolution. The outcome of this paper is a model used in the case company to measure the value for money of a software product during development process as well as a first application of this model within industry context.",Viswanath U.; Betz S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE 10th International Conference on Global Software Engineering Workshops, ICGSEW 2015",2015-08-27,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Siemens Technology and Services Pvt.

Systematic Software Development: A State of the Practice Report from Germany,"The speed of innovation and the global allocation of resources to accelerate development or to reduce cost put pressure on the software industry. In the global competition, especially so-called high-price countries have to present arguments why the higher development cost is justified and what makes these countries an attractive host for software companies. Often, high-quality engineering and excellent quality of products, e.g., Machinery and equipment, are mentioned. Yet, the question is: Can such arguments be also found for the software industry? We aim at investigating the degree of professionalism and systematization of software development to draw a map of strengths and weaknesses. To this end, we conducted as a first step an exploratory survey in Germany, presented in this paper. In this survey, we focused on the perceived importance of the two general software engineering process areas project- and quality management and their implementation in practice. So far, our results suggest that the necessity for a systematic software development is well recognized, while software development still follows an ad-hoc rather than a systematized style. Our results provide initial findings, which we finally use to elaborate a set of working hypotheses. Those hypotheses allow to steer the adaptation of our instrument in the future to eventually facilitate replications toward a more comprehensive theory on systematic globally distributed software development in practice.",Kuhrmann M.; Fernandez D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE 10th International Conference on Global Software Engineering, ICGSE 2015",2015-08-25,Technische Universität München;Syddansk Universitet,software development ;  software process ;  software process improvement ;  survey research ;  test process

A preliminary study into research about open innovation with focus on the field of computer science,"This paper describes preliminary results regarding research on Open Innovation (OI) in peer reviewed literature. Special focus is put on the field of computer science as compared to other fields using the categorization scheme of Thomson Reuters' Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Core Collection). The study was triggered by the observation that peer reviewed literature on OI seems to have a less distinct growth in recent years than publications included in Google Scholar which involves non-peer reviewed literature to a much larger extent. When analyzing peer reviewed literature on OI, we observed that the field of Computer Science seems to have significantly less diversity than all other fields with more than ten publications indexed in the ISI Core Collection. Our preliminary interpretation of this observation is that the topic 'Open Innovation' has not yet been researched and discussed in depth and breadth comparable to other fields, in particular Business Economics, Engineering, and Operations Research Management Science.",Yin H.; Pfahl D.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2015-08-24,Tartu Ülikool,Open innovation ;  Peer reviewed publications ;  Text mining
Requirements engineering in open innovation: A research agenda,"In recent years Open Innovation (OI) has gained much attention and made firms aware that they need to consider the open environment surrounding them. To facilitate this shift Requirements Engineering (RE) needs to be adapted in order to manage the increase and complexity of new requirements sources as well as networks of stakeholders. In response we build on and advance an earlier proposed software engineering framework for fostering OI, focusing on stakeholder management, when to open up, and prioritization and release planning. Literature in open source RE is contrasted against recent findings of OI in software engineering to establish a current view of the area. Based on the synthesized findings we propose a research agenda within the areas under focus, along with a framing-model to help researchers frame and break down their research questions to consider the different angles implied by the OI model.",Linåker J.; Regnell B.; Munir H.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2015-08-24,Lunds Universitet,Open innovation ;  Open source ;  Prioritization ;  Release planning ;  Requirements engineering ;  Software engineering ;  Stakeholder management

Services supporting collaborative alignment of engineering networks,"Large-scale facilities such as power plants, process factories, ships and communication infrastructures are often engineered and delivered through geographically distributed operations. The competencies required are usually distributed across several contributing organisations. In these complicated projects, it is of key importance that all partners work coherently towards a common goal. VTT and a number of industrial organisations in the marine sector have participated in a national collaborative research programme addressing these needs. The main output of this programme was development of the Innovation and Engineering Maturity Model for Marine-Industry Networks. The recently completed European Union Framework Programme 7 project COIN developed innovative solutions and software services for enterprise collaboration and enterprise interoperability. One area of focus in that work was services for collaborative project management. This article first addresses a number of central underlying research themes and previous research results that have influenced the development work mentioned above. This article presents two approaches for the development of services that support distributed engineering work. Experience from use of the services is analysed, and potential for development is identified. This article concludes with a proposal for consolidation of the two above-mentioned methodologies.

The problems of environmentally involved firms: innovation obstacles and essential issues in the achievement of environmental innovation,"Abstract Environmental innovation has been discussed from different approaches in the last decade, due to its increasing importance for business competitiveness and as an engine for the economic development of a country, especially in recessionary economic phases. However, the study of the factors that hinder the achievement of environmental innovations has been largely neglected. This paper focuses on the obstacles facing firms involved in environmental innovations and how they still manage to achieve these innovations. The data used comes from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) conducted in Spain in the year 2012, while the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and binary logistic regression are the statistical techniques used. The findings show that the obstacles that companies involved in environmental innovations face are greater and different to those faced by companies which are not involved in them. Consequently, environmental innovation requires different action plans from those for non-environmental innovation; these actions include public funding, and cooperation, as well as other specific support measures. This research provides a systematic framework for environmental innovation and the ways to overcome the barriers to this innovation. Thereby supplying a roadmap for the creation of an innovation system that constitutes a favourable context for overcoming these obstacles, thus bringing about the success of the environmental innovation process through certain critical factors.",Souto J.; Rodriguez A.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2015-08-15,Universidad Europea de Madrid;Universidad Complutense de Madrid;Universidad Autónoma de Madrid,Cooperation ;  Environmental innovation ;  Obstacles to environmental innovation ;  Public funding

Flax: Sustainability is the new luxury,"'Flax: increasing its value for society' was the challenge posed by cross-border researchers funded by the European Union INTERREG IV A France (Channel)-England call, as the ancient flax fiber had seen a dramatic decline in consumer appeal and market share. The resulting collaboration, ProjectFlax, delivered new innovations where novel applications in sustainable materials for human and environmental wellbeing produced premium products from an unexpected plant source. Could value in future be defined and measured not just by the aesthetics of the artefact, but by assessing the true value of materials using a holistic narrative in relation to process, the philosophy and sustainability of the application? This assessment is, we argue, new luxury. The purpose of this chapter is to show that flax was an unexpected source of innovation for societal advantage, appealing to consumers who desired a deeper material meaning and product differentiation-characteristics afforded by traditional expensive luxury brands. The collaboration between design, science, technology, engineering, mathematics and business (D-STEM-B) combined discipline methodologies, which resulted in new thinking and problem solving. Case study, desk-based, laboratory, practice-led, field study, quantitative, qualitative, narrative and observational methods were explored by 20 national and international, commercial and institutional flax researchers. The findings included improved agricultural and industrial production methods, composites, foodstuffs, biodegradable packaging, bio materials, fashion and interior product prototypes. The research has contributed to a knowledge transfer toolbox between D-STEM-B partners and advanced transdisciplinary working methods, which resulted in further successful funding applications and new market opportunities for flax.",Farrer J.; Watt C.,Book,Handbook of Sustainable Luxury Textiles and Fashion,2015-08-10,University of Portsmouth,Agriculture ;  Business ;  Design ;  Flax ;  Luxury ;  Science ;  Sustainable materials ;  Transdisciplinary ;  Wellbeing

Regional determinants of research and development institutions in India,"This paper provides an understanding of the regional determinants of research and development (R&D) institutions in India. R&D facilities locate across regions in response to factors such as: science and technology manpower availability, banking facilities, transport infrastructure, favorable real estate prices, state domestic product, patents, literacy, quality engineering colleges, higher education institutions, and investment via research and development expenditure. Further, R&D location brings regional change via industry location, employment and investment leading to regional economic development. The Indian government has pursued a balanced regional development strategy since the inception of planning in the 1950s. This strategy would need a dispersed location in geographical space. This policy changed to a market-oriented approach beginning in 1991. Various technology policy documents have emphasized upon ‘promotion of science and technology research’, ‘attainment of technological competence’, ‘enlarging investment in R&D’, and ‘synergize science, technology and innovation’. To examine the trends of R&D this paper addresses the following four questions: (1) what are the regional patterns of R&D distribution in India? (2) what are the sector patterns of R&D distribution in India? (3) What determines the regional distribution of patents? (4) What determines the regional distribution of R&D in India during the periods 1988–1989, 1998–1999 and 2009–2010? Multiple regression models are run to estimate the determinants of R&D in geographical space.",Thakur S.; Malecki E.,Journal,GeoJournal,2015-08-06,"California State University, Sacramento;The Ohio State University",India ;  Regression models ;  Research and development institutions ;  Spatial analysis

Higher Education Institutions as international hubs in community service engineering innovation networks a European Lifelong Learning Program project,"In the Lifelong Learning Project 'Community Service Engineering (CSE)' six European partners work on engineering curricula specifically in the social domain. Engineering educators and the social domain do not typically speak the same language, which leaves a lot of innovation potential amongst student projects untouched. The main goal of the collaboration is to design an international post-graduate course and graduate and undergraduate electives in Community Service Engineering, with an international and blended learning component. In the network economy Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) form a hub in research and development for societal innovation and transformation. Vulnerable groups in society can benefit from this, when future engineers give them and their unmet needs special attention. For this the Community Service Engineering (CSE) project works on defining a CSE curriculum and educational framework based on CDIO principles. Increasing effectiveness of education by providing authentic and activating learning environments are parts of the formula the CSE project focuses on. A combination of push and pull mechanisms can be set up in two ways between the technological enterprises, the social domain and HEIs. In these networks education can shift from teaching students to reinvent the wheel time and again in an artificial setting to letting them participate in interdisciplinary co-creation in an authentic learning environment, solving real problems in transformation research. HEIs can facilitate and monitor the learning processes of students and teaching staff. By using a joint digital platform for blended learning and building thematic digital repositories around CSE, HEIs can join forces in an international setting, and work in a bigger context around local and unique innovation challenges in order to make society more inclusive for vulnerable groups.",Hallenga-Brink S.; Vervoort I.,Conference Proceeding,"Engineering4Society 2015 - Raising Awareness for the Societal and Environmental Role of Engineering and (Re)Training Engineers for Participatory Design, Proceedings",2015-08-04,"Thomas More, Belgium;The Hague University of Applied Sciences",blended learning ;  CDIO ;  co-creation ;  co-learning ;  Community Service Engineering ;  innovation networks ;  interdisciplinary education ;  international HEI collaboration ;  open innovation ;  work integrated learning
Mobile work: Ergonomics in a rapidly changing work environment,"BACKGROUND: Places of work have been completely transformed by innovations in mobile work tools and ever-present access to internet data. OBJECTIVE: This article characterizes use patterns and provides preliminary considerations for productive and comfortable use of common mobile devices. METHOD: Two surveys described trends in mobile work. In the first, ergonomics professionals who oversee programs reported common mobile devices, their users and what data is accessed. The second, an end user survey, explored common activities performed on mobile devices, duration of use and locations where mobile work is common. RESULTS: The survey results provide a baseline data point for the status of mobile work in early 2014. DISCUSSION: Research indicates that additional risks have been introduced to the neck, thumbs and hands when using mobile devices. Possible trends regarding device use and work locations emerge. Intervention studies provide some direction for the practitioner. Practical strategies are outlined to reduce exposure intensity and duration. CONCLUSION: Contemporary mobile work presents tremendous change and opportunity for ergonomists and researchers to keep pace with fitting the changing models of work to the person.

The Attitude of Egyptian SET Academics towards Innovation: Universities and Innovation in a Factor-Driven Economy,"In the modern knowledge economy universities are being required to operate more entrepreneurially, commercializing the results of their research and spinning out new ventures. The literature on the Triple Helix model (of academic–industry–government relations) is outlined, emphasizing – as does the model – the enhanced role that the modern entrepreneurial university plays in technological innovation. The study then examines the situation in Egypt where, as an earlier study demonstrated, innovation and the role of higher education in the innovation process are only weakly developed. Four hundred science, engineering and technology academics from eight of Egypt's private and public universities were surveyed to identify why this is the case. The results reveal that while there is considerable uncertainty amongst academics in both the private and public sectors about the role of Egyptian universities in the innovation process, there is recognition of the need for government intervention and support if the country's universities are to adopt this Third Mission function. The possible types of intervention and support are considered, which will be of relevance to both academics and policy makers in Egypt and other factor-driven economies.",Hadidi H.; Kirby D.,Journal,Industry and Higher Education,2015-08-01,The British University in Egypt,Egypt ;  entrepreneurial university ;  factor-driven economies ;  innovation ;  knowledge economy ;  Triple Helix
Combat: Initial experience with a randomized clinical trial of plasma-based resuscitation in the field for traumatic hemorrhagic shock,"The existing evidence shows great promise for plasma as the first resuscitation fluid in both civilian and military trauma. We embarked on the Control of Major Bleeding After Trauma (COMBAT) trial with the support of the Department of Defense to determine if plasma-first resuscitation yields hemostatic and survival benefits. The methodology of the COMBAT study represents not only 3 years of development work but also the integration of nearly two decades of technical experience with the design and implementation of other clinical trials and studies. Herein, we describe the key features of the study design, critical personnel and infrastructural elements, and key innovations. We will also briefly outline the systems engineering challenges entailed by this study. The COMBAT trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, semiblinded, prospective, phase IIB clinical trial conducted in a ground ambulance fleet based at a level I trauma center and part of a multicenter collaboration. The primary objective of the COMBAT trial is to determine the efficacy of field resuscitation with plasma first compared with standard of care (normal saline). To date, we have enrolled 30 subjects in the COMBAT study. The ability to achieve intervention with a hemostatic resuscitation agent in the closest possible temporal proximity to injury is critical and represents an opportunity to forestall the evolution of the ""bloody vicious cycle."" Thus, the COMBAT model for deploying plasma in first-response units should serve as a model for randomized clinical trials of other hemostatic resuscitative agents.",Chapman M.; Moore E.; Chin T.; Ghasabyan A.; Chandler J.; Stringham J.; Gonzalez E.; Moore H.; Banerjee A.; Silliman C.; Sauaia A.,Journal,Shock,2015-08-01,"Vitalant, USA;Denver Health;Denver Health Med Center",COMBAT ;  FFP ;  FP24 ;  Hemorrhage ;  Hemorrhagic shock ;  Hemostatic resuscitation ;  Plasma ;  Plasma-first resuscitation ;  Randomized clinical trial ;  Trauma ;  Trauma-induced coagulopathy

System framework of land consolidation based on systematic engineering and statistics theory in China,"Because of the contradiction of more people and less land, combining with the threat of land degradation and pollution, land consolidation has become the main way resolving these problems. In the end of 1990's, China issued Land Administration Law, which meant that land development, land arrangement and land reclamation had been promoted to law level and showed the government's attention to land consolidation. At present, ecological civilization has been treated as the national strategy, which needs system framework for land consolidation designed at top level including quantity control, quality management and ecology protection. Unfortunately, a systematic and scientific land consolidation system has not been established on account of theory research work falling behind application work. This paper compared the content, importance and framework level of land consolidation system and land scientific system based on the overseas and domestic research status. Starting from the logic view of land use and cognition, which manifested the procedure of needing land, understanding land, controlling land, fearing land and sustainably using land, the system was divided into the core layer, the supporting layer and the criterion layer. The core layer consisted of technology, theory and discipline. The technology and theory could set up the discipline, while the discipline could accelerate the development of the former two. The supporting layer consisted of management and culture, which could facilitate each other. The criterion layer was land consolidation law, which was treated as a basic standard and guideline for the other systems. It presented the method and principle of how to establish the system framework according to the theory of system engineering and statistics. The results showed that land consolidation system was composed of 6 contents including technology system, theoretical system, disciplinary system, management system, cultural system and legal system. Firstly, land consolidation technology system was the core, which included region classification, investigation, land planning, engineer designation, engineering construction, evaluation, information, technology criterion. Secondly, land consolidation theory system was the basis, which included basic theory, methodology and application. Thirdly, land consolidation discipline system was the impetus, which included major cultivation, personnel training, platform construction, communication and cooperation. Fourthly, land consolidation management system was the main body, which included management object, management subject and management rule. Fifthly, land consolidation cultural system was the soul, which included material culture, spiritual culture and rule culture. Last but not least, land consolidation legal system was criterion, which included law, regulation, rule, normative documentation and institution. The system had the properties of systematicness, innovation and guidance. Systematicness could reflect the attributes' characteristics and the relationship of all the sub-systems. Innovation could fill the current content of land consolidation system using culture connotation and legal criterion. Guidance meant that the technical perfection, theoretical innovation, discipline cultivation and management diversity showed the main development direction of land consolidation in the future. The new view of land consolidation system should be changed, for example, the technology system, theoretical system and discipline system could be treated as core part from only technology system and management system, while management and culture system as the supporting part, and legal system as the criterion. It can be concluded that system framework of land consolidation is a dynamic system, whose content still need to be added and amended in the future.",Zhang C.; Yu J.; Zheng H.; Zhang G.; Gong T.; Zeng W.,Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2015-08-01,Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China;Yunnan Agricultural University,Consolidation ;  Cultural system ;  Discipline system ;  Land use ;  Legal system ;  Management system ;  Systems ;  Technology system ;  Theoretical system
Policy ideas and policy learning about 'basic research' in South Korea,"'Basic research' is based on epistemological and intentional criteria. In terms of science policy, however, these criteria imply contradictory views on investment in 'basic research'. The former espouses the linear model of innovation and encourages policy-makers concerned with economic problems to expand investment on basic research. However, the latter can collide with the policy norm of policy-makers and discourage investment in 'basic research' in an institutional setting where the nation-state prevails over scientists, as in South Korea. Emphasizing policy ideas and policy learning, this paper empirically shows that changes in investment priority and the emergence of new concepts about 'basic research' are co-products of a policy paradigm of the linear model and a policy norm of industrial competitiveness in Korea. Specifically, emphasis was placed on the balance between pure and oriented basic research, but moved on to 'oriented basic research', 'basic engineering', and to 'basic research' coupled with 'woncheon-technology'.",Ko Y.,Journal,Science and Public Policy,2015-08-01,Korea Institute of SandT Evaluation and Planning,Basic research ;  Policy idea ;  Policy learning ;  Science policy
Wireless information and power transfer: From scientific hypothesis to engineering practice,"Recently, there has been substantial research interest in the subject of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) due to its cross-disciplinary appeal and its wide-ranging application potential, which motivates this overview. More explicitly, we provide a brief survey of the state of the art and introduce several practical transceiver architectures that may facilitate its implementation. Moreover, the most important link-level as well as system-level design aspects are elaborated on, along with a variety of potential solutions and research ideas. We envision that the dual interpretation of RF signals creates new opportunities as well as challenges requiring substantial research, innovation and engineering efforts.",Zhang R.; Maunder R.; Hanzo L.,Journal,IEEE Communications Magazine,2015-08-01,University of Southampton,
Moving research to practice through partnership: A case study in Asphalt Paving,"Background: Multi-stakeholder partnerships play a critical role in dissemination and implementation in health and safety. To better document and understand construction partnerships that have successfully scaled up effective interventions to protect workers, this case study focused on the collaborative processes of the Asphalt Paving Partnership. In the 1990s, this partnership developed, evaluated, disseminated, and achieved near universal, voluntary adoption of paver engineering controls to reduce exposure to asphalt fumes. Methods: We used in-depth interviews (n=15) and document review in the case study. Results: We describe contextual factors that both facilitated and challenged the formation of the collaboration, central themes and group processes, and research to practice (r2p) outcomes. Conclusions: The Asphalt Paving Partnership offers insight into how multi-stakeholder partnerships in construction can draw upon the strengths of diverse members to improve the dissemination and adoption of health and safety innovations and build a collaborative infrastructure to sustain momentum over time.

Collective intelligence systems and an application by The Millennium Project for the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology,"There are several definitions for ""collective intelligence"" and its applications. We define collective intelligence as an emergent property from synergies among three elements: 1) data/information/knowledge; 2) software/hardware; and 3) experts and others with insight that continually learns from feedback to produce just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than any of these elements acting alone. This paper will briefly discuss what collective intelligence is, why it is needed, some early approaches, how The Millennium Project (MP) is creating its own system - Global Futures Intelligence System (GFIS), and how MP is applying the elements of GFIS for the creation of ISIS (Integrated Synergistic Information System) for the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology. ISIS is adapted from GFIS to provide a common platform for Egyptians to explore possible futures for input to national short- and long-term strategy.",Glenn J.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2015-08-01,The Millennium Project,Collective intelligence ;  Egypt ;  Foresight ;  Futures research ;  Global Futures Intelligence System ;  Millennium Project
Why and how to subsidise energy R+D: Lessons from the collapse and recovery of electricity innovation in the UK,"The UK electricity sector liberalisation was a pioneer in the worldwide reform trend and its reform model and outcomes have been the subject of many studies. However, lesser known are the effects of privatisation, market based reforms, and incentive regulation of networks on research and development as well as patenting activities in the sector. This paper updates our previous studies of this subject and discusses the recent developments in the innovative activities in the UK electricity sector. We find that, in recent years, the initial absence of support policies and the subsequent decline in innovation efforts in the aftermath of the reform has resulted in efforts towards forming an energy technology and innovation policy. Although we already observe some positive outcomes from these efforts, we discuss whether the balance of the innovation efforts are calibrated appropriately and whether the institutional framework can be further improved to promote long term progress.",Jamasb T.; Pollitt M.,Journal,Energy Policy,2015-08-01,Cambridge Judge Business School;Durham University Business School,Energy technology ;  Innovation ;  Liberalisation ;  Research and development
Industrialization of biology: A roadmap to accelerate the advanced manufacturing of chemicals,"The tremendous progress in biology over the last half century - from Watson and Crick's elucidation of the structure of DNA to today's astonishing, rapid progress in the field of synthetic biology - has positioned us for significant innovation in chemical production. New bio-based chemicals, improved public health through improved drugs and diagnostics, and biofuels that reduce our dependency on oil are all results of research and innovation in the biological sciences. In the past decade, we have witnessed major advances made possible by biotechnology in areas such as rapid, low-cost DNA sequencing, metabolic engineering, and high-throughput screening. The manufacturing of chemicals using biological synthesis and engineering could expand even faster. A proactive strategy - implemented through the development of a technical roadmap similar to those that enabled sustained growth in the semiconductor industry and our explorations of space - is needed if we are to realize the widespread benefits of accelerating the industrialization of biology. Industrialization of Biology presents such a roadmap to achieve key technical milestones for chemical manufacturing through biological routes. This report examines the technical, economic, and societal factors that limit the adoption of bioprocessing in the chemical industry today and which, if surmounted, would markedly accelerate the advanced manufacturing of chemicals via industrial biotechnology. Working at the interface of synthetic chemistry, metabolic engineering, molecular biology, and synthetic biology, Industrialization of Biology identifies key technical goals for next-generation chemical manufacturing, then identifies the gaps in knowledge, tools, techniques, and systems required to meet those goals, and targets and timelines for achieving them. This report also considers the skills necessary to accomplish the roadmap goals, and what training opportunities are required to produce the cadre of skilled scientists and engineers needed.",,Book,Industrialization of Biology: A Roadmap to Accelerate the Advanced Manufacturing of Chemicals,2015-07-29,,

Games4Learning: How to integrate serious games to personalized learning itineraries?,"Good teaching practices and correct learning procedures of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines are essential factors in the motivation and training of professionals in society at the moment. The predicted rise in the demand for STEM professionals in the work market in the next ten years is greater than that predicted for other sectors. Numerous initiatives exist that focus on educational innovations in order to enhance the skills and knowledge of the pupils in the STEM disciplines during their educational life. One of these innovations is the utilization of personalised learning itineraries guided by game-based learning. Intrinsically, the games stimulate motivation and competitiveness between the students. They are socially inclusive and they can be easily adapted to different progress and knowledge levels. Creating games helps in the design of personalized itineraries that allow for the detection of characteristics, skills and/or the drawbacks of each student, making it possible to analyse student progress. Even though, currently, games dedicated to STEM teaching exist, their quality is not sufficient to cover the needs of young students and few of them allow for the creation of itineraries. Moreover, the educator is not able to adapt the existing games to the curricular content without having programming knowledge. This paper focuses on the research of the technological challenge to define and to build a platform to allow for the creation of learning itineraries based on games and oriented to the educational pre-university stages. This platform will be able to create and adapt these itineraries as well as being able to build specific games for the students, making the analysis of their competences and their curricular evaluations easier. The novelty of this proposal lies in the possibility of interactively creating learning itineraries based on games. This platform will help teachers to detect the characteristics, skills and/or drawbacks of each pupil as well as enabling them to build personalized games even if they don't have programming skills. In addition, this platform will provide the tools to increase the student's motivation. Finally, it will integrate the family into the educational process, making the child's needs in the home-study sessions more understandable.",Grau S.; Reig R.; Puig A.; López M.; Rodríguez I.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 10th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, CISTI 2015",2015-07-28,Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC);Universitat de Barcelona,education ;  game-based learning ;  learning itineraries ;  serious games

"Domesticating electric power: Growth of industry, utilities and research in colonial Calcutta","Public electricity supplies became available in Calcutta as early as the 1890s and by the 1940s had developed to become the major source of power and lighting both for industries and private use. Could the electrification of Calcutta act as an agent of industrial development? What impact did it have on the socio-economic condition of the city? The twentieth century was to be the age of electricity. Apart from industrial use of this new technology, to realise its full practical capacities a new discipline emerged—electrical engineering. The Bengali electrical engineering community, alumni of Sibpur and Jadavpur Engineering Colleges, gradually oriented themselves towards ideas of industrial development based on Indian realities. Few trained electrical engineers entered in the business sector and became very successful. High level of technological innovation such as that of hydroelectricity was also exploited by the Bengali entrepreneurs. The credentials of the Bengali erudite and ordinary people in the field of electricity, which this article tries to explore, offer an interesting example of Indian response to the new knowledge.",Sarkar S.,Journal,Indian Economic and Social History Review,2015-07-27,The University of Burdwan,colonial Calcutta ;  electrical engineering ;  Electricity ;  industry ;  motive power

A Conversation with Adam Heller,"Adam Heller, Ernest Cockrell Sr. Chair in Engineering Emeritus of the John J. McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, recalls his childhood in the Holocaust and his contributions to science and technology that earned him the US National Medal of Technology and Innovation in a conversation with Elton J. Cairns, Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Heller, born in 1933, describes the enslavement of his father by Hungarians in 1942; the confiscation of his family's home, business, and all its belongings in 1944; and his incarceration in a brick factory with 18,000 Jews who were shipped by the Hungarians to be gassed by Germans in Auschwitz. Dr. Heller and his immediate family survived the Holocaust and arrived in Israel in 1945. He studied under Ernst David Bergmann at the Hebrew University, and then worked at Bell Laboratories and GTE Laboratories, where he headed Bell Lab's Electronic Materials Research Department. At GTE Laboratories, he built in 1966 the first neodymium liquid lasers and in 1973 with Jim Auborn conceived and engineered the lithium thionyl chloride battery, one of the first to be manufactured lithium batteries, which is still in use. After joining the faculty of engineering of The University of Texas at Austin, he cofounded with his son Ephraim Heller TheraSense, now a major part of Abbott Diabetes Care, which produced a microcoulometer that made the monitoring of glucose painless by accurately measuring the blood glucose concentration in 300 nL of blood. He also describes the electrical wiring of enzymes, the basis for Abbott's state-of-the-art continuous glucose monitoring system. He discusses his perspective of reducing the risk of catastrophic global warming in a wealth-accumulating, more-energy-consuming world and provides advice for students entering careers in science or engineering.",Heller A.; Cairns E.,Journal,Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,2015-07-24,"Cockrell School of Engineering;University of California, Berkeley",
Robotic systems for minimally invasive diagnosis and therapy,"Minimally invasive surgery and interventional procedures have seen rapid advancement as one of leading trend in medical technology innovation for its distinguished clinical benefit for patient. Robotic systems and technologies have made remarkable contribution to the innovation enabling various innovative devices and procedures including robotic laparoscopic surgery assist system. While robotic systems to assist general surgery seem to become mature technology, robotic systems for interventional procedures and neurological surgery are newly emerging. The minimally invasive procedures have inherent limitations and constraints that make human operation difficult or less optimal. Various medical imaging modalities are utilized as visual sensor for the procedures and each has limitations such as radiation exposure, resolution and sensitivity, real-time imaging capability, electromagnetic interference and etc. Tiny and complex tissue structure through which devices for the minimally invasive procedures perform diagnostic or therapeutic operation is another major limiting condition in terms of dexterity or precision. Robotic systems that converge various electro-mechanical engineering and computer science technologies facilitate human physician overcoming these limitations and achieving better clinical outcome for patient. Computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound guided biopsy is one of long researched applications for robotic system utilization. Several robotic systems for cardiac intervention and neurological surgery are already available for clinical use.

"Construction innovation diffusion in the Russian Federation barriers, drivers and coping strategies","Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore the current situation in the Russian construction industry and the obstacles, drivers and strategies that affect innovation implementation most significantly. The Russian construction industry is highly conservative and is often criticised for its lack of innovation. Construction firms invest relatively little in innovation adoption, development of new ideas and formal research and development. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilised an extensive literature review followed by a questionnaire survey incorporating some post hoc interviews with 52 experts from the Russian architecture, engineering and construction industry to identify the most significant drivers, enablers, barriers and strategies related to innovation diffusion in construction. Findings: Findings indicated that economic and financial difficulties, as well as inappropriate legislation, are the most significant barriers to innovation. Financial incentives, legislative improvements and the promotion of alternative construction procurement methods were viewed as the most critical strategies to improve the current lacklustre rate of innovation diffusion. Originality/value: While there is anecdotal evidence that the Russian construction industry is lagging in terms of technological advancement, its closed nature means that there is still little reported evidence on what are the main barriers to innovation diffusion in this country. Hence, there is a lack of focus on innovation diffusion rates in different construction sectors, such as building and civil infrastructure and limited consideration on how effectively the research and development sector contributes to innovation.",Suprun E.; Stewart R.,Journal,Construction Innovation,2015-07-13,School of Engineering and Built Environment;Belgorod State Technological University named after V.G.Shoukhov,Barriers ;  Construction ;  Drivers ;  Innovation diffusion ;  Russian Federation ;  Strategies

An innovative method of train integrity monitoring through wireless sensor network,"Detection of train integrity is a very important research matter affecting safety and more generally railway engineering. Actually the ETCS Level 1 and 2 provide the train integrity and localization functionalities by using track circuits and/or axle counter systems: the problem of these solutions is represented by the high cost of track circuit and axle counter installation, taking into account even the related equipment management. This paper shows the study, design and realization of an innovative method to detect the train integrity, by using the wireless technology. the reference scenario is referred to ERTMS / ETCS (European Rail Traffic Management System / European Train Control System), which defines the modalities for the exchange of signalling information between the track side and on board rail vehicle. In particular, reference is made to a ground subsystem (SST) that implements the ETCS Level 3 only [1]. The designed wireless system is referred to a general freight train that don't have the electric energy on board or at least a low power of energy: for each wagon a logic of vehicle has been implemented to manage the information, instead the communication between neighbouring wagons has been managed by a wireless loop communication, standardized by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.

Towards interactive open source based m-learning solution: The m-chisimba framework,"Purpose - This paper aims to present a research outcome to an investigation towards the innovative use of electronic-learning (e-Learning) software solutions to strengthen the interactive component of mobile learning (m-Learning) in university contexts. This work was motivated by observations of interactive limitations in existing m-Learning solutions in well-intentioned software development and e-Learning efforts. The aim of the project, thus, was to interrogate hindrances to the potency of m-Learning interventions. The idea was to strengthen the interactive component, to improve the compatibility of the desktop e-Learning process - with mobile appliances such as mobile phones and, finally, to explore cost minimizing avenues of downloading learning materials over mobile phones. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology of the project was twofold: that is, both literature-based and experimental. Literature background offered insight on existing efforts towards interactive m-Learning solutions. Against this background, the project was then designed to explore ways to provide presentations and interactive chats for effective m-Learning over mobile phones. The idea was to reduce the file size of presentations slides for effective display on mobile devices. Finally, the aim was also to minimize airtime costs when transmitting presentation slides and when conducting interactive chats on mobile phones. An experiment research method was, thus, used. In this method, a problem and question were articulated first. Then, a practical technological solution was conceptualized, developed, pre-tested, modified and re-tested until it complied with sought specifications, Finally, the solution was implemented, to confirm its viability and response to a research problem and, ultimately, was reported in the findings. Findings - Slides were developed with light colour resolutions to open effortlessly on tiny mobile screens. The best quality was between 128 and 201.188 (out of 255) pixels (more visible mobile phone screens), using Open Source Software. Clear slides also had a font greater than size 32. The average data per presentation were 9,872.66 bytes, and, when seven learners were chatting, it was 3,686.63 bytes (0.03 megabytes). For airtime costs, the Vodacom rate of R0.46 per megabyte was used. This translates to 0.8 × 0.46 R0.0368 cost per slide. The m-Chisimba platform therefore, seems to be cost-effective, quality expedient and most appropriate for interactive m-Learning. Research limitations/implications - Existing m-Learning has been inadequate, failing to align adequately the desktop e-Learning solutions with mobile phone platforms. Desktop presentation slides, for example, have been incompatible with mobile phones’ operations and screen sizes. Mostly, content could consume a lot more airtime, owing to large sizes of desktop originated material that was incompatible with mobile platforms. A solution that emerged from original experiments, leading to the enhanced interactive m-Learning solution, the m-Chisimba platform, is, therefore, presented in this paper. The thinking is that mobile applications are convenient enablers which extend access to information. Nevertheless, mobile applications (including m-Learning solutions) cannot be seen as panaceas to solve all learning concerns as literacy and affordability remain challenges in many under-developed social environments. As a newly developed innovation, the m-Chisimba platform offers an improved m-Learning solution for learning activities over mobile gadgets such as mobile phones. Practical implications - The research work offers new innovative solutions in a number of practical ways. It improves the interactivity component of the m-Learning process, to empower educators and learners to effectively engage learning over m-Learning devices. Social implications - The innovation makes it easier to for learning to take place effortlessly, over mobile platforms. Implications are that more people will be able to access learning processes on the move, meaning that obstacles to access learning opportunities are minimised. Originality/value - Existing m-Learning has been inadequate, failing to align adequately the desktop e-Learning solutions with mobile phone platforms. Desktop presentation slides, for example, have been incompatible with mobile phones’ operations and screen sizes. Mostly, content could consume a lot more airtime, owing to large sizes of desktop-originated material that was incompatible with mobile-platforms. A solution that emerged from original experiments, leading to the enhanced interactive m-Learning solution, the m-Chisimba platform, is, therefore, presented in this paper. The thinking is that mobile applications are convenient enablers which extend access to information. Nevertheless, mobile applications (including m-Learning solutions) cannot be seen as panaceas to solve all learning concerns as literacy and affordability remain challenges in many under-developed social environments. As a newly developed innovation, the m-Chisimba platform offers an improved m-Learning solution for learning activities over mobile gadgets such as mobile phones.",Mlitwa N.; Wanyonyi D.,Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2015-07-06,"University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg;Cape Peninsula University of Technology",Alternative and new technologies ;  Design ;  Education practices ;  Effectiveness ;  Implementing ;  Information and communication technologies ;  Knowledge management ;  Managing and practicing innovation
Challenges in teaching modern manufacturing technologies,"Teaching of manufacturing courses for undergraduate engineering students has become a challenge due to industrial globalisation coupled with influx of new innovations, technologies, customer-driven products. This paper discusses development of a modern manufacturing course taught concurrently in three institutions where students collaborate in executing various projects. Lectures are developed to contain materials featuring advanced manufacturing technologies, R&D trends in manufacturing. Pre- and post-surveys were conducted by an external evaluator to assess the impact of the course on increase in student's knowledge of manufacturing; increase students’ preparedness and confidence in effective communication and; increase students’ interest in pursuing additional academic studies and/or a career path in manufacturing and high technology. The surveyed data indicate that the students perceived significant gains in manufacturing knowledge and preparedness in effective communication. The study also shows that implementation of a collaborative course within multiple institutions requires a robust and collective communication platform.",Ngaile G.; Wang J.; Gau J.,Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2015-07-04,NC State College of Engineering;College of Engineering;Northern Illinois University,active learning ;  advanced manufacturing ;  collaboration ;  engineering education research ;  manufacturing education ;  technical skills
Politics as scholarly practice: Graeme turner and the art of advocacy,"In addition to his very considerable and influential body of scholarship, and his roles as a pathfinder and senior leader of cultural studies in Australia and beyond, Graeme Turner has made a profound if less well-known contribution as an advocate and adviser at the national level, for cultural studies and the wider humanities. Turner’s election in 2004 as President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities was greeted by elements of the conservative commentariat as the final proof of the complete annihilation of sense and meaning in Australian universities. Within four years, Turner had garnered sufficient respect to be appointed personally to the nation’s preeminent science and research advisory body, the Prime Minister’s Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, a distinction confirmed by his reappointment in 2012. This article offers an intimate account of Turner’s advocacy and policy activities, detailing many of the achievements, along with some of the frustrating near-misses, of his work during and after his Presidency. It traces his development from a seasoned institutional player and accomplished scholar, encountering the dual challenges of slippery politics and leaden bureaucracy, to his rapid emergence as an expert political operator quite at home (if a little cold) in Canberra. The article proposes a theory of Turner’s approach, beyond his well-known work ethic, intellectual acuity and force of personality, conceiving of his advocacy and policy work as a species of cultural studies itself – an enactment of a politically engaged cultural practice – as much as an initiative on its behalf. This account looks back to Turner’s own cultural scholarship for insights into his deployment of a highly sophisticated intellectual toolkit in a theoretically informed practice, to gain the attention, respect and support of politicians, public servants, industry leaders and the powerful science lobby.",Byron J.,Journal,Cultural Studies,2015-07-04,Curtin University,academia ;  advocacy ;  Australia ;  humanities ;  policy ;  politics
Strategic Capabilities for Public Sector-led Innovation: Managing Knowledge Worker Deployment at and Quality Performance of Public R&D Laboratories in India,"We investigate critically the relationship between the knowledge, capabilities of research and development (R&D) personnel, the structure and functions of public R&D laboratories in India and their quality performance record. Our objective is to assess whether this relationship create conditions that are conducive to innovation in developing economy contexts. We draw on theories of R&D management, organisation learning, knowledge management and strategic capability to reflect on contextual complexities that arise as a result of the nature of knowledge-based resources of research organisations. We deploy correspondence analysis and use this method to explore the structure of multivariate relationships among the different laboratories in the analysis, showing how various functions impact on effective R&D management and quality performance measured in terms of patents, publications and citations. We find that strategic innovation practices are essential for supporting pilot plants, experimental field stations and in the engineering and design units. We generate a map of laboratories capturing the innovation continuum as distinguished by their in-built strength in basic research, engineering and design services or the working of pilot plants. The article has particular implications for public R&D management for innovation in a developing economy context where the public sector continues to play a significant role in economic development. It should assist with organising public R&D management for innovation in an emerging economy, a relatively under-researched area. It should also help R&D management practitioners to navigate their way effectively in delivering effective performance outcomes at a time of rapid economic change.",Roy S.; Mitra J.,Journal,Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Emerging Economies,2015-07-01,Essex Business School;Institute of Management Technology,Knowledge workers ;  public sector R&D ;  quality performance ;  strategic deployment ;  tacit knowledge
An empirical assessment of the effects of trade in innovative tasks on innovation output,"Multinational firms are increasingly sending their innovative tasks abroad. This article examines whether offshoring research and development, design, and engineering activities provides any gains in terms of firm-level innovation output. The effects of trade in innovative tasks on the probability of firms being innovative and the share of innovative product sales in total turnover are examined using an instrumental variable approach. The data in use come from a recent survey, which provides cross-section observations for more than 14,750 firms in seven European countries. The results suggest that those firms that offshore their innovative activities are 60% more likely to successfully innovate. Also, offshoring innovative activities increases the share of innovative product sales in total turnover up to 35%. Furthermore, firms in this sample appear to gain from trade in innovative tasks when such trade is in product innovation but not when such trade is in process innovation.",Tabrizy S.,Journal,Southern Economic Journal,2015-07-01,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,
Progress in education,"The ongoing Progress in Education series presents substantial results from around the globe in selected areas of educational research. Schools are institutions that sail in the tempest of educational issues, reforms, strategies, data and tools, as well as reflect changes in society. Embedded in all of these are technology, diversity, and innovation - their inevitability has been demonstrated in our schools and communities. The first chapter of this volume examines how technology and diversity leads to innovation. The following chapters discuss the integrity of peer coaching and self-regulated learning; errors and error-handling strategies; career and technical education in Texas schools; high school sizes and Hispanic student college readiness; pedagogical approaches to applying funds of knowledge theories to support minoritized students' learning; electrical engineering education programs; and instructional expenditures and school district wealth.",Nata R.,Book,Progress in Education,2015-07-01,,
Government in the catching-up of technology innovation: Case of administrative intervention in China,"This paper advances the extant knowledge of the mechanism of government intervention in technology innovation, especially that in the catching-up context. It forms a three-layer theoretical framework and further uses it to analyze a case of the standardization of TD-SCDMA, a third generation (3G) of mobile system, in China. The findings validate the argument that in technology development and technology diffusion stages, there are different innovation task foci and different challenges, which require the government taking a mix of regulative, financial and administrative instruments to intervene. The government needs to draw upon the institutional environment, R&D and industrialization capability and the technology characteristics of the innovation in identifying the innovation tasks and challenges, and determining the intervention strategy. In the catching-up context, when pursuing the indigenous innovation in complex technology, ""hard"" government intervention is necessary. Especially the government should take advantage of its control of national economy and the industry to explore the potential of intervention using diverse administrative instruments, for example the leading role of state organizations in innovation should be considered.",Gao P.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2015-07-01,The University of Manchester,Administrative instruments ;  Catching-up ;  China ;  Government intervention mechanism ;  Mobile system ;  Standardization ;  TD-SCDMA ;  Technology innovation
Design of a Composite Structural Panel for High Volume Production,"As CAFE requirements increase, automotive OEMs are pursuing innovative methods to lightweight their Body In Whites (BIWs). Within FCA US, this lightweighting research and development activity often occurs through Decoupled Innovation projects. A Decoupled Innovation team comprised of engineers from the BIW Structures Group, in collaboration with Tier 1 supplier Magna Exteriors, sought to re-design a loadbearing component on the BIW that would offer significant weight savings when the current steel component was replaced with a carbon fiber composite. This paper describes the design, development, physical validation and partnership that resulted in a composite Rear Package Shelf Assembly solution for a high-volume production vehicle.

Selecting early-stage ideas for radical innovation: Tools and structures,"Radical innovation is an engine of growth, but identifying likely opportunities can be challenging. Building on previous work, this paper explores the use and importance of nine strategies for selecting early-stage opportunities in a sample of 94 firms. Four strategies-building alternative visions, prototyping, using probe-and-learn methods, and mobilizing sponsorship and championship-are used by more than half of the firms surveyed. Usage of all of the strategies is higher in innovating firms than in non-innovating firms, regardless of company size. This confirms the utility of these approaches for innovation managers seeking to enable radical innovation in their companies.",Nicholas J.; Ledwith A.; Bessant J.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2015-07-01,University of Exeter;University of Limerick,Discontinuous innovation ;  Radical innovation ;  Scouting ;  Selection strategies
Analog Circuit Design Knowledge Mining: Discovering Topological Similarities and Uncovering Design Reasoning Strategies,"Mining engineering metaknowledge from electronic documents is important in devising new design solutions for emerging applications as well as in identifying new business opportunities. Continuously and comprehensively reviewing and assessing the entire technical literature to find the most relevant ideas and solutions is cumbersome as engineering innovations are constantly being proposed. In particular, high performance analog circuit design has been at the forefront of technological innovations given their importance in applications, like telecommunications, mobile applications, and health care. This paper proposes a model and mining techniques for representing analog circuit design metaknowledge. The metaknowledge representation includes three components: an associative component presenting the conceptual hierarchy of the considered circuits, a component expressing the performance capabilities (e.g., tradeoffs and bottlenecks) of the circuits, and a causal modeling part describing the more likely starting ideas and design plans used to create a circuit. Knowledge structures can be used to tackle new applications, identify opportunities to improve existing circuits, and validate design correctness. A case study illustrates the proposed knowledge structure for a set of 30 modern, high-frequency analog circuits.",Jiao F.; Montano S.; Ferent C.; Doboli A.; Doboli S.,Journal,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,2015-07-01,College of Engineering and Applied Sciences;Hofstra University,Design for space exploration ;  Mixed-mode ;  Modeling ;  Symbolic techniques
From construction megaproject management to complex project management: Bibliographic analysis,"The rapid growth of construction megaprojects worldwide has triggered a growing number of papers published in this area in the past two decades, suggesting that construction megaproject management has become an emerging area in the field of construction engineering and management (CEM). This study aims to investigate the status and the trends in megaproject research by conducting a structured literature review. A total of 85 relevant articles identified from eight peer-reviewed CEM journals between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed based on the number of articles published annually, institutional and regional contributions, citations, and categorization of research interests and methodologies. Analysis results indicated that developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, have enjoyed significant advantages in megaproject research because of their greater experience, while megaproject research in developing countries, such as Russia, India, Turkey, and Vietnam, remains weak or lacking. These results also revealed that many theory-based findings have been reported in five subareas; namely, construction and site management, cost and schedule management, risk analysis and management, innovation and utilization of information technology, and leadership and professional development. The subareas of organization and stakeholder management, project planning and procurement, and project monitoring and control remain to be promising domains for future research, particularly in developing countries which have yet to develop a research tradition. Incorporating the complexity theory and institutional theory as the theoretical foundation in these subareas can develop megaproject research further through strengthened global collaboration in the future.",Hu Y.; Chan A.; Le Y.; Jin R.,Journal,Journal of Management in Engineering,2015-07-01,Tongji University;University of Seoul;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Complex project management ;  Construction megaproject management ;  Institutional theory ;  Literature review
Identifying roles of international institutions in clean energy technology innovation and diffusion in the developing countries: Matching barriers with roles of the institutions,"The development of clean energy technologies is a central issue in climate change negotiation. The signatory countries to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change agreed to organize the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network. The objectives of this paper are twofold. The first objective is to show a broad landscape of barriers in technology development. The paper summarizes the results of key case studies that were conducted to uncover technology-specific barriers in technology development. These case studies include both technologies for industrial use such as wind, bio-energy and building energy efficiency and technologies for individual use such as Light Emitting Diodes and photovoltaic panels. The case studies also contain technologies at the innovation stage such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle and Carbon Capture and Storage. The second objective of this paper is to highlight and define roles of international institutions in overcoming identified barriers in clean energy technology development. In this paper four areas of focus for international institutions are discussed, including: 1) increasing R&D cooperation at the innovation stage, 2) facilitation of intellectual property rights, 3) supporting finance, and 4) enhancing the enabling environment at the diffusion stage.",Suzuki M.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2015-07-01,Sophia University,Clean energy ;  Climate change ;  Developing countries ;  Innovation ;  Technology development
The double-edged sword of industry collaboration: Evidence from engineering academics in the UK,"This paper studies the impact of university-industry collaboration on academic research output. We analyze the channels through which the degree of industry collaboration may be affecting research output. We exploit a unique longitudinal dataset on all the researchers in all the engineering departments of 40 major universities in the UK for the last 20 years. We use an innovative measure of collaboration based on the fraction of public research grants that include industry partners. Our empirical findings corroborate that the relationship between collaboration degree and publication rates is curvilinear, and shed some light on the selection mechanisms at work.

Fostering product innovation: Differences between new ventures and established firms,"This study combines insights from the entrepreneurship, competency-based view and innovation policy literature to analyze the relationships among different types of public incentives designed to foster innovation and product innovation at both new ventures and incumbent firms. To test our hypotheses, we ran a system of regression models on a cross-national sample comprised of 5238 firms from 29 European countries and found a different pattern for new ventures and incumbents. Our results suggest that support for attendance or participation in trade fairs and networking with other companies are the most effective methods of promoting product innovation for new ventures. However, for incumbent firms, we found that the most effective policies consisted of tax reduction for R&D expenditures and subsidies for acquiring buildings or other infrastructure(s) for innovation activities. This distinction prompts interesting insights related to theory development in research on entrepreneurship and innovation policy.",Antolín-López R.; Céspedes-Lorente J.; García-De-Frutos N.; Martínez-Del-Río J.; Pérez-Valls M.,Journal,Technovation,2015-07-01,Universidad de Almería,Competency-based view ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation policy ;  New ventures ;  Product innovation
Initiatives to increase engagement in first-year ICT,"There is widespread concern about lack of student engagement in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) courses and the influence of this on learning outcomes, retention, and the student experience overall. Lack of engagement is particularly concerning for first-year students, who are developing their study behaviours for the remainder of their degree programs. This study seeks to report on the myriad of current initiatives in Australian universities to increase ICT student engagement. This is explored for both in-class teaching innovations and the support structures with which students interface academically and administratively. The study draws upon data collected from interviews of 30 academics involved with the design and delivery of the first-year learning experience of ICT students in 25 Australian universities. Analysis of this data has provided a comprehensive overview of current initiatives to address student engagement. These covered a range of academic and non-academic aspects of the student experience.

Recommendations on adapting crowdsourcing to problem types,"Crowdsourcing is a paradigm which enables and harnesses the power and wisdom of a usually large, diverse crowd in innovation, problem solving and knowledge acquisition. The scale, benefits and application areas of this traditional model are amplified by the advances of information and communication technology such as the advent of Web 2.0, which, at the same time, has increased the complexity and, hence, the need for systematic development approaches. While crowdsourcing has been successfully applied in several projects and de-facto platforms already exist for them, the research on engineering principles, methods and tools for developing a crowdsourcing project is still in the early stages. In this paper, we study the adaptation of crowdsourcing settings to fit the nature of the problem being crowdsourced. As a method, we review the literature and complement that with an online expert survey involving practitioners and researchers active in the field of crowdsourcing. We then interpret the obtained results and identify a set of recommendations on how to set up crowdsourcing to fit each of the five common categories of problems. Our results inform future crowdsourcing developers with best practice experiences on planning and configuring their projects.",Hosseini M.; Shahri A.; Phalp K.; Ali R.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science,2015-06-19,Bournemouth University,Adaptive Crowdsourcing ;  Crowdsourcing Configuration ;  Engineering Crowdsourcing

Spaceship Earth. Space-driven technologies and systems for sustainability on ground,"As awareness towards the problem is growing, eco-friendliness is today a paramount requirement for all space activities and in particular for the ground segment, fully comparable to other industrial sectors. The present work focuses on the assessment and the sustainable development enhancement of a ground-based space facility, the European Astronaut Centre (EAC), located in Germany. The project is framed within the European Space Agency development of an environmental outlook, which aims not only at the full compliance with the legislation and at assessing the impact of its activities, but also at laying the foundation for future evolution through innovation. Indeed, ESA promotes the sustainable use of space as a necessity and duty for Europe. As history teaches us, technical knowledge emerged within the space sector serves as innovation driver in other industrial branches: the goal of the project is to transform the EAC building into a spaceship integrated with the territory through the conscious management of this spontaneous process, fostering the combination between the space sector and the architecture and civil engineering fields. The work explores the potential of space technologies, processes and systems applied on ground and presents a range of space-driven innovative concepts which may improve the sustainability of the EAC building, focusing on different aspects of its resource demand - energy, water and waste management - and defining the integration with the pre-existing compound, the limitation of the impact on the surrounding landscape and the participation of the local community as additional fundamental requirements. Indeed, the project embraces the full concept of sustainability, which considers not only eco-friendliness but also its balance with economic and social aspects. Two factors - a certain urgency for action, which leaves little space for research and experimentation, and a call for ground-breaking solutions - guided the design activity: taking advantage of these conflicting requirements, a comparison between standard technologies and innovative space-related concepts was performed. When dealing with complex and uncertain scenarios, decision among the possible solutions is not straightforward and needs to be supported by appropriate methodologies: a multi-criteria and quantitative decision-making tool, able to concentrate on the main goal while considering all other relevant aspects - environmental, economic, social sustainability - was therefore developed. Furthermore, the project promotes local community participation in the decisional process, as a way to enhance knowledge, generate understanding and promote towards the EAC redesign, space activities and their potential innovative impact on sustainability.",Castiglioni A.; Bigdeli M.; Palamini C.; Martinoia D.; Frezza L.; Matassini B.; Pizzocri D.; Massari M.,Journal,Acta Astronautica,2015-06-11,Politecnico di Milano;Politecnico di Torino,Decision making ;  Design methods ;  Green space ;  Innovation ;  Multidisciplinary design ;  Sustainability

Translating technology taxonomies to facilitate cross-industry innovation,"The Government technology innovation network - Innovate.Gov - is a cross-government extension of the Innovate.NASA (https://innovate.nasa.gov) platform, which was designed to crowdsource new opportunities for NASA technology. Innovate.Gov is a virtual collaboration platform to share technology across Federal agencies and serves as a unified hub for the public to access and innovate with government technology. Using this platform, government agencies share out technology information and engage the public to innovate with these inventions. The Innovate.Gov community collaborates to design improvements and integrations to revitalize these inventions, or propose new applications for these technologies (within and outside of their respective agencies). Innovate.Gov targets participants across a full range of organizations, professions, and areas of expertise, including: government, academia, research labs, private industry, and independent innovators. In order to fulfill the Innovate.Gov mission, technology information posted to the website must be made accessible to this diverse group of participants by applying a universal technology taxonomy. This paper explores our approach, challenges and solutions to translate the language of each agency's technology across multiple disciplines to enable Innovate.Gov to tap into the power of open innovation. This paper describes our approach, which begins with the collection and synthesis of existing taxonomies across our partner government agencies, including the technology categorizations described in their strategic, planning and outreach documents (e.g. the 2012 NASA Space Technology Roadmaps, NASA Tech Briefs). Evaluations of technology discussions across social media were used to augment understanding of the informal taxonomy used by a broader group. This paper describes our solution to build a new taxonomy consistent with our government partners' technology languages that simultaneously represents the full range of the rest of the participant community. Specifically, we created a technology translation matrix to identify the major categories (buckets) of technology (e.g. robotics, materials) and align these overarching terms to agency-specific taxonomies. This matrix creates back-end connections between technologies and various tags to enable a seamless user experience on the Innovate.Gov site. It also automates cross-discipline translation that is individualized to each user and improves the site's search capabilities. This paper also describes our approach to promote the wide spread adoption of the matrix through the creation of a social media strategy and program-specific taxonomy. Furthermore, this paper outlines the unique virtual showcase developed for the technology, which was designed to appeal to participants across multiple industries. For example, one technique entailed the development of 'common language' titles to describe technologies by focusing on their function, regardless of their application. Finally, this paper describes the important role that a shared technology taxonomy can play in technological innovation. This new universal technology linguistics tool translation across agencies will promote increased cross-disciplinary collaboration, reduce duplication of efforts across agencies and the private sector, and support innovation and technology infusion across industry and academia.",Hardash J.; Landegger A.; Decker B.; Thompson V.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2015-06-05,"Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.;National Aeronautics and Space Administration",

Engineering innovation into systems engineering practices,"A significant body of research exists about instilling a culture of innovation, but less is written about how to introduce innovation into systems engineering practices. Further, can suppress innovation. Our increasing need to conceive and develop more transformative concepts motivated an initiative to infuse innovation into our systems engineering. In particular, we introduce innovation into concept formulation, mockups, and early prototyping (front-end innovation) as well as system design, integration, and test (back-end innovation). We began by identifying culture-changing principles from the research literature and formulated an innovation framework oriented toward systems engineering from which to monitor our progress. Approaches to popularize staff empowerment and networking were introduced first, including leveraging crowd-sourced idea generation and the design thinking and maker movements into our systems practices. We also began to place greater emphasis on access to global technologies to search for enabling technology opportunities and potential research collaborators to feed concept development. Additionally, we had the opportunity to explore a more innovative approach to 'agile' engineering development for which we provide a case study. Lastly, we developed measures and indicators of innovation progress, a relatively unexplored area according to the literature. We will describe the literature results, our initiatives, the case study, and the innovation metrics results to date.",Krill J.; Darrin A.; Grant C.; Kedia A.,Conference Proceeding,"9th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, SysCon 2015 - Proceedings",2015-06-02,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Innovation ;  Systems Engineering
Smart mobs as generators of big data: Collective intelligence at the service of social innovation,"Recent decades have seen an increase in the mobilization of the social group that is organized, developed, narrated and coordinated with IT: the smart mob, which uses the new communication media to self-organize. Both because of the quantity of messages generated by such groups and because of the social interactions they produce, smart mobs have become the object of big data studies. Data engineering technology can be used to analyse smart mobs and identify the ideas and knowledge they share. This can favour the reuse of information to increase a group's knowledge and contribute to the development of social innovation. The paper therefore examines the questions that are being asked about the potential and limitations of smart mobs and emphasizes the need for further research on new methods and analysis techniques.",Martos S.; Martínez S.; Lara-Navarra P.,Journal,BiD,2015-06-01,Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,
Combined and Mixed Methods Research in Environmental Engineering: When Two is Better Than One,"Eco-innovation will play a major role in contributing to a sustainable future. Understanding the diffusion is critical, since the diffusion rate is slow and the path unclear. We present the conceptual methodology for eco-innovation diffusion. This methodology combines mixed and combined research methodology to improve the validity and reliability of results. A survey is used as a quantitative method; artificial neural networks and system dynamic are applied as qualitative methods. With this article we aim to contribute to the applications of combined and mixed methods research in the field of eco-innovation diffusion. The application of the presented methodology can be extended for other problems.",Timma L.; Blumberga A.; Blumberga D.,Conference Proceeding,Energy Procedia,2015-06-01,Riga Technical University,artificial intelligence ;  dynamic simulation ;  eco-innovation diffusion ;  technology substitution
Managing human resources and technology innovation: The impact of process and outcome uncertainties,"High technology innovation performance relies on a skilful utilization of human resources. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of interpreted outcome and process uncertainties on the effective management of human resources for technology innovation. This is achieved through an insider-outsider based case study approach of three medical device innovations with varying degrees of radicalness. Findings suggest that uncertainties in process and outcome strongly influence what constitutes effective management of human resources for technology innovation. Findings also offer insights into when certain innovation theories hold, and suggestions on how to manage human resources and technology innovation under various conditions of uncertainty.",Altmann P.; Engberg R.,Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2015-06-01,Högskolan i Halmstad,
Progress in China's Unconventional Oil & Gas Exploration and Development and Theoretical Technologies,"The new century has witnessed a strategic breakthrough in unconventional oil & gas. Hydrocarbon accumulated in micro-/nano-scale pore throat shale systems has become an important domain that could replace current oil & gas resources. Unconventional oil & gas plays an increasingly important role in our energy demand. Tight gas, CBM, heavy oil and asphaltic sand have served as a key domain of exploration & development, with tight oil becoming a 'bright spot' domain and shale gas becoming a 'hotspot' domain. China has made great breakthroughs in unconventional oil & gas resources, such as tight gas, shale gas, tight oil and CBM, and great progress in oil shale, gas hydrate, heavy oil and oil sand. China has an estimated (223-263)×108t of unconventional oil resources and (890-1260)×1012 m3 of gas resources. China has made a breakthrough for progress in unconventional oil & gas study. New progress achieved in fine-grained sedimentary studies related to continental open lacustrine basin large-scale shallow-water delta sand bodies, lacustrine basin central sandy clastic flow sediments and marine-continental fine-grained sediments provide a theoretical basis for the formation and distribution of basin central reservoir bodies. Great breakthroughs have been made in unconventional reservoir geology in respect of research methodology & technology, multi-scale data merging and physical simulation of formation conditions. Overall characterization of unconventional reservoirs via multi-method and multi-scale becomes increasingly popular and facilitates the rapid development of unconventional oil & gas geological theory, method and technology. The formation of innovative, continuous hydrocarbon accumulation theory, the establishment of the framework of the unconventional oil & gas geological theory system, and the determination of the implications, geological feature, formation mechanism, distribution rule and core technology of unconventional oil & gas geological study lays a theoretical foundation for extensive unconventional oil & gas exploration and development. Theories and technologies of unconventional oil & gas exploration and development developed rapidly, including some key evaluation techniques such as 'sweet spot zone' integrated evaluation and a six-property evaluation technique that uses hydrocarbon source, lithology, physical property, brittleness, hydrocarbon potential and stress anisotropy, and some key development & engineering technologies including micro-seismic monitoring, horizontal drilling & completion and ""factory-like"" operation pattern, ""man-made reservoir"" development, which have facilitated the innovative development of unconventional oil & gas. These breakthroughs define a new understanding in four aspects: 1 theoretical innovation; 2 key technologies; 3 complete market mechanism and national policy support; and 4 well-developed ground infrastructure, which are significant for prolonging the life cycle of petroleum industry, accelerating the upgrade and development of theories and technologies and altering the global traditional energy structure.",Zou C.; Yang Z.; Zhu R.; Zhang G.; Hou L.; Wu S.; Tao S.; Yuan X.; Dong D.; Wang Y.; Wang L.; Huang J.; Wang S.,Journal,Acta Geologica Sinica (English Edition),2015-06-01,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development,"""man-made reservoir"" ;  development ;  fine-grained sedimentology ;  micro-/nano- scale pore throat ;  shale gas ;  shale oil ;  tight gas ;  tight oil ;  Unconventional oil and gas ;  Unconventional Petroleum geology ;  unconventional reservoir geology"
A cybernetic view on learning curves and energy policy,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that cybernetic theory explains learning curves and sets the curves as legitimate and efficient tools for a pro-active energy technology policy. Design/methodology/approach – The learning system is a non-trivial machine that is kept in non-equilibrium steady state at minimum entropy production by competitive, equilibrium markets. The system has operational closure and the learning curve expresses its eigenbehaviour. This eigenbehaviour is analysed not in calendar time but in the characteristic time of the system, i.e., its eigentime. Measured in eigentime, the minimum entropy production in the steady-state learning system is constant. The double closure mechanism described by Heinz von Förster makes it possible for the learning system to change (adapt) its eigenbehaviour without compromising its operational closure. Findings – By obeying basic laws of second order cybernetics and of non-equilibrium thermodynamics the learning system self-organises its learning to follow an optimal path described by the learning curve. The learning rates are obtained through an operator formalism and the results explain observed distributions. Application to solar cell (photo-voltaic) modules indicates that the silicon scarcity bubble 2005-2008 produced excess entropy corresponding to costs of the order of 100 billion US dollars. Research limitations/implications – Grounding technology learning and learning curves in cybernetics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics open up new possibilities to understand technology shifts through radical innovations or paradigm changes. Practical implications – Learning curves are legitimate and efficient tools for energy policy and industrial strategy. Originality/value – Grounding of technology learning and learning curves in cybernetic and thermodynamic theory provides a stable theoretical basis for applications in industry and policy.",Wene C.,Journal,Kybernetes,2015-06-01,Chalmers University of Technology;Wenergy AB,Eigenbehaviour ;  Learning curves ;  Non-equilibrium thermodynamics ;  Technology learning
Planning for food security in a changing climate,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other international agencies have concluded that global crop production is at risk due to climate change, population growth, and changing food preferences. Society expects that the agricultural sciences will innovate solutions to these problems and provide food security for the foreseeable future. My thesis is that an integrated research plan merging agronomic and genetic approaches has the greatest probability of success. I present a template for a research plan based on the lessons we have learned from the Green Revolution and from the development of genetically engineered crops that may guide us to meet this expectation. The plan starts with a vision of how the crop management system could change, and I give a few examples of innovations that are very much in their infancy but have significant potential. The opportunities need to be conceptualized on a regional basis for each crop to provide a target for change. The plan gives an overview of how the tools of plant biotechnology can be used to create the genetic diversity needed to implement the envisioned changes in the crop management system, using the development of drought tolerance in maize (Zea mays L.) as an example that has led recently to the commercial release of new hybrids in the USA. The plan requires an interdisciplinary approach that integrates and coordinates research on plant biotechnology, genetics, physiology, breeding, agronomy, and cropping systems to be successful.",McKersie B.,Journal,Journal of Experimental Botany,2015-06-01,,Climate change ;  Cropping systems ;  Drought tolerance ;  DroughtGard ;  Genetic engineering ;  Maize ;  Marker-assisted selection ;  Plant breeding
Comprehensive development analysis of intercity railway station,"Research purposes: The intercity rail transit is a project with a large investment, long construction period and operation of the engineering cost recovery slow after the project, so at the beginning of the construction and operation period, inevitably brings the economic burden for the investment project owner. Comprehensive development of intercity railway, not only can further expanding the scope of the passenger flow attracted, give full play to the role of the intercity rail transit as the main traffic, but also can make a significant contribution to reduce construction financial difficulty and promote sustainable development of the city. Through the technology integration and method innovation, the comprehensive value along the site surrounding rail transit projects is improved, to achieve self balancing. Research conclusions: (1) Because the capital is used in the two years before the start of railway construction, the comprehensive development revenue is acquired after the completion of the railway, the development proceeds cannot be directly used for capital in the project. (2) The development proceeds can be used to compensate for operating cash flow of the project. (3) If the development proceeds are enough, they will return as other railway project capital investment, to meet the investment requirements with more construction projects and more relaxed construction schedule. (4) The research results are of great significance to study the comprehensive development project in other regions and projects.",Zhang P.,Journal,Journal of Railway Engineering Society,2015-06-01,The Third Railway Survey and Design Institute Group Corporation,Comprehensive development ;  Conceptual planning ;  Format design ;  Intercity railway
Research on the combination of the Xi'an railway station reconstruction and the subway station,"Research purposes: The existing railway station renovation project is complex and part of the operations cannot be interrupted. So realizing zero distance interchange with the railway, choosing subway construction methods legitimately, controlling roadbed subsidence of railway stations and ensuring the train operation safety are significant aspects for the railway station hub renovation project. According to the reality of Xi'an subway line 4 by mining method passing through the existing Xi'an railway station and the renovation project, this paper put forward that the integrated design between reorganization and expansion of Xi'an railway station and subway construction restricted and adapted mutually. Additionally, security risk control system of concealed excavation of tunnels was analyzed, how to link up all kinds of transportations, make reasonable plans, distribute operations and strengthen the structure safety measures was discussed, the recognition of the perfect combination between architecture function and structural method was triggered. Research conclusions: (1) The paper expounds the railway station renovation project is combined with history protection and innovation. It is the key problem needed to be solved that is the reasonable choice of subway stations and the construction methods. Furthermore, realizing transfer function and ensuring the railway operation safe are the main purposes. (2) The detailed exploration of underground is necessary. The subway tunnel should implement the whole section grouting to stop water and tube shed measure. Additionally, strengthening the monitoring of surrounding environment, information construction and dynamic analysis, early warning and feedback is necessary. (3) Taking timely measures to limit train speed and reinforce rail, effectively controlling the underlying settlement and project risk are significant for railway transportation hub renovation design and other similar projects.",Zhang J.,Journal,Journal of Railway Engineering Society,2015-06-01,China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group Co.

Open-source 3-D printing technologies for education: Bringing additive manufacturing to the classroom,"Objective: 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve both Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and Career and Technical Education (CTE), as well as integrating these two educational emphases and providing opportunities for cross-curriculum engagement. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.",Schelly C.; Anzalone G.; Wijnen B.; Pearce J.,Journal,Journal of Visual Languages and Computing,2015-06-01,College of Engineering;Michigan Technological University,3-D printing ;  Open-source hardware ;  STEM education ;  Teacher education ;  Teacher workshop ;  Transformative education
Slow adoption of automated infection prevention surveillance: Are human factors contributing?,"Although automated surveillance technology has been evolving for decades, adoption of these technologies is in a nascent state. The current trajectory of public reporting, continued emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, and mandated antimicrobial stewardship initiatives will result in an increased surveillance workload for ICPs. The use of traditional surveillance methods will be inefficient in meeting the demands for more data and are potentially flawed by subjective interpretation. An examination is offered of the slow adoption of automated surveillance technology from a system perspective with the inherent ambiguities that may operate within the ICP work structure. Formal qualitative research is needed to assess the human factors associated with lack of acceptance of automated surveillance systems. Identification of these factors will allow the National Healthcare Safety Network and professional organizations to offer educational programs and mentoring to the ICP community that target knowledge deficits and the embedded culture that embraces the status quo. With the current focus on fully electronic surveillance systems that perform surveillance in its entirety without case review, effective use of the data will be dependent on ICP skills and their understanding of the strengths and limitations of output from algorithmic detection models.",Hebden J.,Journal,American Journal of Infection Control,2015-06-01,Wolters Kluwer Health,Ambiguity ;  Automated surveillance ;  System engineering
Performance-based logistics and interfirm team processes: An empirical investigation,"Practitioners are using performance-based logistics (PBL) strategies to reduce cost and improve value in industries such as defense, transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare. PBL is part of a group of increasingly popular buyer-supplier strategies that focuses on outcomes as oppose to the delivery of products or services. A key tenet of PBL is the use of innovation to create cost avoidance that benefits buyers and suppliers. In this research, we explore the interfirm team-level factors associated with innovation in successful PBL strategies. This research brings together business, organizational behavior, and engineering literature to study PBL team success. The study entailed interviews with 17 managers involved in large scale PBL projects. The interviews and follow-on member checking sessions resulted in a model composed of eight emergent categories and associated propositions.

Organ culture bioreactors – platforms to study human intervertebral disc degeneration and regenerative therapy," In recent decades the application of bioreactors has revolutionized the concept of culturing tissues and organs that require mechanical loading. In intervertebral disc (IVD) research, collaborative efforts of biomedical engineering, biology and mechatronics have led to the innovation of new loading devices that can maintain viable IVD organ explants from large animals and human cadavers in precisely defined nutritional and mechanical environments over extended culture periods. Particularly in spine and IVD research, these organ culture models offer appealing alternatives, as large bipedal animal models with naturally occurring IVD degeneration and a genetic background similar to the human condition do not exist. Latest research has demonstrated important concepts including the potential of homing of mesenchymal stem cells to nutritionally or mechanically stressed IVDs, and the regenerative potential of “smart” biomaterials for nucleus pulposus or annulus fibrosus repair. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about cell therapy, injection of cytokines and short peptides to rescue the degenerating IVD. We further stress that most bioreactor systems simplify the real in vivo conditions providing a useful proof of concept. Limitations are that certain aspects of the immune host response and pain assessments cannot be addressed with ex vivo systems. Coccygeal animal disc models are commonly used because of their availability and similarity to human IVDs. Although in vitro loading environments are not identical to the human in vivo situation, 3D ex vivo organ culture models of large animal coccygeal and human lumbar IVDs should be seen as valid alternatives for screening and feasibility testing to augment existing small animal, large animal, and human clinical trial experiments.",Gantenbein B.; Illien-Jünger S.; Chan S.; Walser J.; Haglund L.; Ferguson S.; Iatridis J.; Grad S.,Journal,Current Stem Cell Research and Therapy,2015-06-01,AO Research Institute Davos;ETH Zürich;University of Bern;Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology;Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai;Université McGill,Bioreactor ;  Cell viability ;  Engineering ;  Intervertebral disc ;  Mechanical loading ;  Mesenchymal stem cell ;  Nutrition ;  Torsional loading
"Intellectual Property, Scientific Independence, and the Efficacy and Environmental Impacts of Genetically Engineered Crops","Neoliberalism is the political ideology behind efforts to commercialize university science. The development of genetically engineered (GE) crops has facilitated the commercialization process because GE crops generally have more restrictive intellectual property protections than conventional crops. Those restrictions have led some to question whether long-term university research and innovations are being compromised to protect short-term intellectual property interests. This concern is evident in two letters submitted by public-sector entomologists in February 2009 to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The letters asserted that scientists are prohibited from conducting fully independent research on the efficacy and environmental impact of GE crops. In response to the letter, the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) negotiated an agreement between university scientists and seed companies to protect industry property rights while enabling university scientists to conduct research with more independence. Through a survey of public- and private-sector entomologists who are members of two regional entomologist research groups, we document scientists' perspectives on the adequacy of the ASTA agreement and whether those scientists have experienced limitations on their research projects involving efficacy and environmental impacts. Our findings show that limitations exist and that certain forms of public knowledge about crops are likely being compromised. These findings have implications for the legitimacy of current risk management institutions, as well as for future technological breakthroughs and innovations.",Glenna L.; Tooker J.; Welsh J.; Ervin D.,Journal,Rural Sociology,2015-06-01,Syracuse University;Portland State University;Pennsylvania State University,
Iron oxide-based multifunctional nanoparticulate systems for biomedical applications: A patent review (2008-present),"Iron oxide nanoparticles (IO NPs) exhibit remarkable properties, including inherent magnetism, biocompatibility, high surface to volume ratio, and versatility of engineering, making them ideal candidates for a variety of clinical applications.Areas covered: The review provides an in-depth discussion on recent patents and developments related to IO NPs in Biomedicine from the last 7 years.

A generic transformation of advanced materials technologies: Towards more integrated multi-materials systems via customized R&D and Innovation,"Starting with the last quarter of the 19th century until recent modern times, rapidly accelerating technological transformations and developments result in better and superior materials and cause improvements in almost every fields of technology. In this regard, materials technologies are also considered to be one of the major pillars and backbones of modern society with other generic fields such as energy, information-communication technologies and biotechnologies. Starting with the 21st century, a new era for advanced materials has emerged and greatly influenced by the market dynamics and intense competition from new entries (e.g. China and other new competitor countries). Advanced materials engineering has been evolving to become significantly more ""integrated materials systems"". Working on individual and isolated material components is no longer adequate enough to solve sophisticated engineering problems in industry. Therefore, a new challenge has been forcing advanced materials to become more integrated with variety of materials i.e., multi-materials systems along with interaction of other engineering functions, i.e., multi-functionality. Despite the fact that regularly developing new technical and scientific achievements and improvements, there is a lack of research in technology and innovation management of advanced materials covering its newly forming characteristics in diverse and multi-sectoral markets. The qualitative findings and results of selected 18 contracted projects on advanced materials indicate the emerging rise of collaborative networking and cooperative activities within variety of sectors. It was found that the predominant connections among such activities are with universities, raw materials suppliers, service-providing companies for testing, analysis, characterization and variety of treatments (thermal, mechanical and chemical) along with in-house collaborations for processing and applications. Such findings should be considered new and emerging since the market is very well known for its intensely competitive environment and sensitivity for any spillovers of information of any kind.",Baykara T.; Özbek S.; Ceranoʇlu A.,Journal,Journal of High Technology Management Research,2015-05-26,Gedik Üniversitesi;Doğuş Üniversitesi Istanbul,Advanced materials ;  Collaborative networking ;  Customized R&D ;  Innovation ;  Integrated multi-materials systems ;  Smart and functional materials
Ribozyme-Based Aminoglycoside Switches of Gene Expression Engineered by Genetic Selection in S. cerevisiae,"Systems for conditional gene expression are powerful tools in basic research as well as in biotechnology. For future applications, it is of great importance to engineer orthogonal genetic switches that function reliably in diverse contexts. RNA-based switches have the advantage that effector molecules interact immediately with regulatory modules inserted into the target RNAs, getting rid of the need of transcription factors usually mediating genetic control. Artificial riboswitches are characterized by their simplicity and small size accompanied by a high degree of modularity. We have recently reported a series of hammerhead ribozyme-based artificial riboswitches that allow for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via switching mRNA, tRNA, or rRNA functions. A more widespread application was so far hampered by moderate switching performances and a limited set of effector molecules available. Here, we report the re-engineering of hammerhead ribozymes in order to respond efficiently to aminoglycoside antibiotics. We first established an in vivo selection protocol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that enabled us to search large sequence spaces for optimized switches. We then envisioned and characterized a novel strategy of attaching the aptamer to the ribozyme catalytic core, increasing the design options for rendering the ribozyme ligand-dependent. These innovations enabled the development of neomycin-dependent RNA modules that switch gene expression up to 25-fold. The presented aminoglycoside-responsive riboswitches belong to the best-performing RNA-based genetic regulators reported so far. The developed in vivo selection protocol should allow for sampling of large sequence spaces for engineering of further optimized riboswitches.",Klauser B.; Atanasov J.; Siewert L.; Hartig J.,Journal,ACS Synthetic Biology,2015-05-15,Universität Konstanz,gene regulation ;  genetic selection ;  hammerhead ribozyme ;  neomycin ;  riboswitch ;  RNA switch

Operations strategy development in project based production - A political process perspective,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study how operations strategy (OS) innovation occurs in a project-centred production and organisation. Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal case study encompassing the processes at the headquarters of the company and in two projects using lean. Findings - The operation strategy development commences at a middle level in the organisation, is underpinned and embedded in production projects and only after several years becomes embedded in the corporate operation strategy. Projects use lean principles in a differentiated manner. Research limitations/implications - A qualitative case study provides insight into only a single occasion of change in OS. More case studies would probably reveal several paths of OS development. OS development need to be handled as emergent, political and with contributions from several managers and management levels, bridging the vertical divides between projects and headquarter. Practical implications - A conscious and systematic vertical integration and interaction is crucial in project-based companies doing operation strategy development, something critically difficult at building contractors.

Differentiation research on industrial technology innovation ability by DEA and PCA,"To analyze the technology innovation ability of China's auto industry, an analytical model is developed based on the theory of technology innovation. Using this model, the performances of technology innovation ability in auto industry, household audio-visual equipment industry and telecommunication equipment industry are evaluated. The model adopts a new and more sophisticated two-line approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, six factors are introduced into this model. The evaluation results show that the technology innovation ability of China's auto industry is in the low level, and it confronts insufficient innovation input and unbalanced innovation output.

The emerging research landscape on bioeconomy: What has been done so far and what is essential from a technology and innovation management perspective?,"As the global resource base is in need to move from fossil towards bio-based raw materials, different supply chains as well as existing technology platforms become increasingly interconnected. The therefore needed creation and exchange of new knowledge across scientific disciplines require R&D and target technology development and innovation, linking the knowledge-based bioeconomy to technology and innovation management research. In order to get an overview of the current research landscape dealing with the bioeconomy, a publication analysis is conducted. As the number of empirical studies, particularly in management research, is low, our study reveals that the evolution of the bioeconomy is still on a strategic level. Existing studies focus on knowledge networks, open innovation and technologies applicable across value chains to enable a holistic view on organizing future resource allocation and biomass flows. Scientific research in several dimensions is needed to elaborate the bioeconomy concept to make its implementation manageable. Industrial relevance Value chains, particularly of the agri-food, industrial products and energy sector, will increasingly converge due to the shift to bio-based raw materials leading to a mutual dependence and triggering new material flows and food processing technologies. This paper suggests that essential innovation management related research frames might contribute to a sustainable evolution of the bioeconomy by addressing the major challenges.",Golembiewski B.; Sick N.; Bröring S.,Journal,Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies,2015-05-01,Universität Bonn;University of Münster,Bioeconomy ;  Publication analysis ;  Technology and innovation management
National institutes of health: A catalyst in advancing regenerative medicine science into practice,"The stem cell domain of the regenerative medicine field has seen fundamental changes initiated by seminal discoveries in cell biology, genetic engineering, and whole genome sequencing. Many of these discoveries were funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NIH remains a leader in supporting research in the United States. However, as the field has developed, the NIH has responded proactively to identify roadblocks and to develop solutions that will accelerate translation of basic discoveries to the clinical setting. These activities range from organizing specialized workshops and coordinating activities among international organizations and the different arms of the government to funding small-scale industry. In addition, the NIH has been a key driver in providing needed infrastructure in areas in which the private sector has been unable to, or does not believe it can, invest. These activities of the NIH are as important as its traditional funding role, and I believe they have contributed to the innovation and rapid pace of discovery in this field.",Rao M.,Journal,Mayo Clinic Proceedings,2015-05-01,National Institutes of Health (NIH),
Changing culture through visionary thinking: Applying the DARPA hard test for innovation,"DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, uses its program visions as a way to drive quick change without upsetting the organization's broader internal balance. In particular, DARPA has embedded the concept of 'DARPA Hard' within its organizational culture, so much so that this term has established an internal standard for ideas intended for big change. DARPA Hard ideas are high risk and high reward. These are big visions, beyond the agency's existing capability. DARPA Hard ideas sit at the intersection of multiple fields, or aim to create an entirely new discipline or paradigm. The DARPA Hard Test assesses an idea across the four dimensions of DARPA Hard, far-reaching ideas, technically challenging ideas, multidisciplinary ideas, and actionable ideas. Ideas are scored on each dimension on a scale of 1-7, with 7 being the highest score. Teams cannot remain passive; they must actively talk through the fi ner points of ideas, which encourages them to open up about what they think is important and why.",Carleton T.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2015-05-01,,
Lime stabilisation for earthworks: A UK perspective,"Lime stabilisation is a versatile technique applied during earthworks operations. Modern soil recycling units are much more efficient at pulverising fill material and intermixing the added binder/water than machinery available 20 years ago. While supplier innovation adds flexibility to the site working method, specifications have not been sufficiently updated to permit optimal application. This review paper details the physico-chemical changes instigated through the lime–clay soil reaction, updating previous reviews. It aims to assist scientific debate, current practitioners and future specification changes. For example, the application of the minimum 24 h mellowing periods (mandatory to UK specifications) with high reactivity, quicklime powders is concluded to cause increased air voids in the compacted fill. Increased air voids are associated with reduced long-term strength and potential volume change from water ingress, which is of particular concern for sulfate swelling. Shorter mellowing periods and/or use of hydrated lime may lesson this issue; however, a ‘one size fits all’ approach is discouraged in preference to site-specific methodologies refined to suit the fill material and project requirements. The discussion also summarises working methods which may lower the risk of sulfate swell and defines areas requiring further practical research.",Beetham P.; Dijkstra T.; Dixon N.; Fleming P.; Hutchison R.; Bateman J.,Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Ground Improvement,2015-05-01,Opus International Consultants Ltd;British Geological Survey;Loughborough University;Independent Stabilisation Company Ltd,Geotechnical engineering ;  Recycling & reuse of materials ;  Reviews
Fixation and creativity in concept development: The attitudes and practices of expert designers,"Interviews were conducted with thirteen professional designers to understand their attitudes towards fixation and the practices they adopt to address it. Fixation was thought to be encouraged and discouraged by a wide range of factors related to the project, the client, the design team, the organisational culture and the design activities employed. The experiences that designers accumulate during their professional lives were associated with fixation in different ways. The experience of prior design failures was thought to encourage fixation whilst the experience of varied solutions was thought to discourage fixation. Recognising fixation episodes and reflecting on them was described as the means by which designers could guard against such episodes in the future and thus be more creative.",Crilly N.,Journal,Design Studies,2015-05-01,Department of Engineering,creativity ;  design fixation ;  engineering design ;  innovation ;  qualitative research
"Contracts, relationships and innovation in business-to-business exchanges","Purpose – This paper aims to contrast two approaches to the study of contracts in business and industrial marketing: first, as a legal document in shaping at the outset exchanges and interactions, for instance in projects; and second, as relational norms in becoming integrated into a business relationship through interactions, for instance as a resource. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on cross-case comparison of three projects, as actors develop an engineering service for optimizing the maintenance of large-scale capital equipment by analyzing real-time data from sensors and user records. Comparison is by coding interview and observational data as micro-sequences of interactions among actors. Findings – Preparing contracts allows a project to commence and is an early form of interaction, intensifying new relationships or cutting into and recasting established ones. Relational norms augment and can supersede the early focus on the contract, thus incorporating incremental innovation and absorbing some uncertainties. Research limitations/implications – The research approach benefits from detailed comparison and captures some variety across its three cases, but the discussion is limited to theoretical generalization. Practical implications – The analysis and discussion highlights and focuses on when different approaches to understanding contracting are more apparent across durable business relationships. Transitions from a contractual document to a view of relational norms are subtle, vulnerable and not always made successfully. Originality/value – This paper’s originality is in it comparison of overlapping approaches to understanding businesses’ uses of contacts in business and industrial marketing, of contract and relational norms. It develops a valuable research proposition, in the transition from a mainly contractual to a mainly relational uses of contracts, thus identifying contract as a particular business resource, to be deployed and embedded.",Möhring M.; Finch J.,Journal,Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,2015-05-01,"Adam Smith Business School;Strathclyde Business School, United Kingdom",Contract ;  Engineering services ;  Innovation ;  Interaction ;  Relationship
Emerging formats for next-generation antibody drug conjugates,"Introduction: Antibody drug conjugates now make up a significant fraction of biopharma's oncology pipeline due to great advances in the understanding of the three key components and how they should be optimised together. With this clinical success comes innovation to produce new enabling technologies that can deliver more effective antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) with a larger therapeutic index.Areas covered: There are many reviews that discuss the various strategies for ADCs design but the last 5 years or so have witnessed the emergence of a number of different antibody formats compete with the standard whole immunoglobulin. Using published research, patent applications and conference disclosures, the authors review the many antibody and antibody-like formats, discussing innovations in protein engineering and how these new formats impact on the conjugation strategy and ultimately the performance. The alternative chemistries that are now available offer new linkages, stability profiles, drug:antibody ratio, pharmacokinetics and efficacy. The different sizes being considered promise to address issues, such as tumour penetration, circulatory half-life and side-effects.Expert opinion: ADCs are at the beginning of the next stage in their evolution and as these newer formats are developed and examined in the clinic, we will discover if the predicted features have a clinical benefit. From the commercial activity, it is envisaged that smaller or fragment-based ADCs will expand oncological applications.",Deonarain M.; Yahioglu G.; Stamati I.; Marklew J.,Journal,Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery,2015-05-01,Antikor Biopharma Ltd.;University College London;Imperial College London,Antibody ;  Conjugate ;  Drug ;  Fab ;  Format ;  Fragment ;  Linker ;  Single-chain Fv
Layers of co-existing innovation systems,"The innovation systems approach, which has taken a prominent position in the academic literature, has also influenced policy-makers around the globe. Most research analyses innovation systems taking a national, regional or sectoral perspective, following a 'technological imperative'. Yet changes in institutional conditions and the importance of non-technological innovation question the accuracy and the relevance of the existing boundaries of innovation systems. These developments ask for a better understanding of how innovation systems integrate within and across different levels. Drawing on a novel combination of configurational and econometric analysis, we analyse 384 Swiss firms and identify five co-existing innovation systems: two generic innovation systems, the autarkic and the knowledge-internalisation; one regional innovation system, the protected hierarchy; and two sectoral innovation systems, the public sciences and the organised learning. The generic innovation systems entail the 'Science, Technology and Innovation' (STI) and the 'Doing, Interacting and Using' (DUI) learning modes. These systems are structurally distinct and do not integrate. In contrast, all regional and sectoral innovation systems integrate the learning modes of the generic innovation systems and complement them with idiosyncratic elements. The perspective on co-existing innovation systems that we develop here indicates the existence of two layers of innovation systems: a 'central' layer that hosts generic innovation systems and that constitutes the foundation for a second 'surface' layer that hosts regional and sectoral innovation systems. We discuss the implications of layers of co-existing innovation systems for policy-makers and future research.",Meuer J.; Rupietta C.; Backes-Gellner U.,Journal,Research Policy,2015-05-01,Universität Zürich,Firms' learning behavior ;  fsQCA ;  Innovation systems ;  Institutional frameworks ;  SUR model ;  Technological and organisational innovation
Determinants of consumers' mobile coupon adoption: A critical review of theories and literature,"Mobile technology is becoming a critical part of marketing practices and many retailers aim to engage consumers through mobile coupons. In this context, it is critical to understand what drives consumers to use mobile coupons. Technology adoption research offers insights for both researchers and practitioners into this matter. This chapter critically reviews guiding theories, Technology Acceptance Theory and Innovation Diffusion Theory, as well as important literature on technology adoption to discuss evolution and application of technology adoption research. Five perception variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, subjective norm, compatibility) and three individual characteristics (personal innovativeness, perceived risk, gender) are selected as most relevant determinants of consumers' intention to adopt and use mobile coupons. Limitation of technology adoption research and possible future research avenues are discussed.",Im H.; Ha Y.,Book,Successful Technological Integration for Competitive Advantage in Retail Settings,2015-04-30,"University of Minnesota Twin Cities;California State University, Long Beach",Compatibility ;  Decision making process (DMP) ;  Image ;  Location-based services ;  Mobile coupon services ;  Perceived risk ;  Perceived usefulness ;  Personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology ;  Subjective norm ;  Technologyacceptance model (TAM)
Keynote: Selecting research methods for studying a participatory culture in software development,"Recent innovations in social media have led to a paradigm shift in software development, with highly tuned participa- tory development cultures contributing to crowdsourced con- tent and being supported by media that have become in- creasingly more social and transparent. Never before in the history of software development have we seen such rapid adoption of new tools by software developers. But there are many unanswered questions about the impact this tool adoption has on the quality of the software, the productivity and skills of the developers, the growth of projects and tech- nologies developers contribute to, and how users can give feedback on and guide the software they use. Answering these questions is not trivial as this participatory develop- ment culture has become a virtual network of tightly coupled ecosystems consisting of developers, shared content and me- dia channels. In our studies, we have found that combining research meth- ods from the social sciences with data mining and software analytics to be the most promising in terms of revealing ben-fiets and challenges from this adoption of social tools. In this talk, I share some of the findings from our studies, discuss the particular research methods we have used, and share our experiences from using those research methods. I also dis- cuss how we as researchers leverage social tools and interact with the participatory development culture to assist with and help us gain feedback on our research. I close with a discussion about how other software engineering researchers could benefit from using social tools and the challenges they may face while doing so.",Storey M.,Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2015-04-27,University of Victoria,
"Knowledge transfers between research consortium, higher education institution and world of work","One of the important functions of higher education institution is to contribute of knowledge transfers and research and development (R&D) related continuums between international research consortium, higher education institution, world of work, and government policy. In this study, knowledge transfers and R&D related continuums for high-value impacts in externally funded research, such as research consortiums related new knowledge creation and dissemination were addressed as interest and innovation promoter, and thus as activate force to regional-national-global developers. This study explores how knowledge was transferred to the realizations of study units in higher education institution and how participators of research consortium influence to the knowledge transfer and continuums in R&D processes.

Learning in higher education by European Framework projects Laurea's study module: 'International innovation work of information systems',"The Framework Programmes (FPs) for Research and Technological Development (R&TD) are funding programmes created by the European Union/European Commission to support and foster research in the European Research Area (ERA). International R&TD projects play an increasing part in many organizations' R&TD investments. Technology developers of all organizations (industrial companies, small and medium-sized enterprises, research organizations, universities, governmental agencies, etc.) should know how the European innovation system works. In Laurea University of Applied Sciences' study module 'International innovation work of information systems', both students and teachers work as a part of an international research consortiumproducing new knowledge and other research outcomes utilizing methodological continuums, such as: understanding; innovating; demonstrating; building; testing; improving; functionalizing; transforming; experiencing; evaluating; implementing; and disseminating. During the study module, all participants (students and teachers) learn (1) what kind is the European innovation system and how to act as a part of it, (2) how to apply service innovation and design tools for developing value proposition, (3) and latest competences and substance knowledge in the field of information systems.",Rajamäki J.,Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2015-04-27,Laurea-ammattikorkeakoulu,Framework Programme ;  higher education ;  information system ;  innovation system ;  learning ;  research and technological development
Learning experiences within authentic demonstrations research project demonstrations at Viksu 2014 Camp,"Externally funded research, development and innovation (RDI) projects can be seen as a learning environment creating new skills and competencies for students, teachers, researchers, companies and public organizations. Laurea University of Applied Sciences' RDI project model develops academic knowledge and competencies by solving real problems in real-life situations. This paper describes how this learning process is realized and integrated into a RDI project in an environment, where students from various degree programmes were creating demonstrations for evaluating the project outcomes. These demonstrations were planned within the Multi-Agency Cooperation in Cross-Border Operations (MACICO) project and were held during Viksu 2014 International Camp for Young Firefighters. The demonstrations will result in five theses. Narrative interviews of the students gave knowledge on how learning has happened in such environment, what kind of competences the students have gained and what should be taken into account when creating similar learning environments.

Mechanical challenges in advanced spacecraft development,"Space engineering research and developments in mechanics are closely related, and often serve to promote each other. Analysis of the engineering difficulties in advanced spacecraft development and the related mechanical challenges shows that it is very important to overcome the main mechanical problems to enable rapid development of aerospace engineering technologies. When compared with classical spacecraft, a series of new concepts and technologies have been proposed to satisfy the requirements of advanced spacecraft development. These advanced spacecraft, which must overcome the severe effects of the complex launching and space running environments, result in challenging problems of applications in fields such as structural dynamics and computational mechanics. In this paper, a heavy-lift launch vehicle, a large complex spacecraft, a reusable launch vehicle and a hypersonic flight vehicle are introduced as four typical advanced spacecraft to illustrate the reactive relationships between the engineering and mechanical disciplines. Based on descriptions of their technical features, the research difficulties related to these advanced spacecraft are shown. Then, ten typical challenging problems are summarized into research topics in the four classical mechanical subject fields. Two challenging problems of a mechanical nature are shown in each of the three classical mechanics fields of dynamics and control, solid mechanics and aerodynamics. When compared with the engineering problems in a single mechanics discipline, it becomes obvious that research into interdisciplinary mechanical problems is becoming a major trend for advanced spacecraft. To promote concurrent development of advanced spacecraft and the appropriate mechanical disciplines, the following two proposals are made: (1) The close relationships between the engineering requirements and the mechanical disciplines should be given greater attention. The research efforts for advanced spacecraft can be supported by mechanical theory to enable new technological challenges to be overcome. (2) The coalescent development of advanced spacecraft with the disciplines of fundamental mechanics can be guaranteed through joint innovation and development efforts between technical personnel and mechanical researchers, both in China and abroad.",Yu D.,Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2015-04-25,China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation,Advanced spacecraft ;  Challenge mechanical problem ;  Engineering problem
Technology-driven layer-by-layer assembly of nanofilms,"Multilayer thin films have garnered intense scientific interest due to their potential application in diverse fields such as catalysis, optics, energy, membranes, and biomedicine. Here we review the current technologies for multilayer thin-film deposition using layer-by-layer assembly, and we discuss the different properties and applications arising from the technologies. We highlight five distinct routes of assembly - immersive, spin, spray, electromagnetic, and fluidic assembly - each of which offers material and processing advantages for assembling layer-by-layer films. Each technology encompasses numerous innovations for automating and improving layering, which is important for research and industrial applications. Furthermore, we discuss how judicious choice of the assembly technology enables the engineering of thin films with tailor-made physicochemical properties, such as distinct-layer stratification, controlled roughness, and highly ordered packing.",Richardson J.; Björnmalm M.; Caruso F.,Journal,Science,2015-04-24,University of Melbourne;ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology,
Evaluating and ranking the learning components of entrepreneurial skills based on a hybrid approach of the M-learning technology and TOPSIS method,"M-learning, a new type of e-learning, is created through the use of mobile phones connected to the internet. The present study aims to create a tool to investigate the learning of entrepreneurial skills via m-learning. An educational system to evaluate and enhance the learning of entrepreneurial skills and the creativity and innovations of the learners has to analyze the involved components. The effectiveness and importance of the components have to be determined to prioritize the components. In this research to create a tool, first a questionnaire that contained eighty-three questions was used to collect data. The statistical population included three hundred and thirty six BA students from the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences at the University of Isfahan. Analyses were carried out by means of descriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods, including one-variable t-test and TOPSIS technique. This survey evaluates the effects of the m-learning on the learning components of the entrepreneurial skills and identifies the most effective components as well. The results revealed that there is a positive and significant relationship between the m-learning, the motivation, the degree of learner's participation, the variety of educational methods, the satisfaction and the increase in self confidence in learners of entrepreneurial skills. It also revealed that motivation, self-confidence and participation have the highest effect on learning of entrepreneurial skills.",Moein R.; Malmir B.; Mousavi M.,Conference Proceeding,"IEOM 2015 - 5th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Proceeding",2015-04-23,"University of Tehran;Islamic Azad University, South Tehran Branch;Iran Management and Productivity Study Center",e-learning ;  entrepreneurial skills ;  entrepreneurship ;  m-learning technology ;  mobile wireless technology ;  TOPSIS method

Sensors of interest include, in particular, those based on the optical fibres, which can allow the sensing of a particular measurand such as the strain or the temperature within the structure where they are embedded, at specific locations with high accuracy, or continuously along the entire length of the optical fibre.Ongoing innovation and research activities are aimed at achieving the required quality and constant characteristics of such smart textiles over the entire life of the structure where they are applied, and for stimulating standardisation.",Zangani D.; Fuggini C.; Loriga G.,Book,Electronic Textiles: Smart Fabrics and Wearable Technology,2015-04-22,D'Appolonia S.p.A.,Fibre optical sensors ;  Multi-functional textiles ;  Smart textiles ;  Standardisation and certification
Rapid design labs - A tool to turbocharge design-led innovation,"We as researchers and User Experience (UX) designers want to identify and create products that change the world and therefore, we choose to engage in strategic research and design. In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design doesn't mean it will automatically be accepted or get to market. By definition, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have anti-innovation antibodies that often kill new ideas-even disruptive innovations that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need new tools to meet this challenge-tools that empower UX teams in both business and universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs-a design-led, facilitative, cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who systemically identify new ideas, and align multi-disciplinary teams around their ideas. Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping.

Technology transfer of HCI research innovations: Challenges and opportunities,"There has been a longstanding concern within HCI that even though we are accumulating great innovations in the field, we rarely see these innovations develop into products. Our panel brings together HCI researchers from academia and industry who have been directly involved in technology transfer of one or more HCI innovations. They will share their experiences around what it takes to transition an HCI innovation from the lab to the market, including issues around time commitment, funding, resources, and business expertise.

Exploring the potential for cross disciplinary working with archives and records management,"This paper explores the potential of cross disciplinary working and collaboration between HCI and archives and records management. It highlights an emerging interest in personal digital archiving and sees this as a fruitful area for more transformative forms of cross disciplinary working. A study is described in which an attempt is made to expose and actively engage UK based archivists and records managers with a selection of literature and research about personal digital archiving taken from the ACM Digital Library. The aim of the study was to see what, if anything, could be learnt through this process and whether, and in what way, such interaction might engender new insight and innovation. Although little new insight and innovation were so engendered, the study still makes a contribution as a provocation to reflect on cross disciplinary working and its importance for shaping new fields of study such as personal digital archiving.",Bunn J.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2015-04-18,University College London,Archives and records management ;  Cross disciplinary working ;  Personal digital archiving
"Standards and/as innovation: Protocols, creativity, and interactive systems development in ecology","Standards and protocols play important but under-theorized roles in HCI research and design efforts, including those dedicated to the development of new collaborative infrastructures in the sciences. Building on several years of ethnographic fieldwork, this paper examines standardization efforts attached to new forms of design and computational development in American ecology. We explore the role that standards play in large-scale research networks; how standards are enacted and enforced in complex interactive systems like science; how standards struggle and fail (and what happens when they do); and how actors work across the gaps that standards leave to produce more effective forms of practice and design. We also argue for the potentially creative role of standards, including contexts in which they function as fulcrums for change and innovation. We conclude with reflections on how HCI researchers might rethink the nature and possibilities of standards and standardization in their own work.",Jackson S.; Barbrow S.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2015-04-18,Wellesley College;Cornell University,Collaboration ;  Ecology ;  Ethnography ;  Infrastructure ;  Science ;  Standardization ;  Standards
From user-centered to adoption-centered design: A case study of an HCI research innovation becoming a product,"As we increasingly strive for scientific rigor and generalizability in HCI research, should we entertain any hope that by doing good science, our discoveries will eventually be more transferrable to industry? We present an in-depth case study of how an HCI research innovation goes through the process of transitioning from a university project to a revenue- Generating startup financed by venture capital. The innovation is a novel contextual help system for the Web, and we reflect on the different methods used to evaluate it and how research insights endure attempted dissemination as a commercial product. Although the extent to which any innovation succeeds commercially depends on a number of factors like market forces, we found that our HCI innovation with user-centered origins was in a unique position to gain traction with customers and garner buy-in from investors. However, since end users were not the buyers of our product, a strong user-centered focus obfuscated other critical needs of the startup and pushed out perspectives of nonuser- Centered stakeholders. To make the research-toproduct transition, we had to focus on adoption-centered design, the process of understanding and designing for adopters and stakeholders of the product. Our case study raises questions about how we evaluate the novelty and research contributions of HCI innovations with respect to their potential for commercial impact.",Chilana P.; Ko A.; Wobbrock J.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2015-04-18,University of Washington;University of Waterloo,Adoption-centered design ;  Commercialization ;  Dissemination ;  Productization ;  Research impact ;  Technology transfer
Tiree energy pulse: Exploring renewable energy forecasts on the edge of the grid,"In many parts of the world, the electricity supply industry makes the task of dealing with unpredictable spikes and dips in production and demand invisible to consumers, maintaining a seemingly unlimited supply. A future increase in reliance on time-variable renewable sources of electricity may lead to greater fluctuations in supply. We engaged remote islanders as equal partners in a research project that investigated through technology-mediated enquiry the topic of synchronising energy consumption with supply, and together built a prototype renewable energy forecast display. A number of participants described a change in their practices, saving high energy tasks for times when local renewable energy was expected to be available, despite having no financial incentive to do so. The main contributions of this paper are in: 1) the results of co-development sessions exploring systems supporting synchronising consumption with supply and 2) the findings arising from the deployment of the prototype.",Simm W.; Ferrario M.; Friday A.; Newman P.; Forshaw S.; Hazas M.; Dix A.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2015-04-18,"School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University;Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts;Lancaster University Management School;University of Birmingham",Electricity ;  Energy ;  Forecast ;  Renewable energy ;  Social innovation ;  Sustainability
The proper care and feeding of hackerspaces: Care ethics and cultures of making,"Communities of making have been at the center of attention in popular, business, political, and academic research circles in recent years. In HCI, they seem to carry the promise of new forms of computer use, education, innovation, and even ways of life. In the West in particular, the maker manifestos of these communities have shown strong elements of a neoliberal ethos, one that prizes self-determination, techsavvy, independence, freedom from government, suspicion of authority, and so forth. Yet such communities, to function as communities, also require values of collaboration, cooperation, interpersonal support-in a word, care. In this ethnographic study, we studied and participated as members of a hackerspace for 19 months, focusing in particular not on their technical achievements, innovations, or for glimmers of a more sustainable future, but rather to make visible and to analyze the community maintenance labor that helps the hackerspace support the practices that its members, society, and HCI research are so interested in. We found that the maker ethic entails a complex negotiation of both a neoliberal libertarian ethos and a care ethos.",Toombs A.; Bardzell S.; Bardzell J.,Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2015-04-18,Indiana University Bloomington,Care ;  Care ethics ;  Ethnography ;  Hackerspace ;  HCI
New product development in new ventures: The quest for resources,"Innovation and new product development (NPD) are becoming more important as strategic initiatives. Yet, innovation creates challenges for most existing organisations, thus leading to the emergence of new ventures (NVs) as vehicles to deliver innovation. NVs present owners and management with unique opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the NV can focus its attention on specific innovation(s) without having to compete with other goals and departments for resource access. Resources are critical to the successful development and launch of new products and can come from financial lenders and/or suppliers. However, because they are new and because their only asset of worth is the highly risky innovation, NVs are at a strong disadvantage in securing access to these resources. This study explores the effectiveness of using personal equity investments as a strategy for securing access and for enhancing NPD success. Using signalling theory as the theoretical framework and data from 745 NPD projects representing manufacturing innovations, this study finds that equity investment is particularly successful in its NPD impact although not impactful with suppliers. As a signal, it can be argued that equity is a strong, high-quality signal.

Latency and cost requirements of systems for teaching MAC protocols,"Over the past decade, the physical (PHY) layer of communication systems has evolved with the addition of techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multi-carrier aggregation. This has resulted in significant performance improvements, but it has come at the cost of increased power consumption and system complexity. To overcome this problem, a wide range of new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for wireless networks. However, the speed of innovation in MAC protocols has not been able to keep up with the fast pace of PHY layer research; the latter being fueled by the availability of a variety of Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms. These systems have eventually made their way into the classrooms and labs, thus giving communication engineers an experiential learning opportunity. They have provided students cost effective options to acquire real-world signals and analyze them using digital signal processing techniques. In essence, this has done for communications engineering students, what the sound card did for students learning audio signal processing. On the other hand, computer science students have been left with the option of learning about MAC protocols only through text books or by using software simulations. This is because most SDR systems do not meet the stringent latency and performance requirements required for creating real-world communication links; and the few that do are priced out of reach for classroom sizes typically found in Indian engineering colleges. In this paper, we analyze this situation at hand and discuss the emergence of a new design space for MAC layer prototyping systems. This paper discusses the key requirements, namely latency, processing speed, and cost, of systems in this design space. Finally, this paper describes how availability of commercial technology and careful trade-off with other requirements, such as throughput and frequency agility, is making it feasible to design a system that meets these key requirements.",Samant A.; Badarla V.; Yadav S.; Vutukuru M.; Khanna P.; Luther E.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 21st National Conference on Communications, NCC 2015",2015-04-13,Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur;Indian Institute of Technology Bombay;National Instruments,

Adopting global virtual engineering teams in AEC Projects : A qualitative meta-analysis of innovation diffusion studies,"Purpose - This study aims to present an integrated conceptual model in order to highlight the major aspects of diffusion of innovations in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) context. To this end, a critical review of literature is conducted, accompaniedbysynthesising the findings of previous studies. The driving force behind this study is stemmed from the fragmentation of literature on innovation diffusion, and paucity of research on diffusion of Global Virtual Engineering Teams (GVETs) as the platform formany technological innovations in relevant literature. Thus, the present study is intended to facilitate filling the gap in GVETs literature. That is, the proposed model will offer a foundation for academia for grounding studies on any innovation including GVETs in the literature on innovation diffusion in the AEC context. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws upon the qualitative meta-analysis approach encompassing a critical review of the relevant literature. To this end, the review builds upon studies found within 15 prestigious journals in AEC. The domain of this review was confined to areas described as ""innovation"", ""innovation diffusion"" and ""innovation adoption"", along with keywords used within a broad review of recently published GVETs literature. The rigour of review is augmented by incorporating 35 authoritative works from other disciplines published in 21 well-known journals in the manufacturing, business and management fields. Moreover, the study deploys the peer-debriefing approach through conducting unstructured interviews with five Australian scholars to verify a model presenting an aggregated summary of previous studies. Findings - The key findings of the study include the following items: Synthesising the fragmented studies on innovation diffusion in the AEC context. In doing so, a model capturing the major aspects affecting diffusion of an innovation in AEC projects is presented; providing a foundation to address the drawbacks of previous studies within the sphere of GVETs, based on the developed model. Research limitations/implications - The developed model was only enhanced using a small sample size of academics, as such not empirically validated. Originality/value - As possibly, the first literature review of innovation in the AEC context, this paper contributes to the sphere by sensitising the AEC body of knowledge on innovation diffusion as a concise conceptual model, albeit verified through the peer-debriefing approach. This study will also further establish the research field in AEC on GVETs along with other methods reliant on virtual working such as building information modelling (BIM) through providing an expanded foundation for future inquiries and creation of knowledge.",Hosseini M.; Chileshe N.; Zuo J.; Baroudi B.,Journal,Construction Innovation,2015-04-07,University of South Australia,AEC ;  Construction ;  Diffusion ;  Innovation ;  Team working ;  Virtual team

Dental science and technology parks: Rethinking university-industry connections,"As the 21st century unfolds, the development of science-based technologies [such as nanodentistry, tissue engineering, three-dimensional (3D) printers, laser dentistry, and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)] should change clinical dental practice. Unfortunately, a persistent problem in dentistry is the slow acceptance of new technology by dental schools and some dentists. Most dental graduates, dental faculty, and dental researchers know little about the principles of entrepreneurship, e.g., the process of patenting and licensing, how to write a business plan, market analysis, sources of financing, and the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises. Most dental graduates, dental faculty, and dental researchers know little about the topics mentioned above. They may know how to conduct a dental research project and publish a paper, but most have no idea of how to plan for the commercialization of research findings.

The Multiple Lives of Moore's Law,"A HalF Century Ago, a young engineer named Gordon E. Moore took a look at his fledgling industry and predicted big things to come in the decade ahead. In a four-page article in the trade magazine Electronics, he foresaw a future with home computers, mobile phones, and automatic control systems for cars. All these wonders, he wrote, would be driven by a steady doubling, year after year, in the number of circuit components that could be economically packed on an integrated chip. A decade later, the exponential progress of the integrated circuit-later dubbed ""Moore's Law"" - showed no signs of stopping. And today it describes a remarkable, 50-year-long winning streak that has given us countless forms of computers, personal electronics, and sensors. The impact of Moore's Law on modern life can't be overstated. We can't take a plane ride, make a call, or even turn on our dishwashers without encountering its effects. Without it, we would not have found the Higgs boson or created the Internet. But what exactly is Moore's Law, and why has it been so successful? Is it evidence of technology's inevitable and unstoppable march? Or does it simply reflect a unique time in engineering history, when the special properties of silicon and a steady series of engineering innovations conspired to give us a few decades of staggering computational progress?",MacK C.,Journal,IEEE Spectrum,2015-04-01,,Integrated circuits ;  Market research ;  Moore's Law
STS-inspired design to meet the challenges of modern aging. Welfare technology as a tool to promote user driven innovations or another way to keep older users hostage?,"Older technology users and their integration into IT society have been on the research agenda since digitalization took off. Given the attempts to develop user-driven design, it is surprising that the appearance of technologies older people are provided with, or are the target group for, have not progressed. Now another political agenda, coined as ""welfare technology"", is being launched in Scandinavia. It is the reminiscent of previous arguments for why demographics, welfare and the need for new business arenas should be prioritized. This paper argues that STS-inspired design can contribute to a paradigm shift that breaks this trend and instead helps to develop proactive technology that meets the needs and demands of today's senior citizens. Two cases illustrate the way the imbalance between technology and older people's influence persists over time. Another three cases with a bearing on design sciences are singled out and discussed: the selection of older subjects; the understanding of the ""social"" in going from the laboratory to real-life settings; and the ""making of meaning"" in product development. The conclusions point to the opportunity to bridge the imbalance when introducing welfare technology by introducing STS-inspired reflections on engineering and design.",Östlund B.; Olander E.; Jonsson O.; Frennert S.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2015-04-01,Lunds Universitet,Aging and design ;  Older users ;  STS-driven design ;  User-driven design ;  Welfare technology

Constraint engineering and generator-based module approaches are among the innovations that have emerged. Our paper will first present a brief review of the state of the art of analog layout automation.

Lithium-sulfur batteries: Progress and prospects,"Development of advanced energy-storage systems for portable devices, electric vehicles, and grid storage must fulfill several requirements: low-cost, long life, acceptable safety, high energy, high power, and environmental benignity. With these requirements, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries promise great potential to be the next-generation high-energy system. However, the practicality of Li-S technology is hindered by technical obstacles, such as short shelf and cycle life and low sulfur content/loading, arising from the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates between the cathode and anode and the poor electronic conductivity of S and the discharge product Li2S. Much progress has been made during the past five years to circumvent these problems by employing sulfur-carbon or sulfur-polymer composite cathodes, novel cell configurations, and lithium-metal anode stabilization. This Progress Report highlights recent developments with special attention toward innovation in sulfur-encapsulation techniques, development of novel materials, and cell-component design.

Effects of Innovation on Technical Progress in Spanish Manufacturing Firms,"We analyse the effect of innovation on technical progress in Spanish manufacturing firms by identifying and explaining how the following innovation factors affect technical progress: research and development (R&D) activities and expenditures, patents, innovations in products and in processes, internal organisation of innovation, outsourcing R&D activities, public R&D funding, external relationships of innovation and different ways of external collaboration for innovation. We focus on how firm behaviour and structure drive these innovation factors. Our results are based on multiple regression analyses using firm-level data from 2010. We show that innovations in product, processes and R&D activities (especially external R&D activities) are more likely to improve the productivity of Spanish manufacturing firms. In addition, the activities related to the internal organisation or the external collaboration for innovation generates a higher productivity level. This positive effect is bigger when a firm collaborates with universities and/or technology centres and employs recent college graduates, especially those with degrees in science, engineering or technology.",Sánchez-Sellero P.; Sánchez-Sellero M.; Sánchez-Sellero F.; Cruz-González M.,Journal,"Science, Technology and Society",2015-03-20,Universidade de Vigo;Universidade da Coruña;Universidad de Zaragoza,
A review of heat pump systems for heating and cooling of buildings in China in the last decade,"Heat pump technology fully shows the principle of energy recycling in terms of Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC). It avoids unipolarity of energy using in the conventional HVAC system. Heat pumps use high-grade energy as a driving energy, recovering and upgrading low-grade energy for avail, like a pump. Because heat source used in HVAC usually is low temperature heat, heat pump systems adopted in HVAC will help improve heating performance coefficient. Therefore, HVAC is one of ideal users of heat pump applications, and thus high-grade energy used in HVAC can be replaced with a large number of low-temperature renewable energy. Through the heat pump technology, natural low-grade energy stored in the soil, water, air or waste heat from variant industries and daily lives, is supplied for building cooling/heating and hot water serving. Therefore, vast applications and developments of heat pump technology are presented in HVAC in China, and some progresses are achieved in the system innovation, experimental research, product development and engineering application, etc. This paper reviews the progress of researches, applications and development in the field of heat pumps for building cooling/heating in China since the 21st century.",Ni L.; Dong J.; Yao Y.; Shen C.; Qv D.; Zhang X.,Journal,Renewable Energy,2015-03-18,Harbin Institute of Technology,China ;  Heat pump ;  Heating and cooling ;  Review
Needs and technology adoption: Observation from BIM experience,"Purpose: Despite the recognized role of motivation of actors in technology adoption decisions, there is limited understanding of the psychological processes underlying the motivation. The purpose of this paper is to explore this gap by investigating Building Information Modeling (BIM) adoption from the viewpoint of Maslow's motivational theory on hierarchy of needs. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses mixed methods. Initially theoretical arguments establish the suitability of Maslow's hierarchy of needs as the conceptual framework to investigate technology adoption. The hypotheses and research questions are investigated using data collected through focus group interviews, interviews and field observations in Australian architecture engineering and construction (AEC). The findings are validated with a survey of BIM adoption cases reported in literature, and additional interviews conducted in Finnish AEC sector. Finally, abductive reasoning is applied to seek the best possible explanation for the observed patterns. Findings: It is found that besides individuals, organizations also demonstrate hierarchical ordering of innovation-related needs. Three broad categories of innovation-related needs are identified. Using abduction, the innovation-related needs of actors are described in terms of stable and excited states. Research limitations/implications: The findings are primarily based on studies conducted in regions with developed economies. Practical implications: This research shows that Maslow's hierarchy of needs could be a useful diagnostic framework to assess actors' response towards technology adoption. Originality/value: This investigation into the potential usefulness of Maslow's theory into understanding technology adoption is by itself a novel research contribution. The finding that hierarchical view of needs can partly explain the adoption decisions of both individual and organizational actors is an original contribution.",Singh V.; Holmstrom J.,Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2015-03-16,Aalto University,Change management ;  Decision making ;  Information management ;  Information technology strategy ;  Innovation ;  Motivation

GIKI MEMS Lab—Architects of Tiny Machines,"The case describes the dynamics faced by Dr Shafaat Bazaz, a foreign faculty member hired by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan, in establishing a state-of-the-art research lab at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIKI), a premier engineering institute in Pakistan. The lab specialized in designing tiny micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). During five years of untiring efforts, the lab produced both skilled human resources in MEMS technologies and a number of cutting-edge technologies (devices) comparable to, and even surpassing, specifications of similar products developed in other countries. The efforts contributed significantly in the introduction and launch of a new industry in Pakistan. The case also highlights the numerous entities that Shafaat interacted with while producing a continuous stream of funding for meeting bare-minimum operational needs of the lab, amidst other challenges, while bearing a perpetual opportunity cost himself. At the time of writing this case, MEMS lab had acquired the capability of offering commercial design services to companies in the Americas and Europe. At the same time, it was engaged in research collaborations with various international institutions for development of new technologies. The potential of producing revenues through commercial activity could be utilized for further development of the MEMS lab and its research potential and resources. However, any future decision on commercializing activity was dependent on Shafaat’s own future, which was uncertain due to possible devolution of HEC in 2011 (as he was an HEC-hired foreign faculty working at GIKI).

Toward a research agenda for human-centered service system innovation,"Solving service problems has enormous practical consequences for the economy and society because (a) more than 80% of jobs in the United States are in the service sector, with most science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates working in the service sector; (b) many complex service problems resist traditional optimization solutions; (c) private investments in platform technologies that underlie business and societal service innovations (smart service systems) are on the rise; and (d) the United States lags in public investment in service research behind countries such as Japan, China, Finland, and Germany. The search for service innovation requires new theories and new methods to address problems unique to services, and what little students are being taught about the service sector has not kept up with the rapid growth of STEM jobs in service or with modern entrepreneurial opportunities. We think that effective understanding of complex human-centered service systems requires a new approach that combines multiple methods, perhaps drawing from industrial engineering and operations research, social and behavioral sciences, information systems, and computer science and computational modeling. In this commentary, we outline a series of broad considerations and concerns, fundamental and applied questions, and specific research agenda items for service system innovation.",Maglio P.; Kwan S.; Spohrer J.,Journal,Service Science,2015-03-01,School of Engineering;San Jose State University;IBM Research - Almaden,Service modeling ;  Service theory and principles ;  Service transformation and innovation

Smart things as service providers: A call for convergence of disciplines to build a research agenda for the service systems of the future,"We are approaching the tipping point in the development of technologies that promise to enable an era of smart everything (cities, cars, buildings, etc.). Concurrently, service systems continue to dominate industrialized economies. Naturally, the concepts of smartness and service are starting to fuse, particularly when there is growing interest in overcoming the issues surrounding the effective implementation of smart engineered systems by applying a ""service"" framework. In terms of adding value to human life, actions executed by smart objects, mediated by technology, can be interpreted as a service to people. Inevitably, a new theoretical framework is needed to describe the interactions of ubiquitous technologies (new smart objects or processes) with the human world. Fundamental scientific principles need to be well understood at the intersection of the sensing and actuating, cognitive/behavioral, communications, and computational fields. This call for a new research avenue is intended to challenge the service engineering research community to think more deeply in the context above and converge with behavioral, cognitive, and computer scientists to develop new or additional principles and theories that help us better predict the behavior of a service system as a function of its design (as a sociotechnical system), with the human at the center.",Medina-Borja A.,Journal,Service Science,2015-03-01,Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez,Language and modeling ;  Logic ;  Service engineering ;  Smart service systems and dynamics ;  Theory and principles ;  Transformation and innovation
A laboratory facility for flocculation-related experiments,"This report describes the design and functions of a new experimental facility built in the School of Civil Engineering at the University of Sydney used for the investigation of flocculation-related processes. This facility was uniquely designed to replicate physical (hydrodynamic processes and sediment load), chemical (nutrients and contaminants) and biological (micro-organisms) processes in natural aqueous environment; hence, it allows for investigating the effects of these processes on the flocculation dynamics of suspended particle matter (SPM) through a fully controllable laboratory-based research. It consists of five major components, including a smallscale settling column, a turbulence generating system, a water quality mea-suring system, a μPIV system, and a micro-controlling system. Measurements, either imaging data of settling SPM or water quality readings, can be acquired automatically with any ar-bitrary scheduling. The innovation of this facility is the integration of physical, chemical and biological aquatic processes into one framework to explore the complexity of the interactions be-tween these processes and SPM dynamics. One of its major contributions to the advancement in sediment dynamics studies is the direct detection of possible repercussions the increased anthropogenic stresses has on the microbial population and the aggregation kinematics and statistics of suspended particles in aqueous ecosystem. Ultimately, this facility is expected to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how all possible interactions in natural water bodies affect each other and consequently, how these interactions affect SPM flocculation and transport.",Tang F.; Maggi F.,Journal,"Research Report - University of Sydney, Department of Civil Engineering",2015-03-01,,Aggregation ;  Settling column ;  Suspended particle matter Biological flocculation ;  μPIV
Two-million-liter tank expands the boundaries of marine technology innovation: National resource available for advancing marine science,"With one small move across a street, NOAA Fisheries, our nation’s steward ofmarine ecosystems, made a giant leap into the future of ocean science and technologydevelopment. The new Southwest Fisheries Science Center facility in La Jolla,California, houses dozens of interdisciplinary research and engineering groups andfeatures a world-class Ocean Technology Development Tank that expands the possibilitiesfor advancing marine industry and science. This 20 × 10 × 10-meter, twomillion-liter, freshwater or seawater “Tech Tank” is clear, quiet, and large enough tocalibrate and test a wide variety of sensitive instruments with minimal boundaryeffects. The tank’s temperature, salinity, and circulation can be made to mimicthe broad range of water conditions encountered in the field, its water conditioningsystem greatly mitigates microbubbles and turbidity, and it can accommodate livemarine animals. This unique combination of features opens doors to efficient engineeringand scientific experimentation. The Tech Tank, supported by scientists andengineers and co-located with other state-of-the-art laboratory facilities, is a uniquenational resource for marine research and development and a catalyst for government,academic, and industry partnerships.

Asset management: A maintenance engineer's view,"In the past, assets were designed in large construction teams but companies in recent decades focus more and more on their core activities. The management of capital goods is being organized in the (supply) chain of owners, users, manufacturers, research institutes, IT, service providers and so on. The complexity of modern systems (e.g., mechatronics) and sustainability issues have placed more pressure on cooperation: openness, interaction and stability in the relationship foster joint innovation in product, process and technology. Focus on opportunities rather than risks makes this cooperation successful. With the operational processes in good shape it is to show where the technical characteristics of the assets fail. Technical ""on the spot"" support is important to develop understanding between the maintenance and the production organizations, and establishing a sense of urgency in their cooperation: first to analyze the actual fault behaviour of the equipment and to solve short-term problems and secondly to take structural measures. In the coming years, real time monitoring facilitates maintenance with more accurate information than before. Proactive dynamic maintenance scheduling reduces the number of unexpected failures.",Van Dongen L.,Journal,International Journal of Performability Engineering,2015-03-01,Universiteit Twente,Asset management ;  Design for maintenance ;  Life-cycle costs ;  Maintenance engineering ;  Monitoring ;  Supply chain cooperation

Review of inverse optimal algorithm of in-situ stress filed and new achievement,"In situ stress is an important basis for the design of mining and geotechnical engineering and dynamic disaster prevention. The inverse calculation of in situ stress field is carried out on the basis of in-situ stress measurement results on a few individual points, combining with a mathematical and mechanical method to regresses and extend them in situ stress field distribution. Focused on the academic idea, scope of application, and the advantages and disadvantages, the basic inverse algorithm and reconstruction methods for in situ stress field are introduced in a systematic manner. The improvement and innovation made all around of the word in literature and application are summarized and elaborated, particularly, the new achievements of the nonlinear mathematical methods used in the inverse calculation of the in situ stress field. In the presented work, a new nonlinear optimal algorithm-surrogate accelerated model is put forward for the calculation of in situ stress, which ensures to obtain the best optimal solution for the entire analytic region.

Ethics and policy issues for stem cell research and pulmonary medicine,"Stem cell research and related initiatives in regenerative medicine, cell-based therapy, and tissue engineering have generated considerable scientific and public interest. Researchers are applying stem cell technologies to chest medicine in a variety of ways: using stem cells as models for drug discovery, testing stem cell-based therapies for conditions as diverse as COPD and cystic fibrosis, and producing functional lung and tracheal tissue for physiologic modeling and potential transplantation. Although significant scientific obstacles remain, it is likely that stem cell-based regenerative medicine will have a significant clinical impact in chest medicine. However, stem cell research has also generated substantial controversy, posing a variety of ethical and regulatory challenges for research and clinical practice. Some of the most prominent ethical questions related to the use of stem cell technologies in chest medicine include (1) implications for donors, (2) scientific prerequisites for clinical testing and use, (3) stem cell tourism, (4) innovation and clinical use of emerging stem cell-based interventions, (5) responsible translation of stem cell-based therapies to clinical use, and (6) appropriate and equitable access to emerging therapies. Having a sense of these issues should help to put emerging scientific advances into appropriate context and to ensure the responsible clinical translation of promising therapeutics.",Lowenthal J.; Sugarman J.,Journal,Chest,2015-03-01,Johns Hopkins University;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,
Archaeal extrachromosomal genetic elements,"Research on archaeal extrachromosomal genetic elements (ECEs) has progressed rapidly in the past decade. To date, over 60 archaeal viruses and 60 plasmids have been isolated. These archaeal viruses exhibit an exceptional diversity in morphology, with a wide array of shapes, such as spindles, rods, filaments, spheres, head-tails, bottles, and droplets, and some of these new viruses have been classified into one order, 10 families, and 16 genera. Investigation of model archaeal viruses has yielded important insights into mechanisms underlining various steps in the viral life cycle, including infection, DNA replication and transcription, and virion egression. Many of these mechanisms are unprecedented for any known bacterial or eukaryal viruses. Studies of plasmids isolated from different archaeal hosts have also revealed a striking diversity in gene content and innovation in replication strategies. Highly divergent replication proteins are identified in both viral and plasmid genomes. Genomic studies of archaeal ECEs have revealed a modular sequence structure in which modules of DNA sequence are exchangeable within, as well as among, plasmid families and probably also between viruses and plasmids. In particular, it has been suggested that ECE-host interactions have shaped the coevolution of ECEs and their archaeal hosts. Furthermore, archaeal hosts have developed defense systems, including the innate restriction- modification (R-M) system and the adaptive CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system, to restrict invasive plasmids and viruses. Together, these interactions permit a delicate balance between ECEs and their hosts, which is vitally important for maintaining an innovative gene reservoir carried by ECEs. In conclusion, while research on archaeal ECEs has just started to unravel the molecular biology of these genetic entities and their interactions with archaeal hosts, it is expected to accelerate in the next decade.",Wang H.; Peng N.; Shah S.; Huang L.; She Q.,Journal,Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews,2015-03-01,Huazhong Agricultural University;Københavns Universitet;Institute of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences,
An ageing-in-place service innovation model by using TRIZ methodology,"Most of the research on the concept of ""ageing-in-place"" has focused on surveys of the needs of senior citizens and/or the quality of the services delivered to them. Service innovation for ageing-in-place has received little research attention, however. The present study addresses this issue by proposing a service innovation model for ageing-in-place. In this model, a TRIZ methodology is used to develop the parameter correspondence table, which integrates TRIZ contradiction parameters and ageing-in-place service-quality determinants, to deal with service contradiction. A TRIZ contradiction matrix is then applied to generate inventive solutions for the innovation of the ageing-in-place service system. A case study is also conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.",Chen C.; Shie A.; Wang K.; Yu C.,Journal,Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing,2015-03-01,Yu Da University;Yuan Ze University,Ageing-in-place ;  Contradiction matrix ;  Home care ;  Service innovation ;  TRIZ
Personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with retinitis pigmentosa,"Introduction: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) encompasses many different hereditary retinal degenerations that are caused by a vast array of different gene mutations and have highly variable disease presentations and severities. This heterogeneity poses a significant therapeutic challenge, although an answer may eventually be found through two recent innovations: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas genome editing.Areas covered: This review discusses the wide-ranging applications of iPSCs and CRISPR-including disease modelling, diagnostics and therapeutics-with an ultimate view towards understanding how these two technologies can come together to address disease heterogeneity and orphan genes in a novel personalized medicine platform. An extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar, with a particular focus on high-impact research published within the last 1-2 years and centered broadly on the subjects of retinal gene therapy, iPSC-derived outer retina cells, stem cell transplantation and CRISPR/Cas gene editing.Expert opinion: For the retinal pigment epithelium, autologous transplantation of gene-corrected grafts derived from iPSCs may well be technically feasible in the near future.

Technostress: Negative effect on performance and possible mitigations,"We investigate the effect of conditions that create technostress, on technology-enabled innovation, technology-enabled performance and overall performance. We further look at the role of technology self-efficacy, organizational mechanisms that inhibit technostress and technology competence as possible mitigations to the effects of technostress creators. Our findings show a negative association between technostress creators and performance. We find that, while traditional effort-based mechanisms such as building technology competence reduce the impact of technostress creators on technology-enabled innovation and performance, more empowering mechanisms such as developing technology self-efficacy and information systems (IS) literacy enhancement and involvement in IS initiatives are required to counter the decrease in overall performance because of technostress creators. Noting that the professional sales context offers increasingly high expectations for technology-enabled performance in an inherently interpersonal-oriented and relationship-oriented environment with regard to overall performance, and high failure rates for IS acceptance/use, the study uses survey data collected from 237 institutional sales professionals.",Tarafdar M.; Pullins E.; Ragu-Nathan T.,Journal,Information Systems Journal,2015-03-01,The College of Business and Innovation;Lancaster University Management School,Context ;  Sales force automation ;  Sales force performance ;  Technology self-efficacy ;  Technology-enabled innovation ;  Technology-enabled performance ;  Technostress
Seizing opportunities for the support of innovation through committee standards and standardization: Insights from German companies,"This paper provides insights into the key results of a research project funded by the German Institute for Standardization DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung e. V.). It investigates how German companies, in particular SMEs, can leverage committee standards to drive innovations. Whereas the impact of standardization on innovation has been acknowledged in the scientific literature from the macro-perspective, little is known on how standards and standardization can support innovation on the company level. This research builds upon findings from 40 semi-structured interviews conducted with experts from German companies in five sectors: biotechnology, nanotechnology, services, security, and mechanical engineering. The key informants are practitioners with R & D and standardization experience. The interview data are fitted into a qualitative model that explains how standards and standardization can lead to innovation, given certain contextual factors (internal and external). The analysis of this data shows that companies that use standards and are involved regularly in standardization processes are able to create six types of opportunities supporting innovation.",Abdelkafi N.; Makhotin S.,Book,"Standards and Standardization: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",2015-02-28,Universität Leipzig;Fraunhofer Center for Central and Eastern Europe,

New progress in the R & D of water drainage gas recovery tools in Sichuanand Chongqing gas zones,"In recent years, the implementation scope of drainage recovery technology in Sichuan and Chongqing gas zones has extended from medium and shallow reservoirs in mature fields to deep, acidic and oil-water-gas reservoirs and this technology has been developed into a combined process. Conventional optimal design has been developed into a software package system combined with economic evaluation. Moreover, new challenges appeared in the existing tools for drainage gas recovery. Through unremitting technological breakthroughs, great strides were made in the development and application of assorted tools and equipment for drainage gas recovery. Gas lift tools were developed from the conventional model to a high sulfate-resistant model, from a side-pocket type to a concentric throwing-in and pulling type. The nitrogen pressure of a gas lift valve was 25 MPa, and external pressure resistance was up to 90 MPa. Independent research resulted in the development of an electric submersible pump for the dedicated wellhead equipments and a remote monitoring and control system which were ranked at domestic leading level. Domestication was realized of the plunger gas-lift tools realized localization. Independent innovation brought about the development of a plunger controller with remote control function, a reliable and efficient throw-in block-type locking device with a buffer spring, a temperature and pressure measuring plunger, and other tools. The performance parameters of a coiled tubing hanger, a large-diameter operating window, a coiled tubing packer, and double-disc check valves all reached a high level. The optimization of a high-pressure wellhead driving head and a tubing anchor dramatically improved the effect and scope of the application of the progressive cavity pump. These integrated innovations of the tools and equipment have effectively expanded the application range of water drainage and gas recovery technology in Sichuan and Chongqing gas fields.",Ye C.; Xiong J.; Kang L.; Peng Y.; Chen J.,Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2015-02-25,CNPC Southwest Oil & Gasfield Company,Coiled tubing ;  Drainage gas recovery ;  Electric submersible pump ;  Gas lift ;  Plunger ;  Progress ;  Progressive cavity pump ;  Sichuan and Chongqing gas zones ;  Tool
Protein chemical synthesis in drug discovery,"The discovery of novel therapeutics to combat human disease has traditionally been among the most important goals of research chemists. After a century of innovation, state-of-the-art chemical protein synthesis is now capable of efficiently assembling proteins of up to several hundred residues in length from individual amino acids. By virtue of its unique ability to incorporate non-native structural elements, chemical protein synthesis has been seminal in the recent development of several novel drug discovery technologies. In this chapter, we review the key advances in peptide and protein chemistry which have enabled our current synthetic capabilities. We also discuss the synthesis of D-proteins and their applications in mirror image phage-display and racemic protein crystallography, the synthesis of enzymes for structure-based drug discovery, and the direct synthesis of homogenous protein pharmaceuticals.",Liu F.; Mayer J.,Book Series,Topics in Current Chemistry,2015-02-24,Indiana University Bloomington;Calibrium LLC,Drug discovery ;  Mirror image phage-display ;  Native chemical ligation ;  Peptide desulfurization ;  Peptide ligation ;  Peptide synthesis ;  Protein chemical synthesis ;  Protein pharmaceutical ;  Racemic protein crystallography
Prototyping: A key skill for innovation and life-long learning,"Physical prototypes play a crucial role in any design project; but all the critical effects that physical prototypes have need to be further studied. Often, design courses (including capstone courses) include some type of prototyping. More needs to be understood about what students need to learn from prototyping and the benefits of hands-on learning. Physical prototypes help designers by providing critical feedback on their designs. Existing literature shows the importance of prototyping in design projects, while some researchers are concerned with the design fixation caused by prototyping. In order to maximize the benefits of prototyping, it is essential to study the design thinking involved in it. This knowledge may help designers, especially novice designers and students in making decisions about which prototyping method to choose. In this study, data are collected from a realistic design project carried out by a team of professional designers. Through interviews with the designers and direct observations on the prototyping and testing cycle, the following hypotheses are investigated: (1) Building and testing prototypes helps to supplement designers' incomplete mental models leading them to better ideas and (2) Prototyping leads designers to design fixation. The results strongly support the hypotheses. Data from the current study is also compared to prior research on semester-long graduate student team projects. This prior research indicates that many unarticulated tests occur when prototypes are built and this leads to a significant number of improvements to the product. Surprisingly, this also occurred with the practicing designers. This demonstrates that the engineering design curriculum may need to adapt to better teach students to take advantage of the unexpected and students must have building skills in order to leverage this advantage. The data also show that building simple physical prototypes frequently in a design project helps to eliminate the shortcomings in initial ideas and lead designers to better ideas. In order to reduce the fixation associated with prototyping, it is essential to minimize the cost (in terms of money, time and effort) associated with prototyping. Due to the need for low sunk cost and opportunities to learn in unexpected ways from prototypes, engineering students need to have proficient building and testing skills so prototypes do not induce fixation due to sunk cost. The professional design team also did things the student design teams did not. The professional team built representational prototypes and those with selected functionalities at times. They also used strategies that likely reduce design fixation including prototyping only parts of the system and systematically used low cost materials like wood and plastic when testing physical interfaces for fit and assembly, not structural capacity.",Viswanathan V.; Atilola O.; Goodman J.; Linsey J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-02-17,The George W.

Improvisation as a tool to develop creativity mini-workshop divergent thinking,"This workshop is meant for all lecturers and researchers of the conference, to experience the benefits of improvisation for themselves or for their students. In educating the inventors of our future, it is important to address creativity as a condition for innovation in Engineering courses of study. Part of the creative potential lies in the ability of divergent thinking. This looking for not yet existing patterns is also one of the characteristics of improvisation. Breaking the routine, staying positive, putting focus on others, staying in the present moment and daring to fail are the basic rules for improvisation, with having fun as a bonus. As Albert Einstein said, no problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it. A disruption in the existing thinking and acting patterns has to be initiated. Giving participants no time to prepare or think things through, in other words giving them the opportunity and obligation to improvise is a mean to cause such a disruption. This way, participants get in the right mood, step out of their comfort zone and focus on the things that are happening in the here-and-now, in essence the right conditions for enhancing divergent thinking. The workshop in improvisation skills lasts 90 minutes and has the following structure: 00.00-00.20 hours: physical and concentration warming up 00.20-00.40 hours: exercises in pairs 00.40-01.10 hours: games 01.10-01.20 hours: cooling down 01.20-01.30 hours: evaluation In all parts of the workshop, people are challenged to solve problems with no more than their imagination. This way, they learn to take initiative, listen carefully, react spontaneously and enjoy making mistakes. The essence of improvisation touches the heart of creativity: acting in the here-and-now, accepting mistakes and learning to look for novel associations. The workshop can serve 30 participants maximum. The workshop leader is a lecturer professional skills who recently started a Ph.D.-research on innovative behavior in higher Engineering education. She teaches improvisation for almost six years now in an Engineering course of study in the Netherlands. She is also the co-author of a book (in press) about improvisation and entrepreneurship. After the workshop, participants will leave in a good mood, while thinking of ways how to stimulate creativity.

From 2D to 3D: Teaching terrain representation in engineering studies through Augmented reality: Comparative versus 3D pdf,"Engineering students have got great skills in the use of new technologies, but large deficiencies in terms of the ability to visualize three-dimensional models shown in two dimensions. Also, the spatial capabilities are critical to them, to achieve the further development and understanding of associated complex, linked contents and competencies. However, it is difficult to illustrate the relationship between the 3D geometry and 2D projection using only drawings on blackboard. A new way to show these concepts is needed. Since Augmented reality (AR) and 3D pdf are the low-cost technologies that could easily display the relationship between two-dimensional displayed representations and the object shown. This paper presents early results conducted through the education innovation project Pol+AR. This project aims to determine the 3D-2D connection, using models, based on AR and 3D pdf, improving the spatial visualisation ability in students, specifically in the study of surveying and its applications, knowledge of the contour lines, earthworks and profiles.

Pre-college (K-12) engineering education: Getting Them Early... and Keeping Them!,"The primary goals of this special session are to assist participants with developing strategies for incorporating an engineering design environment into regular pre-college (K-12 in the US) classroom routines, and to develop an engineering design approach to structuring learning activities. Our core philosophy is that the practice of engineering design reinforces and provides a method for integrating concepts in mathematics and science, thereby introducing, clarifying, and strengthening conceptual knowledge. It also supports a problem-solving orientation in students that encourages creativity and innovation, an approach that is aligned with the strengthening STEAM movement. The inclusion of engineering design activities in the recently adopted Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS US) provides another opportunity to advocate for the adoption of design-focused, project-based curricula that truly integrates learning across STEM, humanities, and social sciences: a curriculum developed through an evidence-based approach firmly grounded in results of K-12 engineering education research. The motivation for this work comes from the need to identify and develop educational environments that encourage persistence in STEM studies from the earliest grades by nurturing key cognitive and non-cognitive factors in addition to the acquisition of subject knowledge. Participants will experience an Engineering Teaching Kit (ETK) from the student's perspective and learn how to use them in their classes in this special session. They will also learn how ETKs are developed, tested, and implemented in middle and elementary schools. Participants will help identify potential topics and areas for future ETKs. Finally, we will explore how an integrative engineering design-focused, project-based pedagogy and curriculum can become a regular component of the school day. All participants will gain access to the on-line resources of our program.",Richards L.; Donohue S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-02-17,University of Virginia,Engineering design process ;  Engineering teaching kits ;  NGSS ;  Persistence ;  Pre-college (K-12) engineering education ;  STEM
An innovation model in curriculum design for teaching engineering at universidad EAFIT,"Constant changes in technology pose continuous challenges for higher education institutions that are training the engineers of the future. These changes are making it necessary to adapt the curriculum in order to develop the skills needed by the XXI century engineer. Moreover, instead of thinking in a large curriculum reform at a specific moment, it is necessary to define curriculum management processes that include change as a natural component of the process. In addition to these global trends, each institution has a particular context and thus, the analysis in each institution has unique characteristics, a common methodological approach, and a reference model that can be built as long as it is flexible enough to include that context. This paper describes a model developed for curriculum management inside the School of Engineering at Universidad EAFIT - Colombia. This model includes the institutional context and is based on a process approach defined by the Business Process Management (BPM) methodology. The model uses the Burlton Hexagon as a theoretical framework to identify organizational structure, strategies, policies, infrastructure, technology tools and human capital. It is also a mechanism for specifying curricular macro processes including the global and institutional context. The proposed model is based on three pillars: (a) scientific research in education, which promotes the use of the scientific method as a strategy to ensure an approach to problems based on evidence which allows the construction of educational innovation projects, (b) education engineering focused on engineering education, which transforms the learning by developing basic, professional, and transversal skills as well as those specific for an engineer of the XXI century, and (c) interactive educational communities, both face to face and virtual, as spaces for knowledge management that support collaborative working and experience-sharing, managed by its members working together promoting initiatives to develop educational innovation projects focused on specific topics, that answer questions related to teaching and learning needs. The formulation and development of educational innovation projects are the responses to different needs identified on specific courses that are transformed into research questions. These projects aim to renew the curriculum so that it dynamically evolves based on classroom experiences. Thus, the curriculum renewal is based on critical thinking about the problems found in engineering education. The use of the scientific method and the collaborative approach enables drawing solid conclusions based on the experimental results. The model proposes the formulation and development of innovative educational projects in which scientific research applied in education aims to transform teaching, academic and administrative practices. As consequence, curricular innovations that integrate learning objects and educational, methodological and assessment strategies, are developed by an interactive learning community composed by teachers. Finally, the results obtained by applying the model in some courses in the School of Engineering of Universidad EAFIT are presented. These results include reducing the drop-out rate of students, redefining admission and graduation profiles, and micro-curricular redesign based on competences using projects, among others.",Zea C.; Rodriguez A.; Bueno N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-02-17,Universidad EAFIT,curriculum development ;  educational innovation projects ;  Engineering education ;  interactive educational communities ;  process management ;  scientific research in education
Comparison of the impact of two research experiences for undergraduate programs on preparing students for global workforces,"The impacts of globalization, changing socio-demographics, and technological advances are uniquely altering the role of engineering in society, identifying significant challenges in the way colleges and universities address the engineering profession, engineering education, and associated engineering student assessment processes and practices. Schools of engineering have been challenged to reconsider how they prepare their graduates to bring high level skills and strategies including team focused innovation, a comprehensive engineering problem-solving approach, cultural competence, globally focused ethics, and leadership to the workplace. Numerous prominent organizations including the National Academy of Engineering, the National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council have charged engineering schools to task on preparing engineers for global workforces. In response, many engineering programs are experimenting with strategies and programs designed to prepare students to solve important engineering problems that stretch far beyond national boundaries geographically, technologically, culturally and socio-politically. Sparse research exists, however, that comprehensively assesses globally focused outcomes associated with such engineering efforts, and the simple question remains: Are international efforts effective? The researchers compare the experiences of students participating in two Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs funded by the National Science Foundation; the NanoJapan International REU Program in Japan and the domestic Rice Quantum Institute (RQT) REU at Rice University. NanoJapan is a twelve-week summer program through which twelve freshman and sophomore physics and engineering students from U.S. universities complete research internships in Japanese nanotechnology laboratories. The RQI is a ten-week undergraduate REU in which sophomore and junior students from U.S. universities complete research in atomic, molecular, optical, surface, materials, chemical and biophysical sciences with faculty at Rice University. The students completed the Engineering Global Preparedness Index (EGPI), a multi-dimensional engineering global preparedness index that measures students' preparedness for global workforces. The four subscales in the EGPI directly align to important 'soft' or professional skills needed by both engineers and other globally prepared professionals. By comparing EGPI results among participants in a domestic and international research experience, the researchers sought to gain insight into what global workforce competencies were developed in an international setting in comparison with the experience of conducting research in a domestic lab setting. Results indicate that the students in the NanoJapan program demonstrated greater increases in engineering global preparedness than the RQI students, and that the RQI students, who did not go abroad, actually declined on most measures of global preparedness at the end of the summer. The researchers posit that this may be attributed to the NanoJapan curriculum that encouraged participants to actively reflect on cultural aspects of research and to the nature of the international experience itself. Moreover, the NanoJapan experience may more closely mirror the typical global workforce/team experience students will encounter after graduation once entering the workforce. The researchers discuss implications for the design of international research and internship experiences.",Ragusa G.; Matherly C.; Phillips S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-02-17,George R.

Using realtime transcription to do member-checking during interviews,"CART (Communication Access Real-Time Translation), a realtime transcription service also known as 'open captioning,' can serve as a time-efficient and cost-effective tool for interviews and member-checks with technologically savvy populations such as those in engineering education research. CART can provide verbatim or near-verbatim full-text captures of even rapid technical conversations. CART professionals are widely available at universities as an accessibility provision for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Several engineering education research pilots indicate that CART can change the researcher/subject dynamic and reduce or eliminate the need for a separate member-check session. This paper explains the procedures and considerations behind employing CART for a qualitative study, including setup details for realtime transcription and the tradeoffs of pursuing such an approach. Following these pragmatic details, we investigate the implications of this technique on researcher/subject positionality and the role of transcription in research methodology. We also introduce the idea of 'grounded indigenous coding' as a methodological innovation, whereby realtime transcription enables participants to reflect on the words they have just spoken ('indigenous coding') while remaining grounded in the verbatim precision of a transcript.",Chua M.; Adams R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-02-17,College of Engineering,Accessibility ;  Grounded indigenous coding ;  Member checks ;  Qualitative methods ;  Transcription
Bridging gaps in engineering education: Design thinking a critical factor for project based learning,"Design thinking plays a critical role in educating a new class of engineers who can create a better society by innovating products & services that solve real world problems. Field research including interviews with several key academicians and technocrats reveal several short comings amongst engineering graduates in India. Addressing the above concerns and building upon literature, a framework is proposed for a recently established engineering institute in India. This framework is applied to structure the curriculum for Bachelors of Technology in Information Communication and Technology (B Tech-ICT). This framework integrates design thinking as a core subject in the 1st year via project based engineering and promotes new product development. This paper describes an innovative curriculum structured to teach design (User centered design UCD1 & 2) as a core course to 1st year B Tech-ICT students. A comparative study of student performance between two semesters indicates an improvement in problem identification, design research and new product development skills. Anonymous student feedback from students for the design courses supports the above finding. The paper discusses the success and challenges of introducing design education to engineering students and identifies social barriers restricting innovative thinking. This paper provided building blocks for educators to teach design thinking for inculcating innovative thinking in engineering students.",Parmar A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-02-17,Ahmedabad University;Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,Design thinking ;  Engineering education ;  India ;  Innovation ;  Project based learning
A higher education social network to share and promote teaching innovation experiences,"This paper presents a social network specializing in higher education teaching innovation, InEdUn (Innovación Educativa Universitaria, http://inedun.campusandaluzvirtual.es). InEdUn is the result of two inter-university teaching innovation projects (TIPs). InEdUn site allows faculty to spread and share achievements emerging from TIPs such as Open Educational Resources, OER; teaching and learning experiences in engineering; new supporting services to improve learning. Furthermore, it provides the creation of learning communities that foster collaboration and exchange of ideas among higher education faculty members. Both services can be integrated into existing web sites such as higher education teaching innovation portals. The website not only encourages contact between active innovation researchers to promote the creation of inter-university projects, but also incorporates valuable design features such as: federated login for using same login credentials from Higher Education Institutions or Research Centres, web searching and navigation facilities to locate contents, a recommendation system, sharing TIPs or collaboration proposals on social networks, adding comments about projects or collaboration proposals by the innovation community. At the present moment, the project has received positive comments and reviews, and we will continue previous plans to spread the system among several Andalusian Higher Education Institutions.",Cabrera L.; Almagro J.; Ruano I.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-02-17,Universidad de Jaén,Collaborative Network ;  Cross-Campus Faculty Collaboration ;  Higher Education ;  Teaching Innovation Projects
Integrated educational research and technical experiences to draw females students into the energy systems area: The UPRM experience,"Traditionally, the energy systems area, or any science, technology, engineering, and/or mathematics (STEM) area, in general, has been male- dominated. Because of this, women in these fields have had a tendency to stand down when it comes to aiding in innovation and practicing a profession within specific fields, such as energy systems. To counteract this effect, research and educational activities have been designed at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus (UPRM) to create an enriching, hands-on-experience in energy systems for current and future female undergraduates. This paper describes how the department of electrical and computer engineering has developed educational strategies to increase the female participation in the energy systems area at UPRM. Some of these strategies include: a) Deliver hands on experience to prospect high school and freshmen college students, with special emphasis on female participants b) Enhance teamwork skills in project development and interdisciplinary work c) Create lasting interest in the study and design of energy systems. Activities based on these strategies range from building simple photovoltaic arrangements and small induction motors, to computer programming. The strategies presented in this paper have already been integrated with the mechanical, and the electrical and computer engineering class curriculums. They are aimed at creating awareness of the vast fields in the energy systems area with the intention of making females students take the initiative of developing themselves as professionals in these fields.",Vazquez L.; Rodriguez V.; Feliciano-Cruz L.; Rivera L.; Del Valle Morales A.; Ortiz-Rivera E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015-02-17,Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez,Energy systems ;  Engineering education ;  Females
Might young makers be the engineers of the future?,"Engineers participate in the Maker movement. Some Makers do not pursue formal engineering education but both the engineering field and their own vocational advancement could readily benefit. We seek to understand Young Makers in K-12 and how might their knowledge, skills, and attitudes prepare them to pursue advanced STEM education and careers. From the Engineer of 2020 list of characteristics we highlight practical ingenuity, creativity and lifelong learning for likely opportunities to leverage the Maker experience. The mission of this research is to develop a theory, inductively grounded in data and deductively built on literature, illuminating the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of Young Makers related to pathways forward to engineering and STEM-related majors and careers. By describing their pathways to or around formal engineering education will better inform future innovations in order to improve the practical ingenuity and lifelong learning of our future engineers. Artifact elicitation interviews, based on the method of photo elicitation and critical incident technique interviews will be administered to participants. Results from the inductive and deductive analyses will be triangulated to generate a preliminary theory of Young Maker knowledge, skills, attitudes, and pathways. This theory, inductively grounded in data and deductively connected to literature, will describe aspects of Young Makers, along with how their pathways forward may intersect with engineering and STEM-related majors and careers.

Characterizing engineering innovativeness through a modified Delphi Study,"There is a growing interest in understanding innovative behavior in engineers. However, there are a limited number of empirical studies that describe innovative characteristics that are unique to engineers. In this research we are conducting a modified Delphi Study to examine the complex constructs associated with engineering innovativeness. The first round survey was developed based on data from a prior qualitative study. The participants in our Delphi study were a group of 102 recognized engineering innovators averaging over 25 years' experience and drawn from academic, corporate, and entrepreneurial organizations. At the conclusion of the Delphi Study, participants will have completed three anonymous rounds of online surveys asking them to clarify and rank order characteristics of innovative engineers by phases of the innovation process. This paper discusses our methodology, initial round one Delphi Study results and the next steps in our research, which include the second and third round surveys.

The environmental impact of technology innovation on WEEE management by Multi-Life Cycle Assessment,"Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) technology innovation is strongly related to Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) management strategies. It does not only effect the amount and speed of WEEE generation through products replacement, but it also exerts overall long-term impacts on the environmental performance of EEE system. Therefore, those impacts should be evaluated quantitatively. A concept framework is developed and applied in the case study of display product technology innovation, and a Multi-Life Cycle Assessment method is proposed to evaluate the environmental impacts of technology innovation on multi-generation systems. The study concludes that constant EEE technology innovation along with frequent product replacement may lead to acute fluctuations of WEEE generation and significant multi-generation products system environmental impacts. Hence, the product-oriented environmental policies, including waste management policies, should take technology innovation into consideration.",Lu B.; Liu J.; Yang J.; Li B.,Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2015-02-15,Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences Chinese Academy of Sciences,Assessment ;  Cycle ;  Multi-Life ;  Products replacement ;  Technology innovation ;  WEEE
Chemical fabrication and electrochemical characterization of graphene nanosheets using a lithium battery platform,"Graphene has opened up new opportunities for scientific and technological innovations because of its astonishing electrical, mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. For instance, graphene-based nanocomposites have found extensive applications in Li-ion batteries (LIBs) as scientists and engineers seek to achieve superior electrochemical performances. The laboratory module reported herein includes both chemical fabrication and electrochemical characterizations of graphene nanosheets (GNSs). The GNS powders are fabricated through the chemical exfoliation of graphite, and the resulting morphological and structural changes are evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Li storage electrochemical characteristics of GNSs are then assessed via galvanostatic chronopotentiometry and compared with that of graphite, a commonly used anode material in LIBs. This novel laboratory module, suitable for a wide range of students with a general chemistry background, has been successfully implemented in a multidisciplinary laboratory and lecture course entitled Experimental Nanomaterials and Nanoscience.

An index-based model for management of the technology projects (The case of engineering education),"With growing concerns, advances and innovations in Information Technology, the demand for research developing innovative tools for management of technology integration in colleges of engineering has grown. The process of technology integration cannot be achieved through the provision of hardware and software alone; rather, the issue is more complex and requires the provision of tools and methods that enable the efficient management of available resources to achieve strategic goals. This paper attempts to develop an Index-Based Model for Technology Management as a tool to assist the top management of colleges of engineering in all stages of planning, implementation, and evaluation for educational technology projects. The aforementioned index is based on 16 Key Success Factors (KSFs) for technology management, which are obtained through an extensive literature review and case studies validated through samples from expert faculty members in the field of educational management within the Faculty of Environmental Design (FED)-King Abdulaziz University (KAU)-Saudi Arabia. The data for the KSFs were obtained and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Ultimately, the index is obtained, and, with the index the linear regression model is found to be significant in predicting the performance levels of the project.",Maatouk M.,Journal,Journal of Engineering and Applied Science,2015-02-01,Faculty of Engineering,Engineering education ;  Project management ;  Technology management
Transdisciplinary technological futures: An ethnographic research dialogue between social scientists and engineers,"This paper suggests that transdisciplinarity is rising as a powerful epistemic strategy for research in technology-related fields such as engineering. Though this topic has been approached from a philosophical perspective, we know little about the actual shape that transdisciplinarity might take in research and action. How is transdisciplinarity operationalized in research and professional practice? As a case study, we report an assessment study of communication modes and content used by engineering students in a special project-course, Robotics for Theater, focused on the planning and construction of a robot from scratch, to support theatric production as actor and prop. Our assessment tools were based on ethnographic research and included questionnaires, journals, and students' expressions of their views on the communication and learning processes. Analysis of the case study of the Robotics for Theater project revealed that: 1. Resource mobilization was fostered by the role of the advisor as information facilitator and ""weak tie"" in the network, and also by the frequent informal contacts among the students in the team. 2. Innovation was fostered by intra-team trust. The strong friendship and teaming experience of the group were critical for effective team dynamics. 3. Probably due to time constraints, the field of theater did not become a fundamental reference of the project, contrary to plans. 4. Time constraints and technical difficulties in implementation inhibited progress. 5. Informal meetings were crucial in the progression of design and implementation.",del Cerro Santamaría G.,Journal,Technology in Society,2015-02-01,Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art,Engineers ;  Ethnography ;  Social scientists ;  Technological futures ;  Transdisciplinarity
Markets versus spillovers in outflows of university research,"A substantial body of research has examined the contributions of university research to regional economic development and technological innovation. This literature suggests that the channels through which university-based research affects regional economic or innovative activity may be divided into two broad categories - knowledge ""spillovers"" (i.e., positive externalities from university research) and ""market-mediated"" channels such as technology licensing or various types of employment relationships between academic scientists and firms. Yet little research has compared the geographic incidence of these market and nonmarket channels of interaction. This paper compares the localization of knowledge flows from university inventions through market contracts (licenses) and nonmarket ""spillovers"" exemplified by patent citations. We find knowledge flows through market transactions to be more geographically localized than those operating through nonmarket spillovers. Moreover, the differential effects of distance on licenses and citations are most pronounced for exclusively licensed university patents. We interpret these findings as reflecting the incomplete nature of licensing contracts and the need for licensees to maintain access to inventor knowhow for many university inventions. Such access appears to be less important for inventions that are nonexclusively licensed.",Mowery D.; Ziedonis A.,Journal,Research Policy,2015-02-01,Stanford Engineering;Haas School of Business;National Bureau of Economic Research,Geographic localization ;  Knowledge spillovers ;  Licensing ;  University-industry linkages

Virtual anthropology,"Comparative morphology, dealing with the diversity of form and shape, and functional morphology, the study of the relationship between the structure and the function of an organism's parts, are both important subdisciplines in biological research. Virtual anthropology (VA) contributes to comparative morphology by taking advantage of technological innovations, and it also offers new opportunities for functional analyses. It exploits digital technologies and pools experts from different domains such as anthropology, primatology, medicine, paleontology, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and engineering. VA as a technical term was coined in the late 1990s from the perspective of anthropologists with the intent of being mostly applied to biological questions concerning recent and fossil hominoids. More generally, however, there are advanced methods to study shape and size or to manipulate data digitally suitable for application to all kinds of primates, mammals, other vertebrates, and invertebrates or to issues regarding plants, tools, or other objects. In this sense, we could also call the field ""virtual morphology."" The approach yields permanently available virtual copies of specimens and data that comprehensively quantify geometry, including previously neglected anatomical regions. It applies advanced statistical methods, supports the reconstruction of specimens based on reproducible manipulations, and promotes the acquisition of larger samples by data sharing via electronic archives. Finally, it can help identify new, hidden traits, which is particularly important in paleoanthropology, where the scarcity of material demands extracting information from fragmentary remains. This contribution presents a current view of the six main work steps of VA: digitize, expose, compare, reconstruct, materialize, and share. The VA machinery has also been successfully used in biomechanical studies which simulate the stress and strains appearing in structures. Although methodological issues remain to be solved before results from the two domains can be fully integrated, the various overlaps and cross-fertilizations suggest the widespread appearance of a ""virtual functional morphology"" in the near future.",Webere G.,Journal,American Journal of Physical Anthropology,2015-02-01,Universität Wien,Biomechanics ;  Comparative morphology ;  Functional morphology ;  Geometric morphometrics ;  Human evolution ;  Shape and form analysis ;  Virtual anthropology ;  Virtual morphology
The impact of foreign-born scientists and engineers on American nanoscience research,"This paper assesses the contribution of foreign-born scientists and engineers to nanoscience innovation. While studies have assessed immigrants' general contributions to American science and engineering, less is known about their presence within emergent, cutting-edge, and multidisciplinary fields. Multiple sources are utilized to determine the nativity of researchers within nanotechnology, a platform technology with important implications for economic growth, industrial competitiveness, and numerous fields of scientific research. Specifically, it examines the authors of the most highly-cited articles published in the period 1999-2009. Based on comparisons with the prevalence of foreign-born in the scientific and engineering community and general population, the study's findings reveal that researchers were disproportionally foreign-born, a trend that has grown over time. Additionally, although over-represented among high-impact researchers, there were no significant differences between the institutional locations (academia versus industry) and research activities (productivity and patterns of collaboration) of foreign and native scientists and engineers.",Walsh J.,Journal,Science and Public Policy,2015-02-01,University of Pennsylvania,Globalization ;  Immigration ;  Innovation ;  Nanoscience and nanotechnology ;  Science and engineering
Analyzing the blood-brain barrier: The benefits of medical imaging in research and clinical practice,"A dysfunctional BBB is a common feature in a variety of brain disorders, a fact stressing the need for diagnostic tools designed to assess brain vessels' permeability in space and time. Biological research has benefited over the years various means to analyze BBB integrity. The use of biomarkers for improper BBB functionality is abundant. Systemic administration of BBB impermeable tracers can both visualize brain regions characterized by BBB impairment, as well as lead to its quantification. Additionally, locating molecular, physiological content in regions from which it is restricted under normal BBB functionality undoubtedly indicates brain pathology-related BBB disruption. However, in-depth research into the BBB's phenotype demands higher analytical complexity than functional vs. pathological BBB; criteria which biomarker based BBB permeability analyses do not meet. The involvement of accurate and engineering sciences in recent brain research, has led to improvements in the field, in the form of more accurate, sensitive imaging-based methods. Improvements in the spatiotemporal resolution of many imaging modalities and in image processing techniques, make up for the inadequacies of biomarker based analyses. In pre-clinical research, imaging approaches involving invasive procedures, enable microscopic evaluation of BBB integrity, and benefit high levels of sensitivity and accuracy. However, invasive techniques may alter normal physiological function, thus generating a modality-based impact on vessel's permeability, which needs to be corrected for. Non-invasive approaches do not affect proper functionality of the inspected system, but lack in spatiotemporal resolution. Nevertheless, the benefit of medical imaging, even in pre-clinical phases, outweighs its disadvantages. The innovations in pre-clinical imaging and the development of novel processing techniques, have led to their implementation in clinical use as well. Specialized analyses of vessels' permeability add valuable information to standard anatomical inspections which do not take the latter into consideration.",Chassidim Y.; Vazana U.; Prager O.; Veksler R.; Bar-Klein G.; Schoknecht K.; Fassler M.; Lublinsky S.; Shelef I.,Journal,Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology,2015-02-01,Soroka University Medical Center;Ben-Gurion University of the Negev;Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin,Biomarkers ;  Blood-brain barrier ;  Clinical imaging modalities ;  Invasive/non-invasive pre-clinical imaging modalities
Rare earth optimal depletion path with the uncertainty of technical innovation,"Both the technical innovations of application and alternative and their uncertainty emerge in rare earth industry. Given the fact that both the technology progress and their uncertainty affect the demand of rare earth, we established the optimal depletion model to investigate the impacts of uncertainty of technical innovation on the optimal exhaustion path (including extraction quantity and depletion time). We find that the uncertainty of application technology and alternative technology progress function in different ways. The higher the possibility of the application technology progress is, the fewer the exploitation quantity of rare earth in pre-exploitation phase, and the more the quantity in later phase. The higher possibility of application innovation tends to lengthen the depletion time of rare earth resources as a whole. The higher the probability of the alternative technology is, the more the quantity of rare earth in pre-exploitation phase, and the fewer the exploitation in later phase. The uncertainty of substitution technology innovation tends to shorten the depletion time as a whole. The policy implications are as follows. Under the condition of uncertainty, the optimal depletion rate of rare earth depends on the relative magnitude of the possibility of application and alternative technology innovation. When the substitution technology is more likely to occur, we are supposed to shorten the depletion time to maximize the economic value of rare earth. For the sake of the resource endowment of rare earth in China, we suggest that we take measures to enhance the possibility of the application technology innovation. The optimal extraction rate of heavy rare earth is supposed to be higher than the light rare earth due to the different original reserve.",Du F.; Gao Z.; Wang Y.; Yu J.,Journal,Chinese Rare Earths,2015-02-01,Inner Mongolia University China,depletion path ;  Optimal ;  Rare earth ;  Technology innovation of application ;  Technology innovation of substitution ;  Uncertainty

Getting the right balance: University networks' influence on spin-offs' attraction of funding for innovation,"Little research has been done on how the relationships of academic spin-off firms with their parent university influence their ability to attract funding for innovation activities. University is undoubtedly important for young spin-offs, not only because it provides knowledge and research facilities, but also because it enables access to financial capital. We drew on a sample of 100 firms in clarifying whether and how the relationship with the university increases the ability of the spin-offs in attracting funding for research and development and to what extent this depends on different network characteristics, such as size, density, strength of ties, and multiplexity. In this study we adopted the model of curvelinearity, derived from ideas on increasing and decreasing returns. We found that all four university network characteristics have a positive relationship with the spin-offs' ability to attract funding. Interestingly, diminishing returns were only identified when it comes to strength of ties and network multiplexity. Accordingly, a relationship tended to be beneficial as long as it was not too strong or too complex. Moreover, the ability to acquire funding tended to increase if the spin-offs develop a well-connected network of university and non-university contacts.

Detection of paradigm shifts and emerging fields using scientific network: A case study of Information Technology for Engineering,"Detection of emerging fields in any industry is of great importance to the industrialists, engineers and policy makers of business as well as state administration. Exact awareness of the paradigm which governs current research activities and chances of likely paradigm shifts which could redefine the research approaches, is very crucial for the actors of scientific community and policy makers. Excellent technologies in IT, even accelerated the scientific and applied ontological pursuit in both academia as well as industry. In this work, network approach is advocated for the identification of innovations, new paradigms and emerging fields in the IT industry in the research area 'engineering'. The network is a scientific network of research publications which reflects the volume and flow of scientific activities. Centrality analysis, path analysis, cluster analysis, etc. are used to identify the key papers of paradigm shifts, emerging fields, relatively important clusters and works respectively. A new metric, flow vergence index is devised for cluster analysis. The paradigm shift identified from this network is RFID technology, related with the supply chain management. With proper economic and policy supports, there are some good reasons to look forward for more wonders from the industry.",Prabhakaran T.; Lathabai H.; Changat M.,Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2015-02-01,University of Kerala,Centrality measures ;  Citation networks ;  Clustering ;  Engineering industry ;  Flow vergence model ;  Information technology ;  Innovations ;  Paradigms ;  Path analysis
Shale gas technology innovation rate impact on economic Base Case - Scenario model benchmarks,"Low gas wellhead prices in North America have put its shale gas industry under high competitive pressure. Rapid technology innovation can help companies to improve the economic performance of shale gas fields. Cash flow models are paramount for setting effective production and technology innovation targets to achieve positive returns on investment in all global shale gas plays. Future cash flow of a well (or cluster of wells) may either improve further or deteriorate, depending on: (1) the regional volatility in gas prices at the wellhead - which must pay for the gas resource extraction, and (2) the cost and effectiveness of the well technology used. Gas price is an externality and cannot be controlled by individual companies, but well technology cost can be reduced while improving production output. We assume two plausible scenarios for well technology innovation and model the return on investment while checking against sensitivity to gas price volatility. It appears well technology innovation - if paced fast enough - can fully redeem the negative impact of gas price decline on shale well profits, and the required rates are quantified in our sensitivity analysis.",Weijermars R.,Journal,Applied Energy,2015-02-01,"College of Engineering;Department of Geoscience & Engineering, TU Delft;Alboran Energy Strategy Consultants",Cash flow ;  Economic gap ;  Shale gas ;  Technology factor ;  Technology innovation
"Recruitment, knowledge integration and modes of innovation","This paper investigates how the strength and intrinsic characteristics of firms' knowledge bases and processing routines have evolved with the past inflow of employees. The empirical analysis is based on linked public register and innovation survey data for Norway. It finds that recruitment from universities, research institutes and higher education institutions has increased the capacity of firms to generate technical inventions. Yet, the organizational knowledge bases and processing routines on which commercial innovation output depends have been strengthened only by the recruitment that has occurred from related industries. Implications for research, management and policy are drawn.",Herstad S.; Sandven T.; Ebersberger B.,Journal,Research Policy,2015-02-01,Universitetet i Agder;Technische Universität Berlin;MCI - The Entrepreneurial School;Research and Education,Innovation output ;  Knowledge integration ;  Labor mobility ;  Modes of innovation ;  Norway ;  Patenting
The Walkshop Approach to Science and Technology Ethics,"In research and teaching on ethical aspects of emerging sciences and technologies, the structure of working environments, spaces and relationships play a significant role. Many of the routines and standard practices of academic life, however, do little to actively explore and experiment with these elements. They do even less to address the importance of contextual and embodied dimensions of thinking. To engage these dimensions, we have benefitted significantly from practices that take us out of seminar rooms, offices and laboratories as well as beyond traditional ways of working and interacting. We have called one such practice the ‘walkshop’. Through walkshops, we have spent several days walking together with our colleagues and students in open outdoor spaces, keeping a sustained intellectual discussion on ethical aspects of science, technology and innovation while moving through these landscapes. For us, this has generated useful opportunities to escape established hierarchies, roles and patterns of thought and to rethink conceptual and philosophical issues from new perspectives, under new attitudes and with renewed energy. In this paper we wish to highlight the potential benefits of the walkshop approach by sharing some of our experiences and describing how we have prepared for and carried out these events. We share this information in the hope that we may encourage others to both experiment with the walkshop approach and exchange information on their own innovative processes for research and teaching in science and engineering ethics.",Wickson F.; Strand R.; Kjølberg K.,Journal,Science and Engineering Ethics,2015-02-01,Universitetet i Bergen;GenØk Centre for Biosafety,Environment ;  Ethics ;  Responsible innovation ;  Science ;  Technology ;  Walkshop
A model to integrate concepts of project management with innovation and knowledge management,"In this chapter, the main objective is to show the reader the interaction between the innovation process and the project management process. In today's world, the great concern of large companies takes place in the process of ensuring that the knowledge gained remains within company boundaries. In this chapter, the authors show how a proposed model retains the knowledge gained during the project management process and company investments through innovation and the use of lessons learned methodologies. In addition, the reader has the opportunity to see the evaluation of the process of emerging technologies against the paper of the strategic planning process through the well-aligned process of knowledge management within the companies. The chapter is divided into three major sections: the first presents the main concepts in project management and also in innovation and technology.

Harnessing knowledge integration in is design for innovation facilitation,"This chapter examines from a Knowledge Integration (KI) perspective the innovation potential that resides in KI for the generation of Information System (IS) based on organizational innovation. The chapter does this by examining methodologically the process of Requirements Engineering (RE) as a research topic and uses for this purpose a mixed-method approach including literature review, participant observation, and recourse to secondary research. The chapter first outlines the emergence of KI as research topic in its own right before the emergence of IS as innovation in organizations is described. The chapter then examines the innovation inhibitors to KI as proxy for innovation generation. It argues in the conclusion that taking RE for IS premises and research methods employed in relation to research into KI might be guided by rationalistic efficiency-driven conceptions, while KI as research agenda seems to be premised on a notion of effectiveness.",Krone O.,Book,Handbook of Research on Effective Project Management through the Integration of Knowledge and Innovation,2015-01-31,IT Consulting Private Corporation,

"Advanced Oxidation Processes, Nanofiltration, and Application of Bubble Column Reactor","The burgeoning world population with growing industrial and manufacturing demands has led to a difficult and challenging situation where protection of the environment has become of major concern, a critical issue and a crucial factor for several industrial processes that will have to meet the requirements for the sustainable development of modern, progressive society and a resurgent nation. In order to correlate industrial activities with preservation of the environment (sustainable development), there is a tendency in most countries to adapt rigid and rigorous environmental legislation where well-known green technology plays a key role. In this context, chemical processes employing the best available technology (BAT), not entailing excessive costs, and aspiring to superior performance without considerable environmental impact are preferred over classical processes. Challenges, hurdles, and efforts presented by the scientific community and scientific fraternity in recent times for the development of green technology are presented and deliberated in detail. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are described too, with importance being given to ozonation and AOP applications. The visionary applications of nanofiltration (NF) are also discussed in detail. The fundamental as well as applied aspects relating to ozone science and technology are presented. Ozone science is a vast area of scientific enquiry and scientific rigor that is straddling one frontier after another. Our primary objective is to present the vast unexplored area of ozonation, other AOPs, and membrane separation processes in lucid detail. The applications of a bubble column reactor in environmental engineering and the environmental sciences based on the excellent heat and mass transfer properties of a bubble column are discussed. However, scientists face research challenges in the application of bubble column reactors. One vision is unfolding with another vision as research progresses in this area. Our study has been undertaken with rigorous scientific endeavor, and this will open up doors of innovation in the years to come.",Palit S.,Book,Nanomaterials for Environmental Protection,2015-01-27,University of Petroleum and Energy Studies,Advanced ;  Bubble ;  Nanofiltration ;  Nanotechnology ;  Water
Extended abstract: Comparing cultural models in the context of teaching global software engineering,"The rise of globalization has driven new challenges to software engineering education. The industry scene today involves international acquisitions, project offshoring, and strategic alliances, which create the need for globally oriented students who can understand and function within the new business paradigm. This, subsequently, has brought about a burgeoning interest in cross-cultural research in global software engineering (GSW) education. Recent research points out that today's web-enabled platforms have eliminated geographical borders allowing the world to collaborate in multiple domains including education, research and development, innovation, production among others. In this context, research on cross-cultural dimensions is rapidly gaining momentum. Recently, GSW courses are being introduced at academic institutes as part of computer science and software engineering degree requirements. Collaborative GSW courses are mainly concerned with studying methodologies, tools, infrastructures, and other factors that influence distributed software development by culturally diverse teams. Cultural issues are among the factors that may affect the outcomes of GSW courses. Influences could be in productivity, trust, communication methods, and leadership of distributed teams. In the past 30 years, a considerable amount of literature has examined the definition and characteristics of culture, mostly from a person-task perspective, which is the extent to which cultures focus on human interaction as opposed to tasks to accomplish. The most referenced research of all literature on cultural dimensions in the context of GSW is that of Greet Hofstede, Project GLOBE, Trompenaars and Hampdeen-Turner, and Hall. Hofstede identified six major dimensions on which cultures may vary. Project GLOBE extended Hofstede's work to examine universally endorsed, universally unendorsed, and culturally contingent behaviours across the different cultures. Both studies are considered landmarks in cross-cultural research because they have taken cross-cultural research to an advanced level by exploring cultures that were never considered in the previously American-dominated literature of cultural research. However, more efforts are needed to identify drivers of productivity in culturally diverse teams within context-specific settings. This paper attempts to identify contextual factors that support or inhibit productivity within distributed teams, especially those located in regions that are under-researched, like the Middle East.",Zeid A.; El-Bahey R.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Professional Communication Conference,2015-01-23,American University of Kuwait,Cultural dimensions ;  global software development ;  software engineering education
Texts as tools to support innovation: Using the Business Model Canvas to teach engineering entrepreneurs about audiences,"According to activity theory research, texts have the ability to act as tools that mediate classroom activities. In order to understand the teaching potential of one such text, the Business Model Canvas, we explore how the canvas operates in an entrepreneurship classroom. In doing so, we draw on the activity theory literature and data from an entrepreneurship education case study. The case study followed a course offered primarily to upper-level and graduate engineering students and includes observation, reflection, and autoethnographic data regarding how students and instructors used the canvas. The findings explore the ways in which the canvas, as a mediating textual artifact, served to anchor the students' work in the needs of their audiences, consistently bringing them back not only to questions of who the users of their products will be and what those users want, but to questions about who they need to pitch their product ideas to and how the data they gather can support that pitch. At the same time, the findings illuminate the limitations of the visual/textual tool, and consider what is left out of the canvas and how those omissions might also shape students' work.",Hixson C.; Paretti M.,Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Professional Communication Conference,2015-01-23,Virginia Tech College of Engineering,Activity theory ;  audiences ;  Business Model Canvas ;  engineering ;  entrepreneurship
On the economic impact of university proof of concept centers,"University proof of concept centers (PoCCs) are an organizational innovation intended to improve the dissemination and commercialization of new knowledge. During the past 15 years, at least 32 university-affiliated PoCCs have been established at universities within the United States. Despite this recent growth, little systematic empirical research exists relating to the organization or impact of PoCCs. Analyzing data published by the Association of University Technology Managers, we find that universities affiliated with a PoCC enjoy a positive and statistically significant increase in the number of spinoffs established each year after adoption. While additional research is needed, our findings are consistent with the presumption that PoCCs may offer a promising new tool for regional and national economic development.",Hayter C.; Link A.,Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2015-01-20,The University of North Carolina at Greensboro;Arizona State University Downtown Phoenix Campus,Entrepreneurship ;  Proof of concept center ;  Startups ;  Technology ;  University technology transfer
Leaping development of Beijing pharmaceutical industry: Problems and countermeasures,"BACKGROUND: The biomedical industry is recognized as one of the international high-tech industries with the most development prospects in the 21st century, is also one of the world’s sunrise industries with fastest trade growth. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the development of Beijing biomedical industry and to briefly state the problems and countermeasures in the leaping development of Beijing pharmaceutical industry. METHODS: A computer-based search of Baidu Library and CNKI as well as manual retrieval of school library was done for literatures published from 2005 to 2014. Then, we analyzed the developmental status and existing problems of Beijing pharmaceutical industry, based on which, the guiding significance and conclusion on the leaping development of Beijing pharmaceutical industry was given. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In recent years, Beijing biomedical industry has developed rapidly and obtained good achievements, but there are still problems in the implementation of the leapfrog development, such as poor industrial base, no innovative subject, and lack of funds. To solve these problems, we propose five countermeasures, that is, to constantly optimize and readjust the industrial structure, to further optimize the ownership structure, to enhance technological innovation, to build business-oriented research & development system, and to implement brand extension strategy, based on which, Beijing biomedical industry can realize the leapfrog development from strategic industry to leading industry, and become the world’s major research & development center, high-end manufacturing base and market center.",Kong Y.; Sun L.,Journal,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,2015-01-15,Shenyang Pharmaceutical University,Biopharmaceutics ;  Tissue engineering
BareBone cloud IaaS: Revitalization disruptive technology,"With today's Internet of Hype-Things, technology innovation is no longer a strategic weapon to gain competitiveness or even sustainability at SME. Legacy frameworks are biased towards larger computing during happy day environment. This paper presents a new framework for SME to embrace IaaS with confidence to move up the value chain despite facing volatile economic turbulence. While disruptive BareBone cloud technology maybe inferior to large enterprises, holds potential opportunities to the smaller enterprise where base cost does matter. The use of three instruments (mass survey, interview and focus group) for collecting primary data has ensured consistent information validation. The findings from the directional correlation hypothesis affirm the negative correlation between infancy stage of technology innovation and the measurable organizational values expected by the small enterprise.

Adopting IS process innovations in organizations: The role of IS leaders' individual factors and technology perceptions in decision making,"While there is a rich body of literature on information system (IS) innovations, there is a limited understanding of the role IS leaders' individual factors and their appraisals of technological factors play in organizations' adoption of IS innovations. We address these gaps in the IS literature by focusing on an IS process innovation-namely, computer-aided software engineering (CASE)-which is targeted at the core activities of systems development/maintenance in IS departments. We specifically examine how organizations' CASE adoption decision is impacted by (1) two individual factors of IS leaders (i.e., leaders' hierarchical position and job tenure) and (2) their perceptions of technological factors (i.e., relative advantage and technological complexity of CASE). Data were gathered from IS leaders at 350 organizations in the United States using a national cross-sectional survey. The findings suggest that IS leaders' hierarchical position and their job tenure significantly differentiate CASE adopters from non-adopters. IS leaders at lower levels of the organizational hierarchy and with shorter job tenure made the adoption decisions in adopter organizations, while IS leaders at higher levels of the organizational hierarchy and with longer job tenure made the adoption decisions in non-adopter organizations. The findings also reveal that relative advantage has two dimensions-namely, perceived efficacy advantage and perceived efficiency advantage-and IS leaders' evaluation of the perceived efficacy advantage of CASE differentiates adopters from non-adopters. The study has important implications for our theoretical and practical understanding of the factors related to IS leaders that are influential in the organizational adoption of IS innovations.",Sharma S.; Rai A.,Journal,European Journal of Information Systems,2015-01-10,Indian Institute of Management Kashipur;J.

Highly Selective Lignite Mining and Supply,"Lignite is still the most important source of energy in Germany. In 2012, a total of 185.4 million tons of lignite was mined here. In addition to electricity generation and district heating, processed products such as briquettes, dust and coke are also produced. Besides this, a very small amount of lignite (~1% of the lignite mined worldwide) is used for non-energetic utilisation. In central Germany, the ibi alliance was formed to further promote this particular sector. The aim is to use lignite as a source of hydrocarbons by further developing technology, plants and processes. An alternative method of producing basic chemical products would reduce Germany’s dependence on oil and natural gas imports. The successful implementation of this goal requires not only the development of chemical processes but also a secure supply of lignite. Since deposit conditions in Germany will become more and more challenging (in deposit depth, seam splitting and - dips), more well developed extraction and conveyance techniques as well as mining technology will become preconditions if deposits are to be mined sustainably and economically. It is this issue that the companies MIBRAG, FAM, TAKRAF, ABB and Freiberg University of Mining and Technology are addressing in one of a total of five joint research projects within the ibi alliance. MIBRAG’s involvement includes the conception of mining technology where the selective extraction of different coal qualities plays a key role. Typical deposit data were defined and then used to formulate the specific technical requirements in terms of mechanical engineering. In most cases, the use of large machinery is favoured when planning mining operations. The research focuses on compact bucket wheel excavators that allow improved handling of biaxial inclination (up to 10%) as well as greater mobility. On the stopes and at the border slope system, continuous conveyor systems are considered for the transportation of overburden and coal. Due to the depth of the deposit, more challenging requirements have to be set for the conveyer system along the border slope system. Moveable transfer systems are to replace the conventional central, stationary mass distributors. Since the intention is to use the conveyer system in the border slope system to transport several qualities of coal before then transferring them to 2 main conveyer belts leading towards the coal pile, another crucial focus of the joint research project is on material tracking, controlling the conveyer routes (including for overburden) and stockpiling. Further research activities are focusing on the identification of mayor geological layers which shall be done during the mining process on the excavator. The main focus here is on contactless systems. Online raw material analysis can be used to write the data back directly into the deposit model. These innovations in the fields of engineering and sensor technology allow modified mining technologies. Furthermore it opens up the potential for significant improvements by mining geologically challenging deposits. In the ibi process, research is currently focused on lignite products only. Additional focus on “overburden products” in the future will make it possible to carry out accepted, resource-efficient and sustainable surface mining operations.",Schultze S.; König M.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Production Engineering,2015-01-01,MIBRAG mbH;MIBRAG mbH,Biaxial Inclination ;  Coal Quality ;  Coal Seam ;  Joint Research Project ;  Mining Machine

"Science, Philosophy and Sustainability: The End of the Cartesian dream","For science to remain a legitimate and trustworthy source of knowledge, society will have to engage in the collective processes of knowledge co-production, which not only includes science, but also other types of knowledge. This process of change has to include a new commitment to knowledge creation and transmission and its role in a plural society. This book proposes to consider new ways in which science can be used to sustain our planet and enrich our lives. It helps to release and reactivate social responsibility within contemporary science and technology. It reviews critically relevant cases of contemporary scientific practice within the Cartesian paradigm, relabelled as 'innovation research', promoted as essential for the progress and well-being of humanity, and characterised by high capital investment, centralised control of funding and quality, exclusive expertise, and a reductionism that is philosophical as well as methodological. This is an accessible and relevant book for scholars in Science and Technology Studies, History and Philosophy of Science, and Science, Engineering and Technology Ethics. Providing an array of concrete examples, it supports scientists, engineers and technical experts, as well as policy-makers and other non-technical professionals working with science and technology to re-direct their approach to global problems, in a more integrative, self-reflective and humble direction.",Pereira Â.; Funtowicz S.,Book,"Science, Philosophy and Sustainability: The End of the Cartesian dream",2015-01-01,Universitetet i Bergen;University of Leeds;ICT,
Model Risk in Financial Markets: From Financial Engineering To Risk Management,"The financial systems in most developed countries today build up a large amount of model risk on a daily basis. However, this is not particularly visible as the financial risk management agenda is still dominated by the subprime-liquidity crisis, the sovereign crises, and other major political events. Losses caused by model risk are hard to identify and even when they are internally identified, as such, they are most likely to be classified as normal losses due to market evolution. Model Risk in Financial Markets: From Financial Engineering to Risk Management seeks to change the current perspective on model innovation, implementation and validation. This book presents a wide perspective on model risk related to financial markets, running the gamut from financial engineering to risk management, from financial mathematics to financial statistics. It combines theory and practice, both the classical and modern concepts being introduced for financial modelling. Quantitative finance is a relatively new area of research and much has been written on various directions of research and industry applications. In this book the reader gradually learns to develop a critical view on the fundamental theories and new models being proposed.",Tunaru R.,Book,Model Risk in Financial Markets: From Financial Engineering to Risk Management,2015-01-01,University of Kent,
Subject to Interpretation: Individual Managers’ Concepts of Consumers During NPD,"The idea that discerning and responding to the needs and wants of consumers is essential for sustainable firm performance is a cornerstone of marketing thought and theory. However, despite copious concern with the relationships that consumers have with companies (Bhattacharya and Sen 2003) and brands (cf. Fournier 1998), to date there has been little investigation of the reverse: how producers relate to their targeted consumers. In the firm context, the consumer is primarily conceptual and managers learn about consumers through research findings, in which they are sometimes rendered as a persona or character. The study described herein asks, “how do individual members of product development teams conceive of their targeted consumer during the product development process?” Interweaving employee and firm-level conceptualizations of customer orientation (CO), I investigate individual managers and their “interactions” with target consumers via, for example: research reports; pictorial representations, videos, focus group observation and/or interviews during new product development (NPD). The findings presented here are drawn from empirical data gathered during an 18-month ethnographic study of five Fortune 500 consumer products firms’ NPD processes. Organizations were theoretically sampled (Glaser and Strauss 1967) to include slow- and fast-moving industries; radical and incremental innovation, low and high product complexity and both products and services. Because each firm was a complex multinational corporation, key informants were asked to select a focal product to speak with me about. Snowball sampling (Atkinson and Flint 2004) within the organization provided additional informants who also worked on the same project. Informants were selected if they were contributing members of NPD teams, regardless of their function (e.g. marketing, R&D, product planning, engineering). In addition to participant-observation, 39 semi-structured depth interviews were conducted with 32 informants. Data was analyzed from a symbolic interactionist (Solomon 1983; Prus 1996) perspective. Symbolic interactionism (SI) is an ideal lens for this analysis because it foregrounds three important constructs relevant to this investigation: the role of others in constructing meaning and providing context; the centrality of the individual in sensemaking; and the ever-evolving negotiation of subjective meaning. SI emphasizes two concepts which are integral to this analysis: inter-subjectivity and role-taking. That is, when product developers engage in the interpretation of consumers’ behaviors, they inevitably rely upon the shared understanding or mutual expectations of those who broadly share a common culture. In addition, they have intersubjective understanding of both their function’s and their organization’s norms and expectations. Analysis of the data revealed that members of NPD teams relate to the consumers for whom they develop based on their readings of the consumer as a symbolic object, influenced by the salience of roles and orientations they develop towards the consumer in the course of a project. Managers who foregrounded their role within the organization, i.e. as a decision-maker or representative of a functional area, had different interpretations of consumers’ needs than those who allowed their personal experiences (e.g. as consumer) to be salient. Similarly, individuals varied on the emotional interpersonal distance they maintained from the targeted consumer. On one end of a continuum of responses, product developers actively worked to get closer to the targeted consumer in order to discern their desires, for example, by conducting thought experiments or spending time outside of the office in the contexts that the target might occupy. On the other end of that continuum, managers distanced themselves—physically and emotionally—from the consumer and were, for example, more likely to be satisfied with received definitions and conclusions about consumers. These two dimensions—role orientation and interpersonal distance—combined, resulted in very different relationships among product developers and their target consumer. Accounting for managers’ various experiences and expectations is vital, because they can lead to two seemingly different yet simultaneous outcomes: objectivity and empathy. Objectivity is presumed in believing that others see what you see. However, shared understanding and expectations makes it possible for managers to engage with consumers by “walking in their shoes.” Therefore each manager, while engaged in sensemaking through shared social systems, also holds a host of individual experiences and roles which can shift their interpretations of consumers. Individual predilections, training and/or beliefs, among other factors, can activate and foreground the objective or the empathetic, and thus shift perceptions of the consumer and relevant solutions for him or her. This study’s contribution lies in examining the role of both individual interpretation and intersubjective sensemaking; activities assumed to be governed by firm norms. Avenues for future research include optimal NPD team composition; the role of interpretation in conflict and contestation and the influence of intersubjectivity on the commissioning and interpretation of consumer research (particularly in the context of innovation).",Wilner S.,Book Series,Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,2015-01-01,Wilfrid Laurier University,Interpersonal Distance ;  Product Developer ;  Product Development Process ;  Symbolic Interactionism ;  Symbolic Object

Widely used but also highly valued? Acceptance factors and their perceptions in water-scrum-fall projects,"Agile methodologies like Scrum propose drastic changes with respect to team hierarchies, organizational structures, planning or controlling processes. To mitigate the level of change and retain some established processes, many organizations prefer to introduce hybrid agile-Traditional methodologies that combine agile with traditional development practices. Despite their importance in practice, only a few studies have examined the acceptance of such methodologies, however. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study that was conducted at a Swiss bank. It uses Water-Scrum-Fall, which combines Scrum with traditional practices. Based on the Diffusion of Innovations theory, we discuss several acceptance factors and investigate how they are perceived. The results indicate that, compared to traditional development methodologies, some aspects of Water-Scrum-Fall bring relative advantages and are more compatible to the way developers prefer to work. Yet, there also exist potential acceptance barriers such as a restricted individual autonomy and increased process complexity.",Schlauderer S.; Overhage S.; Fehrenbach B.,Conference Proceeding,"2015 International Conference on Information Systems: Exploring the Information Frontier, ICIS 2015",2015-01-01,Universität Bamberg,Agile software development ;  Qualitative research ;  Software development
Image guided surgery innovation with graduate students - A new lecture format Basics - Experience - observe - Analyse = innovation generation recipe and motivation boost for biomedical and medtec master students,"In Image Guided Surgeries (IGS), incremental innovation is normally not a technology push (technology delivered) but rather a pull (by learning and working with the clinical users) from understanding how these surgeries are performed. Engineers need to understand that only through proper observation, procedure know-how and subsequent analysis and evaluation, clinically relevant innovation can be generated. And, it is also essential to understand the associated health economics that could potentially come with new technological approaches. We created a new lecture format (6 ECTS) for graduate students that combined the basics of image guided procedures with innovation tools (Design Thinking, Lean Engineering, Value Proposition Canvas, Innovation Games) and actual visits of a surgical procedure. The students had to attend these procedures in small groups and had to identify and work on one or more innovation projects based on their observations and based on a prioritisation of medical need, pains and gains of the stakeholders, and ease of implementation. Almost 200 graduate students completed this training in the past 5 years with excellent results for the participating clinicians, and for the future engineers. This paper presents the lecture content, the setup, some statistics and results with the hope that other institutions will follow to offer similar programs that not only help the engineering students identify what clinically relevant innovation is (invention x clinical implementation), but that also pave the path for future interdisciplinary teams that will lead to incremental and disruptive innovation.",Friebe M.; Traub J.,Journal,Current Directions in Biomedical Engineering,2015-01-01,SurgicEye GmbH;Technische Universität München;Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg,graduate lecture ;  image guided surgery ;  innovation generation ;  innovation tools ;  interdisciplinary research ;  medical need
Orientation Towards IC-Technologies and Value Added Services at Logistics Service Providers,"Value added services in combination with the utilization of innovative information and communication-technologies are a valuable source for differentiation of logistics service providers. To examine the orientation of logistics companies towards these aspects and to analyze their usage of formalized processes for the development of new services, a study among the German logistics industry was conducted. The study is based soundly in the theories of the Resource-based view, the Service-dominant logic and the concept of service engineering. With regard to the current market situation the main research results reveal a controversy: On the one hand, logistics service providers have realized the potential of both information and communication-technologies and value added services. On the other hand, they still lack formal development procedures. Closing this gap will be a challenging task for the management of the future.",Preiß H.; Papert M.; Klötzer C.; Pflaum A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Logistics,2015-01-01,Universität Bamberg,Common Method Bias ;  Innovation Strategy ;  Logistics Service ;  Service Development ;  Service Engineering
Engineering as a Socio-technical Process: Case-Based Learning from the Example of Wind Technology Development,"This chapter describes an example of teaching engineering students social perspectives of engineering by using the case example of wind technology. It is part of the philosophy of engineering course taught to undergraduate engineering students at Aarhus University. The case of wind technology development is suited to discuss a large number of different social issues related to engineering, such as engineering approaches (science-based versus practice-oriented), the role of engineering styles and traditions, forms of learning and interaction in engineering, requirements and problems of engineering communication, innovation strategies, research policies, market structures and ideologies. The case of wind technology shows that engineering is more than developing technical artifacts.

Mars mission design strategy board game to inspire STEM students,"Most elementary and middle schools lack the engineering (design innovation) component in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) curriculum as identified by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the National Research Council (NRC) in their report “Engineering in K–12 Education UNDERSTANDING THE STATUS AND IMPROVING THE PROSPECTS.” These reports also emphasize that “engineering design” should be taught in schools to promote engineering education and the engineering habits of mind. Even though concrete guiding principles on the direction and form of engineering in school curricula are discussed, there is limited information in the reports on how to apply the engineering principles in a classroom setting. In this paper, a board game geared towards design innovation and entrepreneurship is introduced for school age children (ages 10-14 years) that incorporates various phases of the design process (research, design, engineering and build process). After evaluating their design, students/players build a physical model of their design by assembling the components. The winning design will have the highest score during the evaluation. A prototype of the board game was developed and a pilot test was completed at St. Catherine’s girls’ school to verify the game’s appeal and ease of use and most importantly confirm design engineering and innovation learning aspects of the board game. Further testing and evaluation will determine the learning outcomes related to design innovation in STEM education.",Pidaparti R.,Conference Proceeding,"56th AIAA/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference",2015-01-01,College of Engineering,
High grade steel pipeline for long distance natural gas projects,"Natural gas will play the role, in the years to come, of the main fossil fuel, even the energetic scenario is moving to the renewable sources as an alternative for the far future; natural gas will act as a ""bridge"" to guarantee the transition to the ""green energy"" from the actual one [0]. As a matter of fact the era of easy gas is ""terminated"", now there is the need of large investments to connect big gas reservoirs located in far and sometimes stranded locations. To have access to these reservoirs, from the logistic and economical point of view of the exploitation, the cost for gathering natural gas has to be reduced dramatically. The cost cut has to affect not only the construction but also the operational duties. So any new solution has to be properly checked, before to be put in place, to assure it must be as reliable as the actual currently used. From the mid of the 90′ it has been shown as the adoption of very high pressure for the transportation of large amount of natural gas it's the easiest solution to be used; the main reason ofthat it's because it's based on the enhancement of current technologies used for the manufacturing of the material, for the construction and maintenance of the gas pipeline; it doesn't need any break through leap that may create a divide with the actual way or working. The material proposed is C steel with higher strength in term of yield and tensile stress. Material as carbon steel above API 5L X80 and X90 and in some cases also X100 have been considered for this application. The paper is aimed to highlight the topic need to better understand the use of API 5L X80 C steel for pipeline (UOE & Spiral welded) to be used for mild/harsh scenarios in onshore pipeline laying. Eni committed its interest on pipeline high strength steels by combining experimental researches and theoretic studies on structural integrity & reliability [0]. The scope is to address the design phase towards quantitative safety targets for which the reliability level specified by designer and desired by operator is pursued. X80 pipeline steel had so far not been used mainly because the lower steels grade were suitable for any of the previous applications, and also because of the predominant attitude in O&G sector to adopt new solutions is conservative; furthermore the lack of experience on ""in field application"", it's another reason to ""freeze"" the evolution process. This project was aimed to fill these gaps through an integrated ""full scale and realistic long term tests"" approach. The innovation embedded in this R&D project is to have an overall cycle approach, involving the analysis of aspect related to the engineering phase, enhancement in the construction methods, and last but not the least also the maintenance and daily operational duties.",Cheldi T.; Castano M.; Spinelli C.,Conference Proceeding,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference, ADIPEC 2015",2015-01-01,"ENI S.p.A., Italy",

Value management: An effective innovation management tool for strategic management of technology in the services sector - Case of a VTI,"The concept of Strategic technology management (STM) places technology in a strategic context. STM did not emerge as a distinct area of managerial and academic interests until late 1980s. The key managers may initiate efforts to gain access to newer technologies, but the question is whether the approach they adopt is strategic or a series of ad hoc decisions [Quinn, 1988]. Value Management (VM) has assumed an important role in providing leadership and strategic growth to technology firms. Historically VM emphasized use of alternatives to reduce cost, promote innovation and enhance the performance of products. VM has moved beyond manufacturing and can be applied for strategic decision making in the services sector. It is envisaged the VM can be an effective tool for STM. It should help in generating creative ideas on the most appropriate technologies, examination of alternatives, evaluating the alternatives and developing a strategy. A study conducted by the author in the East, revealed that the performance of firms is influenced by the type of strategies developed during the VM process. This result provided the motivation to explore if such strategies are relevant to the managers of the ""services"" sector and if their performance too is influenced by these adoptions. There is dearth of similar studies in the literature. More importantly, in this age of technology, there is a dire need for management to understand and implement ideas not perceived before. The results could contribute to the literature/management in developing a set of VM strategies which could be termed as ""global"" and applied to any sector and those termed as ""unique"" which are specific to firm/service sector. In terms of the services sector, the nearest similarity to the technology intensive firms appear to be the vocational and technical institutions (VTI). The big study sought to identify and analyse the level of awareness of participants on strategy issues and the perception of departments (including those in the Ministries) about STM (and the inherent VM). This paper attempts to present the results on that part of the study which deals with the relationship between the type of the managers/management (gender, qualification, age etc) and the application of developed strategies. The participants included the staff and heads of departments at a technical college from an oil rich ASEAN country, the senior management at the college and the policy makers at the Department of Technical Education (DTE). The strategy and management data was desired from all the three groups. Data was collected through a questionnaire and analyzed using statistical techniques. A pilot-study helped to refine the questionnaire before it was administered. The study sets the tone to open up discussions and research interest towards applying VM tools in the strategic management of technology in the education sector in a rapidly growing digital world. The type of managers/management revealed as part of this study has implications to the senior planners in the education sector in keeping pace with the technology age by providing valuable inputs to innovate, discover, evaluate and develop strategies to provide value to the stakeholders, decision makers and technology lecturers.",Sikander A.,Conference Proceeding,"Joint HKIVM-SAVE International Conference 2015: Discover Hidden Values, HKIVM-SAVE 2015, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Murdoch University,Performance ;  Strategic technology management ;  Technology ;  Technology strategy ;  Value ;  Value management
Flax: Sustainability is the new luxury,"‘Flax: increasing its value for society’ was the challenge posed by cross-border researchers funded by the European Union INTERREG IV A France (Channel)—England call, as the ancient flax fiber had seen a dramatic decline in consumer appeal and market share. The resulting collaboration, ProjectFlax, delivered new innovations where novel applications in sustainable materials for human and environmental wellbeing produced premium products from an unexpected plant source. Could value in future be defined and measured not just by the aesthetics of the artefact, but by assessing the true value of materials using a holistic narrative in relation to process, the philosophy and sustainability of the application? This assessment is, we argue, new luxury. The purpose of this chapter is to show that flax was an unexpected source of innovation for societal advantage, appealing to consumers who desired a deeper material meaning and product differentiation—characteristics afforded by traditional expensive luxury brands. The collaboration between design, science, technology, engineering, mathematics and business (D-STEM-B) combined discipline methodologies, which resulted in new thinking and problem solving. Case study, desk-based, laboratory, practice-led, field study, quantitative, qualitative, narrative and observational methods were explored by 20 national and international, commercial and institutional flax researchers. The findings included improved agricultural and industrial production methods, composites, foodstuffs, biodegradable packaging, bio materials, fashion and interior product prototypes.

Mean shift detection for state space models,"In this paper we develop and validate a procedure for testing against a shift in mean in the observa-tions and hidden state sequence of state space models with Gaussian noise. State space models are popular for modelling stochastic networks as they allow to take into account that observations of the true state of a sys-tem may be corrupted by measurement noise (usually, a Gaussian noise process is assumed). Although state space models are very general, they are still relatively tractable in that the true system state can be estimated efficiently by a recursive procedure known as Kalman filtering. State space models can be regarded as a special type of hidden Markov model. As such, they are a flexible modelling tool that has been found useful, for example, for modelling road networks (Stathopoulos and Karlaftis, 2003) to account for uncertainty in the measurement of travel times. For instance, we may assume that travel times have to be estimated from flow and occupancy data. An increase in the unobserved mean travel time can be caused by traffic congestion; a shift in the mean value of the observations on the other hand could indicate a bias of the sensors. State space models can also be used to model communication networks: Suppose that the current state of a channel (e.g. measured by the probability of packet loss) is not observed directly, but has to be inferred from the received package flow. A change in the mean value of the hidden state sequence, or a change in the mean value of the received package flow can deteriorate the performance of the network if it remains unrecognised. This motivates us to investigate procedures for testing against a shift in mean in the observations and hidden state sequence of state space models. The objective is to detect a change as quickly as possible while keeping the ratio of false alarms at a pre-specified low level. Since the observations are generally not independent, in (Basseville and Nikiforov, 1993) a cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedure is applied to the (independent) sequence of innovations, which is obtained as a byproduct from Kalman filter estimation of the hidden states. That is, a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test statistic is used and an alarm is raised as soon as this test statistic exceeds a certain threshold that is assumed to be given. Change point detection for state space models has also been considered in (Lai and Shan, 1999) for the case where the size of the mean shift is unknown, in which case a generalized LLR test can be applied. In this paper we tackle the question of how the threshold of the sequential LLR test can be chosen when the shift size is assumed to be known. In practice, the latter assumption can be dealt with by realizing that typically there will be a minimum change size that is of interest from an engineering perspective, and that can thus be used as input for the model. Based on this assumption we can identify the appropriate level of the threshold based on approximations of the false alarm probability - essentially the probability that a random walk process exceeds a given threshold on an interval. A persistent change in the mean value of the observations results in a dynamic change in the mean value of the innovations, which are therefore not identically distributed after the change point. However, it follows from the stability properties of the Kalman filter that under weak conditions the magnitude of the shift converges to a constant. This allows for large-deviations (LD) approximations as well as approximations motivated by a functional central limit theorem (CLT). LD approximations to the false alarm probability have been considered in (Bucklew, 1985; Ellens et al., 2013; Kuhn et al., 2014) for testing i.i.d. and vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models. CLT approximations were motivated, for example, in Siegmund (1985). We compare the numerical performance of the tests under both types of limiting regimes with respect to the false alarm probability and the detection delay.",Kuhn J.; Mandjes M.; Taimre T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015",2015-01-01,The University of Queensland;Korteweg-de Vries Instituut voor Wiskunde,Change point detection ;  Gaussian processes ;  State space models ;  Threshold approximation
The orchestrated collaborative classroom: Designing and making sense of heterogeneous ecologies of teaching and learning resources,"The physical face-to-face classroom still represents the core educational setting in which everyday CSCL practice takes place. However, current classrooms are not limited anymore to books, blackboards and other physical artifacts: laptops, tablets, digital whiteboards, wikis, shared applications and simulations have also become part of this learning landscape. These last ones add new layers of complexity to the everyday educational practices and the dynamics of the classroom. CSCL researchers have traditionally proposed standalone systems or innovations, focusing their evaluation on the effects and management of a single system/intervention. However, everyday classroom activities involve multiple subject matters, different pedagogical approaches as well as a variety of technologies. The assumption that our innovation is alone no longer holds. The multiplicity and heterogeneity of resources (digital and legacy) pose a unique set of opportunities and challenges for the CSCL research community, which are bound to become stronger as time goes by. This collaborative workshop brought together technology designers, researchers and practitioners, in an attempt to match CSCL technologies to the pedagogical needs and contextual constraints of practitioners, identify a set of guidelines to design and connect existing CSCL systems with each other and with legacy classroom resources, and help teachers and students to make sense of these heterogeneous learning ecologies.",Prieto L.; Dimitriadis Y.; Harrer A.; Milrad M.; Nussbaum M.; Slotta J.,Conference Proceeding,"Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL",2015-01-01,"Linnaeus University, Kalmar;Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile;Universidad de Valladolid;Technische Universität Clausthal;University of Toronto;CHILI Lab",Classroom ;  Design guidelines ;  Ecology of resources ;  Heterogeneity ;  Orchestration
Typical applications of protonic ceramic cells: A way to market?,"Most research on ceramic-based cells (SOCs or PCCs) is deeply oriented to reduce energetic cost, while keeping reasonable electrical performance and mechanical strength of the system under dynamic operation. It is usually well admitted in the community that decreasing the operating temperature below 600°C and/or incorporating ultrathin electrolytes of ceramic-based cells benefits by a strict reduction of manufacturing cost and stressing environment. Until now, most of the common SOCs based on anionic conducting materials such as yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), samaria-doped ceria (SDC), and La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-0.5(x+y) (LSGM) require to operate at temperatures higher than 600°C, challenging the risk of using expensive and more complex engineering materials and processes. In this context, the last decades revealed a renewed interest in the study of protonic ceramic conductors in the domain. The main reason comes from the specific properties of a PCC (operation ability below 600°C, proton kinetics transport, etc.) and the significant improvements obtained both in terms of performances and the fundamental understanding of proton transport through such material (see Chapter 1). As developed in Chapters 2 and 3, many studies are made to lower electrical resistance and cost of PCCs by different strategies of innovation and architecture: ∑ Improving the intrinsic proton transport and physicochemical properties of common ionic-conducting ceramics ∑ Finding novel electrode materials and reliable interfaces microstructure with high catalytic activity and chemical compatibility ∑ Favoring easy and reproducible scalable processes from cell to stack design Thus, several industrial routes more and more employed are promoting solid-state proton conductors in several domains, especially in (a) sensors, (b) separators, (c) fuel cells, (d) (co-)electrolysis, (e) ammonia synthesis, and (f) heterogeneous catalytic reactors. This chapter relates main progress results of electrochemical performances and reliability and proposes orientations and pros-pects of PCC devices applied in such applications. 4.1 Proton-Conducting Material: An 4.1.1.1 Electrochemical performance As described in Fig. 4.1, a fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy from a hydrogen source as the fuel into electricity through a electrochemical reaction with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. In this sense, fuel cell devices differ from batteries since they can produce electricity continually as long as inlet gases are supplied. In such an operation, a protonic ceramic cell (PCC) device proposes several intrinsic advantages, in particular the nondilution of the fuel at the hydrogen electrode side since water is produced at the air side (in contrast with what is observed in common solid oxide cell [SOC] device).",Marrony M.; Matsumoto H.; Fukatsu N.; Stoukides M.,Book,Proton-Conducting Ceramics: From Fundamentals to Applied Research,2015-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas;Nagoya Institute of Technology;Kyushu University,

"Global manufacturing technology transfer: Africa-USA strategies, adaptations, and management","Global Manufacturing Technology Transfer: Africa-USA Strategies, Adaptations, and Management presents practical strategies for developing and sustaining manufacturing technology transfers. It is particularly useful for helping developing nations achieve and sustain a solid footing of economic development through manufacturing. The book examines Africa and USA trade relations to demonstrate how modern technology innovation strategies can be developed and harmonized to keep a nation moving forward economically. It then explores how to advance existing technical relationships through new and updated approaches. The book uses the case and template of trade relations of Africa and the United States to demonstrate how technology innovation strategies can be developed and harmonized to keep a nation moving forward economically. The author discusses project management tools, highlights manufacturing as the foundation for economic development, and explores lessons learned. He details a systems approach, covering both qualitative and quantitative tools and techniques. Although focusing on Africa-USA technology transfer, the concepts are applicable to other technology transfer relationships. Africa is poised to assume a leading role in global manufacturing.

Eco-Engineering opportunities for offshore marine infrastructure projects,"Our respect and understanding of the local environment is increasing with the recognition of its importance in our daily life. This is reflected in the Eco-Engineering Approach developed and used in dredging- and marine infrastructure projects. The approach starts with a thorough understanding of the local environment, and aims to increase overall value of the project both for nature, society and of course the project itself (economics and profitability). By focusing on synergies and development opportunities that strengthen both the environment and the project, construction and operational costs are reduced as well as lead times during permit process. We believe that this approach offers similar benefits to selected Offshore projects. It is based on the lessons learned and knowledge development gathered in the past years through the Building with Nature innovation programme, and experience gained from projects in daily practice. This allows for a head start on offshore projects. Eco-engineering starts from dedicated pre-project environmental monitoring to gain insight in the underlying physical and ecological processes. This provides the basis for project design and, later on, the construction and operation works. For nature, it is about recognizing key environmental values and the presence and resilience of sensitive receivers at an early stage. This enables optimization of project design and implementation of adaptive work methods with the objective to enhance habitat (soft and hard substrate), and to ensure minimal impact. For the physical environment, designs and work methods can be adapted to allow for beneficial use of natural forces such as sediment transport, currents and waves. Examples for offshore projects include landfalls in sensitive near shore/intertidal and wetland areas, landscaping of seabeds, scour protection and rock coverings to decrease volumes and increase ecological habitats and use of ecologically designed Gravity Based Structures acting as reefs. Joint development and implementation of the approach, and creation of support within the project stakeholder community are some of the major lessons learned and success factors of the Building with Nature innovation programme. By bringing together a broad range of stakeholders at start of the programme consisting of research institutes, universities, NGO s and local stakeholders, industry, consultants and governments, ensures mutual understanding and respect for each other s goals and approaches. Instead of being restrictive towards each other with continuous scrutiny during every step in the process, the network interacts and develops innovative knowledge, thereby strengthening each other s ideas. Contractors played a key role in this development by initiating the Building with Nature programme, subsequently taking responsibility in contracts and developing and implementing the Eco-Engineering approach in daily practice. This approach contributes importantly to a sustainable future for both the sector/industry as well as the environment in which they operate.",Rijks D.; Aarninkhof S.; Van Spreeken A.; Legierse E.,Conference Proceeding,OTC Brasil 2015: The Atlantic: From East to West - An Ocean of Innovation,2015-01-01,Boskalis,
Regulatory environment and endogenous technological development in the upstream oil and gas industry in Brazil,"Since its formal creation in 1953, Petrobras has operated in monopoly in the Oil and Gas (O&G) industry in Brazil. In 1997, the Congress approved the law 9478/1997 (Petroleum Law), which set a fundamental change in the legal framework and allowed other competitors to enter into the market. Since then, the government has also implemented a set of new regulations in the O&G sector to foster local content as well as investments in science, technology and innovation. Here we aim to understand how the regulatory environment affects technological development in the upstream O&G industry. Our methodology consists of two pillars. First, we provide a critical review of the literature about the broad relation between natural resources and economic development. We find that technological development is a key driver of productive linkages from the primary sector and we suggest that the regulatory environment plays a major role. Second, we adopt both quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze three specific mechanisms of the regulatory framework for the case of Brazil. Our results are two-fold. On one hand, the regulatory environment has prompted significant investments in science, technology and innovation in the O&G industry; also, it has promoted the establishment of new partnerships between the oil industry and the Science and Technology Institutions (STIs).1 On the other hand, some regulations as well as recent modifications have hampered investments in science and technology, especially due to a low involvement of the suppliers. An important conclusion is that, for the case of Brazil, the R&D center Petrobras has played a leading role in fostering technological development. Though, the regulatory environment needs to be revised to involve more actors in this process; more coherent and coordinated policies are needed to promote both local content and innovation at the same time. This paper differs from previous literature in two key aspects. First, whereas other scholars tend to study the macroeconomic and governance-related issues of natural resources, here we analyze their productive implications. Second, our work combines both quantitative and qualitative research methods; both questionnaires and semi-structured interviews have allowed us to collect primary data at micro-level.",Mancini L.,Conference Proceeding,OTC Brasil 2015: The Atlantic: From East to West - An Ocean of Innovation,2015-01-01,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,

Sustainability and food in Margaret Atwoods 'MaddAddam' trilogy,"In Margaret Atwood's science fiction trilogy 'MaddAddam', we read about food innovations such as ChickieNobs that are genetically modified and extremely fast growing chicken parts. They are not only presented as more efficient than conventional meat products but also as superior with regard to problematic side-effects caused by intensive husbandry, e.g. harming animal welfare or increasing greenhouse gas emissions. ChickieNobs are part of a widespread belief that research and innovation in biotechnology are the most promising way to figure out humankind's challenges such as overpopulation, environmental crisis or climate change. As counter-image, the God's Gardeners are presented, an environmentalist sect, which tries to minimize their ecological footprint. They meet their demand for food and other resources through self-sufficiency as they are living in small communities and imposingon themselves a very rigid code of conduct: 'no consumption of animal protein except in emergencies, no corporate products unless in recycled form, strict limitations on the use of water'. This very different approach imposes partly very strict limitations on the member's personal freedom. Focussing on the topics of food production and food consumption, the paper wants to follow the discussion about and aesthetical configuration of future and sustainable food depicted in Atwood's novels. The discussion turns on the question whether sustainable food should be achieved by means of an economically driven and science-based approach or should it rest on a dramatic change of individual behaviour as represented by the Gardeners.",Rockoff M.,Book,Know Your Food,2015-01-01,Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen,Consumerism ;  Fiction ;  Genetic engineering ;  Human nature ;  Humanities
How do the origins of life sciences influence 21st century design thinking?,"How can the origins of life sciences inform design thinking in an ecological era? This paper considers the possibility of the origins of life sciences as being more than a blue sky practice for the development of advanced scientific theories but also offers a technical platform for designing and engineering life-like solutions for an ecological era. A design-led study of dissipative systems is discussed as a form of natural computing and innovation platform that can deal with probability and whose ontology (nature of becoming) is consistent with complexity, nonlinear dynamics and the flow of energy and matter. However, since the proposed approaches do not yet formally exist as products or mature technologies, exemplary design-led projects are introduced to explore the principles of design and engineering with these origins of life strategies. A portfolio of work is presented that includes the The Hylozoic Ground installation and Future Venice projects. Such experimental work investigates the value of collaborations between the origins of sciences and design practice as a strategic approach towards new systems such as, artificial soils – which may not only be recognised as applied research fields that offer insights into the transition from inert to living matter – but also give rise to potential cultural impacts and commercial opportunities in the built environment.",Armstrong R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Artificial Life, ECAL 2015",2015-01-01,Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences,

Interdisciplinary initiative for infusion of virtual labs in IT and engineering degree programs,"In recent years, online learning has taken a new dimension with the introduction of virtual labs in the higher education field. There has been a huge initiative to engage faculty to integrate virtual labs in the IT and Engineering studies. This paper explores the benefits of integrating virtual labs into computer engineering curriculum with the anticipation that this virtual hands-on experience will help engage students in connecting the abstract theory and concepts to practice. Virtual labs are in fact preferred in many higher educational online settings for addressing the inability to visualize complex phenomena in a virtual setting that will help students to attain their learning goals. As we know, faculty plays a vital role in determining the success or failure of developing the content to align with the course learning outcomes. By employing an interdisciplinary initiative, this research paper will help inspire online educators in IT and Engineering field to integrate virtual labs for their courses that would highly motivate students to apply their theoretical learning to solve real-world application problems.",Jagannathan U.; Blair R.,Conference Proceeding,"6th International Multi-Conference on Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics, IMCIC 2015 and 6th International Conference on Society and Information Technologies, ICSIT 2015 - Proceedings",2015-01-01,Ira A.

"Cloud-Based Design, Engineering Analysis, and Manufacturing: A Cost-Benefit Analysis","From a business perspective, cloud computing has revolutionized the information and communication technology (ICT) industry by offering scalable and on-demand ICT services as well as innovative pricing plans such as pay-per-use and subscription. Considering the economic benefits of cloud computing, cloud-based design and manufacturing (CBDM) has been proposed as a new paradigm in digital manufacturing and design innovation. Although CBDM has the potential to reduce costs associated with high performance computing (HPC) and maintaining ICT infrastructures in the context of engineering design and manufacturing, it is challenging to justify the potential cost savings associated with HPC in the cloud because of the complexity in the cost-benefit analysis of migrating to CBDM. In response, this paper provides important insights into the economics of CBDM by identifying key cost factors and potential pricing models that can influence decision making on whether migrating to the cloud is economically justifiable. Specifically, the cost breakdown of adopting CBDM is presented. The general key benefits are demonstrated using real case studies. In addition, a hypothetical application example is presented to compare costs in CBDM with that of traditional in-house design and manufacturing. Finally, some of the key issues and road blocks are outlined.",Wu D.; Terpenny J.; Gentzsch W.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Manufacturing,2015-01-01,Iowa State University;UberCloud,Cloud computing ;  Cloud-based design and manufacturing ;  Cloud-based engineering analysis ;  Cost-benefit analysis ;  High performance computing
The Mix that Works for the SMARTBoard Integration in an American Elementary School: What We Can Learn from Them,"The function of school and the important role of community involvement on technology integration are areas that are given little attention in the fields of research in educational technology in Malaysia. This study, which explores the aforementioned areas specifically on the integration of the SMARTBoard Technology, attempts to shed an insight into how Malaysian schools can learn from an American elementary school that is well known for its successful integration of the SMARTBoard Technology. Framed by the Cultural Historical Activity Theory and the Theory of Diffusion of Innovations, this study centers on the mix that works for the success from the social, cultural, and historical lenses. Two technology embracer teachers were the participants in this study. The findings that emerged from this study revealed that the school's pledge is the key innovation that was necessary in the school for the success of the SMARTBoard Technology integration, which also came as another innovation. These innovations was made swift through the school's community practices, which are community building, developing routines, and balancing act-The mix that was necessary for the school to successfully diffuse innovations into its system and function efficiently as a community.

The effect estimation and channel testing of the technological progress on China's regional environmental performance,"To study the effects of and approaches to technological progress on China's regional environmental performance, this study first estimates China's regional environmental performance and its variation indexes by applying a slack-based model (SBM) and an entropy-based model (EBM). The results indicate that the environmental performance in different regions of China has improved, but the rate of improvement differs greatly. This may be attributed to heterogeneous characteristics and changes in the green technology innovation level in different regions. Considering the overflow effect of environmental pollution among different regions, we study the impact of various technological progress patterns on China's regional environmental performance using spatial econometrics, and we find that there are significant spatial effects of technology innovation, technology transfer, and imitative innovation on China's regional environmental performance. Also, different technological progress patterns have different effects. Specifically, independent innovation has failed to effectively improve regional environmental performance, whereas the introduction of technology and imitative innovation have significantly improved this performance. Moreover, after the cross-items of independent innovation and human capital are introduced, the effects of technology introduction and imitative innovation on China's regional environmental performance through the absorptive capacity of human capital remain significant, whereas the effect of independent innovation on regional environmental performance via the absorptive capacity of human capital becomes more obvious. Based on this and from the perspective of environmental enhancement, we believe that China should strengthen human capital accumulation and give consideration to imitative innovation and technology introduction while emphasizing independent innovation.",Ai H.; Deng Z.; Yang X.,Journal,Ecological Indicators,2015-01-01,Hunan University;Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences,Environmental performance ;  Spatial econometrics ;  Technological progress
Does civil environmental protection force the growth of China's industrial green productivity? Evidence from the perspective of rent-seeking,"Based on the decision analysis of heterogeneous enterprise between green technology innovation and rent-seeking, this paper formulates the Hybrid-Luenberger index considering undesirable outputs and studies difference in the response of regional industrial green productivity to civil environmental protection. Empirical study on China's regional industrial data from 1997 to 2011 shows that: (1) Compared with the intensity of environmental pollution and other passive environmental protection incentives, the public are more sensitive to per capita income level, education quality, health concern and other rational environmental protection incentives. (2) The increase in the civil environmental protection effect promotes the industrial green technology innovation, while the rent-seeking activities have a significant negative effect on green productivity. (3) The civil environmental protection of the eastern coastal area has more significant effect on the industrial green productivity compared with that of the central and western inland area. (4) As the quantile of the industrial green productivity increases from the low point to high level, the positive effects of the civil environmental protection on the industrial green productivity turn to be more significant, and the rational environmental protection have positive and negative effects on high and low quantile of the industrial green productivity, respectively, which proves that the ""Potter Hypothesis"" can only be established on the condition that producers are approaching to the technology frontier.",Zhang Y.; Jin P.; Feng D.,Journal,Ecological Indicators,2015-01-01,Hunan University,Civil environmental protection ;  Industrial green productivity ;  Rent-seeking ;  Undesirable-Hybrid-Luenberger index

The Delft prototype laboratory,"In architectural education increasing digitalization leads to de-materialization, to abstraction and to the 'lawlessness' of free form architecture. The lack of practice experience in the study time and the sudden surprises at the start of the practice time of young alumni makes it necessary to prepare architecture and engineering students in order to restore their balance between abstraction and materialization. The experienced generation has ample overview with materialization, be it that continuously new products and techniques are developed for buildings of which they should have knowledge. The coming generation has only its imagination and fast learning intellect, but large omissions in practical building experience. So the students are sometimes brilliant but usually lack practice and experience of professionally working with their hands. Buildings stay longer than the lifetime of the creators. Materials and material techniques are very important to chose the suitable materials and develop the correct details to connect the materials, elements and components together. And yet they lack the inspiration from that materialization. It also influences their faith in their own abilities. As all designers they try to see their dreams realized. In order to open the possibilities of making material prototypes and to get rid of cold feet for young designers a special prototype course and a laboratory / workplace for prototypes was developed and implemented by the Chair of Product Development. For these reasons the Prototype Laboratory at TU Delft was installed in 1995. Combining creativity and surprising out-of-the-box thinking with the initiative to materialize design concepts for building components can lead to new product concepts for building components. Revolutionary, continuous or even incremental innovation in industrialization and prefabrication with new technologies in the development of building components stimulates the state-of-the-art of technical architecture. It keeps architecture in material respect alive and up-to-date with societal progress. Educating prototyping distinct the department of Building Technology TU Delft from the education of architectural engineers and building technology designers of many other universities. And it works. The amount of foreign students in the prototype semester is almost 50% in 2012. But the experience of prototyping came from practice. This book also relates prototyping to the position of a practical designing professor at the Chair of Product Development who regards his private design & build offi ce as his research laboratory as it were outsourced from the TU Delft , on the results and processes of which he contemplates in his scientifi c research publications. He even goes to the extreme of theoretical publications for example on the topic of methodology, but always this knowledge and insights are gained from practice. Being a practical designing architectural engineer as well as a university professor enables him to combine his positions in two separate domains of industry and academia. Experimenting and prototyping play an important role in order to increase knowledge and insight by continuous engaging inventions into innovations. The Prototype laboratory worked ever since 3 times or 2 times a year with a group of maximum 25 students, a provisional staff in a former workshop in Mechanical Engineering. The collection of 18 years of full-scale material prototyping provided more than 900 graduates with this very valuable experience of design & build innovation. The knowledge of and the hands-on experience in getting any technical design or 'dream design' into reality controlling the material properties and available production techniques equipped these graduates eminently as technical and innovative designers in the realm of architecture. In education of this type of architectural engineers it is no use to design and prototype the usual, the familiar. Instead the invention and innovation with the risk of failure is far more instructive. To get the stronger eff ect in the desired education students in small groups are prototyping their own design ideas. The development of the education in the Master tracks of Architecture is showing how groups of students work on prototyping in quite innovative designs in a short span of time. It goes without saying that the costs of these material educational exercises are often a multitude of normal design and engineering courses. In the more than 18 years of its existence there was a continuous battle to get faculty funding. Originally the Chair had ample means, but after a rigorous slandering of its size due to unforeseen and ad hoc new management rules, the extra over funds came from the department, not any more from the faculty. To keep such a facility going means commitment from the department and the faculty, which really had to be forced in 1995, but later was never actually doubted as a goal. Getting the proper fi nancial means for prototyping, however, is a continuous battle, in which many SME companies are involved, informed and challenged by the students. Many companies have donated small amounts of money to these students or materials, elements and components. Most of the Delft Architecture alumni have stated that the experience with this design & build process of prototyping opened their mind for an technically inventive and innovative way of thinking for the fi rst time in their architectural education, which is such an important element in the toolbox of the architectural and technical engineer. For this type of architectural engineer the aesthetics of a building or a building component is in a reciprocal relation to the materialization. The architectural engineer or technical architect is the contemporary variant of the architectural hero-to-be that students wanted to become a decade ago.",Eekhout M.; Van Swieten P.,Book Series,Research in Design Series,2015-01-01,Delft University of Technology,

Organisational issues in modelling business processes: An activity-based inventory and directions for research,"This project aims to create a structured inventory of concerns related to business process modelling that may face organisations embarking on business process management (BPM) projects. Key issues are identified for each BPM activity stage, overarching patterns are noted, and suggestions are made for the future research agenda. Modelling is at the core of BPM, a practice which in recent years has developed maturity and become linked with managerial concerns such as innovation and knowledge management. Although it is well known that modelling business processes can be challenging for organisations, an inventory of known issues, which could be of use to organisations to plan and manage BPM projects, is missing. This study aimed to develop such an inventory. The scoping review method was adopted. The review protocol consisted of a search for related literature using keywords, complemented by forward and backward searches through citations and references. Analysis of these papers revealed 77 concerns. These concerns where then organised according to four key BPM activities (analysis, modelling, enactment, and management). Further analysis resulted in a collection of 18 sub-activities, which summarise and reveal which overall concerns are characteristic of BPM modelling. The nature of the evidence base for each concern is also broken down. We suggest that this study contributes to build a high-level understanding of process modelling issues faced by organisations when delving into process modelling practices. Furthermore, we suggest that understanding of how to address these issues can be increased through research into seven high level questions.",Jonnavithula L.; Antunes P.; Cranefield J.; Pino J.,Conference Proceeding,"Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, PACIS 2015 - Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidad de Chile;Victoria University of Wellington,Business process management ;  Business process modelling ;  Scoping review
Selecting Video Analytics using Cognitive Ergonomics: A Case Study for Operational Experimentation,"The objective of this research is to achieve innovation with a disruptive edge in a human-driven operational environment where layering key information is critical to the customer's current story-boarding solution space. However, new online video data sources present an increasing complexity, with visual cues trapped in hours of video data with no automated means to easily locate and extract key data nuggets. The solution is the introduction of disruptive concepts with an ‘operational experimentation’ focus to mimic the customer's approach. This new method will embrace the larger ‘tell me a story’ perceptive approach to automate the process of building a user defined text story representation based on the accurate discovery / identification of relevant content in the online videos. This paper will cover overall components of the operational experimentation methodology which is part of a long-term (12-24 month) software research and development (R&D) prototyping strategy to operationalize software through a customer driven partnership. This methodology borrows ideas from multiple disciplines including cognitive ergonomics, computer science and industrial engineering. This case study emphasizes the importance of incorporating how humans cognitively process film based stimulation as a ‘story’, to design a system that will assist humans by automating the processing of online social media based video streams and imagery. The significance of this work demonstrates a paradigm shift in how automated video analysis is designed and accomplished through sharing pros and cons of selecting and operationally testing analytics through a series of vignettes. Beginning with an on-line video and concluding with a text based story of that video that is now searchable, understandable, and available to traditional cloud based analytics tailored to an organization's particular needs.

An Intentional Approach to the Engineering of Knowledge-intensive Service Systems,"This paper presents an Intentional Architectural Framework for developing Knowledge-Intensive Service System Architectures (IAF-KISSA). This framework enables the specification and evaluation of knowledge-intensive service systems (KISS) architectures at the levels of network, performance, engagement, and activities. A chosen architecture then allows designing, developing, and adapting a KISS throughout its lifecycle. This research is motivated by the lack of service systems engineering (SSE) methods specifically created for KISS, despite their economic importance in industrialized economies. Examples of KISS include joint innovation initiatives and IT outsourcing contracts. KISS possess a number of distinctive characteristics, including: the knowledge-intensity of their processes and outputs; the inter-organizational coproduction of outputs, and the multi-stakeholder perspective that drives the evaluation of these systems’ performance. SSE aims to define and discover dynamic relationships among entities in order to plan, design, and adapt services systems to cocreate value [1,2]. SSE calls for a change in perspective in service engineering, from services as products to services as socio-technical systems where actors and resources are configured to collaboratively create value. An important challenge for the field of SSE is the creation of advanced models, methods, and tools for developing service system architectures. However, current service system architectures typically retain a functional and provider perspective on service systems operations without accounting for KISS characteristics. Using an intentional approach leads to modeling a service system in terms of agents, goals, strategies, and dependencies, thus addressing these concerns by moving from a functional to a strategic level of analysis [4]. Using an intentional approach to architecting KISS is thus ideally suited to their social and behavioral complexity. IAF-KISSA contributes a novel approach for architecting KISS, a type of service system that has hitherto been beyond the scope of SSE.

Using data from a survey conducted in Brazilian research groups, an empirical model was estimated to evaluate how the characteristics of the research groups impact their interactions with firms. Main results show that research groups with higher academic performance, larger research groups and groups affiliated with larger departments tend to present higher numbers of interactions. Furthermore, engineering and agricultural sciences research groups interact more. Given these findings, the main contribution of the paper is that it furthers understanding of the factors that shape university–industry linkages and how characteristics of research groups affect interactions.",Garcia R.; Araujo V.; Mascarini S.; dos Santos E.; Costa A.,Journal,Innovation and Development,2015-01-01,Universidade de São Paulo,Economics of technology ;  Knowledge and innovation ;  University–industry linkages
Bioactive glasses: Frontiers and Challenges,"Bioactive glasses were discovered in 1969 and provided for the first time an alternative to nearly inert implant materials. Bioglass formed a rapid, strong, and stable bond with host tissues. This article examines the frontiers of research crossed to achieve clinical use of bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics. In the 1980s, it was discovered that bioactive glasses could be used in particulate form to stimulate osteogenesis, which thereby led to the concept of regeneration of tissues. Later, it was discovered that the dissolution ions from the glasses behaved like growth factors, providing signals to the cells. This article summarizes the frontiers of knowledge crossed during four eras of development of bioactive glasses that have led from concept of bioactivity to widespread clinical and commercial use, with emphasis on the first composition, 45S5 Bioglass®. The four eras are (a) discovery, (b) clinical application, (c) tissue regeneration, and (d) innovation. Questions still to be answered for the fourth era are included to stimulate innovation in the field and exploration of new frontiers that can be the basis for a general theory of bioactive stimulation of regeneration of tissues and application to numerous clinical needs.",Hench L.; Jones J.,Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2015-01-01,College of Engineering and Science;Imperial College London,Bioactive glass ;  Bioglass ;  Inorganic/organic hybrids ;  Regenerative medicine ;  Scaffold ;  Sol-gel ;  Synthetic bone grafts ;  Tissue engineering
Tailoring the business modelling method for R&D,"While the benefits of innovation seem to be clear intuitively, Research and Development (R&D) organisations are struggling to show the value they add. Especially in times of crisis, the result is that they get the first budget cuts to reduce costs in the short term. This causes companies, industries, or even whole economies, to lose competitive advantage in the long run. The field of business modelling deals with the creation and capturing of value. However, it has not yet provided a method tailored to R&D previously. Building upon earlier work on business modelling, we adapt the Business Modelling Method (BMM) to the field of R&D.",Meertens L.; Sweet N.; Iacob M.,Conference Proceeding,BMSD 2015 - Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Business Modeling and Software Design,2015-01-01,Universiteit Twente,Business modelling ;  Business models ;  Modelling method ;  Research and development
Development of novel plasma surface engineering technologies for multi-functional surfaces,"Multi-functional surfaces underpin the technological innovations in many high-tech industrial sectors to meet ever-increasing requirement for demanding applications. To this end, some new plasma surface engineering technologies have been developed at Birmingham Surface Engineering Research Group to generate novel multi-functional surfaces for a variety of challenging applications. This paper will start with the limitation of currently used DC glow-discharge plasma, followed by the recent development of advanced active-screen plasma and innovative triple-glow plasma surface engineering technologies.

"Transdisciplinary approach of science, technology, engineering and mathematics education","At the end of 20th century and especially in this century the education field is undergoing a significant change not only as a result of technological innovations but also pedagogical innovations on the bases of artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive science and neuroscience. What interested us was the attitude of students and teachers towards these changes. In the research the participating students were arranged in two groups, the control group (CG), where conventional lessons were carried out and the experimental group (EG), in which teachers used a transdisciplinary cognitive neuroeducation model. The performance data for the both groups was acquired via questionnaire adopted from TIMSS research. The teachers’ attitude towards these changes was mostly monitored via qualitative research. As is apparent from the results, a positive shift can be seen in the students’ attitude towards school. And this positive attitude towards school can create in students the suitable motivation, which is the first and most important step towards quality knowledge.

"Future Challenges for Civil Aircraft Systems: How to Combine Safety, Simplicity, Virtuality and Agility?","Air transport is a major contributor to global economic prosperity and is the corner stone of global commerce with a myriad of economic and societal benefits. This expanding sector is trying to respond to the increased passenger demand – doubling every 15 years – by offering the latest innovations that meet evolving passenger trends and environmental demands. In this context, some of the future challenges aircraft manufacturers will have to face include the system complexity reduction while keeping the same high-level safety standards. Fault detection, diagnosis and prognostic are also key points to address to be compliant with stringent airworthiness regulations while improving the aircraft performances and environmental footprint. Efficient system architecture has also to be designed in this context and it could be promising to consider distributed architecture. Finally, in order to decrease the development cycle, attention must be paid to the virtual testing. All these key elements, completed by some additional ones, will be broached and detailed during the presentation, with a strong industrial point of view, allowing the academia to better understand how to bridge the gap between basic research levels and engineering needs.",Comes M.,Conference Proceeding,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2015-01-01,Airbus France,Civil aircraft systems ;  diagnosis and prognostic ;  modeling ;  safety ;  virtual testing
The impact of tacit knowledge capacity on social media: An empirical research on physicians in North Cyprus,"Tacit dimension of knowledge is still remaining as Black box in the knowledge management literature. While it is not a new concept, the sharing of tacit knowledge at the social media environment has recently been discussed in the last decades. There are mainly two important approaches on sharing and capturing the tacit knowledge. The first one is about the possibility of sharing tacit knowledge by using social networks tools. For example Hildrum (2009) and Lopez-Nicolas and Soto-Acosta (2010) mentioned that IT can trigger sharing of the tacit knowledge. The second one argues that it is almost not possible to share tacit knowledge by using IT tools. Sagsan (2003) argued that according to the mental models, transmission stage is problematic which includes common sharing and diffusion within an organization among stakeholders. Likewise, Flanagin (2002), Johannessen et al, (2001), Hislop (2001) and Haldin-Herrgard (2000) argued that though tacit knowledge sharing via IT is almost impossible. This paper argues that social media can be used effectively to increase the tacit knowledge capacity. As the people need to be contacted from their preferred medium of choice (Fill, 2011) it will be suitable to use social networks to share the tacit knowledge within organizations. The empirical part of this study concentrated on physicians in order to understand how the tacit dimension of knowledge capacity could be diffused or captured. Questionnaire had been conducted to 138 physicians who works in North Cyprus and the regression models indicates that Seniority of Employees and the Speed of Adaption of Innovation affects both Tacit Knowledge Accumulation and Tacit Knowledge Transfer.",Kaya T.; Sagsan M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organisational Learning, ICICKM",2015-01-01,Yakın Doğu Üniversitesi,North Cyprus ;  Physicians ;  Social network sites ;  Tacit knowledge accumulation ;  Tacit knowledge capacity ;  Tacit knowledge transfer
Impact of customer networks on customer lifetime value models,"The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is believed to be the 21st century marketing strategy approach. The concept of customers viewed as a long-term asset of the company seems to attract proper company resources to the activities related to this asset. The focus on long-term profitability of customers and the selection of the right customers for the future expansion is a key to valuable growth. CLV models alongside with Customer Equity (CE) models, both constitute the core and actionable basis for tactical and strategic marketing of customer-centric companies. Innovations in both concepts of CLV and CE arise from new technological possibilities to empower customer data. Social network interactions and network structure information signify enormous opportunity for marketers to understand the real value of customer referrals and cooperation, especially in the business-to-consumer industry. Social network analysis techniques are effective to extract individual customer's importance for the company, what subsequently can be compared to the long term profitability and thus used for decisions in reputation management or churn management. Not only customers form groups on established social networks, but also such groups appear via informal relations in terms of similar behaviour, attitudes, and interactions. Hence a clustering of user behaviour is an important technique for segmented approach to computing future value of a customer base. More precise and subtle input data make CLV models rigorous with deep respect to the heterogeneity of a customer base. The main goal of this paper is to propose new innovative enhancements of traditional CLV models, with focus on business-to-consumer segment and non-contractual settings of customer relations with a company. Partial goals of the paper include 1) a summarization and discussion of current technological possibilities in social network analysis and clustering for the use in customer retention models, moreover 2) an enhancement of statistical models used for CLV and CE computation and finally 3) an empirical application of these statistical methods on health & beauty e-commerce dataset from the Czech Republic. The paper focuses on clustering of CLV by marketing channels that are attributed to customers. Clustering of CLV has brought important practical insights to the targeting of marketing campaign. Empirical analysis proved that clusters emphasized actionable insights from CLV estimation in comparison with naïve grouping. Two clusters of customers originated from organic search traffic were found with significantly different CLV predictions and also with overall higher CE than other marketing channels. These clusters of identified customers should be targeted in a different manner.",Jašek P.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2015-01-01,Prague University of Economics and Business,Customer Equity ;  Customer Lifetime Value ;  Customer relationship management ;  Innovative marketing management ;  Social network analysis
Product and process innovation to exploit new market opportunities and overcome the crisis: An Italian family firm case study,"The innovation is a key driver for national and international economic development and growth nevertheless, especially during the period of crisis, companies and Governments stress the resource rationalization, limiting the investments in research and innovation. Literature has developed a series of studies on innovation, focusing on product and process innovations and the company's attitude, influenced by the company size, the economic sector and company's strategic approach to environmental changes. Existing literature has also dealt with the topic of innovation in family businesses. Some authors argue that family firms are more conservative, less inclined to risks and so less attracted by product and processes innovation. However, a part of international literature sees family firms as a source of growth, development and economic stability, as well as a dominant business model. The objective of this study is to verify whether a strategy of innovation in terms of products and processes might offer a competitive advantage to family businesses operating in the automotive sector, that is highly representative of the Italian economic context. The research methodology, at first, focuses on a review of international literature dealing with the management of innovation in family businesses. Then, basing on the literature evidences, it was selected and examined a significant case study. It was decided to describe an explanatory single case study, represented by an internationally successful Italian family firm, the Rolfo S.p.A., leader in the European vehicletransport sector. Over the last years, the crisis has strongly affected this sector, increasing the average life of commercial vehicles. In order to survive and thrive over this rough period and in contrast with other companies' behavior, the family owner has adopted a proactive approach, based on a strategy focused on innovation. In particular, the company has studied and developed product and process innovations, through a greater variety of new products, the introduction of lean production logics or the re-engineering of the distribution processes. These innovations enabled the company to expand the business beyond Europe as in the Russian and in emerging markets, with a greater vitality and a lower saturation, and to survive over this rough period, characterized by the exit of many competitors. This paper adds some specific aspects related to the management of innovation in family firms, contributing to extend the literature on innovation in family businesses, also providing some useful insights. Future researches could involve a multiple case study method and, as regards the technique, the number of interviews might also involve employees working within the company, as opposed to family members.",Truant E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2015-01-01,Università degli Studi di Torino,Automotive sector ;  Case study ;  Crisis ;  Family firm ;  Innovation
Putting innovation in place: Georgia Tech's innovation neighbourhood of Tech Square,"Discussions of university-based economic development practice have evolved from discrete discussions about constituent elements (ex. technology transfer, firm start-ups, etc⋯) to more integrated discussions about the role of the entrepreneurial university in shaping innovation districts. Policy analysts have identified ""innovation ecosystems"" connected to anchor institutions in Baltimore, Buffalo, Cambridge, Cleveland, Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San Diego, and ""Tech Square"" in Atlanta. These innovation districts share characteristics in common with the ""Triple Helix"" thesis combining university, industry, and government partners to build innovation neighborhoods connected to anchor institutions. Although the success of these innovation districts has been widely noted, the elements underlying that success have not been systematically identified. This study contributes to this evolving scholarship by examining the development and evolution of Technology Square in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The ""triple-helix"" thesis articulated by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff argues successful innovation cultures are fostered by continuous and iterative interaction among universities, governments, and industry. The Brookings Institution's innovation districts model further considers the physical space and relationship culture in which these triple helix interactions manifest: 1) Economic assets (the triple-helix actors); 2) Physical assets (public and private space, infrastructure, and connectivity); and 3) Networking assets (the relationships among the various actors that help advance new ideas). This paper analyzes the ""Tech Square"" project. It was built from 2001 to 2003 and simultaneously expanded the size and scope of the Georgia Institute of Technology, a major public research university with an urban campus. The project was initially driven by the need for more programming and academic space, but multiple factors shaped it into the foundation of a growing innovation hub. This case study uses a review of the literature on university knowledge and technology transfer; archival records; interviews; contemporary accounts; and mapping to build an ex post evaluation of Tech Square based on evolving theories of innovation district design. This study makes key contributions through a close examination of the physical form of Tech Square and how it was shaped by its particular Triple Helix environment. In addition, the Tech Square case highlights how the U.S. political context of limited government funding for university expansion necessitates a more creative economic development role for universities as anchor institutions. The findings of this study will be of interest to practitioners and scholars of economic development, public policy, urban planning and design, public-private partnerships, and higher education seeking to better understand the evolving role of researchintensive urban universities in building and shaping innovation districts.",Giuffrida G.; Clark J.; Cross S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2015-01-01,Georgia Institute of Technology,Anchor institutions ;  Innovation ecosystems ;  Knowledge and technology transfer ;  Regional innovation systems ;  Triple Helix
An investigation on the implications of design process phases on artifact novelty,"Innovation, including engineering innovation, is essential for economic growth. Currently, while most design practices in engineering education focus on aspects of ""good"" technical design, elements of innovation may be neglected. This research investigates design process activities that yield innovative artifacts. Specifically, we examine the types of design activities, their timing, and the associations among each other. Specifically, two research questions are explored. First, what design activities do teams engage in that relate to the innovativeness of the resultant design artifact? Second, how do these design activities impact the succeeding activities across the design process (from problem definition to working prototype (WP))? To explore these questions, 16 senior capstone bioengineering design teams are followed as they advance from initial conceptualization to WP over an average 23 week period. Several significant measures suggest that innovative teams differ from their noninnovative counterparts in terms of what activities they engage in, how much they engage in the particular activities, and in what phase they conduct the activities. Specifically, certain activities utilized in the early phase (e.g., marketing) are essential for innovation. Moreover, in terms of iterations through activities, spending significant time and effort while developing a design, as well as having smooth, rich iterations throughout the process contribute to the innovativeness of the artifact.",Ozaltin N.; Besterfield-Sacre M.; Okudan Kremer G.; Shuman L.,Journal,Journal of Mechanical Design,2015-01-01,Swanson School of Engineering;Penn State College of Engineering,Association maps ;  Design process ;  Engineering education ;  Innovation ;  Regression analysis

Expanded benefits for humanity from the international space station: International space station program science forum,"In 2012, the International Space Station (ISS) [Figure 1] partnership published the updated International Space Station Benefits for Humanity [1], a compilation of stories about the many benefits being realized in the areas of human health, Earth observations and disaster response, and global education. This compilation has recently been revised to include updated statistics on the impacts of the benefits, and new benefits that have developed since the first publication. Two new sections have also been added to the book, economic development of space and innovative technology. This paper will summarize the updates on behalf of the ISS Program Science Forum, made up of senior science representatives across the international partnership. The new section on ""Economic Development of Space"" highlights case studies from public-private partnerships that are leading to a new economy in low earth orbit (LEO). Businesses provide both transportation to the ISS as well as some research facilities and services. These relationships promote a paradigm shift of government-funded, contractor-provided goods and services to commercially-provided goods purchased by government agencies. Other examples include commercial firms spending research and development dollars to conduct investigations on ISS and commercial service providers selling services directly to ISS users. This section provides examples of ISS as a test bed for new business relationships, and illustrates successful partnerships. The second new section, ""Innovative Technology,"" merges technology demonstration and physical science findings that promise to return Earth benefits through continued research. Robotic refueling concepts for life extensions of costly satellites in geo-synchronous orbit have applications to robotics in industry on Earth. Flame behavior experiments reveal insight into how fuel burns in microgravity leading to the possibility of improving engine efficiency on Earth. Nanostructures and smart fluids are examples of materials improvements that are being developed using data from ISS. The publication also expands the benefits of research results in human health, environmental change and disaster response and in education activities developed to capture student imaginations in support of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, education internationally. Applications to human health of the knowledge gained on ISS continue to grow and improve healthcare technologies and our understanding of human physiology. Distinct benefits return to Earth from the only orbiting multi-disciplinary laboratory of its kind. The ISS is a stepping stone for future space exploration by providing findings that develop LEO and improve life on our planet.",Rai A.; Robinson J.; Tate-Brown J.; Buckley N.; Zell M.; Tasaki K.; Karabadzhak G.; Sorokin I.; Pignataro S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2015-01-01,S.P.

"Spaceil educational mission - Inspiring, modeling, connecting","SpacelL is an Israeli non-profit organization competing in the Google Lunar XPRIZE: an international Moon Race. SpacelL is committed to using the potential prize money ($20 million) from the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition to promote science and STEM education in Israel, and to ensure that Israel will continue to live up to its reputation for excellence in these fields. Using the innovative project of building, launching and successfully landing a spacecraft, SpacelL aspires to create an Israeli ""Apollo effect"" - like in the 1970s in the US. The mission of SpacelL is to inspire the next generation in Israel to think differently about Science; Engineering; Technology and Math. For Israel, STEM education is not only important in school but is part of the nation's future. SpacelL sees its educational mission as using the challenge of reaching the Moon as not only a source for formal and informal activities based on science and technological challenges, and innovative ways to overcome them, but also an example for Israeli teenagers for innovative ways to pursue their own dreams and aspirations through science and technology. In order to achieve our educational mission, SpacelL has developed several educational models, with the goal of influencing life-long decisions about STEM and scientific literacy. These models are based on the idea of leveraging the space mission through people (role models), activities (problem based learning using the context of groundbreaking space exploration), and values (innovation, cooperation, and volunteering). By implementing these models, SpacelL is leveraging its groundbreaking Moon mission to creating a collaborative community around the spacecraft and connecting people to science as a national asset.",Weizman A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2015-01-01,V.P. of Education,
University partnerships as a model for capability building in emerging space nations,"Organizations within many developing countries arc identifying space and smaD satellite technology as priority areas in which to increase their local capability. Satellites provide valuable public services in the areas of earth observation, communication, positioning, timing and scientific research. Small satellite projects arc also an opportunity for universities and government agencies to foster goals in educating students, stimulating innovation, enhancing the capability of local firms, pursuing strategic international alliances and fostering national pride. As a nation that is new to space begins early activities small satellites, it is valuable to develop partnerships with more experienced space nations that can provide mentorship. Such partnerships come in a variety of models, including political agreements between governments, commercial contracts with firms and educational agreements with universities. Each of these models has benefits and weaknesses; each may be appropriate for ait emerging space nation depending on their local context, objectives and stakeholder needs. This paper considers the opportunities and challenges facing developing nations that harness international university collaborations with more experienced space nations as part of their strategy to increase local capability in small satellites. Specifically, the paper presents examples of university programs led by the Kyushu Institute of Technology, which is serving as a mentoring partner to many developing countries that are starting new small satellite programs. The university partnership model is particularly appropriate for a nation that seeks a long term process of capability building that fosters education and the maturation of new space-related agencies, firms or university programs. The Space Engineering International Course of the Kyushu Institute of Technology is an example of a program offered by a mentor nation that supports such goals. This paper describes the educational and technical components of the Space Engineering International Course (SEIC). The discussion provides several examples of experiences within the SHC program. The SEIC exposes students to academic education, hands-on satellite programs, international teams and professional development opportunities. The paper provides advice to leaders of universities and space related agencies in less experienced space nations as they consider how to best take advantage of international university collaborations. At the same time, the paper addresses university leaders in more experienced space nations, highlighting models and techniques that will help them build mutuaDy beneficial and sustainable relationships as a mentoring partner.",Wood D.; Polansky J.; Cho M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2015-01-01,Kyushu Institute of Technology;Johns Hopkins University,
Portable lubrication analytical instrumentation for maintenance application,"Maintenance practices have a beneficial economic impact in industry. Industrial equipment operators are continuously forced to reduce operating costs while increasing profits to remain competitive. Reaching optimum lubricant capabilities can extend the life cycle of assets, help achieve lower operating costs and maintain the harsh continuous cycling of machinery. Attaining these capabilities without hindering system performance often requires modern portable technologically advanced condition monitoring instruments. Increasingly, these portable instruments arc replacing the conventional practice of analysing lubricants in commercial laboratories. Delays in laboratorial analysis are eliminated, maintenance response time is increased and production output is increased. This paper describes the differences of analysing used oils from industry with a bench mounted commercial laboratorial instrument and an on-site portable oil analyser. Furthermore, an evaluation of the modern portable analytical instrumentation that is available for on-site lubrication analysis is conducted. The research has found that the same maintenance action is prompted by the results of both the commercial instrument and the portable instrument that was used for testing. This paper has also listed other modern, portable, analytical instrumentation for lubrication analysis and described their operating principles, benefits, limitations and applications. The research has shown that a full range of portable instrumentation is available for a complete on-site analysis of lubricating oils.

Digital innovation in construction: Exploring the firm-projects interface,"This paper reports on an in-depth qualitative study of the diffusion of digital innovation in a large UK engineering firm. Previous research in the diffusion of innovations in construction emphasises either projects or the firm with little attention to the interface between the firm and its projects, and the effect of this interface in diffusion processes. This research however employs a contextualist process approach which accounts for more than the individual choice, and considers non-linearity and iteration within the chronology of a diffusion process. The findings of this research provide a case for learning and capabilities development for BIM across the firm through strategic technology group which the firm mobilised to provide innovation championship and digital leadership. It also captures important tensions and challenges at the interface between the firm and its projects, which are largely related to the need for standardised processes across the firm to achieve repeatable solutions, and at the same time being able to meet the unique requirements of specific markets and projects. The implications of these findings in practice and in research in the diffusion of innovations in construction are discussed.",Shibeika A.; Harty C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 31st Annual Association of Researchers in Construction Management Conference, ARCOM 2015",2015-01-01,University of Reading,BIM ;  Diffusion of innovations ;  Digital innovation ;  Project-based firms

The S.O.A.P.<sup>™</sup> process: Collaborative research & development project between KT-Kinetics Technology S.p.A. and UNISA - University of Salerno,"The collaborative research and development project between KT-Kinetics Technology (KT) and the University of Salerno (UNISA) has been started over a decade ago with the main purpose to identify and develop a new process for the treatment of H2S. The starting idea was to create technological innovation by improving reliability, expanding productivity and driving down costs while reducing environmental impacts. The driving factor of this research and development project has been the production of H2 by thermal or catalytic cracking of H2S, in presence of O2 or membrane assisted. The process engineering expertise of KT jointed with the academic competences and laboratory plant of UNISA has made possible the development of experimental tests of several methods for H2S decomposition. All the knowledge acquired and the encouraging results have been utilized to develop the Selective Oxidative Autothermal Process (KT S.O.A.P.™) as the novel way to process H2S which allow to obtain H2 production and SO2minimization. This paper provides the laboratory test results for the main technology solutions investigated by KT and UNISA starting from the Catalytic Reaction Membrane Separation method (KT C.R.M.S.™) up to the Selective Oxidative Auto-thermal Process (KT S.O.A.P.™). The effects of the main operating parameters like reaction temperature, feeding ratio and residence time will be presented in terms of H2S conversion, H2 yield and SO2selectivity.",Colozzi M.; Cortese S.; Barbato L.; Palma V.; Vaiano V.; Barba D.,Conference Proceeding,Sulphur 2015 - 31st Annual Conference of Sulphur and Sulphuric Acid,2015-01-01,Università degli Studi di Salerno;Processi Innovativi S. r. l.;Kinetics Technology International S.p.A.,
Comprehensive evaluation of some innovative wind turbines,"A rapid development in wind turbine technology took place during the Second World War and oil crisis of 1973. It continued during twentieths century, which resulted in turbines with bigger size and more advanced technology. Today, large wind turbines are becoming more competitive in the field of electricity generation because of economical production of electricity and availability at rural and remote locations. They have occupied remarkable share in world renewable power generation among various renewable energy sources. On the other hand small wind turbines are not accepted well because of lack of assured performance, cost, efficiency, etc. Therefore some researchers are trying to develop new wind turbine systems to convert wind energy in to electricity. Innovations in the design wind turbine to make them compatible for household use and also to favor their installations by building more eye-catching, efficient and economical wind turbine. To increase acceptability of wind turbines, wind turbine should satisfy the most of the criteria listed in the present study such as, ability to catch the wind from all the direction, self starting, light weight, inexpensive, maintenance free, low weight towertop system and hence supporting structure, light weight and efficient generator, efficient wind to mechanical energy conversion and manufacturing simplicity at affordable cost and reliable performance. Present study focused on the innovative wind turbines that installed as an offshore and onshore technology. There are more than one hundred of different innovative wind turbine designs listed research papers, books, magazines and internet. In present paper, innovative design aspects of some of these turbines discussed with the technological challenges. Innovations are in the area of blade profile design, aerodynamic shape of the wind turbine, reduction of noise and vibrations, the material of the blade, mechanical and electronic instruments such as gearbox and electronic power circuit, suitability to the application, etc. The aims of these innovations are improvement in the efficiency of the wind turbine; increase in power output and to lower the overall cost. At the end of paper the technological challenges that these innovations overcome, innovative concept and feasibility of the concept are discussed. These innovations include spiral wind turbine, VAWT with accelerator, Windpax-Collapsible portable wind turbine, multi-rotor wind turbines, diffuser augmented wind turbines and floating wind turbines.",Kulkarni S.; Dabeer P.; Kale S.; Sawant S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2015-01-01,Rajarambapu Institute of Technology;Trinity College of Engineering and Research,
Strategy for developing a system for sustainable product design and manufacture,"Research studies confirm that embracing sustainability in product design and manufacturing not only yields environmental improvements, but offers key business benefits. There is an increasing pressure to adopt a more sustainable approach to product design and manufacture. Organizations that are actively engaged in sustainable product design and development cite impressive levels of improvement over their poorer performing peers in product innovation, quality, safety and revenue growth alongside anticipated environmental and energy gains. Sustainability in design and manufacturing has a lot to do with ?doing better with less,"" and embracing a broader view of product development, and examining full lifecycle of the product and the impact that its design, manufacture, performance and disposal can have across not only on business, but on the environment and society, as well. The process of rethinking a product's design so that it is more durable contains fewer parts and easily packaged and recycled also drives innovation and quality. The goal of sustainable product design (SPD) is to produce products and/or to provide services, which are sustainable and achieve their required functionality, meet customer requirements and are cost effective. In other words, SPD is about producing superior products and/or services that fulfil traditional criteria as well as sustainability requirements. The requirement to develop sustainable product is one of the key challenges of 21st century This paper describes a system that identifies sustainability related performance measures for products in terms of: a) Sustainable product design by robust design b) Sustainable design by quality of service. The first case study is on a laser based measuring instrument which supports the theory of sustainable product by robust design techniques The objective of the robust design study is to find the optimum recommended factor setting for the surface roughness analyser to minimize the variability in the readings. This instrument relies on the spread of the laser light on the work piece to determine surface roughness; therefore, the analyser's reliability depends primarily on everything involved with the laser and its path. There are a minimum number of parts to achieve this function since the laser can scan over the work piece, substituting functionality in place of additional parts. The use of surface roughness analyser for online measurement of surface finish and continuous online monitoring and control with a feedback provides the robustness in quality and sustainability. The second case study, which is on elevator quality of service, is considered to support the theory of sustainable design by quality of service. This example shows how the design considerations are influenced and closely linked to the quality of service and maintenance. To support the theory of sustainability by quality of service, this case study examines elevator design and maintenance and recommends a new procedure based on Root Couse Analysis resulting in Elevator Condition Index (ECI). ECI is a new procedure and is applied based on original equipment reliability, projected average life cycle of key wear components, number of run cycles since maintenance was last performed on each component, cost of emergency repair vs. cost of maintenance vs. likelihood of failure. It supports service based on prognostics rather than routine service cycles. Sustainable design and manufacturing is possible if we deploy the virtual engineering tools to monitor and service manufacturing machinery so that the sustainable benefits are maintained throughout the product design cycle. The choice of a workplace structure depends on the design of the parts and lot sizes to be manufactured as well as market factors, such as the responsiveness to changes. Designers should be aware of the manufacturing consequences of their decisions because minor design changes during the early stages often prevent major problems later. As a part of product performance evaluation, the use of capability index to maintain process quality can lead to beneficial results.",Shetty D.; Manzione L.; Campana C.; Ghosh S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2015-01-01,University of Hartford;University of the District of Columbia,Elevator quality of service ;  Robust design ;  Simulation based design support ;  Sustainable design

"Hybrid-MCX-1, BWB and 777 aircraft comparison","Conceptual design is the first and most important phase of an aircraft's configuration and system development process. That being said, there is no denying that innovation in aviation has stunted over the last 50 years; the once every present fascination of flying has been blanketed by the rapid profit-driven commercializing of an industry. Moreover, we have reached an apex of maximizing the efficiency of current passenger aircraft model configurations. In recent times, new research and development has culminated to the introduction of aerodynamic structures to address key issues such as stability and fuel efficiency. This research paper seeks to push the envelope of innovation with a brand new perspective on how we view air travel - redefining the Why, What and How. It explores novel concepts such as Boeing Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft shown in, which does not follow the conventional Tube and Wing (TAW) configuration. It is a tailless design that integrates the wing and the fuselage into a single-lifting surface. The most common advantages include a higher lift-to-drag ratio and higher payload capacity due to a distribute load along the centerline of the aircraft. On the other hand, a tailless configuration comes at a cost to in-flight maneuvering and stability. The unique design of the Hybrid-MCX-1 aircraft involves the application of the active aero-elastic tailoring to aircraft topology optimization for both subsonic and transonic regimes. With a focus on experimental wind tunnel testing and high-fidelity simulations, this project proposes a new concept that deviates from today's tubular and wing concept. The aircraft has a unique shape with a forward fuselage that starts off with the conventional tubular and winged aircraft design currently flown in commercial travel, but deviates to a wider cross section at the center of the fuselage. The model has self-supporting, cantilever, dihedral, swept wings, with pronounced fillets at the junction of the wing root and fuselage, blending them smoothly. This smooth transition reduce interference between airflow over the wing root and the adjacent body surface, ultimately reducing drag. The engines of the Hybrid-MCX-1 are mounted by at 45-degree angle on the rear of the plane. This engine location offers the opportunity for swallowing the boundary layer of air from that portion of the center body upstream of the inlet, providing improved propulsive efficiency by reducing the ram drag. The Hybrid-MCX-1 also possesses a vertical tail that bisects the engines. As with current commercial aircraft, this tail provides lateral stability and controls the yaw. In the case of the BWB, yaw control is made possible by sweeping the wing and downloading the wingtips. However, this approach reduces the effective aerodynamic wingspan of the aircraft and imposes a significant induced drag penalty. The presence of a tail on the concept model addresses the aforementioned issue and rectifies unwanted yawing that may arise during cross wind flight conditions. The rear end of the aircraft decrease significantly in vertical thickness when compared to the lateral thickness to minimize the possibility of flow separation as air passes around the wings and over the front half of the aircraft while maximizing total lifting surface area. The pylons are adequately sized to avoid aerodynamic interference between fuselage, pylon and nacelle but still relatively short to minimize drag.",Clarke M.; Norman N.; Smith S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2015-01-01,College of Engineering and Architecture,
NASA innovation ecosystem: Host to a government technology innovation network,"This paper explores the potential for a Government technology innovation network where technologies are shared across US Agencies and with the public as a central way to innovate around Government technologies. The NASA Innovation Ecosystem supports discovery, collaboration, and ideation around NASA current and future technology. Innovate.NASA (www.innovate.nasa.gov) is the virtual platform in the Ecosystem for citizen scientists to learn about NASA technology, collaborate to rethink these inventions, and shape the discussion around future innovation. The purpose is to strengthen NASA’s technology capabilities through actively exposing NASA developed technology to external innovators for open innovation. Innovate.NASA shares out NASA research and inventions on its website, and provides inspiration and insights on innovation via its social media accounts. Participants of Innovate. NASA contribute questions and ideas to identify new uses and reuses for NASA technology, and engage in discussion to promote innovation. Innovate.NASA encompasses a broad community of scientists, technologists, researchers, and entrepreneurs. This open, interactive, collaborative platform brings together technologists and innovators to drive innovation through: Leveraging and cultivating existing relationships between subject matter experts regardless of field; Identifying opportunities for re-use across technologies beyond original functional design or intent; Connecting scientists and technologists together that are agnostic of geography, function or organization; Exposing technology to the general public to allow for open innovation and crowdsourcing of ideas. In support of NASA missions the Innovation Ecosystem involves scientists and technologists dynamically to actively submit, discuss and collaborate on new ideas and innovative uses of technology. What makes this type of interaction unique to NASA? Very little. Most government agencies have technology and as good stewards of taxpayer funding they are looking to use, license, and re-use the technology. In this tight fiscal environment a collaborative approach provides additional benefits in the form of agency re-use. Think of this benefit as the “technology garage.” At home when finances are tight, instead of running off to the hardware store to purchase a new part, you may check in the garage first to see if you have an existing part that could be modified to fit your needs and solve your problem. Given the same logic, in a tight fiscal environment rather than funding new technology development a project may find it useful to look into existing technology in the agency “garage” to see if existing solutions can be modified to fit the project needs. This type of solution is not just limited to NASA technology - in fact it is greatly enhanced by allowing multiple agencies to have access to all of the other Government agency technology garages. Imagine instead of wandering into your garage and making due with the parts you find, that you had access to all of the garages in your neighborhood! The possibilities become exponentially larger that you will not only find a part that could work but you can find other perspectives on the problem and even a potential collaborator to help you fix the problem. NASA’s holistic approach to foster innovation encompasses several NASA-wide movements to strategically prioritize research and development, promote collaboration, increase transparency, and engage the public. Innovate.NASA is one of the initiatives built to transform NASA’s internal innovation ecosystem into a cross-sector, multi-industry, international, open one. NASA recognizes that this capability is applicable to many Government agencies and is planning to host this collaborative Government technology innovation platform. Ultimately through multi Agency participation each does its part to support an environment where innovation thrives and ideas translate into impact for future Government missions, interagency cooperation, cross pollination of technologies, and a place for the public to participate in technology innovation. This impact will be measurable through technology transfer licensing, interagency agreements, and connections between agencies and the public made through collaboration on the Innovate.NASA platform.",Hardash J.; Landegger A.; Decker B.; Thompson V.,Conference Proceeding,53rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting,2015-01-01,"Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.;National Aeronautics and Space Administration",
The discipline of innovation,"As design and engineering professionals you are no-doubt familiar with lots of tools and techniques that you can employ in your work like task analysis and usability testing.

The flaring of intellectual outliers: An organizational interpretation of the generation of novelty in the rand corporation,"Much of intellectual history is punctuated by the flaring of intellectual outliers, small groups of thinkers who briefly, but decisively, influence the development of ideas, technologies, policies, or worldviews. To understand the flaring of intellectual outliers, we use archival and interview data from the RAND Corporation after the Second World War. We focus on five factors important to the RAND experience: (1) a belief in fundamental research as a source of practical ideas, (2) a culture of optimistic urgency, (3) the solicitation of renegade ambition, (4) the recruitment of intellectual cronies, and (5) the facilitation of the combinatorics of variety. To understand the subsequent decline of intellectual outliers at RAND, we note that success yields a sense of competence, endurance in a competitive world, and the opportunity and inclination to grow. Self-confidence, endurance, and growth produce numerous positive consequences for an organization; but for the most part, they undermine variety. Outliers and the conditions that produce them are not favored by their environments. Engineering solutions to this problem involve extending time and space horizons, providing false information about the likelihoods of positive returns from exploration, buffering exploratory activities from the pressures of efficiency, and protecting exploration from analysis by connecting it to dictates of identities.",Augier M.; March J.; Marshall A.,Journal,Organization Science,2015-01-01,Naval Postgraduate School;Stanford Graduate School of Business,Archival research ;  Deviance ;  Innovation ;  Organization and management theory ;  Organization and management theory ;  Organizational evolution and change ;  Organizational processes
Innovation competitiveness of the Russian regions,"The article is devoted to the problem analysis of the competitiveness of the Russian regions and to the development of the methodology of its increasing. The author's hypothesis is that when supporting the priorities of increasing the region's innovation competitiveness, one must take into account not only region's scientific and technical, and innovation potential, but also peculiarities of interaction of innovation and socio-economic development of the territories. This is because the region's innovation competitiveness is manifested in its ability to create innovations as well as to increase on their basis the resistance of the territory, and, therefore, initially, it quite closely linked to its industrial and technological type. On the basis of the conducted data analysis of the state of research and innovation potential of the Russian regions, the main trends and causes of the continued weakening of their innovation competitiveness are identified. In modern Russia, this is mainly caused by the lack of politically significant groups whose economic interests are closely linked to the development of mechanical engineering, high technology and restoration of the industrial production structure. The interdependence between the socially necessary level of the region's innovation competitiveness and the need for innovation industries with high technology levels are showed. In the article, the methodical approach is proposed for determining ways of increasing the innovation competitiveness of the Russian Federation's regions. It is showed that they should be developed on the basis of coordination of interests of preserving and strengthening the research and innovative capacities of the country, on the one hand, and the needs of increasing the vitality of the territories on the other. In view of the statistical base, the integral index of development priority in the centers of innovation activity aimed at enhancing the resistance of the different degrees of knowledge-intensive industries was developed. The results of the ranking of the subjects of the Russian Federation according to the priority of development there the centers of innovation activity of high-tech, medium-low (on the example of metallurgy) and extractive industries are presented. The proposals for improving the competitiveness of the Russian Federation's regions of the above-mentioned production-technological types are formulated.

Changes in the vector of industrial policy and possibilities for innovative development of the industrial regions,"In the present paper, reasons for the increased interest in industrial policy, both in developed and developing countries are explained. The systematization of the development results of the Russian industry from 1989 to 2014 showed a lack of systematic selection of its priorities, preventing the formation of a strategic vector of industrial policy. The desired industrial policy diversity is established at the different economic development stages of the country. In the context of economic sanctions against Russia, it is shown that the emergence of a new industrial policy vector is connected to the need for import substitution and concomitant changes in the development model of the domestic economy. The dynamics and characteristics of the industrial development area are shown by the example of a highly developed region like the Central Urals. The total level of innovation activity of organizations continues to be low and composes only 12 %, although in the manufacturing sector this index is higher than the regional economy index by four absolute percentage points. The industrial policy of the Middle Urals is analyzed, and innovation drivers of the industrial sector of the regional economy are established. The possibilities of the defense, civil engineering, mining, chemical and pharmaceutical, and forest complexes of Sverdlovsk Region to implement the import substitution policy are revealed. The most significant investment projects that will reduce the import dependence of the regional economy are presented. The possibilities of the research sector and created innovation infrastructure of the region in solving this problem are shown.

Safety of individual products - Perspectives in the context of current practices and challenges,"The safety of products is one essential feature on the way to approval. Methods of safety analysis are applied to ensure this. Facing growing demand for individual products and stricter regulations, these analyses require increasing efforts. In mechanical and mechatronic engineering, these analyses in practice are dominated by traditional methods. Current research aims to improve and enhance this process of considering safety during all stages in design. However, these works mainly focus on software or embedded systems. Thus, this paper aims to understand the current practices and challenges in mechanical or mechatronic engineering. It examines existing approaches from literature and records the industrial practices within an interview study. Challenges in safety analysis are discussed with special focus on increasing variance and user innovation concepts. By that our paper contributes to a better understanding of current and upcoming challenges in the domain of mechanical and mechatronic engineering and identifies the needs and directions for further research.",Roth M.; Gehrlicher S.; Lindemann U.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2015-01-01,Technische Universität München,Design for X (DfX) ;  Design methods ;  Safety analysis ;  Safety engineering
Argumentation analysis in an upstream phase of an innovation project,Nowadays the innovation process has become a collective activity where designers have no longer to work only in their own field of expertise but they have also to work with others in project meetings in order to make decisions collectively. The main purpose of this study is to understand how participants argue and converge toward one solution in an upstream phase of an innovation project. Our work is based on a case study. We captured video and audio data and we gathered working documents from an innovation project meeting in a French company. Our first macro analysis showed that during this meeting there were no explicit decisions concerning both technical and business model solutions. We also noticed that the technical discussions converged towards a solution. This convergence was based on a multitude of mobilized criteria that we structured in different categories. In future research we plan to carry out micro analyses of particular moments highlighted in our current work in order to understand this convergence process.,Abou Eddahab F.; Prudhomme G.; Masclet C.; Lund K.; Boujut J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2015-01-01,Université Grenoble Alpes;ICAR,Argumentation ;  Collaborative design ;  Convergence ;  Decision making ;  Innovation
Provoking iterations in ideation workshops -an explorative study,"There are at least two different perspectives on iterations in product development processes (PDP), a negatively connoted management perspective and a positively connoted engineering perspective. This paper aims at revealing more about both perspectives on iterations in early phases of product development, and to provide hints about the impact these iterations might cause. In an explorative study with eight organisations, we observe their earliest phase of new product development during their participation in ideation workshops. So far, the differences of both perspectives seem to be smaller than expected.

Interdisciplinary learning through design activities uniting fundamentals of engineering curriculum,"An interdisciplinary design approach is essential to solve critical engineering challenges, yet few eng. curricula cultivate interdisciplinary design thinking, particularly early on. Most fundamentals courses are taught independently, often viewed as isolated subjects. We consider a framework for core eng. subjects, Structures & Materials and Circuits & Electronics, to gauge if proposed design activities can 1) reinforce concepts taught in each course, 2) enable students to see coexistence of both subjects in applications, 3) advance innovation/design skillsets/mindset and 4) increase confidence in solving interdisciplinary problems. To achieve concrete experience and reflective observation of Kolb's model, three design problems are posed to target challenges in energy, aerospace and healthcare. The activities foster deductive learning based on earlier concepts and require their interdisciplinary application. Participants report more confidence with interdisciplinary design projects and better grasp of interdisciplinary requirements in solving technical challenges (p<0.05).

Innovative and sustainable design: Perceptions of experts,"Innovation and creativity research assists and enables designers to break the mold of everyday, expected designs and discover the delightful, but unexpected, meaning-rich, and radical through novel approaches to engineering problems and opportunities. Sustainability is one ""wicked problem"" that requires innovative design thinking to change the interface between nature, society, economy and artifact. We surveyed perspectives on the innovation process from 59 design experts internationally through two separate workshops. In the first workshop, 38 experts in innovation provided perspectives on the cognitive underpinnings and design processes relevant to innovation. In the second, 21 experts provided their perspectives on the same topics in light of sustainable design objectives.

A model of idea evaluation and selection for product innovation,"Product innovation is one of key strategic guidelines for sustainable business and competitive advantage. The process of innovation takes significant resources, and it is extremely important during the front-end of innovation to choose a concept with high innovation potential. There is a consensus among researchers that the evaluation and selection of ideas is critical to innovation success. Current research indicates that companies carry out the selection of ideas ad hoc or intuitively, and that only a small number has defined methods and/or the methodology. In this paper, we propose a rational and effective model of evaluation and prioritization of ideas, on the basis of which it is possible to make a choice of ideas. The model emphasizes a set of criteria for evaluating the efficacy of innovation, and defines the attributes for determining the value of each of the criteria. The proposed model represents a level in the methodology and can be applied separately or as part of the methodology. The development model is based on extensive research of the literature, empirical research and practical work. The application of the model was presented by the analysis of one practical case.",Stevanovic M.; Marjanovic D.; Storga M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2015-01-01,University of Zagreb;Markot.tel,Early design phases ;  Idea evaluation and selection ;  Idea management ;  Innovation ;  New product development
Proposal of a framework for characterizing virtual collectives in the engineering design field,"To manage global innovation firms organize their global R&D footprint all around the world to optimize knowledge access.

Design repository & analogy computation via unit-language analysis (Dracula) matching algorithm development,"Analogical reasoning is not the only approach for achieving innovation, but it is a highly effective and noted method. To avoid relying on chance identification of analogies through unique individual knowledge and experience, this research considers the potential impact of a system where an engineer could begin with their existing design, specify to a computer a set of critical functions and desired design performance improvements, and be returned with design analogies intended to inspire avenues for design improvements. This system, called Design Analogy Performance Parameter System (D-APPS), implements performance metric matching to retrieve examples and stimulate analogical mapping, enabling innovative design advances. The D-APPS software, Design Repository & Analogy Computation via Unit-Language Analysis (DRACULA), produces matches using topological isomorphism.

Teaching nurses cad: Identifying design software learning differences in a non-Traditional user demographic,"This pilot study examines CAD software learning differences between a group of non-Technical innovators (clinical nurses) and traditional CAD users (design engineers). This research was motivated by the rapid growth of digital fabrication methods and the proliferation of low cost, semi-professional CAD software, both of which have reduced prototyping barriers for innovators outside of professional design. The study's methodology consisted of (i) a pre-Test survey to assess each subject's degree of computer usage and confidence in 3D modeling, (ii) the completion of a CAD tutorial on a laptop, and (iii) an interview to record each participant's impressions of the design experience. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, the study showed that the nursing cohort had both the strong motivation and technical ability to learn CAD software. However, their profession enforces a low tolerance for ambiguity or time inefficiency, making the traditional engineering methods of ""explore and learn"" inappropriate. The output of this study will be used to assemble an extensive experimental curriculum for nurse innovators interested in medical device design.",Stephenson K.; Pickham D.; Aquino Shluzas L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",2015-01-01,Stanford Engineering,Biomedical design ;  Collaborative design ;  Computer aided design (CAD)
Environmental impact assessment during product development: A functional analysis based approach to life cycle assessments,"As global environmental concerns increase, industries continue to respond prominently to meeting sustainable practice standards through technological innovations and new business models. By implementing sustainable practices companies can create a competitive advantage and ultimately drive profitability in addition to mitigating environmental impacts. However, this potential is limited because current comprehensive environmental metrics, including Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), cannot be completed until after the product bill of materials is developed and the manufacturing process has been defined. In addition, the current LCA standards do not provide practitioners with a sufficiently standardized method of conducting an assessment, which makes its application to product development less reliable. This research develops a framework by which environmental impacts of a product system can be assessed and addressed during product development using a more standardized and precise LCA method. The basis of this method integrates systems engineering tools and a functional analysis based approach to LCA. Using this framework, designers can easily develop, classify, and explore different product designs based on predictive environmental impacts.",Santucci A.; Esterman M.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2015-01-01,Kate Gleason College of Engineering,
Automated import of XML-files containing optimized geometric data to 3D-CAD-models of non-linear integral bifurcated sheet metal parts,"The Collaborative Research Centre 666 has the focus on researching fundamental new methods for the development of optimized products and production processes for integral bifurcated sheet metal parts. Technological innovations have been achieved with respect to new production processes such as linear flow splitting and linear bend splitting as well as to produce products with flexible profiles. The use of state of art product development methodologies can be applied but these are not optimized to deal with the high complexity of the requirements and properties of integral bifurcated sheet metal products. In order to deal with that complexity a new approach of a product development methodology, the algorithm based product development process, has been established. Within the scope of the algorithm based product development methodology a topology optimization, based on mathematical algorithms using product requirements information, is already applied in the conceptual steps of product development process. By using this methodological approach an optimized concept of bifurcated sheet metal can be determined. The results are stored as optimized geometric data in XML-format files. 3D-CAD-Models are generated based on these data. However the import of these data into 3D-CAD-Systems are not fully automated. The developed data model, from earlier works for linear flow splitting and linear bend splitting, does not take into account the variability of the profiles in the third-dimension. In addition the topology optimization does not provide production-orientated design requirements and therefore it does not take into account the production process limits (of linear flow splitting and linear bend splitting). Hence 3D-CAD-Models resulting from the optimized geometric data need to be adapted manually. Therefore new advanced approaches in terms of virtual product development tools need to be explored. This paper describes the development of an interface within the CAD-System Siemens NX which supports the automatic import of XML-files containing the optimized geometric data of non-linear integral bifurcated sheet metal in 3D-CAD-Models. The existing data model is extended considering the requirements of the developed interface in order to represent nonlinear bifurcated profiles. An approach of the interface using the described data model and the NX Open API is introduced and explained.",Martins T.; Albrecht K.; Anderl R.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2015-01-01,Technische Universität Darmstadt,Algorithm based product development process ;  CAD
A cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of the development of innovation capability in undergraduate engineering students,"Multiple research studies have examined the role of the undergraduate engineering curriculum on students' innovation capabilities. The majority of these studies have used crosssectional samples to compare students at the beginning and end of their college careers, and most results have shown that seniors outperform freshmen. In the following paper, we use a combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons to uncover when innovation capabilities grow. Over a two-year period, undergraduate engineering majors at different points in their college careers completed concept generation tasks. Their resulting concepts were scored for originality. While no difference was found from freshman to senior year using a crosssectional comparison, a significant increase in originality was found between separate senior groups at the beginning and end of a capstone course. The difference between the senior groups occurred despite no difference between these students in academic performance or engineering design self-efficacy. In addition, a significant increase in originality was found from junior to senior year using a longitudinal analysis. This increase in originality occurred without corresponding changes in academic performance or engineering design self-efficacy. These results are discussed in relation to prior research regarding the interplay between curricular and individual difference factors in the development of students' innovation capabilities.",Kershaw T.; Peterson R.; McCarthy M.; Williams P.; Young A.; Hölttä-Otto K.; Seepersad C.; Bhowmick S.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2015-01-01,College of Engineering at UMass Dartmouth;Cockrell School of Engineering;Singapore University of Technology and Design;University of Massachusetts Dartmouth,

Factors influencing intention to use mobile technologies for learning among technical universities students,"Mobile technologies offer more than just calling. There are number of innovative features that are crucial and impactful to educational purpose. Despite the importance of understanding factors influencing mobile technologies for learning, this area has received limited research. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate factors influencing intention to use m-learning among students at Malaysian technical universities. The research framework for this research has been adopted from unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to achieve research objectives. A total of 400 set of data was collected from four Malaysia technical universities using purposeful structured random sampling and self-administrated survey questionnaire. AMOS was performed to test whether the model of its good fit to test hypotheses formulated. The results revealed that performance expectancy and self-management of learning are significant related to behavioral intention to use m-learning while effort expectancy, social influence and perceived playfulness do not indicate significant relationship with intention to use mobile technologies for learning among students at Malaysia technical universities. The findings of this study added new understanding as regard to factors influencing students' intention to use m-learning in higher education.",Kim-Soon N.; Ibrahim M.; Ahmad A.; Sirisa N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 26th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Management and Sustainable Economic Competitive Advantage: From Regional Development to Global Growth, IBIMA 2015",2015-01-01,Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman;Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia,AMOS ;  Intention to use m-learning ;  Malaysian technical universities network (MTUN) ;  Mobile technologies ;  UTAUT
Health-related website usability: A preliminary study,"This ongoing research explores the usability of health-related websites in Malaysia. Three websites were evaluated based on various technological factors. Two evaluation methods were applied; using the web diagnostic tools and based on real user experiences. The results indicated that the usability of the websites are at the modest level. Most users are still having problems with believability and trust to share their information in the web. Furthermore, the websites have technical hitches such as containing various errors in its development, low level of popularity in all search engines and the most decisive verdict is one of the websites level of reading is considered difficult. By dint of, a good health-related website should be tested before being implemented in order to secure its quality and to ensure it meets the expectancy of the users.

Understanding and formalization of innovation: A panacea to inefficiency in construction industry project delivery,"Construction industry as a vital sector of any national economy and whose level of activities at any moment in time symbolizes the state of economic development of a nation has, over the years, been variously criticized of inefficiency in its project delivery. The construction industry plays a critical role in the national economy and in its long-run socio-economic development. It is responsible for the development of housing, facilities and infrastructures necessary for national social and economic development. The industry's operation systems therefore need to be revitalized in order to realize expected and even greater economic gains from its activities. Innovation is the most generally accepted and recommended strategies for re-engineering any economic sector in order to meet the customers' demand, market competition and other challenges of the modern businesses. The roles of the built environment professionals (i.e., the consultants) in the realization of construction projects can never be over-emphasized as they are responsible, especially, in its conceptualization, planning and execution and also in the re-engineering of construction projects. Existing literatures show that innovation studies in the construction industry have been generally organisation-based and the few that are firm-specific do not address some critical issues on innovation practices in this vital subsector (consultancy services) of the industry. The paper is therefore aimed at enhancing the understanding and improving innovation practices among consultancy firms in the Construction Industry. The objectives of the study are to review existing literatures on the concept of innovation and its practices and to bring into highlight the need for formalization of innovation practices to achieve greater benefits. The arguments on this paper are derived from PhD research work (in progress) on Assessment of Factors Affecting Innovation Practices among Consultancy Firms in Abuja. The paper concludes that innovation and its formalization is essential for a firm willing to offer satisfactory services to its various clients and become relevant or sustain its relevance in the globalized and competitive market. Key words: Innovation, Construction Industry, Formalization, Consultants.",Adinoyi Y.; Nor'Aini Y.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 26th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Management and Sustainable Economic Competitive Advantage: From Regional Development to Global Growth, IBIMA 2015",2015-01-01,Universiti Sains Malaysia,
Discourse analysis on success and failure during the adoption of an educational information system,"While Information Technology (IT) adoption has been widely discussed in previous studies, it is still a research challenge. In this sense, a neglected research topic is understanding what users say during an IT adoption process. To contribute to this issue, we analyzed the discourses of three Chilean lecturers of first-year engineering courses during a training session of an online quiz system. Methodologically, we used discourse analysis to understand and classify the rhetoric of the users. The findings show some meaningful differences between the speech of users who adopted the system, and the user who did not. The first two users expressed themselves in the first person singular, showing commitment and assertiveness. The other lecturer used neutral and passive statements and was lacking in commitment. His communication was based on asymmetrical and intimidating power relationships. These findings show that understanding the differences in rhetoric between users could help to predict their willingness to either use IT or not. The present paper contributes by giving an answer to prominent scholars, who claim that new methodological perspectives are needed to understand better why users adopt or reject a new system. We would strongly encourage researchers and practitioners to analyze what the users say during an IT adoption process.",Cataldo A.; Alvear S.; Vargas H.; Muñoz N.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 26th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Management and Sustainable Economic Competitive Advantage: From Regional Development to Global Growth, IBIMA 2015",2015-01-01,Universidad de Talca;Universidad de Atacama,Adoption process ;  Discursive analysis ;  IT adoption ;  Small groups
Exploring mobile visualization for diabetic self-care management: A conceptual framework,"Developing countries face continual growth in the occurrence of chronic illnesses, along with a continued burden of the health practitioner confronted with increasingly complex patient data. Moreover, patients' also face disappointment due to waiting time and lack of contact between office hours visits. Hence, innovative application of mobile technology on health care delivery and monitoring offer great promise for improving the quality of life. This study concentrates on determining how information visualization use in mobile diabetic self-care management can assist in improving patient health. The focal point of the study is to examine the stakeholders' requirements to support effective knowledge transfer through information visual and to establish a standard guideline of icon and colorcoded that making sense in managing diabetic record by using mobile visual representation. The study will adopt an ethnographic research approach for the requirements analysis where data will be collected through observation and interviews. Furthermore, this ethnographic method will complement usercentered design with respect to understanding the users. The result is expected to support the reliable and effective model required for mobile visualization analytic for diabetic self-care management system consequently will assist in improving the quality of life of diabetic patients while larger social and health care implications will be reflected upon.",Uzir N.; Khairuddin I.; Ahmad N.; Khan M.; Abdullah S.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 26th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Management and Sustainable Economic Competitive Advantage: From Regional Development to Global Growth, IBIMA 2015",2015-01-01,Faculty of Information Management,Diabetic self-care management ;  Information visualization ;  Mobile visualization ;  Personal health care
Importance of service provision by manufactures,"Manufacturers of tangible products need to enlarge their product offering to be able to satisfy customers. Therefore companies often focus on customer services. Adding services to the products to extend the total offering through services are possible ways of acting to eroding product margins. Customer services are able to help to extend life cycles, develop long-term relationship that lock out competitors, increase revenue, etc. The aim of the paper is to find out a) if manufacturers of electric equipment and electronic components in the Czech Republic perceive service provision impact to their total company revenue and b) main findings based on correlation analysis focused on the Service Offering and Importance of services. The producers of electric equipment and electronic components were chosen for the research. Manufacturers comply with the Czech industry classification CZ-NACE 27 and CZ-NACE 26. The segments are extremely important for Czech industry nowadays, especially because of many companies being subcontractors for the car industry and mechanical engineering. The questionnaire in the form of the Likert scale was prepared to gather information about customer services. The respondents were usually directors or managers, e.g. employees with high competencies of knowing customer services in this particular market. Total of 60 SME were included in the survey.

A knowledge based system for element recognition in 2D construction drawings for an automated bills of quantities,"Estimating is one of the critical success factors in construction projects. In common practice, estimating is a solo activity carried at pre construction phase using the construction drawings. The engineering drawing specifications, the past experience, and previous records references help the quantity surveyors to produce the bills of quantities manually. However the market available estimating software need manual key-in about the drawing elements as the automation of estimating directly from the construction drawings is critical. This is due to various issues namely no algorithm to recognise the primitive symbols of the two dimensional (2D) drawings into construction elements, random practice of drawing specifications, and lack of standardized specificatons in 2D drawings and so on. This study developed a prototype in-built with a new knowledge based algorithm to recognize the drawing primitive symbols of lines, arcs, text and other sysmbols into construction elements in 2D drawings. The beam element drawing is selected randomly for this element recognition. The element recognition method follows namely i) extraction of the drawing attributes from the 2D drawing; ii) identification of the construction elements from the extracted drawing attributes; iii) classification of the construction element's attributes into parametric values; and iv) interpretation of the parametric values into bills of quantities. The prototype has been validated with real time commercial drawing for its element recognition performance to produce the bills of quantities. In conclusion, the prototype being developed by this research produces bills of quantities through auto element recognition from the 2D drawing successfully.",Muthuveerappan C.; Minhans A.; Samsudin S.; Mohammed A.; Majid M.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 26th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Management and Sustainable Economic Competitive Advantage: From Regional Development to Global Growth, IBIMA 2015",2015-01-01,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Bills of quantities ;  Element recognition ;  Estimating

Examining flexibility in Scrum under a scientific approach - A survey study,"As both business and technological environments change are at an increasing rate, flexibility has become a critical issue for project management in general and software development projects in particular. Software development projects took an important turn after the emergence of agile software development methods. Agility offers more flexibility as far as requirements and change management are concerned. In this study, the focus is placed on one of the most popular agile software development methods: Scrum. The goal of this research is to study and find the rigid and flexible parts of Scrum under a scientific approach. This means referring to mostly used taxonomies and concepts regarding software development processes and business process flexibility that can be found in literature. For this, we used a survey-based research approach, adapting questions that required advanced scientific knowledge to daily practices and examples that can be understand by Scrum professionals.",Mejri A.; Ghannouchi S.; Martinho R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 26th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Management and Sustainable Economic Competitive Advantage: From Regional Development to Global Growth, IBIMA 2015",2015-01-01,Ecole Nationale des Sciences de l'Informatique;Universidade do Porto,Change ;  Flexibility ;  Scrum framework ;  Software development process
Education of maritime doctoral students as part of international university network,"Aalto University, together with four other universities, has received significant funding for an international Research Centre of Excellence for Arctic Shipping and Operations from Lloyd's Register Foundation (LRF), a UK registered charity that invests in science, engineering and technology for public benefit, worldwide.. The Centre is headed by the Aalto University (Finland), in partnership with the Hamburg University of Technology (Germany), the University of Helsinki (Finland), the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Norway) and the Memorial University of Newfoundland (Canada). The Centre will support 15 doctoral dissertations on risk in Arctic operations over a period of five years. The Centre is the first of its kind in the Nordic Countries and the only centre concentrating on Arctic challenges. The funding provided by LRF is a very significant contribution to the activities of the consortium allowing it to continue to develop global expertise in the challenging operational environment owing to the long distances involved, the large fluctuation in ice conditions, and the unpredictable behaviour of ice. The breakthrough innovations are only possible through on-going research and development, in which theoretical modelling, laboratory tests and full-scale observations are in balance, which can be achieved most efficiently by international networking. The mobility of the doctoral students has key importance for the success of the project. This paper will describe the basic principles of organizing the mobility of the doctoral students and analyse the first experiences gathered from this mobility. The network of the students and their thesis topics will be described together with main links between the studied topics so that the overall challenging targets of the research activities can be achieved.",Kujala P.; Veitch B.; Ehlers S.; Leira B.; Khan F.; Vanhatalo J.,Conference Proceeding,"RINA, Royal Institution of Naval Architects - Education and Professional Development of Engineers in the Maritime Industry 2015, Papers",2015-01-01,Aalto University;Memorial University of Newfoundland;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Hamburg University of Technology;Helsingin Yliopisto,
Risk management in manufacturing smes in South Africa,"Risk Management (RM) in Manufacturing Small and Medium Enterprises (mSMEs) has received limited attention in academic literature and has been viewed as a deficiency in these organisations. SME's are often the source of innovation, producing customised products in niche markets in a flexible manner and are hence important for the sustainable development of emerging economies. SME's, however, may be less sustainable and less competitive than large firms because they have limited management and business expertise, lack adequate financing and are subject to cumbersome regulatory and bureaucratic requirements. Additionally, continuously changing and rapidly evolving political, economic and social environments in general, supply chain disruptions that are unplanned or business environmental disruptions, such as, transportation delays and port stoppages due to strikes or accidents, supplier incapacitation due to fires or earth quakes or floods may contribute to their perceived vulnerability. Thus, to be sustainable and remain competitive, SME's while vulnerable to risks, need to manage these risks. The premise of the study is that the risk management strategies applied by SMEs are innovative and, thus, can provide valuable insights. The research aims to discover more about the risk management practices that have been developed by SMEs that have survived through and continue to operate despite the challenges they face on a daily basis. This paper explores the nature of Risk Management in four well-established (+10 years in operation) mSMEs in the Steel and Engineering Industrial sector. A case study approach is employed where semi-structured interviews with the owner-managers, survey results and walk-through observations of the mSME manufacturing facilities are utilised to generate qualitative data. Data is analysed through content coding and analysis. The findings, although limited to only 4 SMEs, are that external risks in the form of regulatory requirements, lack of skills and labour unrest feature most dominantly among the owner-managers. The demand side of the Supply Chain is more risky than the supply side, while the internal environment of the firm does not pose significant risks. Two key practices across the firms were identified as dominant risk mitigating modes of operation. These are the ""Building of Relationships"" and ""Business Continuity"". Risk perceptions differed across the owner-managers, but all agreed that their decision-making regarding risk was influenced by their knowledge and experience.",Sunjka B.; Emwanu B.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,"University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg",Manufacturing ;  Owner-managers ;  Risk Management ;  SMEs
The emergence of innovation function in Brazilian companies,"In last decades, innovation has acquired increasing importance for organizations, especially in industrial sectors. However, unlike cases in which innovation occurs sporadically and randomly, special challenges are faced by organizations that are engaged in systematic generation of innovations. In this line, a set of initiatives in large companies seems to point towards the creation of workgroups dedicated to innovation management activities. Taking the concept of organizational function as an identifiable group with a specific mission within an organization, some recent studies have argued that innovation emerges as a distinctly new organizational function. In this context the central question posed in this study is: what characterizes the innovation function within organizations, considering different initiatives undertaken by large industrial companies engaged in building systematic innovation capability in Brazil? The study discusses concepts of innovation and the management approaches found in the literature relating to the challenge of systematizing innovation within organizations. Case studies were conducted in fifteen large industrial companies in Brazil that, except for two control cases, have workgroups dedicated to activities related to innovation management. The analysis of these cases and their convergences reveals key characteristics of the innovation function (IF) that emerges in these companies. Such characteristics are divided into six perspectives, viz, general purpose, origins, legitimacy and guidance, people, assignments and future perspectives. Finally, among the main implications, the findings serve as a basis for new corporate initiatives aimed at implementing regular and systematic innovation capability. The characterization of innovation function also adds new elements to existing knowledge on how companies can build and maintain innovation capability. For future research, some of the proposed paths are: deepening the comprehension on the assignments of innovation function and identifying the ways by which innovation function can be legitimized in organizations.",Bagno R.; Salerno M.; Dias A.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais;Universidade de São Paulo,Industrial Companies ;  Innovation Management ;  Organizational Functions ;  Systematic Innovation
Capabilities-driven innovation management™: Conceptual framework to manage the innovation ecosystem,"Almost all CEOs and executive managers agree that innovation should be a top strategic priority within their organizations. But, a large percentage of corporations are still unsuccessful with the implementation of innovation management within their organizations for various reasons: many are still in the infancy stage of their implementation effort; underestimated the complexity and scope; or there exist a knowledge gap. Current industry research and literature build a strong case that disruptive or breakthrough innovation has become an absolute requirement for sustainable growth and survival. To support this theory, the management of innovation as an additional corporate business capability must increasingly become more important as a critical factor for corporate success. This paper revisited competitive advantage, core competency, capabilities and innovation process model theories from academic literature, and intersected the knowledge with empirical data collected as the current state of innovation management within corporations at a global scale. The research identified ten innovation management capabilities with strong interdependencies and critical relationships to support innovation successfully within corporations. The Capabilities-Driven Innovation Management™ conceptual framework was then developed with the goal to introduce a flexible map, consisting of strongly interrelated capabilities to simplify the understanding and implementation of innovation management capabilities and the management of a corporate innovation system and ecosystem. The expected end result of this framework is to increase successful innovations, competitive advantage, growth and the generation of wealth for employees, shareholders and all other stakeholders.",Bouwer L.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,North-West University;NECSA,Capabilities ;  Framework ;  Implementation ;  Innovation ;  Management
Creating a renewable energy ecosystem: Evidence from India,"This paper develops a conceptual framework for the establishment and evolution of new industrial ecosystems drawing on theories of biological ecosystems (Vihervaara et al., 2010), industrial ecosystems and national systems of innovation. We argue that just as species diversity is critical for the provision of multiple services, ecosystem stability and resilience (Mitchell et al., 2013), diversity of organizational type (a range of organizations) may be necessary for the stability and resilience of an industrial ecosystem. Using case study methodology to examine the newly emergent renewable energy sector in India, the paper provides evidence to support the framework and suggests that organizations exhibit four types of diversity in this ecosystem: (1) Diversity of function; (2) diversity of form; (3) diversity of interactions; and (4) diversity of knowledge. Moreover, each organizational type in the ecosystem varies in prominence over time as the ecosystem evolves. These findings have important implications for the adoption and establishment of new technologies and the management of technology life cycle.",Surie G.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Adelphi University,
Technology roadmapping and roadmaps in a context of developing countries: A conceptual framework,"The current technology roadmapping theory is typically based on third generation innovation models of the 1970s that couple linear models of technology push and market pull. There are incremental improvements to this field although the original philosophy on technology roadmapping and technology roadmaps is still prevailing. Unfortunately, the current technology roadmapping framework doesn't address sixth generation innovation models where there are complex interactions at a systemic level. This paper presents a conceptual framework for the technology roadmapping process and technology roadmap development for developing countries. The framework addresses the gaps in technology roadmapping and technology roadmap theory for technology catch-up strategies. It is derived from the literature on technology roadmaps' format and purpose; technology roadmapping processes; transition management and complex systems theory. The framework proposes the need for transition orientated technology roadmaps in case of developing countries and technology catch-up strategies. These types of roadmaps initially focus on nurturing several niche innovations, with emerging technologies as the major form of technology areas. Through technology roadmap review and updates, the promising niche innovations are selected for upscaling. The paper seeks to encourage wider adoption of technology roadmaps as a technology planning tool by firms and governments in developing countries. The literature on other technology planning and analysis tools such as technology foresighting have started to focus on customised frameworks for developing countries, although this gap has not been addressed from a technology roadmapping perspective. Further work is planned in future for testing and validation of this proposed framework.",Letaba P.; Pretorius M.; Pretorius L.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Pretoria;National Advisory Council on Innovation,Complex systems ;  Developing countries ;  Framework ;  Technology roadmap ;  Transition management
Measuring the level of technological innovation,"Innovation is the foundation that helps to ensure a competitive edge, both economical and in the military. Several types of innovation are defined in order to provide a better understanding of what innovation really entails and what drives it. The main drivers are internal and external to an organisation where the level of collaboration with other organisations and institutions plays an important role. The internal drivers refer to the strategy of the organisation, the innovation climate and the leadership, the entrepreneurship and the resources of the organisation. The external drivers are more related to government's role. Innovation itself is not measureable and must therefore be linked to a pre-determined set of criteria. In using specific frameworks, one has to determine the level of innovation as well as which drivers are applied in order to make it possible to measure the feasibility of innovation efforts. The resources that need to be allocated in terms of funding and personnel with reference to the effort must also be determined. For this paper 27 projects, from a typical defence related industry, were used and evaluated to measure the level of innovation that is taking place per project and in the specific organisation. Three aspects were measured; namely ideas, processes and products. A second framework was drafted to measure the drivers or environment in which the innovation took place in terms of internal drivers, external drivers and the level of collaboration. The research results provided a sound basis for the identification and measurement of the elements and drivers of innovation. It was found that the two frameworks are practical instruments that can be used to validate the innovation capability of an organisation, providing a deep insight into the level of innovation and the environment of innovation in the defence research organisation.",Smit D.; Pretorius T.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Pretoria,Drivers of innovation ;  Innovation ;  Measurement of innovation ;  Types of innovation
A framework towards an open innovation approach for SMES,"The literature indicates that implementing Open Innovation as a formal management practice in organisations remains a challenge. Open Innovation (OI) is receiving increased focus in academia and industry, but practical implementation and application guidance for users are still limited. This is even more relevant for the application of Open Innovation in small and medium sized enterprises (SME). Open Innovation is still largely an emerging field of research in academia, with larger organisations receiving most of the focus. In this paper the authors introduce a framework for the development of an Open Innovation approach for SMEs, based on models and frameworks from the literature. Following a design sciences method, the authors review various models and frameworks on innovation and general implementation best practices, and deduct core elements that can be applied in an Open Innovation Framework. The framework is based on a continuous improvement cycle that aims to mature the Open Innovation capability within the organisation through various iterations. The framework comprises of four main components, six sub-components and twenty three core elements. The four main components of the framework are: Plan and Prepare for OI, Perform OI, Measure and Evaluate OI, and Improve and Mature OI. The framework suggested in this paper can be used towards the development of an Open Innovation approach for SMEs. Such an approach should include descriptive elements for the implementation and application of Open Innovation within the context of SMEs.",Krause W.; Schutte C.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Stellenbosch University,Innovation Management ;  Open Innovation ;  SMEs
When innovation supported by Fab Labs becomes a tool for territorial economic development: Example of the first mobile Fab Lab in France,"The popularity of digital spaces as a support for the innovation process has been widely demonstrated and described in literature. The proliferation of DS (Digital Spaces) in various countries, whether in public institutions (universities, engineering schools, local authorities, etc.) or private organisations (big companies, SMEs) is a fact. Following this wave, in 2010 the University of Lorraine set up a Living Lab recognised by the European network ENOLL and then a Fab Lab in 2011 as defined by Neil Gershenfeld from MIT. However, even if these spaces are doing a good job in their functions of accelerating collaborative innovation, it is clear that they are mostly located in cities, serving a privileged type of users and very often not SMEs. At the same time, there is also an exponential increase in the offer of seminars on creativity and innovation support, or conferences on the piloting of the innovation process, but still in these same urban settings. In fact, a whole range of companies, especially rural SMEs, is forgotten in the offer of services to improve their ability to create and innovate. Based on these two observations and on a survey of 36 SMEs' needs regarding the definition of a dynamic of innovation, a school of engineers located in a French city set up a ""mobile Fab Lab"" in 2014. The present paper will show how this device can allow rural SMEs to access 3D technologies to support their creative and innovative processes. Indeed, this innovative truck can deploy a surface of 20m2 in which creativity software, tactile tables, 3D printers, scanners and laser cutting are available to these entrepreneurs and industrials that are located very far from the urban centres and research centres. We will comment on our experiences after the first months of working experimentation and will propose some improvements and challenges to address.",Morel L.; Dupont L.; Lhoste P.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Université de Lorraine,Additive manufacturing ;  Innovative processes ;  Mobile Fab Lab ;  Rural SMEs/SMIs ;  Smart rurality
SI 2 - Trajectory of change: Remodelling India's national innovation system for sustainable development & inclusive growth,"India has been pursuing a unique developmental path. Initially it followed a mixed economy concept and now attempting to bypass manufacturing stage and leapfrog from predominantly agrarian to service oriented economy. Along the course of liberalisation since 1991, India has registered an accelerated rate of growth with GDP reaching up to 8% per annum. While the growth may have helped in poverty reduction at some level it has not been without attendant problems such as increasing uneven economic growth, disparities in income individually and regionally and pressure on environment. Innovative industrial development is the focus of policy measures in order to ensure a continued success of India's unusual development path and to mitigate attendant problems risen out of recent economic growth. In this paper we follow the framework of Innovation presented by the National Innovation System paradigm. National Innovation System approach has been found to be an effective methodology of studying the economic development of nations particularly those that fall in the category of developing economies. NIS approach is particularly significant in the context India's recent attempts to restructure its Innovation System. We examine changes occurring in the innovation paradigm and India's trajectory as evidenced from the emerging organizational architecture and institutional arrangements through a survey of studies. In order to set down the nature of the emerging system, the paper focuses on few interrelated issues. To understand and define the conceptual framework of the Innovation. System prevailing since 1950s until the 1980s. understanding the transition and the nature of the emerging NIS and. to understand the nature of challenges and analyse the impact of policy measures to restructure the NIS. to explain the need, the nature and relevance of SI 2 innovations. Delineate the features of emerging NIS For most part of the data the reliance is put on India's Innovation Portal, various studies by international organisations such as the World Bank, IMF, OECD, UN agencies etc. writings and speeches by planners involved in creating this system. Mental models that define the conceptual framework are inexorably determined by the culture and civilisation of the place. Indian policy perspectives strongly reflect this impact. In order to delineate the characteristic features of the new paradigm we make a comparative analysis of the old and the new paradigm. For the final part of this analysis we make use of the recent data and statistics proffered by the public and international agencies. In the final analysis an attempt is made to consolidate the evolution of all institutional structure and to present an integrated view of the emerging NIS of India.",Rawat A.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Institute of Business Management and Technology,Inclusive growth ;  Innovation system ;  Sustainability
Pharmaceutical industry development in brazilian health innovation system,"Given the importance of the health industrial complex, which is extensively technological, and the possibility of increasing the competitiveness of their systems through innovation, this research aims to present the structure and development of the pharmaceutical industry within the health innovation system in Brazil. To achieve such goal we used secondary data obtained by means of publications and sites which were organized with the objective of research. The results indicate that, despite the potential for innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, in Brazil there is still a gap in the field, with low investment in R & D for domestic innovation, which makes it dependent on imports and foreign technology. The support policies in innovation and legislation can help this process by providing resources, mainly financial, for R & D investments. Also, the partnerships with universities are critical to research development, making the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry more competitive. This can also be achieved through the production of generic drugs, which have, in the smaller industries, a suitable structure for its production.",De Souza Bronzeri M.; Tonet E.; Lobo R.; Da Cunha S.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Estadual do Norte do Paraná;Universidade Positivo,Innovation system ;  Innovation system health ;  Pharmaceutical industry
The influence of supply chain sources of technology and knowledge on innovation in developing country automotive component manufacturing,"This study seeks to establish the influence that supply chain sources of knowledge have on innovation within developing country automotive component manufacturing. Innovation research indicates that most firms learn from external parties as part of their innovation initiatives. Learning occurs due to knowledge deficits resulting from an elevated level of innovation the firm is aiming to achieve or uncertainty facing the firm, whilst an important source of learning is from within the supply chain viz. suppliers, competitors and clients. Understanding these relationships can significantly increase the chances of innovation and could assist policymakers in improving the effectiveness of innovation support schemes. Data from a 2009 study was used, where semi-structured interviews were held with automotive component manufacturers in the Pune area in India, Beijing area in China and in South Africa. An updated survey was conducted with manufacturers in the Durban area. The hypotheses were tested using chi-squared testing to establish association and multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine correlation. The differences between the three regions are discussed as a guide to firms, particularly in South Africa and other lesser developed economies, on what can be learnt from successes of firms in the automotive component manufacturing sector in more advanced developing countries. Statistical analysis of the secondary data corroborates four of the proposed hypotheses for at least one country, illustrating that the supply chain sources of technology and knowledge do indeed have some influence on innovation.",Amojee D.; Steyn J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Pretoria,Automotive component manufacturing ;  Innovation ;  Innovation process ;  Supply chain learning
A mathematical basis for innovation,"This paper will present a mathematical model forthhhhhhhabout innovation at various organizational levels. To begin with a series of equations will be derived that will provide deeper insight into the nature of the system we live in. In particular the equations will provide some insight into the inherent innovation bias of our system, the nature of each point in the system, the broad architectural forces behind the development of organizations, the inherent uniqueness of each organization, the way to think about varying cultures or organizations, and the inherent dynamism of our system. These equations will assist in putting 'science' into the 'art' of innovation. Three basic and ubiquitous states of organization-the physical, the vital the mental-will be built on to suggest six equations that provide insight into the fundamental organizational states of stagnation, stability, entropy, energy, sustainability, and fragmentation. These equations provide insight into the inherent bias of the system to always re-organize based on a more comprehensive possibility. Equations for the characteristics or properties embedded in a single point will then be derived. The 'point' captures the inherent intelligence that appears to exist in the system, or in any smaller part of it. Hence, equations for the fundamental power, knowledge, presence, and nurturing hypothesized to exist in each point of our system will be derived. Following this, sets for each of the four characteristics embedded in a point will be derived, that in effect suggest the architectural forces that can create and develop any type of organization. The hypothesis is that every organization, whether a person, team, corporation, market, or country is unique and that this uniqueness can be specified in terms of elements of the derived sets for power, knowledge, presence, and nurturing. Hence, an equation for the unique 'signature' of an organization will be derived. Further, the equation for uniqueness will itself be governed by an equation for the emergence of the uniqueness. Having defined an equation for the uniqueness of an organization it now becomes possible to also derive equations for the culture of an organization. Hence, two equations are derived-one for a monoculture and one for a diverse culture. We now turn full circle and derive equations for the fundamental states of our system we had begun with: physical, vital, mental, and integral (from the family of nurturing). The derived equations indicate the dynamism in-built into each of these states, and indicate too the conditions for the incarnation or interchange of the meta-levels with the observed states. Finally, we derive equations for Stagnation and for Dynamic Growth, based on the dynamism inherent in the four states. These equations will provide a framework for thinking about and managing innovation at varying scales of organizational complexity.",Malik P.; Pretorius L.; Winzker D.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Pretoria;Deep Order Technologies,Equation for dynamic growth ;  Equation for stagnation ;  Equation for system knowledge ;  Equation for system nurturing ;  Equation for system power ;  Equation for system presence ;  Mathematics of innovation ;  Organizational architectural forces ;  Signature of an organization

The conceptual role of cyber systems in virtual R&D,"These days Corporate Research and Development (R&D) and innovation activities have become increasingly integrated in global production and innovation networks. While the internationalization of corporate R&D and innovation is not new, its speed and extent have increased in recent years in response to increased global competition, technological change, and the availability and costs of skills, Unlike the past that firms are believed that keeping their information and knowledge back-door can be their success secret, Nowadays by progress of science and technology, Open innovation appears which help to share information and knowledge causes sharing profits at the same of risks. For this reason, the old structure of R&D cannot quickly synchronize with new technology and require the most modern strategy. Hence, in this paper we have decided to demonstrate changing in the structure of R&D and mature to Virtual R&D by using cyber systems that integrates with physical systems and can be ready as tools for empower virtual R&D. In fact, Cyber systems such as social network play a significant role in enterprises with cost and permanent labor reduction, progress acceleration and easy access to experts and resources.",Jabalbarezisarbijan A.; Golhosseini S.; Marangi F.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Qeshm Voltage Company;Expert of Foreign Trade of Qeshm Voltage Company;Khaje Nasir Tossi University,Cyber systems ;  Cyber-physical systems ;  Open innovation ;  Virtual R&D
Labor in post-industrial society: A reading of drucker and de masi theories,"The post-industrial society (for De Masi, 1999) refers to the period in which the dissemination of knowledge was essential for competitiveness in organizations. The aim of the paper is to compare the work of post-industrial society through the theories of Drucker and De Masi. The research is descriptive analytical approach, justified by the published literature. There was a systematic review to compare the works of Drucker (1999a) ""The post-capitalist society"" and De Masi (1999) ""The future of work: fatigue and leisure in post-industrial society"" to establish the similarities and differences. Drucker and De Masi formulated their theories about the same time (in the late twentieth century). Works converge as in the description of the knowledge society, both deal with the transition from capitalist society is stimulated for a new configuration in the production of knowledge. Drucker (1999a) describes the historical evolution of the events changed significantly as relations of production and capitalist work a decentralized production, specialization of labor and government coercion. Already, De Masi (1999) emphasizes the science and technology engines of development of knowledge society, and the knowledge revolution, the revolution of the scientific method. At this stage, there is a concern with the nature of organizations and the social. We conclude that, despite addressing the same social event, De Masi and Drucker differ as to work in the post-industrial society. Drucker emphasizes the evolution of industrial society to post-industrial society based on the despotism of capital (predominance of skilled labor) and knowledge as a main driver of change. The economy is based on government restructuring and permanent supply of skilled labor to follow technical and organizational innovations. For De Masi, the same transition was driven by the evolution of technology and the free time to technical progress, inducing workers to produce creatively to meet the market demand driven by globalization.",Picinin C.; De Fátima Stankowitz R.; Proni M.; Pedroso B.; Rasoto V.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Estadual de Campinas;Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná;Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa,Capitalism ;  Knowledge society ;  Post-industrial society
An evaluation of ehealth systems implementation frameworks for sustainability in resource constrained environments: A literature review,"The burden of disease is higher by far in developing countries than in the developed world. Although significant progress has been made towards health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the past years, developing countries still lag behind in achieving these targets. Some innovative ways of solving healthcare problems have been introduced to improve healthcare services and achieve healthcare goals. Information and communication technology (ICT) for health, or eHealth, is one of the innovations that have been brought to the healthcare sector to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, access and quality of the healthcare system. It is believed that eHealth can help reduce the healthcare budget and relieve the shortage of healthcare professionals. This is done through remote diagnosis, remote monitoring of patients' conditions and the electronic sharing of patients' medical records. It has been reported that many ICT for health systems could not demonstrate sustainability beyond the pilot phase, or after the seed money of the project had dried up. Some of the sustainability challenges of eHealth implementation in resource constrained environments are related to weak ICT infrastructure; shortage of funding; lack of technical skill to support technologies brought from the developed world; and the introduction of technologies that were not innovated in the context of developing countries. Although the implementation of successful eHealth systems is a global challenge, developing countries exhibited much more failures than the developed ones. Several eHealth implementation frameworks have been reported on literatures. However, this paper assesses the ability of these frameworks to ensure sustainability of eHealth systems in resource constrained settings. The evaluation framework for sustainability of eHealth systems considers the three pillars of sustainability (social, environmental and economic factors) to evaluate eHealth system's operational environment, and technological factor to assess the systems of interest. The majority of eHealth sustainability factors link to the environments in which systems function. It is also observed that most eHealth success challenges are associated with system environments that differ significantly in developing and developed worlds. All four eHealth frameworks evaluated in this paper address the technological factors; but they either lack depth, or miss some of the system environment factors (social, economic and environment). Therefore, an eHealth framework's ability to ensure sustainability in resource constrained environments depends not only on technology, but is also determined by the social, economic and environmental aspects of the system environment.",Fanta G.; Pretorius L.; Erasmus L.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Pretoria;The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,EHealth framework ;  EHealth Implementation ;  EHealth systems ;  Resource constrained environment ;  Sustainability

Cooperative venture capital model: Engineering an innovation pipeline,"Overcoming the various ""valleys of death"" in the commercialisation process is one of the complex problems faced when supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. The creation of a pipeline of investable opportunities is needed by investors to diversify investing risks.

The oil and gas innovation system in Brazil: Characterization and evaluation,"The exploration of fossil fuel involves great technical complexity, given the large number of interdependent technologies and the very extensive knowledge base needed. Furthermore, there is significant motivation in the use of advanced technologies in the upstream oil industry given the competitive pressures to reduce costs. On the other hand, there are estimates that there will be a large increase, in the near future, in Brazil's oil production, resulting from increased production of fields for which expansions are planned or underway. This indicates a clear need for a major effort in innovation. This work will look at the Innovation System of the Brazilian oil and gas industry with two main objectives: (i) to map and characterize, through the theory of National Innovation Systems (NIS), the main dimensions and the integrating factors of this innovation system; and (ii) assess the perception of managers of supplier companies, about the effectiveness of such system, highlighting its advantages and difficulties. To meet the first objective, we performed a literature search in order to characterize the main dimensions of the Brazilian System of Innovation in the chosen industry. Such search resulted in a framework that describes the interaction of companies with the six dimensions identified, i.e., Productive Sector, Public Sector, Science & Technology System, Educational System, Financial System and External Sector. Subsequently, we conducted a survey with the direct supplier companies of the industry, in order to (1) describe such companies; (2) understand their views about the level of development of the six subsystems identified in the literature review; and (3) understand their views about the importance of each subsystem for the innovation process. The Productive Sector appears as the most relevant to this Innovation System, followed by the Educational System and the Financial System. At the lower end are the Science & Technology System, the Public Sector and the External Sector. This should not be confused with the level of development of each sector, as perceived by the 100 companies in the sample (response rate 35.6 %). The Educational System is one of the biggest problems in the country. The main weaknesses identified relate to the low availability of skilled labor. In the Public Sector, the main problem identified was the issue of taxation. The System of Science & Technology is considered a central dimension in many NIS, but in the case of the oil and gas industry, what really drives innovation is learning-by-doing. The Financial System showed a low level of development due to the negative perception of small and medium size companies. Finally, with respect to the External Sector, a large imbalance between imports and exports was identified. The Productive Sector received the best evaluation in the study, with its performance being directly related to the degree of general cooperation in the sector. The Public Sector best feature has to do with the role of public policies established by PROMINP (a Federal program for the development of the Brazilian Oil and Gas industry.",Hanna F.; Neto C.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,Brazil ;  Education ;  Innovation systems ;  Oil and gas
How to adapt the innovation process to the context and objectives of the project,"Literature about innovation attests to a high variability at the new product development process (NPDP) level. Numerous models are proposed to describe the innovation process, including: -Kline and Rosenberg and the Fuzzy Front-Ends-The idea life cycle-The open innovation model-The Stage Gate model However, even taking into account these meta-models, the description at the micro-level of the sequence of tasks and methodologies during the period between idea emergence and new product launching is scarcely identical, considering companies of the same sector and similar projects. Hence, adjusting the NPDP to the context and objectives of the company represents a key success factor. Consequently, one theoretical challenge consists in finding interrelations between some initial characteristics of an innovative project and recommendations in the progress of the development phase. This requires the identification of some descriptive criteria characterising an innovative project, focusing on criteria that are documented and evaluable from the start, more precisely the fuzzy front ends of the project. Then the objective is to define methodology assisting decision-making in the field of new development process design based on these descriptive variables. The research approach integrates a literature review about evaluation criteria available during the fuzzy front ends, including the degree of newness and the inner impacts of the new project (changes to product, production, sales). Secondly, choosing the stage gate model as a reference, a list of best project management practices is elaborated and a maturity grid is defined for each of these practices. Finally, an expert consultation is conducted and a multi-criteria algorithm established in order to define minimum maturity thresholds for each practice according to the outcomes of the evaluation of the descriptive criteria of the project. This paper provides the main theoretical aspects. The limitations of the research are discussed, including the necessary evolution of the methodology.",Boly V.; Camargo M.; Galvez D.; Claire J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Université de Lorraine;Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie de Lorraine,Complexity ;  Innovation ;  Newness ;  Project ;  Stage-gate
Valuation of innovation projects with high uncertainty: Reasons behind the implementation of real options,"Many papers have been discussing the nonadherence of classical financial tools-like net present value (NPV), return on investment (ROI), discounted cash flow in general (DCF) to the evaluation of innovation projects involving high uncertainty. There are an attempt to use some new tools to cope at least partially with the challenge of valuation and selection of right projects. Among these tools, we can find the real options approach. However, they all require data that are unavailable for most radical innovation projects. The later point leads us to the following research question: why firms are looking for new tools for valuation of projects and which are the effective questions behind it? Based on five in-depth case studies based on grounded research in companies in Brazil searching for radical innovation (three Brazilian owned-two multinationals, one startup company; one multinational American owned), where we have longitudinally accompanied specific projects, we propose a discussion on the main issues behind the search for such techniques, and which are the conditions for their successful introduction in an organization. We identify three main issues behind the valuation problem: a) portfolio management (traditional issue); b) commercialization issue (pricing of the technology or price of the company); c) internal disputes for budget. Our conclusions show that the critical success factors for a implementation of real options are: a) the involvement of other people than R&D (e.g. finance, marketing, etc.); b) building capabilities on managing uncertainties; and c) development of competences on identifying and defining the possible decision points where to exercise the options (abandon, continue, or improve the project).",Salerno M.; De Vasconcelos Gomes L.; Brasil V.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade de São Paulo,Innovation management ;  Radical innovation management ;  Uncertainty management ;  Valuation of innovation projects
A model of a research and entrepreneurial university for developing nations: The case of Nile University,"Education is the most important sector influencing development of nations. The experience of the USA, several European countries, and more recently of South Korea, India and China are but few examples of the positive influence gained from attention to education on economic growth and improvement of the standards of living. All components of the education system chain from preschool to primary, secondary, tertiary and graduate education are important. Higher education, however, can provide greater value added particularly when combined with research and innovation. Research universities have a significant role to play in this regard particularly if combined with an entrepreneurial culture. Research entrepreneurial universities not only participate in education and dissemination of knowledge but also create knowledge and innovations. They give special attention to technology transfer and entrepreneurship with direct impact on economic return and development. Developing countries and in particular African countries face many challenges that must be addressed without delay. These include education, health care, transportation, logistics, security, information and communication, energy, water supplies, environment and many more. Research entrepreneurial universities consider these challenges as fertile opportunities to tackle through relevant curricula, research and technology transfer. This paper presents a model of a new university established recently in Egypt called Nile University (NU). This model can be a useful one for similar effort in Africa and many developing countries. The author relies on personal experience gained in establishing the University in Egypt where he serves as founding president. The model is an independent, nonprofit research and entrepreneurial institution of higher learning. The university conceptual design is based on the management of technology philosophy for development and wealth creation. The university philosophy in Education, research and focus on graduate education is explained. The emphasis on entrepreneurship education and promotion qualifies it to be a truly entrepreneurial university.",Khalil T.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Nile University,Culture of knowing ;  Development ;  Education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Learning culture ;  Research university ;  Wealth creation

The evolution of quality management systems to assist manufcturing entrepreneurs in incubation clusters,"Quality management systems are important for any organization to sustain growth, develop technologies and to manage innovation. However, the cost of quality can make it challenging for start-up enterprises to be competitive. South Africa needs to establish successful incubation models that can assist the country's government to reach key economic development milestones. The transformation of quality management systems in these incubation clusters to assist start-up enterprises is still not clearly understood. A quality management framework can assist to recognise the life cycle position of an incubation cluster and the phases to grow from a start-up into established value streams. In this study several manufacturing incubators in South Africa were visited to conduct an incubator quality management systems capability analysis. The stage of cluster growth of these incubators were plotted onto the quality management framework. Current best practices are highlighted and future work discussed.",Jura D.; Oosthuizen G.; Pretorius J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Stellenbosch University;University of Johannesburg,Incubation ;  Quality management systems ;  Sustainable growth
The empirical study of the impact of R&D human resource investment on innovation performance,"High-tech firms have been the main impetus of economic growth and prosperity, innovation is the key to high-tech firms' development. So an exploration of the influencing factors of high-tech firms' innovation performance can serve as a reference in promoting national and regional economic development. With the data collected from the 166 high-tech firms, the impact of R&D human resource investment on innovation performance are explored from the resource-based view. The R&D human resource investment is measured by four dimensions, namely R&D human resource intensity and quality, R&D human resource training and compensation. The innovation performance is measured by the number of authorized utility patents and new product sales respectively. By using modified Cobb-Douglas production function and Multilevel linear regression analysis. The results indicate that R&D human resource investment has more significant influence on authorized utility patents than on new product revenue compared with R&D expenditure investment. In particular, R&D human resource intensity and quality show only positive impact on authorized utility patents; R&D human resource training shows only negative impact on authorized utility patents numbers; R&D human resource compensation has positive influence on authorized utility patents and new product revenue. Finally, the causes of the results are analyzed and suggestions to improve the utilization of R&D human resource investment so as to improve innovation performance are proposed.",Li S.; Ling C.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Innovation performance ;  R&D human resource compensation ;  R&D human resource investment ;  R&D human resource training

Their importance manifests in a considerably increasing number of fields of technological applications, e.g. automotive, aviation and railway engineering, telecommunications as well as machinery and plant engineering. In this context, the identification of new technologies is an essential success factor in a highly competitive environment and therefore of high relevance for enterprises of ES. Hence, this paper analyses different types of methods, the importance of technology scouts, the process and relevant success factors related to the identification of new technologies in the field of ES. Open-ended and guided interviews are chosen as research method consisting of a sample of 48 experts from several industries originating in the European Metropolitan Area of Nuremberg, Germany. These interviews have been analysed employing a qualitative content analysis, which is a suitable method to systematically extract relevant information from text material. The results show that technology identification is of essential importance for companies of ES and beyond. Within the sample there exist 15 relevant methods for the identification of new technologies, e.g. subject related publications, exhibitions, internet, customer and supplier/producer. Roughly 73 % of the interviewed enterprises do not employ distinct technology scouts, instead technology identification is perceived as part of every employee's continuous duties. 36 companies use a formalised process which follows a predefined pattern. Regarding the factors influencing the success of identifying novelties in terms of ES, our study reveals six factors, namely networking, cost and profit optimisation, applicability, currency, corporate culture and competitive advantage. Our findings are highly relevant for the evaluation of technology identification processes which are critical for the success of Technology Scouting (TS), managing innovation, planning technologies as well as foresight and forecasting related to emerging technologies. This study concerning technology identification and TS commends itself as a starting point for further investigations towards the closely related theoretical concepts of Technology Foresight and Technology Management.",Kiel D.; Arnold C.; Baccarella C.; Voigt K.; Hoffmann D.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Embedded Systems ;  Qualitative content analysis ;  Technology Foresight ;  Technology identification ;  Technology Management ;  Technology Scouting
Innovation in consulting firms: What are the foundations?,"Innovation inside consulting firms has missed specific attention in academic research. Consulting firms usually are considered to be part of Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS), Professional Service Firms (PSF) or Project-based Firms (PbF). However, consultancies possess particular characteristics that might affect generalizations made in studies targeting all the categories stated before. Consulting firms usually help other companies to be innovative, but they also need to have innovation within themselves in order to survive in the market, maintain and attract more clients. The objective of this paper is to explore the theoretical basis and to analyze the emerging literature related to innovation in consulting firms. This may help to understand what characteristics differentiate innovation in consulting firms from innovation in other service organizations. The methodology applied is based on a semi-quantitative literature review involving three main steps: first, we identify keywords to select the articles and create a database; second we make a quantitative analysis on the database using information from Science Direct, Emerald Insight and Google Scholar (journals, citations, type of firms, academic clusters); and finally, we identify the main contributors and research streams on the field. Our database has 206 publications including journals articles, conference papers, books and working papers: more than 70% of these publications have been published in the period from 2008 to 2014 and 24% (59 articles) focused on service innovation in the context of consulting firms. From these 59 articles, 15 articles have been considered as relevant works according to the methodology used. Some scientific journals stand out with their contribution in the literature: Research Policy, International Journal of Project Management, Journal of Knowledge Management and Scandinavian Journal of Management. There are three main contributions in this paper. First, it is a service innovation review in the context of consulting firms. Second, we have identified five main research streams: knowledge management, innovation studies, strategic management, services and project management. Each academic cluster emphasizes in a greater or minor way certain aspects (processes, structures, models, characteristics, factors, etc.), resources (clients, consultants, suppliers) and views (internal or external) about innovation in the consulting industry. It seems that the linkage between these different streams is missing. Some recent service innovation models we also identified but none of them focuses exclusively on service innovation in the context of consulting firms. Thus, there is still a field to study in order to have a clear comprehension on this matter and we make a call for an integrative approach. Finally, we distinguish some further research that needs to be done from the academic and the practitioner perspective.",Isaac L.; Hidalgo A.; Cagliano R.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Politecnico di Milano,Consulting Firms ;  Innovation ;  KIBS ;  Professional Service Firms ;  Project-based ;  Services
Management of technological innovation for sustainable growth: An ontological meta-analysis,"The concept of sustainable growth has been gaining momentum globally due to the need to manage limited resources like energy, food and air while at the same time sustaining the growth of economies for the wellbeing of the people. Technological innovations are the key to optimizing the use of resources in societies pursuing sustainable growth. The interest in managing technological innovations for sustainable growth (MOTISG) is emerging from different groups of stakeholders who bring their own approaches, frameworks or biases to study the problem. The challenges of sustainable growth under these partial perspectives and particular lenses generate narrowly focused knowledge in the respective stakeholders' domains. But such knowledge may not be necessarily compatible across domains, when seen from a more comprehensive perspective. For example, technological innovations to use green energy in manufacturing for sustainable economic growth may adversely affect the local farmers' agricultural practices and hence their social and cultural growth. A systematic and systemic approach is needed to inclusively understand, assess, plan, manage and monitor the effectiveness of strategies, policies, and practices of sustainable growth. Such a complex ecosystem is not amenable to simple, fragmented analysis. Also, the results of the analyses have to be comprehensively synthesized to orchestrate the efforts and measure the consequences of decisions. Thus, our central questions are: How to represent in an integrative framework the knowledge generated to manage technological innovation for sustainable growth? Are there emphases or gaps in the knowledge generated and transferred among communities of science and practice for technological innovation for sustainable growth? The authors propose an ontological framework for MOTSIG and conduct a meta-analysis of the available literature and systematically map the scientific publications of the last five years in this area. The ontology has five dimensions derived from the definition of the domain-Stakeholder, Management, Innovation, Technology, and Growth. Each dimension is defined by a taxonomy of constituent elements. A taxonomy may be extended by adding categories, reduced by eliminating them, refined by adding subcategories, and coarsened by aggregating them. The dimensions are arranged left to right, with adjacent suffixes and prefixes, such that one can construct a natural English sentence by concatenating an element from each dimension with the suffixes/prefixes. By mapping and meta-analyzing papers indexed in a comprehensive, curated bibliographic database, we identify areas of knowledge that have received more attention in the period of the search, but also the areas where knowledge generation and transfer are missing. We thus identify the 'bright', 'light', and 'blind/blank' spots in MOTISG research. Thus, using the ontological maps the efforts of researchers, policymakers and practitioners can be aligned to satisfy the agendas of national innovation systems.",Cancino C.; La Paz A.; Ramaprasad A.; Syn T.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Illinois at Chicago;Texas A and M International University;Universidad de Chile,Ontological framework ;  Research agendas ;  Sustainable growth ;  Technological innovation
Foresight for the enabling technologies materials,"Europe needs innovations and production on-site in high-tech technologies to obtain prosperity. For a sustainable and stable knowledge-based economy and society it is indispensable to maintain the value-added chain also for enabling technologies inside an area such as Europe or a specific country. The maintenance of prosperity in Europe requires an innovative and stimulating environment. Creating awareness and support from a wide variety of agencies and institutions with regard to he system for enabling technologies (knowledge creation and production) is a challenge. However foresight methodologies provide approaches which can take into account a broad variety of aspects and experts for dealing with such a challenge. Therefore the Austrian Society for Metallurgy and Materials, the Montanuniversität Leoben, and the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology designed and accomplished a foresight project for developing scenarios for the manufacturing bases in Austria regarding structural materials such as steel, non-ferrous metals, polymers, and ceramic each regarded together with their composites for high-tech technologies along the whole value-chain. The emphasis of this contribution is put on the adaptation of the methodology to this specific problem. Foresight is a systematic view of the longer-term future of science, technology, business and society to identify areas for strategic research and technology with the greatest economic and social benefits. The process was organized into three stages. At the first stage the frame was defined in details. Essential elements of the first stage were the following. The advisory board with high representatives from universities, industries, and policy makers was defined and organised. The definition of the experts to be invited for workshops and the adaptation of the scenario method was worked out and discussed with the advisory board. At stage two scenarios in each of the four structural material areas (steel, non-ferrous metal, polymers, ceramic) were developed in several workshops with a strict structured procedure. At stage three a ""future conference"" discussed the developed scenarios and worked out the topics and actions across all scenarios and lead to three central issues, which were to be pursued in a follow up process. The consortium was optimally composed because of the complementary expertise. The developed procedure managed to involve and reach most of the important people for further support of the thematic outcome.",Hörlesberger M.; Kriszt B.; Hribernik B.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Austrian Institute of Technology;Montanuniversitat Leoben;Austrian Society for Metallurgy and Materials,"Enabler technology ""materials"" ;  Scenarios development ;  Structural materials ;  Technology foresight"
The analysis of innovation efficiency of enterprises in hubei province based on dea method,"With the data collected from 168 enterprises in Hubei province, innovation efficiency is evaluated and analyzed in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, returns to scale, and projection analysis by using DEA method. The results indicate that only15.48% of the enterprises operate on the best-practice frontier and there exist significant discrepancy between different types of enterprises in terms of innovation efficiency. Increasing returns to scale are found among 46.43% of the enterprises and decreasing returns to scale are found among 35.12% of the enterprises. Scale efficiency is the main factor which leads to low innovation efficiency; and the insufficient input of R&D personnel and the inappropriate allocation between R&D Personnel and R&D expenditure are the fundamental reasons leading enterprises non DEA effective. The empirical results indicate that there is much room for enterprises to improve its innovation efficiency, and specific adjustments are proposed for each type of enterprises on the basis of empirical analysis. Corresponding recommendations are put forward from the enterprise, industry, government level.",Li S.; Ling C.; Liu F.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Data envelopment analysis ;  Innovation efficiency ;  Projection analysis ;  Return to scale
Exploring the dynamics of the wind energy industry,"Since the end of 1990s the growth of new energy and renewable energy production has been strong and increasing. Wind power energy has become one important source of energy almost all over the world. Europe, USA and Asia has become the leading markets in the development of wind energy. The total volume of global wind energy production has increased from 13,600 MW in 1999 to 318,137 MW in 2013. Since 2006 the wind energy industry is showing very rapid growth as well as dynamics among major industry actors. Some companies has left the industry due to havy competion, some has used the growth as an opportunity to expand and the inceasing demand and the growth in the wind energy sector has opened opportunities for new actors to enter the industry. China has very fast become the largest country in the world in terms of installed wind energy capacity (28,7% share of total installed capacity and 45,4 % share of installed capacity in 2013). China is followed by Germany, UK and India. USA is now on the 6th place regarding the share of new installed capacity in 2013 with 3,1 %. Sweden is on the 9th global place, shared with Romania, with 2.0 % installed capacity in 2013. The study focuses on the industry dynamics among major wind turbine producers during the period of 2006 and 2013. The study explores how the seven top wind energy companies, with the greatest market share of wind turbine manufacturing, used business model innovation to create competitive advantage, how they act to sustain competitive, and how they act business wise globaly in the wind energy industry. Our analysis identifies three major industry clusters based on their mix of business model components. We have labeled those three as ""Born in Wind-Stay In Wind"", ""Born In Wind-Expand In Others"" and ""Born In Others-Expand In Wind"" due to the patterns of actors from their origin, growth and expansion strategies to diffusion in different markets. The majority of manufacturers have their origin outside wind energy industry, and they create success through new combinations of resources and new value creation for customers. Only one global actors is born in the wind energy and is still remaing in the wind energy industry. All actors have over the years reshaped their business model components, value propositions and value creation to customers in order to sustain competitive on the market. There are new comers in the wind turbine industry that in short of time has achieved high growth and high market shares. Our analysis shows that the business model innovation can be seen as one important perspective to understand the dynamics of wind power industry. Based on our analysis and findings we suggest that companies in the future even more should focus on the design and innovation of their business models, and that those should have the focus on the value creation for customers from a customer perspective and make differentiation from their competitors in the global wind power industry.",Pataci H.; Danilovi M.; Liu L.; Hoveskog M.; Halila F.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Shanghai Dianji University;Högskolan i Halmstad,
Bridging the innovation chasm: Students' understanding of the concept of patent,"Do students understand the process of patenting new ideas, innovations, or inventions? A sound understanding of the definitions, concepts and dynamics of patenting could help students in playing an active role as entrepreneurs and innovation actors. This paper contributes to the discussion of entrepreneurial and innovation chasm by providing the results of a survey on the students understanding on the process of patenting. Questionnaires consisting of 17 statements that were categories into five research sub-questions where disseminated by e-mail to 100 students registered for a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) Computing degrees, at the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (FoICT), Tshwane University of Technology (TUT).

Developing country industrialisation programme: Inferences from state-owned industrial estate,"The paper evaluated the innovation performance of firms and examined the challenges faced in Nigeria's industrial estates. A set of questionnaires was administered to 46 firms located in four small scale industrial estates out of which 41 (89.1%) responded. Data was gathered on innovation activities, networks and obstacles to firms' technological innovation. The empirical evidence suggests that firms engaged more in process innovation which is aimed at producing more with less. In addition, business interactions with suppliers and buyers are the major channels of information for firms' innovation while collaboration between the firms and research institutes was found to be weak. The study also revealed that despite the objectives these estates are set to achieve, firms in the estates are seriously constrained in terms of infrastructure and fund. The paper concluded that in order to increase innovation performance of firms located within the Nigerian industrial estates, there is need for policy intervention by government at restructuring and revitalising these estates for better industrial growth and economic development.",Sobanke V.; Okogun O.; Egbetokun A.; Ologeh I.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Dangote Cement PLC.;Obafemi Awolowo University;University of Lagos;National Centre for Technology Management Research,Developing countries ;  Industrial estate ;  Industrialisation ;  Technological innovation
An integrated perspective on sources of E-value,"The Internet provides an abundance of new opportunities for innovative businesses and wealth creation. The large number of e-business failures attests however, that it is by no means easy to make a success online. One obstacle hindering e-business start-ups is the ambiguity in which value creation in e-business is shrouded. Its consequence is the formulation of ineffective strategies that ultimately result in failure. In order to provide greater clarity on the subject and thereby assist e-business start-ups, this paper proposes an integrated perspective on sources of e-value creation. The nature of the research is exploratory, made use of inductive reasoning, and drew on existing e-value creation and generic value creation literature to develop its integrated perspective. The resulting model was subsequently refined through feedback obtained in one-on-one interviews with academics and practitioners in the domains of e-business, strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship. The result of the research endeavour was a model named ""18 sources of e-value"". The identified sources of e-value include 12 predominantly functional sources, namely (1) effectiveness, (2) affordability and cost reduction, (3) range and complementarities, (4) reach and accessibility, (5) findability, (6) timeliness and immediacy, (7) authenticity, trust and security, (8) richness of information exchange, (9) interpretation, (10) simplicity, (11) convenience, and (12) customer empowerment. Six predominantly emotional sources of e-value were also identified and these include (13) novelty and newness, (14) aesthetics and brand attractiveness, (15) embodiment, (16) individualisation, (17) connectivity and socialisation, and (18) personal fulfilment. These 18 sources of e-value inform our understanding of value creation in e-business and therefore enhance our ability to develop strategies for the e-domain and enhance our ability to compete in the e-domain. More importantly, the 18 sources of e-value can serve as a sound basis for spurring further theoretical conversations about the vital topic of e-value creation.",Ungerer G.; Schutte C.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Stellenbosch University,E-Business ;  E-Value ;  Integration ;  Sources of Value ;  Value Creation
Indirect social capital and open innovation,"The proposed research seeks to demonstrate that indirect social capital has a positive effect on open innovation (OI) output. Specifically, it focuses on the roles played by trust and knowledge diversity in leveraging indirect social capital for OI returns through a trusted bridging chainmade up of individuals referred to the chain through trust relations. Essentially, indirect social capital can be seen as the returns derived specifically from indirect relationships, either through a chain of referred relationships or through by-chance relationships. Indirect social capital may therefore be defined as 'information or knowledge (new or improved resources) made available to individuals or collectivities through a trusted bridging chain or through (by-chance) indirect relationships'. Studies on innovation networks show the importance of both supporting relations (depicting trust) and bridging relations (representing access to diverse information) for innovation returns. In essence, it is argued that individual A will ask individual B to help solve an innovation problem or to find another person (C) who can solve it, if A thinks B has benevolence-based trust in A, and A has competence-based trust in B. Hence, competence-based trust would drive the quality of the chain and thus the innovation solutions submitted. Typically, the search horizon for external innovations is at a single (direct) level, representing mostly direct relationships between the focal organisation (or intermediary) and the innovators. Studies on OI suggest that organisations can over-search, as too many diverse relationships can become less effective and more expensive. So there is an opportunity to develop an OI search ""filter"" to facilitate external search. Studies on OI have not openly covered either the role of ordinary individuals' indirect relationships in innovation searches, or the context and nature of dyadic external relations per se. Studies on social networking, such as small-world studies, demonstrate how new or enhanced resources can be obtained using an instrumental search through supporting relations, alongside ""short paths"" formed through bridging relations, in effect resulting in a chain. The context and nature of a search chain have not featured much in such studies, though. Furthermore, in most social networking studies diversity is identified by measuring structural holes (the disconnects between direct relations to an ego) or the strength of ties (particularly weak ties). Yet, the latter measurement has not always proven to be a proxy for diversity, and analysing structural holes requires access to network ties around the ego and not merely a dyadic relation. This study suggests an improved measurement of dyadic tie diversity that encompasses knowledge and geographic distance between individuals in a dyadic relationship. Considering the importance of diversity for innovation per se, it is argued that a chain that bridges knowledge and geographic boundaries may better deliver innovative solutions. A trusted bridging chain could reach across the world to solve a developing-world problem in the developed world, for example. Finally, the proposed study puts forward levels of social capital - direct and indirect - to help define social capital better. The research problem requires an outcome-driven analysis based on variance logic, and a quasi-experiment to set up the necessary treatment to examine the proposed relationship between indirect social capital and OI with hypothesised relationships.",Lombard M.; Barnard H.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Gordon Institute of Business Science,Direct social capital ;  Indirect social capital ;  Open innovation ;  Social capital ;  Trusted bridging chain
Top management capabilities for Sme's market entry decisions,"New market entry decision making is important to the growth of SMEs, but research on this subject has been lacking. A better understanding of market entry decision making for SMEs is important not only for their ability to grow, but also for economic sustainability development in general. Overestimation of the dynamic capabilities of an SME in a new market can result in disaster, and underestimation can lead to missed opportunities for growth and innovation. In this article we introduce a new empirically grounded theoretical model that explains the interrelationship of three important market-entry processes/capabilities: opportunity identification, adequate resources, and previous market experience. The model was developed in a grounded theory study on seven cases of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Mexico.

Education in electric and electronic engineering via students involvement in innovative projects,"The promotion of the students' transversal or generic competencies is one of the key points of the new European educational framework. Today, companies hiring graduate students are not only concerned about their technical background but also transversal skills and competencies. Hence, it becomes necessary to adopt measures to promote and cultivate these competencies among students. The students' involvement in innovative research projects brings an excellent opportunity to achieve this goal: competence dimensions as team work, effective oral and written communication, effective use of informational resources, independent learning, foreign language, problem resolution among many other can be effectively developed by involving students in multidisciplinary teams conceived to develop this type of projects. This paper focuses on this idea, remarking the usefulness of these projects to achieve the goals pursues by the new educational framework in the context of generic competencies.

Research challenges in multicultural human-systems engineering panel discussion: Current issues and future trends in human-systems engineering research,"Radical and incremental innovations continue to challenge human-systems integration efforts due to system complexity and the heterogeneity of users and ecosystems in which they operate. These multicultural ecosystems consist of diverse users, diverse contexts of use, diverse constraints and diverse enablers. Yet, the methods we use to design and evaluate human-systems technologies intended for use by multinational and multicultural users are based on procedures grounded in reductionist philosophies that rest on quantizing and aggregating values and central tendencies to extract meaning. The continued application of these methods to operational environments and users who are highly heterogeneous has implications for the safety and validity of technologies as well as the equity of benefits. In this panel discussion, the scope of the problem will be discussed through exemplar cases. Considerations for research design and analysis methods for heterogeneous ecosystems will be offered.

Individuals, especially millennials or Generation Y, are constantly preoccupied with social media. Spontaneous and planned innovations result as creative, skilled and talented individuals interact via social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn, Blogs, Myspace and Wikis. This paper explores the possible use of social media platforms for identifying opportunities for innovation. The exchange and sharing of information on social media has the potential to influence perceptions and spark off debate and discussions among individuals with diverse backgrounds, culture, expertise, and viewpoints. The proposition in this study is that information exchange on these platforms presents opportunities for identification of creative ideas and solutions to problems which eventually result in useful innovations when implemented. This study develops a theoretical model describing the hypothesized relationship between innovation and social media based on theories of connectivism, social learning and the Medici Effect. A case study of student engineering design teams is discussed and directions for future research presented.",Asio S.; Khorasani S.,Conference Proceeding,IIE Annual Conference and Expo 2015,2015-01-01,Texas Tech University,Innovation ;  Organizational productivity ;  Social media
Nurturing Future Engineers: The New Four-Year Tertiary Education in Hong Kong,"Engineering education in Hong Kong is experiencing significant changes in response to several major forces: (1) an increasing demand for future engineers who possess technical competencies, professional skills, and knowledge of ethical awareness and responsibilities; (2) accreditation requirements; and (3) the system-wide education reform in the region. Curriculum changes have taken place in several universities in Hong Kong with engineering majors but there are few conceptual articles providing in-depth discussions about the impact of the changes. This article aims to provide insights into the engineering curriculum reform in a broader context for university management, program leaders, and coordinators who are involved in curriculum design and implementation. Using a newly revamped engineering curriculum in one of the research-intensive universities in Hong Kong as an example, this article highlights the features of the new four-year engineering curriculum and discusses how it may contribute to the nurturing of future engineers. While clear progress has been made in providing students with a broad perspective and support, the influences of the prevailing culture of teaching and learning, the local perceptions of the engineering profession, and the decision making patterns of Hong Kong Chinese students cast a complicated picture. To fully achieve the goals of the new curriculum, universities should proactively address the challenges by the following actions: acting consistently to the commitment of holistic education, supporting students' personal and value development, establishing reward mechanisms for faculty members' contributions in student development, and investing in pedagogical development and innovations.",Zou T.,Journal,International Journal of Chinese Education,2015-01-01,The University of Hong Kong,curriculum changes ;  education reform ;  engineering education ;  teaching and learning culture
The research and development of safety forewarning composite integral strong geocell,"In the paper, we study the high strength geocell development technology route, analyze the rules of the tensile properties and creep properties of geocell, establish the relationship between elongation and stress and time, thus provide theoretical foundation for the development and engineering application of the new material.

Tools and inspiration for engineering education development through stakeholder cooperation,"This practice-based paper presents the motivation, model and results of national level stakeholder collaboration for the development of engineering education. In addition, it presents how the results have been utilized in a case university. Stakeholder collaboration has been successfully used in the development of engineering education in Finland. University management, teachers, education developers, students as well as partners outside the universities such as industry representatives and policy makers all share an interest and a role in the development of engineering education. The Academic Engineers and Architects in Finland TEK has been active in facilitating the collaboration between key stakeholders, creating networks and forums of cooperation as well as ways of distributing the know-how and best practices of education development. One of the recent large scale stakeholder forums for was organized together by TEK and The Federation of Finnish Technology Industries in December 2014. The bi-annual two-day event attracted almost 90 representatives of university management, teachers, education developers, students, industry, research centers and policy makers. It is considered as one of the main networking and development forums in the field of engineering education. In addition to the strategic development of universities, the focus was on the future working life competencies; namely what they are and how can university education produce the skills and competencies needed. The aim of the event was to create tools and share best practices supporting competencies especially for the following multidisciplinary areas: career planning, sustainable development, innovation and entrepreneurship as well as sales and customer service. The key findings of the stakeholder workshop indicate that more emphasis should be put on the development of students self-esteem and confidence, communication and networking skills and in general the ?Yes, I can!?-attitude. Inspiring and systematic cooperation with industry and other stakeholders, such as visiting lecturers, traineeships, project work and case studies, as well as multidisciplinary team work and utilization of modern teaching technologies and learning facilities are some of the tools to be implemented in engineering education. In order for the tools to have an effect on education, they need to be put into practice. This paper examines, how a case university, in this case the School of Electrical Engineering in Aalto University, has been implementing new ideas and best practices gathered through collaboration with other universities and stakeholders.",Hyotynen P.; Keltikangas K.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,Aalto University;Academic Engineers and Architects in Finland TEK,Industry Cooperation ;  Stakeholder Cooperation
Engineering in Dutch schools: Impact on study choice: A quantitative analysis,"Since 2004 a growing number of ?Technetium? schools in the Netherlands have introduced engineering projects in their curriculum[1]. Goals include stimulating learner?s creativity and broadening their horizon with respect to engineering studies and related jobs. Throughout their school career students work on authentic tasks originating from companies and institutes. The final assignment connects with a Polytechnic or University. As many projects incorporate engineering elements we expect study choice impacts. We found a shift in learner preferences towards design-based engineering studies. Research questions (1) Do Technasium students select engineering studies more often? (2) Do these students perform better compared to students with no Technasium background? Method We checked student numbers, results and dropout rates for students originating from Technasium schools over the period 2009-2013 [2]. Results From our 2633 freshmen a total of 89 students (78 male, 11 female) followed this new engineering trajectory throughout their school career.This group favors studies like Industrial Design and Mechanical Engineering showing a shift away from traditional Science studies. Study success measured is similar: Technasium students: 49+/-16 ECTS versusall science & engineering students: 49+/- 14ECTS. We also find no significant difference in dropout-rates after 1 year: Technasium students 14% versus all science & engineering students 15%. (Table presented ) Conclusions and discussion Despite the small numbers we already see significant effects that may grow if engineering education is introduced in more schools. Engineering at secondary schools does pay off, with still some challenges to attract more girls. Further analysis will show whether we are attracting new groups of students or moving students from science towards engineering. Finding similar study success is a good starting point for an educational innovation like Technasium. Engineering studies should take into account that new students may have a background in design and engineering and will be eager to engage on new challenges.",Van Der Veen J.; Blume-Bos A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,Universiteit Twente,Engineering education ;  Secondary schools. ;  Study-choice ;  Study-success
Entrepreneurship and gender in higher engineering education in Germany,"In the past years European economic and employment policies increasingly underline the strategically important role of higher education institutions (HEIs) in boosting Europe?s innovation potential through supplying highly skilled labour[1, for references see additional document]. Two key priorities are particularly emphasized: The first is to embed entrepreneurship into higher education curricula in order to further develop the knowledge triangle that integrates education, research, and innovation with each other [2].This particularly counts for applied disciplines such as engineering [3]. The second priority is to enforce gender equality in labour force participation and increaserepresentation of women in skilled employment [4]- which is again most evident in engineering - by incorporating gender issues in teaching plans and creating more awareness for gender balance in labor markets [5].These objectives have subsequently been incorporated into national and regional policies. In Germany, funding for knowledge and technology transfer for economic and societal applications is already a central instrument in policy strategies of federal and state level ministries of education and science [6,7]. The question now is in how far these policies are already put into practice at universities in Germany. Curricula documents can serve as a database for a first-hand insight, which bases on the assumption that if entrepreneurship and gender is taught at the universities it must be visible in these documents.Hence, this research brings together entrepreneurial and gender research with research on higher engineering education. The connected research questions are the following: In how far is entrepreneurship and gender manifested in curricula of selected German technical universities? How and by whom are these topics taught? The methodology for this research is mainly based on content analysis. Therefore the mechanical engineering curricula for bachelor and master level from nine leading German technical universities (TU 9) were analyzed (for this abstract a focus was put on TU Munich, RWTH Aachen and TU Berlin). First findings show that entrepreneurship is represented in all of the curricula, even ifthe way how it is represented differs significantly. On the one hand there can be found educational modules that fully address entrepreneurship. On the other hand there are quite a number of modules that tackle the topic of innovation only in one or two parts of the full course. Comparing these result with the results on the gender topic is pretty disappointing. Only in one of the curricula there could be found one course that had the term gender in its description and teaches gender sensitivity. For the full paper this research will be broadened to all TU 9 universities and more detailed results will be explained. Moreover it will be examined how in terms of teaching methods entrepreneurship and innovation as well as gender and diversity are taught in present engineering education practice.",May D.; Hosch-Dayican B.; Leisyte L.; Lensing K.; Sigl L.; Terkowsky C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,Technische Universität Dortmund,Content analysis ;  Engineering curricula ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Gender
The innovation-cognitive science interface: Implications for engineering and technology education,"This paper presented the construct of technological innovation and then overlaid it onto today's context of significant challenges and in particular the sense that our engineering and technology education systems are not as effective as we deem necessary. A brief overview of traditional and newer approaches to addressing innovation by our universities was then shared but so was the conclusion that there remained a considerable shortfall in both practice and research. The potential of employing the perspectives and methodologies of cognitive science was then posited and at least some of the implications thereof were highlighted. Much work, however, remains to further explore and detail the latter.",Dyrenfurth M.; Barnes J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,Purdue Polytechnic Institute;Barnes Technologies International LLC,Cognitive Science ;  Engineering Education ;  Innovation ;  Technology Education
Teaching sustainability to industrial engineering students,"The complex issue of sustainability has increased its importance in companies? strategy. The competencies and skills required to industrial engineers have changed accordingly: industrial engineers must now address issues such as eco design, certifications, information flows streamlining, life cycle assessment and processes and products innovation. Hence, in view of a continuous renewal of teaching, the change of some essentially descriptive classes on industrial technologies has been pursued. As the crucial importance of cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary nature of the topic, the new classes have been designed focusing on the complex issue of sustainability, especially in its environmental and socio-cultural aspect. The content and teaching methodology have been defined assessing which skills neo engineers should have in order to successfully address the dynamic and proactive sustainability of a company. The main purpose has been highlighting both the close links between market dynamics, research and creative development and productive processes and the effects that these connections lead on business organizational models. That is to improve sensitivity to the recent need of Italian companies to contain the consumption and the costs of energy and water and deal with wastewater management. As its great economic and social importance in Italy, the classes focus on the fashion industry (textiles, clothing and tanning / footwear). In addition, the Italian fashion industry (from processing of fibers to weaving, from finishing to the finished garment) has worked on reducing the environmental impact of its processes and on the traceability of its supply chain in order to restore its competitiveness in the global context. Such a new approach calls for new ways of relating between textile companies and fashion companies with chemical and mechanical textile to share the common goal of ensuring fashionable products with a high level of aesthetics and quality but with reduced environmental impact. Finally, the class underlines the lack of standardization in the sustainability processes (except for some large companies) and that sustainability is an question that requires collaboration of multiple figures and constant transfer of information and data collection methods: a stimulating issue for young engineers.",Noè C.; Pozzi R.; Magni A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,Università Carlo Cattaneo,Industrial engineers ;  Sustainable company
Team-based professional development in higher education: A review study,"The University of Twente is currently redesigning its engineering education to better prepare its engineering students for the future. To implement this curriculum innovation successfully, professional development of teachers is needed. Teacher professional development in higher education has gained more and more attention during the last decennia. Research has been published on various kinds of professional development programs like courses, workshops, (online) trainings or peer observations [1]. Most review studies in this area focus on professional development of individual teachers, whereas team-based professional development programs have been neglected. Although research has shown that professional development in teams can be very effective [2], there has never been a review study focusing on these team-based interventions in higher education. To provide an overview about research on this topic, we carried out a systematic review study specifically focused on team-based professional development. The method for this study is based on Petticrew and Roberts? [3] method for executing systematic reviews in the social sciences. A systematic literature search was conducted using four scientific databases, which resulted in 533 publications. Based on our exclusion criteria, about 20 publication were found to be suitable for this review. With this study we try to answer the question: What are the benefits of team-based professional development in higher education, and under which conditions are they most successful. The results reveal that in comparison to individual professional development interventions only a small number of research studies about team-based professional development interventions have been published. Most articles focus on team-based professional development as such, some describe team activities part of a larger professional development program. Several conditions for successful team-based professional development are described in these articles, for instance a faculty or university culture supporting professional development, trust between team members, supportive leadership, and leader and management commitment. Regarding the benefits of team-based professional development several articles report an effect on teacher attitudes, for instance teachers state that they value the collaboration with their colleagues and see team-based professional development as a good opportunity to learn. However, most articles which focus solely on team-based professional development do not measure the effect of these interventions on teacher learning, only a few quantitative methods were used. In comparison, articles which study team-based professional development as part of a larger professional development program often specifically highlight the benefits of these programs in the form of knowledge gained.",Gast I.; Van Der Veen J.; Schildkamp K.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,Universiteit Twente,Engineering Education ;  Higher Education ;  Professional Development ;  Teacher Teams
Influence of integrating creative thinking teaching into project-based learning courses to engineering college students,"In Taiwan, teachers of engineering colleges mostly focus on the innovation and breakthrough of engineering technologies that makes students possibly are limited to the system functionality and integrity. In other words, because of the lack of creative thinking developing and training, students tend to be limited in their creativity when they are doing their homework. However, as the matures of engineering technologies, engineering is transformed to the creative applications of scientific theories that often as unique creations to herald their existence, thus creativity is thought of as the innate character of engineering in future [1-3]. Accordingly, many research approaches have been arisen that aim to enhance creativity in engineering education, such as Project-Based Learning (PBL) that is often adopted for problem solving, self-learning, and leadership skill. The main concept of PBL is that capturing students' interest via the illustration of real world problems, then arise students thinking of applying new knowledge in order to solve the problems [4-6]. This study focuses on integrating creative thinking teaching into PBL courses. In order to push the students in the course can inspire their imagination and creativity effectively, the five stages of project-based teaching period is adopted. Students? creativity analysis was conducted and the results indicated: 1) students significantly enhanced their intrinsic motivation and thinking relationship of self-learning; 2) the evaluation results and teacher assessment results were without significant differences, indicating that approach of integrating creative thinking teaching into project-based learning courses could be perceived as a valid teaching method; 3) the feedback of student learning process and the score of expert creative assessment were highly consistent.",Lai C.; Hwang R.; Chen S.; Huang H.; Wu T.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,National Yunlin University of Science and Technology;National Chung Cheng University,Creative Thinking ;  Engineering College Courses ;  Project-based Learning
Facilitating creativity as a core competence in Engineering Education,"In Engineering Education (EE) there is a growing emphasis on providing students with skills and competences within innovation and entrepreneurship. This development has emerged from an identified need for establishment of new enterprises, creation of new possibilities for employment and to contribute to enhanced growth. Engineers are considered to have a key position in this development, and many engineering challenges call for new solutions. Creativity is a prerequisite for the ability to combine present knowledge into new solutions. Hence, creativity is an important subset in innovation. This development gives reasons to reconsider the content in EE and how it is taught. If creativity and innovation are the new key components in academic training of engineers it is also necessary to embrace openness to collaboration and multidisciplinary, holistic views on real life complex problems, and design competences in EE [1]. Still it is well known that there is inertia in Engineering Education to develop new structures and traditions in teaching and learning [2]. In the whole education system there is a growing interest in creative engagement of pupils and students, and the body of research in the area is growing rapidly. Research in this field has an emphasis on the role of the teacher in facilitating creativity, while the question of how to train teachers in teaching creativity is less emphasized [3]. How do we teach creativity to those how are going to teach creativity in EE? At the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) a mandatory teacher training program for new faculty has in its present design been successfully held since 2004. Different approaches to fostering teachers? beliefs of creativity and innovation as teaching methods have been explored in the programme, based on approaches like the ones described in [4]. Based on qualitative surveys and interviews this paper will discuss how the programme influence teachers? beliefs about 1) creativity in teaching and learning, 2) view on creativity as an important engineering skill, and 3) desire to emphasise creativity in their own teaching. The results indicate that while new faculty like to master a traditional way to teach at university, some new faculty is convinced by elements of the course material and thus display another behaviour ? embracing new perspectives in EE and being more open to include creativity as a part of their teaching.",Andersson P.; Onarheim B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,Technical University of Denmark,Creativity ;  Entrepreneurship and engineering education ;  Innovation ;  New learning concepts for engineering education
Cross institutional comparison of curricular change in Dutch engineering bachelor programmes,"The three Universities of technology of Twente (UT), Eindhoven (TU/e) and Delft (TUD) in the Netherlands each initiated major bachelor programme innovations between 2011 and 2014. The need for shorter study duration, higher pass rates, and lower dropout rates were reasons to instigate these innovations. In addition, at leasttwo of the technical Universities were losing market share. Finally, the programs were not yet adequately geared towards the big challenges of the future and the engineering skills the students needed for this. This contribution reports on a research project conducted by the 3TU Centre for Engineering Education (CEE). One of the aims of the researchis to findeffective components. The results reported in this project focus at the Intended curriculum (Van den Akker, 2003), the leadership and (organization) process used to implement the bachelor curriculum innovation and the drivers of change leading the institution into a major change process (Graham, 2014). The leading research questionin this research is ?In what way did the three technical universities realise the bachelor curriculum innovation objectives. Drivers of change, the innovation process and characteristics of the intended curriculum were special areas of interest. Results suggestthat the drivers for change have implications for the extent to which staff and students are involved in the change process and /or to what extent the studentneeds as a client are leading in determining the nature of the change. Furthermore, the characteristics of the change process are a set of heuristic moves to come to the desired results. In this paper we will share the process and its? impact on the objectives on the basis of the criteria for sustainable change by Ruth Graham. Finally, we will show that some of the elements of the intended curriculumcontradict between the 3 Universities, whilst theyhad the same goal in mind. The practical relevance is scaling mutual problems and professionalization through diverse approaches and input of the 3TU Federationtacit knowledge. Naturally, there are many implications of this study we will discuss during the presentation.",Klaassen R.; Brans C.; Gommer E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Delft University of Technology,Curriculum Development ;  Engineering Education
Collaborative PhD projects: Together towards innovation,"The Delft Infrastructures & Mobility Initiative (DIMI) and Delft Energy Initiative (DEI) of the TU Delft are starting a pilot for PhD students which are not employed at the university, but at a company or a governmental organisation that is interested in the same research themes. These collaborative industry-university PhD projects strengthens the cooperation between the university and industry and this interaction increases the potential for innovation. The ambition to increase Europe?s competitiveness by innovating faster based on sound research could become a reality. An important condition, however, is that these collaborative PhD projects with high potential candidates from industry run smoothly. The question is therefore: What does doctoral engineering education for collaborative university-industry projects look like? I have studied the problems that PhD students already working encounter from the start of their PhD study to the end. The needs of the PhD candidates varies significantly. Some of these problems can be solved easily; others are less easy to solve, since they arise from differences in the domain of practice and the domain of scientific research. Interviews are also held with supervisors at the university and companies in order to recognise the specific needs of each party and be able to (co-)design a tailor-made PhD doctoral engineering programme. Furthermore, I have looked into the part time PhD programs offered by universities in the Netherlands. I have made a comparison and they turn out to be very diverse. This paper presents the design criteria of collaborative PhD projects for DIMI and DEI, using the existing literature. Collaborative PhD projects will become an interesting learning process for all parties involved.",Sjoer E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,The Hague University of Applied Sciences,Doctoral Education ;  Innovation ;  PhD students ;  University-Industry Collaboration
Application of research-inspired assessment to enhance students learning in civil engineering,"The relationship between teaching and research has become a highly challenging issue due to evidence of synergy between them and complexity of integrating them. As reported by Locke [1], the separation of research and teaching could be the result of policy and operational decisions to distinguish the way these activities are funded, managed, assessed and rewarded. However, this would not necessarily excuse higher education institutions from a commitment to optimise the beneficial relations between teaching and research. For example, research conducted by Posch and Steiner [2] at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich on innovation for sustainability, concludes that appropriate integration of research and teaching activities leads to mutual benefits for both higher education institutions and students. In this study an approach introducing research activities in Civil Engineering subjects to enable students to develop skills within critical and creative thinking and being lifelong learners has been developed and evaluated. Research based activities/assessments in two major Civil Engineering subjects at undergraduate level have been introduced, and students? learning process has been monitored and evaluated. The results of this project indicate that by incorporating research components in subjects, research-based learning culture among Civil Engineering students were developed. This clearly gave more satisfaction to the students about the learning experience. Statistical analysis of results indicated that students with better performance in mini-projects performed better in the final exam, which was a totally independent assessment task. In addition, the averaged final exam mark of students with good quality projects was higher than the one for other students.",Fatahi B.; Khabbaz H.; Valipour H.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015",2015-01-01,UNSW Sydney;University of Technology Sydney,Assessment Task ;  Civil Engineering ;  Research-Inspired

Large-scale field tests with flexible slope stabilization systems,"In the scope of a research project by the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) of the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research, large-scale field tests with flexible slope stabilization systems were performed in Winterthur, Switzerland under the direction of the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Burgdorf. For this purpose, a 13 × 15 m steel frame was filled with soil material and tilted up to 85° using a 500 to crawler crane. Different mesh and net coverings combined with a nail anchoring system were used to stabilize the soil material against instabilities near the surface. This article gives an overview of the test assembly and summarizes the results from the large-scale field tests performed. In addition, the retrograde calculation of the RUVOLUM dimensioning concept was verified. The large-scale field tests performed create an ideal foundation for a better understanding of the load bearing capacity of flexible slope stabilization systems and comparison of different meshes under same conditions as well for further developing and adapting them to project-specific requirements.",Roduner A.; Flum D.; Stolz M.; Gröner E.,Conference Proceeding,"Geotechnical Engineering for Infrastructure and Development - Proceedings of the XVI European Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, ECSMGE 2015",2015-01-01,Berner Fachhochschule;Geobrugg AG;Rüegger+Flum AG,

Evaluating the accuracy of orthophotos and satellite images in the context of road centerlines in test sites in hungary,"Improvement and constant change in science, technology and innovation in our modern life demands knowledge of a variety of geo-information applications, thus tools of data processing, display, analysis and simulation while fulfilling an interdisciplinary role, promote decision making and analytic procedures of engineering, ecological and marketing tasks. Aerial and satellite images have been used worldwide for the purpose of conducting various projects (studies of changes in land cover, classification, defining land usage) with photos serving mostly as starting points, a basis for our analyses. Assuming that different aerial and satellite images shall yield data of varying accuracy, subject to the scale and resolution of the photos as well as the type of depicted cartographic units, it is essential to have advance knowledge of expected accuracy of the photos to be used before the evaluation is performed. The aim of our analysis was to determine the difference between the vector files obtained from digitized orthophotos and those obtained by using geodesic measurements; we examined whether accuracy was subject to varying resolutions of orthophotos or satellite images. We have analyzed aerial photos and satellite images of two chosen test sites by comparing points and lines obtained by landscape measurements with those digitalized from orthophotos. By using statistical methods we defined the expected accuracy (resolutions used were 0.4 and 0.65 m/pixel) of road centerlines digitized from photos. Our study wants to emphasize that the assessments we apply may be utilized for planning and research work and the resulting data may effectively be used for road line planning as well as determining road segments and public utility crossings.",Varga Z.; Czedli H.; Kezi C.; Loki J.; Fekete A.; Biro J.,Journal,Research Journal of Applied Sciences,2015-01-01,Debreceni Egyetem Műszaki Kar;Debreceni Egyetem Természettudományi és Technológiai Kar;Geodesic and Cartographical Inc.,Environmental monitoring ;  GPS Trimble R6 ;  Landscape changes ;  Landscape metrics ;  Ohophoto
Social media for sustaining product innovation: A design framework for capturing business insights from user-generated content,"The fast paced business environment is increasingly requiring companies to explore the use of external sources of ideas and information to accelerate innovation. Social media, full of user-generated content (UGC), including users' opinions and comments, has been considered as a gold mine for exploring new and useful ideas so as to augment companies' competence in innovation. Despite the increasing importance of social media having led more and more firms to engage with it, capturing innovative ideas and knowledge from the vast amount of online content can be very challenging. Thus far, there is a lack of useful methods that serve to collect and analyze the substantial data effectively. In this study, it is argued that companies need to work systematically to analyze and interpret the online commentaries of social media, for this can enhance in-house research and design activities. In this research, the intention is to find ways of tackling the challenges faced by firms when trying to process ""big data"", with the focus being on the context of online commentaries. To this end, we propose a framework from the design science approach, for automatically analyzing the content of online opinions and comments in connection with product innovation using a web corpus established for this purpose. Further, a case study is presented as a proof-of-content by applying this framework. Subsequently, theoretical and practical implications of the outcomes are discussed in this report.",Lee J.; Yang C.; Chen S.,Conference Proceeding,"International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 2015, ASEM 2015",2015-01-01,Yuan Ze University,Content analysis ;  Design science approach ;  Product innovation ;  Social media ;  User-generated content ;  Web discussion forum
Spinning-out university technologies: A role for students in the commercialization process,"Universities engage in technology commercialization, based on different motivations including the goal of accomplishing sustainable innovation with economic and societal impact and diversifying income streams. The latter objectives are better realized from spinning out successful new companies, which compared to licensing create advantages both for the university and the academic inventor. Although universities generally struggle to successfully commercialize research results as new firms, some universities are much better than others at spinning out companies. The research has not identified a singular formula to increase university spin-outs. A common theme in much of the empirical evidence is that academics/university researchers lack knowledge related to market development which must be supplemented for successful commercialization. This study analyses the role of non-research students in developing knoweldege about markets to supplement the knowledge-gap among academics, which as far as we know have not been widely explored. The analysis is based in the context of a technical university which provides a unique opportunity to explore how students working to fulfil academic requirements can create momentum around a technology to increase its spinout potential. The results show that students working with potential spin-out technologies as class projects are seen as nonthreatening which allow them to gather useful market information. This early information can stimulate interest leading to partnership development as well as help to identify advantages and challenges for different applications of a technology.",Murdock K.; Johnsen L.; Ølund M.; Overgaard M.; Broeng J.; Hvidt O.; Jarnel N.,Conference Proceeding,"International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 2015, ASEM 2015",2015-01-01,Copenhagen Business School;Technical University of Denmark,Knowledge gap ;  Student resources ;  Technology commercialization ;  University Spin-outs
Introducing bio-based additive manufacturing to an engineering facility,"Innovative product development and manufacturing technologies are vital to a robust economy. Recent national emphases on STEM disciplines and breakthrough research in these areas underscores the importance of innovation and disruptive technologies to increased economic activity effects. One of the hot areas of emerging technology applications in industry is that of additive manufacturing (AM). While the AM process may produce parts from both metallic inputs and polymer resins, this effort focuses on the polymer area and specifically bio-based polymers. The research examines process and technology aspects which may impact performance and capabilities. In order to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating bio-based AM into an engineering setting, the Plastics Laboratory of Northern Illinois University has conducted a study. The required steps were the purchase of a 3D printer, installation and trouble-shooting of the printer, creation of sample parts, generation of test coupons for mechanical testing, and testing per ASTM specifications. This program's effectiveness is judged by the ease at which the AM technology is made operational as well as the properties of resulting parts. Properties include appearance, durability, and strength. The property evaluation is especially important as quality is dependent on how the part is oriented during the build, along with other factors, and strength is lower when compared to parts made by traditional plastics processing methods. For success, the printer must be relatively easy to install and operate, and parts must have a minimum amount of strength.",Ziemer N.; Tatara R.,Conference Proceeding,"International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 2015, ASEM 2015",2015-01-01,Northern Illinois University,Additive manufacturing ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability
Case study research of user design methods,"System users have been a demonstrated source of innovations and breakthrough ideas. While there is a wealth of literature dedicated to understanding this source of innovation for its ability to generate new markets; understanding how users design and change systems remains understudied. As an initial step, this research seeks to understand problem solving mechanisms employed by users. To observe this phenomenon, this initial research considers an extreme case of user design, the development of a complex system. Three categories of change mechanisms were employed by users: user, method and material. As a departure from traditional design methods it was found that users view themselves as a dynamic component of the system and change themselves or their behaviors to enable system capabilities. In the case considered, users were able to rapidly develop a complex system to meet new requirements; interestingly this was accomplished with either modular or minimally invasive equipment changes. While traditional flexible design tenets were present in the materiel components of the system (e.g. robustness and modularity), the skill and capacity of the system users provided a separate source of system flexibility.",Cox A.; Szajnfarber Z.,Conference Proceeding,"International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 2015, ASEM 2015",2015-01-01,The George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science,Engineering design ;  Flexibility ;  Problem solving ;  Search mechanisms ;  User innovation

Strategy and instruments for a successful implementation of electromobility in Austria,"Driven by the high share of renewable energy sources in national power generation Austria has defined electromobility as a political top priority. Public administrations are cooperating closely with industry and research institutions within the Austrian Association for Advanced Propulsion Systems (A3PS) and have elaborated the National Implementation Plan ""Electromobility in and from Austria"", which provides a set of actions which have significant potential to facilitate the introduction and development of electromobility in Austria. After the introduction the second chapter describes the market penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure and tries to analyse user preferences for buying a new car. It shows the ongoing trend towards electromobility and provides an overview on the market development of other alternative propulsion systems, energy carriers and the corresponding hydrogen and charging infrastructure. Since 2003, the stock of EVs has risen fifteen-fold (including 3,500 EVs and 13,000 hybrid vehicles). The third chapter provides detailed information about regulatory conditions and funding programs in Austria and describes the successful implementation of model regions. The Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology has a vital role due to its simultaneous responsibility for R&D-funding programs, infrastructure planning and transport policy framework conditions. An important reason for the dynamic increase of EVs in Austria is the mission oriented cooperation between engineering service providers, producing industry, fleet operators, policy makers and research institutions working together in defining roadmaps for joint actions and implementing them, coordinated by the A3PS and the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Cluster FCH-Austria. Another asset is that Austria holds a very competent automotive supply industry working for all OEMs worldwide. The third chapter emphasises successful ongoing projects and studies which brings electromobility closer to people and shows further future trends.",Dorda A.; Nikowitz M.,Conference Proceeding,"28th International Electric Vehicle Symposium and Exhibition 2015, EVS 2015",2015-01-01,A3PS—Austrian Association for Advanced Propulsion Systems;Austrian Ministry for Transport,Austria ;  Electromobility ;  Funding programs ;  Regulatory conditions
Can academia-industry collaboration through serious gaming contributes to learning and skills development?,"CONTEXT: With increasing expectations of graduates in a competitive and transparent education system/market and amidst calls to prepare engineering students for professional practice in an increasingly globalised world. Universities may consider sharing responsibility with industry for student education in their efforts to educate engineers of the future. Engineering firms, too, can collaborate with universities to provide engineering students with workplace training and skill development that may better fit the workplace. There could be greater interaction between universities and industry to improve the quality of graduates. PURPOSE: The objective of this position paper is to bring academic and industry experts together to promote innovation diffusion. For example, developing and using new learning resources, in particular, educational games known as serious games (SGs) to educate engineering students. The paper asks if academia-industry collaboration through SGs can contribute to learning and skills development of engineering students. RESULT: This paper explores the potential for academia-industry collaboration to develop teaching methods and tools based on specific technological expertise and knowledge. In particular the potential for universities and industry to develop SGs that apply to real-world situations. DISCUSSION: There are likely to be many benefits of developing stronger links between academia and industry. Particularly in the collaboration involving the development of new teaching tools such as SGs to provide an engaging, self-reinforcing context in which to motivate and prepare the new generation of engineers.",Tan E.,Conference Proceeding,"6th Research in Engineering Education Symposium: Translating Research into Practice, REES 2015",2015-01-01,,Academic-industrial collaboration ;  Game developers/designers ;  Serious games (SGs) ;  Skill development
High or low tech approaches to teaching and learning?: The value of pedagogical soundness,"This paper looks at the application of peer instruction via in-class concept questions, an approach based on a constructivist conception of learning (as opposed to a 'transmissionist' model) that facilitates the engagement of learners through active learning opportunities (Smith et al, 2009). This approach has been adopted using both 'high tech' (clickers) and 'low tech' (flashcards) approaches (Mazur, 1997, 2009), whereby crucially, 'no significant differences were found in conceptual learning gains' between either approach (Lasry, 2008). The current paper considers the use of flashcards to facilitate peer discussion and learning in a fluid mechanics module and elicits learner reflections on how this approach better facilitates learning relative to a 'traditional' lecturing approaches. It also reflects on how this approach compares with other technological innovations aimed at supporting learning. Conclusions are drawn around the need to place the pedagogical horse ahead of the technological cart when considering teaching approaches.",Byrne E.,Conference Proceeding,"6th Research in Engineering Education Symposium: Translating Research into Practice, REES 2015",2015-01-01,University College Cork,
Can the scientific method survive the plant condition?,"If engineering is the application of technology to improve our way of life, then the venerable pilot is the means to that end in the chemical and process engineering realm. Whether a pilot is conducted to develop a new product, assess methods to recover a waste/byproduct, troubleshoot, enhance robustness or improve the quality-yield-capacity of a long established operation, the execution of technically sound pilots is inextricably tied to the Scientific Method (SM). The SM categorically transcends the industry, market or application and establishes a powerfully simple method of gathering data and knowledge to accomplish a goal. That it is applicable to grade school students where it is first introduced may belie its utility to thirty-five year subject matter experts in the various high-tech fields, but make no mistake, those who snub it with technical arrogance do so at great risk to the success of their undertaking. While the SM's natural habitat is the comfort zone of HVAC-controlled Research and Development (R&D) laboratories around the world, its survival is less certain when immersed in the comparably hostile ecosystem born of the ""plant condition"". In this paper, the so-called plant condition is the confluence of human-factors, commercial, technical, safety, and financial/resource limitations that conspire to make it a casualty in what may very well have started as a well-planned undertaking with a clear Design of Experiments (DoE). The plant condition can also take on a more literal meaning - when the plant is already in a start-up mode and its performance is lacking in some way, thus necessitating additional work alongside start-up - perhaps even leveraging the plant itself as part of the plant. While piloting alongside a start-up is certainly not a comfortable position for a new plant, it is a scenario that demands the most from the best qualified, disciplined, and creative team members and forces a disciplined adherence to the SM in spite of temptations to deviate from it. A failed pilot is at best a lost opportunity and at worst the harbinger of a failed venture so it may be difficult to locate a post mortem or read of the lessons learned as the victims (not to mention those accountable) often have little incentive to propagate the pain. This paper takes a very process-centric look at how the SM lies at the foundation of properly executed pilots and how the various forces inherent in the plant condition can be managed to keep their execution on track towards achieving the goals. It demonstrates how the tenets of process safety management, good engineering/project management techniques, and an ever-increasing desire to develop more chemically responsible and sustainable solutions can be used to maintain focus on the priority and goals to help ensure success, while acknowledging that the goals themselves may change as data is gathered and the pilot organically adapts in response. In the final analysis, the raison d'être of the chemical engineer and what generally separates them from other disciplines is the mass and energy balance (MEB) gleaned from a properly executed pilot. Consequently, it is not an overstatement to suggest that the SM is the essential tool that should steer pilot endeavors if a goal is to be met, if a process is to see commercialization and if a business is to succeed.

The innovations friendly organization: Effective introduction of new technologies and innovations in oil and gas companies,"The challenges in introducing new technologies or advanced innovations in the Operating Units of the E & P Companies are manifold and surprisingly it is not about a lack of ideas or missing skilled staff at all. While the mandate for any E & P company is to innovate or to lag behind, often the attempts of introducing new technologies and innovations do not succeed due to factors that were left out either at the planning or at the execution stage. On the other side in the Operating Units (OUs) often the subject is associated to an alien technology team coming from the Head Quarter offices, that is in charge of it and once they get the required data or complete the test they will be gone, thus missing the purpose of promoting and establishing an innovations friendly culture inside the organization. The smooth introduction of new technologies and innovations to overcome specific technical or operational requirement does not necessarily happen because the management has decided to do it or somebody outside the organization is pursuing that. Instead it requires following a tailor suited approach as creative processes are the result of well motivated staff rather than of a decree. Hereby an approach is proposed based on Three Key Factors and Seven Components to effectively introduce Innovations and New Technologies. The Key Factors are: The Prevailing Creative Energy Flow, The Alignment to the Company Goals, The first one is related to the dynamical interactions underlying the site/area/organization where the technology or innovation is pursuit. It is based on the fact that in every OU of an E & P Company that is delivering on a yearly production target there is a prevailing energy flow that already contains a great deal of creativity to cope with the dynamical changes of the oil and gas reservoirs and the operations. It is about recognizing this energy flow, its influencing factors, main actors, stream direction, etc. in order to be able to first get attached to it and then to steer it accordingly. The second one is about getting fully aligned to the specific company goals so that the innovation or technology is supported by all the stake holders. Further it is also about properly cascading down the company goals and to establish a mechanism that promotes effective participation of the staff, in both forms, as individuals and as a team. The last one is about being fully aware of the Main Components of the Technology and Innovation Life Cycle that beyond the technical also involves organizational, strategically, operationally and human resource aspects. The use of the proposed approach is shown in specific field case examples that document its effectiveness. Considering the specific features of the above elements will be reflected in shorter times from the idea generation to the field implementation. Moreover it enables a workflow that effectively encourages the participation of everybody in the organization in the introduction of new innovative ideas and Technologies thus supporting a continuous improvement mode and a shift to an innovations friendly organization.",Armacanqui J.,Conference Proceeding,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE North Africa Technical Conference and Exhibition 2015, NATC 2015",2015-01-01,CoO WOGI Incorporated,
An ontology-based collaboration recommender system using patents,"Successful research and development projects start with finding the right partners for the venture. Especially for interdisciplinary projects, this is a difficult task as experts from foreign domains are not known. Furthermore, the transfer of knowledge from research into practice is becoming more important in research projects to enable the quick application of research results. This is in particular relevant for projects in medical engineering. Patents and publications contain technical knowledge which can be exploited to find suitable experts. Patents are usually more product-oriented as the inventors have to describe an application area and products might be protected by patents. On the other hand, scientific publications represent the state-of-the-art in research. The challenge is finding the right mixture of research- or application-oriented experts from different domains. Hence, we propose a recommender system for experts for a certain topic based on patent topic clustering, ontologies, and ontology matching, which maps patents to corresponding innovation fields. The medical engineering domain serves as a first test bed, since projects in this area are highly interdisciplinary.",Geisler S.; Hai R.; Quix C.,Conference Proceeding,"IC3K 2015 - Proceedings of the 7th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management",2015-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT,Ontology Engineering ;  Ontology Matching ;  Patent Analysis
An empirical research of the technological innovation effect on the export sophistication of China high-technology industry,"This paper adopts China 28 provinces' data from 1995 to 2011 and empirically analyzes the technological innovation effect on the export sophistication of China high-technology industry. After the statistical analysis of the technology innovation level and the export sophistication of China high-technology industry, the results show that both of them have obvious regional differences. The eastern region has higher value than the middle and western regions. Further empirical research shows that technological innovation can improve the export sophistication of China high-technology industry. While this effect depends on the level of economic development and export scale, the lower level of economic development and the larger scale of exports can produce greater impact. The eastern and middle regions have the same conclusion. Since the financial crisis in 2008, technological innovation has played significant role in promoting the export sophistication of the high-technology industry and this effect has not had any differences in regions with different economic development levels.",Shen L.,Conference Proceeding,"WMSCI 2015 - 19th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Fujian Normal University,Economic development ;  Export scale and regional differences ;  Export sophistication ;  High-technology industry ;  Technology innovation

Do Australian universities encourage tacit knowledge transfer?,"The purpose of this paper is to explore whether Australian universities encourage tacit knowledge transfer. In doing so, the paper also explores the role of managers (academics' supervisor) in promoting or hampering tacit knowledge transfer and the value given to new ideas and innovation. This study collected data by conducting interviews of academics in four universities and a qualitative narrative analysis was carried out. The findings suggest that universities generally encourage and facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge; however there are some areas that require improvement. Avenues for improving tacit knowledge transfer call for open communication, peer-trust and unrestricted sharing of knowledge by managers. The study was conducted in four universities, hence limits the generalisability of the findings. This paper will contribute to further research in the discipline of tacit knowledge, provide understanding and guide universities in their tacit knowledge transfer efforts and in particular, encourage the transfer of tacit knowledge.",Chugh R.,Conference Proceeding,"IC3K 2015 - Proceedings of the 7th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management",2015-01-01,CQUniversity Australia,Academics ;  Encourage ;  Knowledge ;  Knowledge management ;  Tacit knowledge ;  Tacit knowledge transfer ;  University

An outline of simulation software packages to cultivate outstanding application oriented technocrats: Innovation for future,"Presently, engineering education in India has witnessed a major change. Usually, one of the major problems of engineering graduates is that after getting the bachelor degree, they are not ready to face the real life challenges due to the lacking of simulation skills required as per industrial environment. Indeed, analytical, experimental, simulation and communication skills are vital to prepare globally competitive vibrant technocrats. In context of these skills, simulation practices are an integral part of engineering and technology programme. Simulation provides verification of basic theory and application of logical analysis to solve real world problems. The study of researchers and professionals shows that student who used simulation prior to conduct practical performed better than the professionals who conducted the laboratory exercises without conducting simulation first. No doubt that simulation can't replace the traditional hands on experience, but it can enhance the teaching, learning and research experience.

High performance rowing: A research outlook using a coaches perspective,"The purpose of this paper is to explore research opportunities in the Olympic sport of rowing. While innovation in equipment is promoted in rowing the FISA rules don't allow for it to be a deciding factor in the performance outcome for an individual crew. Thus, the challenge is to look at innovative ways to develop these abilities within a boat and harness their energy to create the most efficient and effective machine. This paper describes an outlook identifying four areas containing research opportunities with an emphasis on being able to 'fine tune' the moving parts of the engine that is a rowing crew: Sonification in the learning of motoric movement, rowing dynamics that will impact the hydrodynamics around the hull by inducing pitch and heave instead of forward propulsion, surface structures and finally objectivity in on water performance. A research outlook is made into different research opportunities in Rowing, using a coaches perspective. Another novelty is the comparison of the work carried out by the athletes in the rowing to the situation in production systems with assembly operators working at assembly workstations, opening up an new area of well-established theories to by utilised in sports.",Finnsgård C.; McGowan D.,Conference Proceeding,icSPORTS 2015 - Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress on Sport Sciences Research and Technology Support,2015-01-01,SSPA Sweden AB;Chalmers University of Technology;Mölndals Rodd Klubb,Coaches perspective ;  Olympic sports ;  Production systems ;  Research outlook ;  Rowing ;  Sonification

Experimental assessment of integrated technology application used to rain (WM4RR) & floods reduction (AR-DWIS) in Jakarta,"Flood has always been a problem in Indonesia since the colonization era. The provincial rules in Jakarta Number 20/2013 stated that the 4% of land covered by building must compensate with 4% holes volume on that area. However, the data shown that ±30% of Jakarta's land surface is located under sea level and most building in Jakarta is not follow those rules. Furthermore, the capacity of all drainage in Jakarta has lower capacity than required and only 30% of that drainage working properly. Nowadays, the open green land of Jakarta is only 9.9% with 1.9% change-land use rate per year. Government of Jakarta has policy mentions that every deep-well exploitations must registered with water tax. To anticipate future floods, BPPT has a flood solution concept by combining two activities, for example rain reduction (Weather Modification for Rain Reduction, WM-4-RR; Seto et. al., 2011), and flood reduction with Artificial Recharge Deep Well Injection System (AR-DWIS; Sudinda et.al., 2006-2009), and technology innovation such as WM-RR & AR-DWIS (Goenawan et.al., 2014). The WM-4-RR & AR-DWIS have proven to be able to reduce flood approximately to 33% as stated by Mohajit et.al. (2014). It was assumed that flood peak in Jakarta is equivalent to 800 m3/s, therefore Jakarta needs until 2000 AR-DWIS in which each capacity is 400 l/s. While, BPPT and Ristek's building has made experiment & development for AR-DWIS (BR-1) since 2006, the capacity is still 1.43 l/s or 85.71 l/minute or 2.057 m3/hour.",Goenawan R.; Ridwan R.; Sadly M.; Sudinda T.; Kudsy M.; Seto T.; Harsoyo B.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2015-01-01,Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi,Artificial recharge ;  Flood reduction ;  Weather modification
Classification of TRIZ techniques using a cognition-based design framework,"The role of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) techniques within engineering design is examined through the lens of Cognition- based Design (CBD). The paper aims to answer some of the questions sought by the design community at large and to provide some directions for scholars and practitioners on how TRIZ techniques can be applied during various stages of the design process. The CBD framework is based on a systems-view that integrates core principles coming from traditional engineering design with fundamental concepts as they are used in cognitive psychology and other fields related to cognition (e.g., problem solving, creativity, and learning theory). The paper provides the details of the proposed cognition-based classification scheme for TRIZ techniques. This is illustrated with the help of the CBD framework. The classification scheme is based on three components: (1) the stage of the design process in which TRIZ techniques are applied and the primary cognitive function supported by the technique; (2) the cognitive level required for mastery of the technique; and (3) the cognitive style simulated through the technique. The aim of this classification scheme is to help design practitioners and TRIZ students make better choices about the techniques they will use, based on the challenges of the given design opportunity, rather than choosing only those techniques they are familiar with. Recommendations are given for making use of the new classification scheme and guidelines for future research. That research can also identify potential loopholes in the problem solving process and techniques, as they are currently available to the designer.",Samuel P.; Ohler M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2015-01-01,BMGI;BMGI,Adaption-innovation theory ;  Cognition-based design ;  Cognitive style ;  TRIZ techniques

Identifying and reformulating knowledge items to fit with the Inventive Design Method (IDM) model for a semantically-based patent mining,"The analysis of initial situation is necessary when dealing with the complex engineering situation. Furthermore, innovation is the underlying foundation of technological advances and today's competitive economy. Patents contain important research and it is also possible to find within them a kind of history of the evolution of an artifact. Used effectively, patents can help to provide businesses and individuals work with innovative ideas. In this context, the engineers may very often need to analyze them in order to benefit from the knowledge contained therein to organize their inventive task. However, patents are lengthy and rich in technical terminology; analyzing patents may require a lot of human effort. Thus, automating the process is very timely. To facilitate this, several patent analysis tools have been created. There are also patent analysis tools dedicated to highlighting various values of tools, but very few of them are designed to extract information or knowledge contained in patents. This paper presents an ongoing research on knowledge extraction for the Inventive Design Method (IDM), which extends from TRIZ, the theory of inventive problem solving.",Souili A.; Cavallucci D.; Rousselot F.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2015-01-01,INSA Strasbourg,IDM ;  Knowledge discovery ;  NLP ;  Patent mining ;  Text-mining ;  TRIZ
Time based separation: Compression on final approach and time based separation for optimized runway delivery,"The report ‘Compression on final approach and Time Based Separation for optimized runway delivery’ is the result of a nine month master thesis study performed at the research and development unit of EUROCONTROL, and is part of the Optimized Runway Delivery Study (ORD). The research assignment has been provided by EUROCONTROL and the Air Transport and Operations Department of the Aerospace Engineering faculty at Delft University of Technology. This study is executed in cooperation with NLR, various airports, pilots and air traffic controllers. The report shows relevant investigated runway compression issues on final approach, and will provide fundamental information regarding the process from going over from a Distance Based Separation (DBS) to a Time Based Separation (TBS) during final approach. During this process derived characterization issues will be incorporated in the TBS methodology or act as support requirements for Air Traffic Control (ATC). Therefore this report can be used as a basis for the future TBS concept and for a better characterization of the compression effect. In this research, firstly individual characterization performances are examined, such as, the time to fly, the deceleration and stabilization fix, airspeeds, aircraft type and flight manual system. This will be done for a better understanding of the speed profile and the compression effect on final approach. Secondly, these performances will be verified with Vienna airport, RECAT-EU and Boeing data and incorporated into a DBS model. Thirdly, the model will be translate into a TBS FFH (Floris Friso Herrema) model by giving as input the most relevant extracted characterization issues. Finally, the report shows two case studies, in which TBS FFH and TBS OSED 1 models are tested in real radar tracks, using both Airbus and Boeing medium aircraft types. By comparing the performances of these two TBS models, the best performances will be extracted by looking at the least time separation error. The innovation of this study is that the aircraft performances, runway compression issues and air traffic control solutions for applying TBS are now, for the first, time captured mathematically in a model, in order to evaluate the system requirements and constraints to cater to compression. With this model the potential performance improvements and related compression issues by using a TBS methodology, can be predicted.",Herrema F.; Zhao W.; Curran R.; Treve V.; Graham R.,Conference Proceeding,"15th AIAA Aviation Technology, Integration, and Operations Conference",2015-01-01,Delft University of Technology;Airport Research/Directorate ATM,
Does TRIZ change people? Evaluating the impact of TRIZ training within an organisation: Implications for theory and practice,"The author conducted research into the impact of TRIZ training within a global FMCG organisation, repeating the research of Birdi et al (2010) [1], which was conducted within a global engineering company. This research is based on Birdi et al's (2010) [1] model, which suggests that different individual and contextual factors are required for different parts of the innovation process (idea generation, followed by implementation). This study has highlighted potential mechanisms that underlie creative behaviour: namely, cognitive factors (creative thinking skills), and affective factors (motivation to innovate and creative self-efficacy ; and developed further a method of measuring them. The questionnaire (n=122) found that Birdi et al.'s (2010) [1] suggested mechanism of how TRIZ training improves idea generation - by improving levels of cognitive and affective factors - was partially supported. Trainees reported higher levels of creative self-efficacy, motivation to innovate, idea generation and patent submissions than non-trainees: while creative thinking skills were shown to be associated with higher levels of idea generation, no difference was found comparing trainees to non- trainees. Birdi et al. (2010) [1] predicted environmental support for innovation would influence idea generation and implementation, which was not supported, however as predicted, some of the measures of job-relevant capabilities were better predictors for idea implementation than training. Different levels of impact were found according to how much training the participants had received. This study therefore suggests some of the mechanisms by which TRIZ improves innovative behaviour at work: by providing an understanding of the functional changes as a result of training, better evaluation can be conducted by measuring individual's changes in cognitive and affective factors, providing a more rigorous measure of the impact of TRIZ training. The implications for practitioners in delivering the most effective TRIZ training are discussed (in terms of focus, structure and learning outcomes), as well as the limitations of TRIZ training and the other factors organisations need to consider in order to increase their innovative output. This research contributes to the literature by being one of the few evaluations of innovation training which is theoretically driven, conducted within an organisation, and repeats past work using the same training content (TRIZ). The research was conducted as part of the author's MSc in Occupational Psychology, and while she is a TRIZ trainer and practitioner herself, this research was conducted at an organisation which had received training in TRIZ from another consultancy.",Haines-Gadd L.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2015-01-01,"Birkbeck, University of London",Creativity ;  Evaluation ;  Innovation ;  TRIZ training
Research on the efficacy of creative risk management approach based on reverse thinking,"Based on Sabotage Analysis as one of TRIZ techniques, we developed Creative Risk Management Approach based on Reverse Thinking (CRMART). CRMART is very effective not only as a method to prevent human errors at site of work in manufacturing and construction industries but also as a risk management method based on future-oriented thinking against New-Type Risks (NTR) in IT field with drastic advances in technical innovations. Introducing CRMART in a variety of real projects, we have got a reputation from practitioners who experienced CRMART through risk management activities. Judging from the above, it is clear that CRMART really plays the field and is flexible method. And now, reverse thinking in CRMART comes from ""Other Way Round"" called No.13 principle in 40 Inventive principles. However, the most important feature of CRMART is that the risk factors we grasp get converted to functions we should practice by utilizing Functional Analysis (FA) in Value Engineering (VE). Because it's possible to move the risk factors from non-participant observer to central player in a risk management activity logically by transforming risk factors from usual risk items into functions. Putting risk factors to central players means that capacity for imagination regarding the process coming up risks could be improved. That is to say, it is clear that capacity to respond to unanticipated risks has risen. Therefore, in this paper, we want to introduce a case study about proposed measures against divulging of information at a company as a typical unanticipated risk in information society, contrasting a case study we applied with proposed procedure of CRMART. Lastly, we would like to organize the advantages of this method as specific observer's eye as possible.",Sawaguchi M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2015-01-01,Waseda University,CRMART ;  Functional analysis ;  Sabotage analysis ;  Unanticipated risks
TRIZ 40 Inventive principles classification through FBS ontology,"Altshuller screened patents in order to find out what kind of contradictions were resolved or dissolved by the inventors/inventions and the way this had been achieved. From this he developed a set of 40 inventive principles. Since the first Altshuller's formulation [1], the inventive principles have been largely used and studied by academic institutions and private companies operating in the product innovation field. Research on inventive principles is focused on improving principle definitions by providing a huge list of examples to be used as analogy and customizing definitions for specific domains (i.e. informatics, business, chemical, manufacturing and more others). Meanwhile, many authors worked on classifications and comparisons with other design models or problem solving methods. One of the reasons for this interest can be found in an attempt to reduce the degree of subjectivity in the use of this tool. This problem can be attributed to the high degree of abstraction with which many principles are written, inducing inevitably to a certain freedom of interpretation. In some cases, during the problem approaching, this ambiguity may lead the user not to fully capture the inventive essence. The goal of this work is to analyze all 40 principles from a new design perspective, i.e. The FBS (Functional Behaviour Structure theory) [2], in order to overcome their ambiguity and ameliorate their efficacy. New definitions have been conceived to make the user aware if he/she is acting on the function, the behavior or the structure of the device. This analysis has revealed that in many cases there is already a perfect matching between original Altshuller's definitions and FBS logic. That means a large part of the principles forces the user to act both on the function, the behaviour and the structure of the system. Where the matching with FBS is not complete, this classification/reformulation can help to enlarge the range of its interpretation/suggestions broadening the solution space. The potentiality of this work has been tested on a set of industrial case studies solved by 40 mechanical and management engineering students and by a group of TRIZ experts.",Russo D.; Spreafico C.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2015-01-01,Università degli Studi di Bergamo,FBS ;  Inventive principles ;  TRIZ

Design of resilient production facilities through innovation and risk management,"This paper presents a resilient approach to designing production facilities and processes based on the capability of organizations to effectively innovate and adapt to changes and risk while maintaining quality and profitability. It presents a practical and innovative method that uses benchmarking to show how to identify risk factors and develop prioritized contingency plans for marine facilities, based on risk and criticality of operational weaknesses. The investigation is descriptive and research-based, combining field research with bibliometric case studies. The research illustrates the relationship between variables, and an oil industry case study provides the context for the research. The process used includes assessing risk, characterizing effects, evaluating resilience capacity, and designing solutions. Risk assessment is developed for operational, process, supply chain, and other risks, whereas the capacity for resilience is assessed on the basis of capabilities to monitor the environment, incorporate process flexibility, and adapt organizationally to change. In addition, the bibliometric analyses of companies in the energy sector were conducted to identify and document best practices and lessons learned. On the basis of this investigation, a strategic framework for facilities development was formulated that incorporates excellence in operations, innovation, and efficiency. This process optimizes the management of resilient facilities based on the implementation of an integrated cycle, including a proactive business and corporate culture. It includes assessing risk, evaluating response capability, designing the balance between reactive and proactive capabilities, planning resilience, and managing the implementation of the facilities planning strategy. The paper underscores the importance of integrating and improving business processes and tools to facilitate decision making in a timely and reliable manner while managing risk and operational and environmental uncertainties. Consequently, in addition to focusing on the causes of changes and risks, resilience is oriented toward enabling adaptation to changes during the project lifecycle in the face of the unknown. Usually, companies have a tendency to dedicate their resources to the area of highest vulnerability (high occurrence and high impact) and to neglect the areas of medium vulnerability that result from low impact but high frequency events. The medium impact method identifies these risks; it also defines factors that contribute to designing resilient facilities, creating competitive advantage, managing internal and external adversities, and incorporating lessons learned from other projects. Growing uncertainty within various business areas has attracted the attention of many companies, particularly within the oil and gas industry, in which many risk factors in exploration, drilling, production, and marketing are managed onsite. This paper summarizes best practices and lessons learned from benchmarking cases of resilient organizations that have integrated risk management methods for uncertainty and achieved high value innovations within their processes and products. These companies have attained excellence in operations while effectively innovating.",Uzcategui M.; Mathison J.; Soto A.,Conference Proceeding,"SPE Latin American and Caribbean Health, Safety, Environment, and Sustainability Conference 2015",2015-01-01,Halliburton,

The correlation of organizational practices for the creation of ideas in suggestion programs,"The Programs of Idea Management appeared in the end of the 19th century, getting popular around the middle of the 20th century with the Quality Movement. In Brazil, they were spread as a method that works toward increasing the performance levels of the practices focusing on innovation. Thus, this paper's goal is to identify the correlation between the four organizational practices regarding culture, the environment, the acknowledgment systems and the practices and techniques encouraging the creation of ideas to promote innovation in Suggestion Programs. In order to do that, the research was conducted in two steps: the first was sending surveys, via the internet, with four blocks of questions to 48 large-sized Brazilian companies. Of the sent surveys, 21 returned filled out. For the second step, the accessibility standard was adopted, resulting in 11 interviews. This way, the triangulation of the data was done to identify the practices and techniques used by the companies to improve the innovation processes and development. For the descriptive analysis of the data, the results were examined through the average score of each of the 21 organizations. For the quantitative analysis, a statistical correlation was done to the data from the four practices, in order to identify the correlation between them. The literature identifies innovation management as a work process to enable innovation and to increase competitive edge, achieving positive results within the company's goals. The Suggestion Programs stand out as a tool of continuous improvement for the products and processes, widely spread and adopted by Japanese industries through the Toyota Production System. On those programs, the employees contribute with their ideas, which are evaluated according to the company's goals. The authors of the approved ideas are rewarded and acknowledged in order to inspire an environment and culture of innovation. The main results show the relevancy of the mission and of the organizational values such as communication elements, encouragement to experimentation and freedom, investment in trainings for professional and personal development, implementation of a profit distribution policy and the promotion of techniques centered on idea creation, which make for a set of strategies adopted by the companies to inspire and generate an innovative and creative environment.",De Fátima Stankowitz R.; De Carvalho H.; Dos Reis D.; Dergint D.; Picinin C.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Positivo;Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná,Idea creation ;  Organizational practices ;  Suggestion programs
Impact of Intellectual Property Rights from Publicly Financed Research and Development on research alliance governance mode decisions,"Recently, demands to generate more economic benefit from publicly financed Research and Development (R&D) in South African has resulted in the enactment of the Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) and the Intellectual Property Rights from Publicly Financed Research and Development (IPRPFRD) Acts. Strengthening Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) for publicly financed R&D ensures that research organisations maximise the full national value of the Intellectual Property (IP) that they generate, but potential negative spill over effects on the perceived value of a research alliance might deter an existing alliance partner from continued collaboration, or a potential alliance partner from future collaboration. Hence, the perceived strength of such IPRs legislation can be viewed as a factor external to a research alliance and needs to be considered during the decision making process of strategically selecting an optimal research alliance governance model in order to maximise the perceived value of such a research alliance. This study, performed in 2010 within the context of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), consisted of two distinct research phases with the goal of developing a decision making model that would enable strategists at publicly financed R&D organisations to analyse and predict governance mode decisions, as well as select optimal governance mode structures for research alliances. Using a qualitative online survey amongst senior managers at the CSIR, followed by narrative enquiry and constant comparative method analysis, the first phase of the study aimed to qualitatively identify impact domains within the Acts, which could potentially influence research alliances with publicly financed R&D organisations. The first phase determined that the highest ranked impact domains included the choice of IPRs ownership, state walk-in rights on undeclared IP, and benefit-sharing policies for the creators of IP. The second phase was quantitative in nature and used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to attempted to construct and verify a decision making model based on Value-Mediation Governance (VMG) theory. This phase revealed that stronger perceived IPRs regimes are positively related to the preference for quasi-hierarchy research alliance governance modes. Furthermore, it established that the expected value of a research alliance acted as a mediating factor on the relationship between the perceived IPRs regime strength and the preferred research alliance governance mode.",Staphorst L.; Holland M.; Pretorius L.; Pretorius T.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Gordon Institute of Business Science;University of Pretoria;The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,Intellectual Property Rights ;  Research Alliances ;  Value-Mediation Governance
Method for decision making in the management of innovation: Criteria for the evaluation of ideas,"This article aims at the construction of a method to aid decision associated to the initial processes of innovation management decision, which was applied in a company in the energy sector, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Field research were conducted in companies that have defined the innovation processes, two within the energy sector and two outside, seeking to understand their operation. Meetings with experts were also conducted, aiming to define important aspects, both strategic and cultural factors to the company. Complementing, were identified and compared in the literature, different ways to select and prioritize innovative ideas that assist the process of innovation management, generating a list of relevant criteria. As a result there was obtained a quantitative structure of decision making that makes explicit the panorama related to earnings and the implications that a project proposal (idea) can generate for the company, considering both their strategic issues as its annual investments.",Correa C.; De Moura Ferreira Danilevicz Â.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul;Companhia Estadual de Distribuição de Energia Elétrica - CEEE-D,Innovation ;  Innovation criteria ;  Management ;  Projects ;  Research and development (R & D)
Automobile innovation technology in emerging nations with a special reference to India and South Africa,"World Bank Report (2014) draws attention to the fact that globalization has narrowed technological divides between two directions that is north and south, thereby making level of playing field for developing countries. Precisely, it opens a superior question of technological advancement of developing countries, to which this paper intends to dwell on. Technologies playing a vital role in the sustainability of high rates of economic growth in countries like India that has witnessed rapid expansion of market in recent decades, similar to South Africa. Thus, it attempts to make a comparative study between these two countries, namely India and South Africa, on the basis of technological advancement that are either commercialized or initiated.

Strategic implications of technology life cycle on technology commercialization,"A technology life cycle (TLC) can be a useful tool to help us to estimate the future development of a specific technology and make decisions whether to invest in it or not. However, it is not easy to understand the stage status of its TLC. One approach to analyzing TLC is to observe the patterns of patent applications or citations over time. In this paper, we build a model to calculate the TLC for a certain technology through the analysis of technology cycle time (TCT) based on backward citation of patents. The model includes the following steps: first, we focus on devising and assessing patent-based TLC indicators, then we choose some technologies with identified life cycle stages, and finally find strategic implications on firms' technology commercialization. The method used and result obtained in this study can be used in technology management practice to enable technology observers to determine the current life cycle stage of a particular technology of interest.",Park H.; Sung T.; Kim S.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information,Patent citation ;  Technological innovation ;  Technology commercialization ;  Technology cycle time ;  Technology life cycle ;  Technology management
The use of TRM as a guiding tool for the planning innovation in the development of eco-efficient fuels for air transport,"It is anticipated that in the next twenty years, air transport will have a growth of almost twice the rate of global GDP growth. This accelerated industry expansion has caused some negative consequences. The aviation industry has committed to change this scenario and the goal is to halve the emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to develop eco-efficient aviation fuels that minimize the negative impacts as in the case of replacing fossil fuels derived from renewable resources fuel, which allows the reduction by 80% of the CO2 emission. In this sense, this study seeks to contribute to this issue by proposing a management tool to guide innovation in this sector, the technology roadmap - TRM. From the desk research and content analysis, studies of reports and database were made in order to identify future and present needs to the planning process of innovation in the development of eco-efficient fuel used for air transport in Brazil needs. The framework is presented as a result contributes to planning innovation in this sector to this sector and identified products, technologies, resources and partnerships necessary for the development of eco-efficient fuel for the sector in Brazil.",Traguetto J.; Caetano M.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal de Goiás,Air transport ;  Eco-efficient fuel ;  Management of innovation ;  Technology roadmap
Lessons learned about technology monitoring in the solar photovoltaic energy segment,"The practice of using technology monitoring to keep track of technological advances is increasingly valued, and its systematic use is understood as essential to business in the new knowledge economy. The structuring of the technological monitoring process has become a growing need for organizations to keep up with the significant and rapid changes of technology in their core business and to better understand its business impact in order to support the decision-making process of companies. An effective technology monitoring process should be based on a company's business needs and on the information required for the fitting to strategic guidelines. This encompasses the right selection of databases, the establishment of the search strategy and keywords to be applied, the screening of the retrieved information, the analysis and consolidation of this information, and the right format and display of the relevant data and future trends to help the management decision. Photovoltaic solar energy reached the capacity of 139 GW in 2013, being an expanding market with a high number of government funding projects in the United States and in the European Union. Therefore, a survey was carried out about the new technologies and related business scenarios for this kind of power generation, using technology monitoring tools. Energy generation via photovoltaic cells has been known for a long time, since the Becquerel studies in the XIX century. Solar photovoltaic energy enables the generation of distributed electric energy, preventing long transmission and distribution lines, besides being a silent energy source that can be easily integrated into buildings without the need of additional installation areas; for these reasons, its application is being fostered by government programs. The main step of the technology monitoring methodology is discussed, and the peculiarities and difficulties encountered in the process are pointed out. A survey of the scientific and technological developments in this area of knowledge was carried out, using patents and scientific papers with the time frame from the beginning of 2008 to the end of 2013. The lessons learned in this process and the major facilitating factors and difficulties for the retrieval, screening and analysis of the information collected are reported.",Leite L.; Mendes F.; De Oliveira Rodrigues Schumacher S.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,Decision-making support ;  Innovation management ;  R&D management ;  Solar photovoltaic energy ;  Technology monitoring
Disclosing the development capabilities of the firm,"It is a fact that the product development is the industrial firm's survival. Even if the products developed are not so new, there is an internal ability to develop them. This ability encompasses a set of knowledge, skills and routines called development capability. Furthermore, the kind of product improvement achieved is a result of the development capability accessed. However, to reach innovation through new product development, it is necessary that it provides positive returns to the firm. Considering innovative performance as something new that provides economic return to the firm such as increasing profits, market share and sales, what is the role and types of development capabilities needed to achieve higher innovative performance? This research presents the Innovation Capabilities Model and a cluster analysis in order to realize three types of development capability configurations, based on a survey with 1107 firms cross-sectorial. Such as expected, the majority of the outcomes are product improvements. However, each type of development capability has been achieved through different firms' performance and one of them, the ""developer cluster"", is enhanced by having highest development capability. This kind of research helps to disclose the development capability configurations of the firm and aims to answer what is relevant to innovative performance. Yet, more in-depth research is needed to explore the underlying reasons for the relationship between the development capability configurations and its performances in order to describe types of new product development. This research seeks to expand the discussion on the capabilities needed for developing new product and, thus, to reach innovation.",Barbieux D.; Zawislak P.; Padula A.; Camboim G.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,Development capability ;  Innovation ;  Innovative performance ;  New products development ;  NPD
Innovation lessons learned from the joule EV development,"The establishment in 2005 of Optimal Energy, a start-up business with the objective of ""establishing and leading the Electric Vehicle industry in South Africa and expanding globally"", was considered by many as too ambitious in the African context. The company flourished however, and by December 2010 had four road-worthy prototypes and an astonishing success in the global media. The Joule Electric Vehicle was a ""born electric"" 5-seater passenger car, sporting a totally new vehicle design incorporating locally developed battery, motor and software technologies. Despite the technical and marketing success achieved Optimal Energy was liquidated in June 2012. Even with a rigorous and successful development process, a strong team of 108 people, substantial in-house technology and an impressive network of partners and suppliers, the company lacked local funding and had to close. This paper outlines some of the Innovation lessons learned by the author, previously a co-founder and the Chief Technical Officer of the organisation. An overview of the Joule concept and its innovation process is given, bringing together aspects of Systems Engineering, the development process and the funding challenges. Several innovation and commercialisation challenges are discussed, particularly those that are most often missed in the South African context. The conclusions presented will hopefully help level the path for other start-up companies, particularly those relying on government funding.",Swart G.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Alphadot (Pty) Ltd.,Development ;  Funding ;  Innovation ;  Joule ;  Lessons ;  Process
Building relationship quality in electronic commerce,"The creation of value seems to be a key factor for a sustainable growth to any organization, especially when the market is geographically huge like the Brazilian market which remains cautious in a slow ongoing global economic recovery scenario. Technological innovation allows different strategies to attend wants and needs of customers. Compared to traditional physical stores, electronic commerce offers an easier access and search process to the buyer, i.e., allowing them to easily find the most suitable offer, concerning brands, price, delivery and freight rates. This landscape heightens the challenge for sellers to develop a relationship quality marketing with their clients instead of a transactional marketing approach, which sometimes means one sole purchase. So, commitment, satisfaction and trust that one inspires on ones clients appear to be even more important to e-commerce businesses, since price and other selling conditions are very similar. In this paper we report on our studies about the construction of a model to measure the relationship quality between consumers and e-commerce sellers, exploring demographic variables, attitude, behavior and loyalty toward electronic purchase, perceived value, commitment, satisfaction and trust. A first survey was conducted with a non-probabilistic sample extracted from a Brazilian nationwide electronic commerce vendor database covering 2009-2013 period. Around 1200 clients answered the online research about behavior and attitude toward e-commerce. Statistical tests (Chi-square, t test) were conducted to get a general overview. We did not find evidences of action loyalty, meaning that despite the respondents declaring they believe (cognitive loyalty) and like (affective loyalty) the e-seller, their intention to buy (conative loyalty) sometimes does not transform into action. These initial findings have led us to expand our research to include perceived value, commitment, satisfaction and trust, using Structural Equation Modeling, establishing links among those constructs concerning the relationship quality between the buyer and the e-commerce seller.",Moriguchi S.; Barbon S.; Murakami L.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Estadual de Londrina;Universidade Federal do Ceará;Universidade Federal de Uberlândia,Buyer-seller relationship ;  E-commerce ;  Perceived value ;  Relationship quality ;  Structural equation modeling ;  Technology impact
Scientific production analysis of resilient enterprises,"The term resilient originates from physics and is used in most scientific areas, from psychology to environmental studies and information technology. In this Brazilian research paper the focus was the concept of resilience as applied to business administration. A resilient enterprise, the one that recovers itself from crises before competitors take over, minimizes the impact on its clients through the use of flexibility, innovation and self-knowledge. Resilient enterprises aim to improve regional development. To ascertain how a resilient enterprise succeeds, the first proposition was to identify its scientific roots. What research has already been done on the topic? Who is currently studying it? Where are these researchers based? What exactly does the concept 'resilient' actually mean? This paper we will report on the results of scientific production analysis on resilient enterprises. In order to achieve the objective of this paper the methodology used was both qualitative and quantitative bibliographical and bibliometric exploratory research. Quantitative analysis was used to find out how many publications mentioned the term resilient enterprise, also we looked at where, when, and who wrote these publications. A Qualitative approach was employed using the concept interpretation of the papers found. The data base used (Portal de Periódicos da Capes-MEC-Brasil) is academically recognized and brings productions from all countries in the world. According to expectations, we did not achieve many results with our search: just 274 in the general research, 143 after restricted by peer review, and only 33 papers matching the search goal. As a conclusion, academic production on resilient enterprise comes basically from USA (55%), but there are 12 countries on the list, what shows an incipient production. Considering chronological analysis, 82% was done after 2005, and 55% after 2010. The most frequently referred to author, writing about logistics and supply chain process was Yossi Sheffi, from MIT. The search results, indicate a straight relationship between resilience and innovation in business management.",Livramento T.; De Oliveira E.; Rodrigues M.; Moraes M.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade de Taubate,Regional development ;  Resilient enterprise ;  Scientific production analysis
Technology innovation policy for the bioeconomy,"Korea has a strong potential on biotechnological research and industrial capabilities. The Korean government recognized biotechnology was the key factor that will allow the nation to be a leading country and had begun promoting biotechnology after enacting of the Genetic Engineering Support Act [now known as the Biotechnology Support Act in 1995] in 1983. When formulating of Basic Plan for Biotechnology Support (""Biotech 2000"") in 1993, the government started to coordinate governmental biotechnology policies. In 2006, the government established the 2nd Basic Plan for Biotechnology Support (""Bio-Vision 2016"") in an effort to achieve a goal of making Korea a biotechnology leader in the world, according to the vision of realizing a sound health life and prosperous bioeconomy. But the governmental R&D investment on biotechnology began to increase rapidly in the 2000s. In 2013, US$2.6 billion was invested. And it's nearly 18.4% of total governmental R&D investment in Korea. Korea has taken great strides to set up an efficient institutional systems related to the biotechnology promotion. In this paper, using policy analysis model to illustrate, I demonstrate how the suggested model helps to set the policy formation and implementation analysis of Korean biotechnology. According to model, four categories of indicators play a major role in this analysis: inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes. The methodologies combine qualitative and quantitative methods, such as peer reviews, interviews, and S&T indicators. Eight ministries of Korean government were related to biotechnology promotion and implemented many governmental programs. Total production has increased by 26% from US$1.9 billion in 2002 to US$2.4 billion in 2004. There was also a drastic rise of the number of biotechnology start-ups. It was increased from 167 bio-venture companies in 1999 to 600 in 2001. And there has been a significant increase in the number of biotechnology research papers that are written by Koreans and published in international top academic journals such as Nature, Cell, and Science from 1 in 1996 to 10 in 2004. From 2000 to 2003, the number of Korean biotechnology patents within the U.S. has increased by 85% up to 204. Also international achievements in pharmaceutical development were achieved. For example, the 1st Korean global new drug, ""Factive"", was approved by U.S. FDA in 2003. But the total productivity of governmental R&D investment is not high yet in Korea. And now, the policy direction of new government is shifted to 'creative economy' and key concepts are 'creativity' and 'convergence'. Therefore the promotion of biotechnology start-ups is very important and similar to the state of governmental support from 2000 to 2005. I conclude by developing a policy agenda to guide the national paradigm shift to address current and future challenge in Korea. And the experiences in Korea show various policy implications that will render especially for developing countries.",Han S.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning,Bioeconomy ;  Biotechnology ;  Creative economy ;  Policy analysis ;  Policy implementation
The impact of public policies for innovation in the increasing number of patents - Brazil and China,"Innovation, generation of technologies and intellectual property are increasingly recognized as important issues and marks of competitiveness of business and economic development of countries. As such, the interaction between innovation and intellectual property has been analyzed by economists from different schools of thought. The same could be addressed to the connection and impact on the technological knowledge and the level of maturity of an economic system among countries and regions. This paper analyses how the configuration, structure and degree of interconnection between innovation and intellectual property policies influence the generation of technologies and patents in two countries with emerging economies - Brazil and China, and draws some considerations about the link between innovation strategy and economic performance in both countries. Our findings suggest that a relative small set of critical points, such as greater integration between innovation and IP policies, more aggressive role of local governments and long-term policies, allowed a much stronger performance of the Chinese innovation system as compared to the Brazilian.",Gonçalves A.; Do Canto Cavalheiro G.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (INPI);Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP),Industrial and innovation policies ;  Innovation systems ;  Intellectual property ;  Patents
Innovative logistics and supply chain management for sustainable food public procurement,"Food supply chains are increasingly asked to deliver sustainable products in a sustainable manner. Sustainability affects every segment of the supply chain and it is a key driver of innovation today. Even so, many companies are still reluctant to more environment-friendly investments. Public procurement through its ""power of purchase"" is one of the most influential means through which the state can effect behavioural change in economy and society. Forcing sustainable improvements in its suppliers, public procurement can have a huge influence over the food system, but organisational innovation is needed in logistics and supply chain management. In the food sector, fish supply chain is one of the most critical in terms of sustainability due to the overexploitation of oceans' resources, the decline in wild fish stocks and the big amount of waste generated along the chain from the ship to the consumers' plate. In this paper we report on our experience in innovating the logistics and the management of the fish supply chain for the school canteens of the city of Rome, in which around 150.000 pupils have lunch every day. The innovation consists of the introduction of fresh, organic, farmed fish of locally grown species transformed in attractive recipes, accurately studied based on the nutritional needs and the level of appreciation of the young consumers, instead of frozen, few wild fish presented in boring and tasteless preparations such as boiled fillets and breaded sticks. Examining the barriers and the solutions adopted, we explain how public procurement can become a creative force for sustainable development in the fish supply chain. A qualitative case study methodology is used where catering managers and staff, fish suppliers and distributors, food procurement officers, dieticians and nutritionists are interviewed. The innovations in logistics, organisation and management are defined in interaction with all the actors of the chain involved in the research and implemented under several different conditions. Observations of the feasibility of the supply chain, from production to consumption, are conducted to assess the results. Findings show an example of good practice in the area of sustainability in the food supply chain and illustrate the substantive progress that can be made in achieving supply chain sustainability. At the same time, the paper provides the specific challenges in developing a management model in which the power is more balanced along the chain and where a holistic approach requires to be taken to reach sustainable improvements. Considering the scarcity of work examining empirically the issue of sustainability in food supply chains, this study demonstrates the evolutionary process and its stages based on the examination of the Rome school canteens' supply chain and the sustainability approach it has taken with its suppliers. The author also illustrates a range of key implications that need to be considered by both managers and policy makers and it provides a range of areas where further research is required.",Pagliarino E.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Fish supply chain ;  Logistics ;  Management ;  Organisational innovation ;  Public procurement ;  Sustainability
Bottlenecks and drivers in Ethiopia's domestic biogas sector,"Ethiopia experiences an energy and environmental crisis due to the sustained reliance on woody biomass to satisfy its energy needs. A sustainable innovation that can improve this situation is domestic biogas. This paper analyses the current status of the domestic biogas sector in Ethiopia and identifies barriers and drivers that influence its development and further growth. The analytical framework used for the analysis combines the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) and Strategic Niche Management (SNM). The MLP consists of three levels: landscape, which contains national and global factors and trends; regime, which contains the current, traditional agriculture and energy sectors; and niche, in which the new innovation is being introduced. SNM looks into the niche level and investigates three processes: network formation, dynamics of expectations and learning processes. The information sources are threefold: (1) desk study through literature and internet research; (2) online interviews and questionnaires with Ethiopian stakeholders; (3) an extensive field study including an extensive number of interviews with stakeholders inside and outside Ethiopia. The biogas sector in Ethiopia started with the launch of the National Domestic Biogas (NBPE) programme in 2008, which has led to the dissemination of over 8,000 biodigesters up until now, about 60% of what was initially intended. At the landscape level, the use of domestic biogas has been triggered by Ethiopia's energy crisis as well as the suitability of the technology with the physical geography. However, the dissemination has been affected by factors such as economic instability, poverty and illiteracy. At the regime level, the inability of the traditional practices to solve the energy crisis has created a window of opportunity to provide alternative solutions that replace the use of firewood. However, many Ethiopian farmers are trapped in a lock-in, where due to their limited purchasing power they cannot afford the niche technology; at least in the way it is being disseminated. At the niche level, the NBPE designated a diverse set of actors to contribute to the implementation of the niche technology. However, their alignment is poor and the private sector is not involved. Expectations have had to be lowered because targets were not met. Also, learning processes are not optimal. Bottlenecks that were already identified in 2006, for example lack of involvement of the private sector, still remain unsolved. The current research is innovative because (1) it is the first case study into biogas in Ethiopia; (2) it analyses multiple regimes (the energy and the agriculture regime) and their interaction with the landscape and niche levels; and (3) it shows more insight in how the SNM and MLP frameworks can be applied to a sustainable innovation in a developing country and what can be done to overcome bottlenecks. Such insights in possible bottlenecks and how to overcome them contribute to sustainable growth.",Kamp L.; Forn E.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidad de Costa Rica;Delft University of Technology,Domestic Biogas ;  Ethiopia ;  Multilevel Perspective ;  Strategic Niche Management
Influence of government supports on technology innovation process: The case of Li-Ion battery in the United States,"Public support for technology innovation is a policy tool frequently used to foster research and development (R&D) efforts in private firms. It influences firm's R&D motivations, decision making process, and hence innovation performance. Besides factors pertaining to characteristics of firms receiving the support, the strategic behavior of project team, characteristics of the technology and the market, the regulatory environment, and the form and scale of public support can influence its effectiveness. How they influence the effectiveness remains an important policy and research question. This paper reports a study on the influence of two important forms of public support, namely government championship and assistance, in the innovation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology. This technology has experienced significant progress in recent years. Enormous efforts in the private sectors and public support from governments (notably United States, South Korea, and Japan) contributed to this progress. It is one of the most promising technologies to power electric vehicles, and will continue to be a high priority for public support. A survey was conducted among the project managers or principle investigators of more than 300 Liion battery R&D projects that have received financial supports from the U.S. federal government. Two types of government supports - championship and assistance - were studied. The strategic behavior of project teams is also considered, with the organization type and size as control variables. While our preliminary results confirm most of the findings in previous studies, this study also reveals different influence of government championship and assistance in technology innovation. In particular, the correlation between government assistance and strategic behavior seems significant. Through further analysis, this study will elucidate what government roles, and under what conditions, is more effective in technology innovation.",Yue X.; Sun G.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,College of Engineering and Applied Sciences,Government championship ;  Li-ion battery ;  Organization behavior ;  Technology innovation process
Science spin-offs in the context of Brazilian Academic entrepreneurship,"This paper analyzes the emergence of academic spin-offs, with a specific focus on those derived from basic knowledge in the natural sciences (mainly Physics and Chemistry). These companies emerged in the context related to science, technology and innovation and the evolution of the University's mission. Hence, it is possible to state the importance of initiatives to stimulate university-industry relationship, the transfer/licensing of technologies and the creation of spin-off companies. In addition, the literature review addresses the concepts related to academic entrepreneurship, as well as the definitions, development models and factors that affect the process of creation and development of academic spin-offs. Therefore, an exploratory and qualitative approach was adopted. Three case studies were conducted in chemistry and physics incubated companies founded between 1990 and 2009, created by senior researchers of University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The main interest was to understand the similarities and particularities of these companies within technology-based start-ups. By performing multiple case studies, it is possible to conclude that there are characteristics related to the entrepreneur and to his company that greatly influence their growth. These characteristics are mainly related to their process of creation and development, the importance of resources, corporate formation and team formation, the product development process and the articulation of the business model. These cases are important to stimulate entrepreneurial initiatives among researchers and professionals in those areas, as examples that induce the creation of a culture for generation of new business in the midst of academic origin.",Martins P.; Plonski G.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade de São Paulo;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Science ;  Technology ;  University spin-off
A systematic literature review on firm-level innovation management systems,"Innovation management has been defined as a set of organizational routines and activities aimed at developing a culture for innovation. As it can be expected, these routines and activities vary enormously among industries and firms. The systematic management of innovation at firm-level becomes even more complex when one considers the multiple interrelations and cooperative activities that occur in an increasingly open innovation paradigm. For these reasons, all kinds of models and proposals for firm-level innovation management have been proposed throughout the years. Some are fairly generic, while others are either industry- or firm-specific. Moreover, some models consider only what is within the firm's boundaries, while others consider its relationships with the whole business ecosystem. Finally, some models approach innovation from a product development perspective, while others concentrate on process innovation. As a result, there has been much confusion about what is and what constitutes an innovation management system. In fact, with few exceptions that are either limited in scope or level of analysis, no comprehensive systematic literature reviews on firm-level innovation management systems have been conducted. In this context, this paper presents partial results of a systematic review of published literature regarding innovation management systems. A total of 642 works were analysed by three researchers. In particular, this paper focuses on 27 of the 102 most relevant works. The main outcome is a tentative interpretative framework of innovation management systems that critically highlights and discusses their most common elements and aspects: an innovation process and elements that drive or support innovation. Implications for theory and practice are drawn from this taxonomy, including suggestions on how to use the proposed model for implementing a firm-level innovation management system.",Cortimiglia M.; Delcourt C.; De Oliveira D.; Correa C.; De Moura Ferreira Danilevicz Â.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul;Companhia Estadual de Distribuição de Energia Elétrica - CEEE-D,Innovation drivers ;  Innovation management ;  Innovation process ;  Literature review
Designing a technology and innovation platform for oncological drugs: An integrated foresight framework,"Technology platforms have been conceptualized as the result of the exploitation and reutilization of knowledge and experience accumulated by the institutions and firms in a sector, generating, with that, new knowledge and distinctive technological competences that can be shared by product families, applications and future businesses. This paper aims to present an integrated foresight framework customized for designing a technology and innovation platform and defining a strategic R,D&I Agenda for oncological drugs in Brazil. This framework encompassed: (i) development of technological roadmaps, looking for technological and market bottlenecks and opportunities for this segment in the period of 2013 to 2030; (ii) identification of local distinctive competences concerning four categories of oncological drugs - chemotherapy; hormone therapy; immunotherapy; and argeted therapies; (iii) establishment of strategic R,D&I portfolios for each category, considering local distinctive competences versus strategic importance for the Brazilian health system; and (iv) strategic roadmapping for designing the technology innovation platform for oncological drugs, considering three distinct time horizons. From this experience, one can conclude that: (i) the integrated foresight framework was demonstrated to be effective for designing a technology and innovation platform for oncological drugs in Brazil; (ii) the most promising local opportunities for cooperative R,D&I projects in this pharmaceutical segment could be identified; and (iii) it was possible to establish conditions for replication of this foresight framework at sectorial level for other drugs segments.",De Almeida M.; De Moraes C.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro;Universidade Candido Mendes,Distinctive competences ;  Integrated foresight framework ;  Oncological drugs ;  Technology platforms
Postal industry: Review and reengineering framework for sustainable growth,"No sector of the economy is immune to changes and the associated challenges that come with it as witnessed in the postal industry. The declining demand for postal mail service somewhat attributed to technological changes call for proactive reengineering approaches for sustainability and continual relevance of the postal mail sector in a rapid changing economy. The study reviewed the throughput of the postal industry in terms of operations, logistics and products from a global perspective and it attempts to relate it to what is obtainable in South African Post Office (SAPO) mail business using a comparative analysis approach. The study equally identified innovations within the postal industry and perceived factors that influence consumer demands resulting in declined mail volumes. In this paper, the reality of imminent future technological changes, the impending effect on the postal sector and structures required to remain relevant were also explored. In evaluating innovation, the postal industry trends were considered in terms of business growth parameters. Innovative dynamic models which have the potential of stimulating growth in the postal industry were explored from a technical point of view and recommendations were proposed accordingly. In future, the study can be expanded by considering legislations and social parameters in forecasting innovations.",Opeyeolu L.; Khumbulani M.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Tshwane University of Technology,Innovation ;  Postal reform ;  Postal service ;  South African Post Office ;  Sustainability ;  Technology
Balancing the strategic product portfolio based on market and competence needs,"Companies have to cope with challenges such as globalization, increasing market dynamics, increasing number of competitors and growing complexity of products. Long-term success can only be achieved by the future oriented planning of a consistent set of product characteristics, which meet market requirements of tomorrow and consider upcoming environmental influences (e.g. legislative regulations). In fact, a company should be ahead of the race and accomplish a competitive position that cannot be imitated easily. To develop such products it is necessary to anticipate the development of markets, technologies and the business environment. Thereby, future chances and opportunities can be detected at an early stage, to identify a beneficial position within the competitive arena of tomorrow. Focusing the engineering industry and especially small and mid-size companies, the outlined challenge is crucial: Manufacturers offer products with increasing technical complexity in a dynamic global market. The consequence is an extended time to market with high uncertainties regarding the product specifications. Thus, there is need for a management suitable approach, which takes into consideration all relevant information of different fields of influence. Within this paper we describe a suitable approach to balance the strategic product portfolio by means of meeting promising market demands and exploiting a company's competencies. Therefore we developed an approach that leads to consistent product concepts and evaluates their realization priority to decrease uncertainties in the early phase of product development. To prove the approach we validate the following steps in cooperation with a company of the automotive industry. In a first step, the approach focuses on the identification of factors that influence the product portfolio. In the considered validation case, over 30 influence factors were identified. By conducting a cross impact analysis, the factors are reduced to approximately 15 key-factors. For each key-factor up to five alternative characteristics were defined. Afterwards, a consistency analysis is performed, based on a pairwise evaluation of the characteristics. The results are consistent combinations (bundles) of characteristics, whereby exactly one characteristic of each key-factor is included in one bundle. Hence, the results can be interpreted as a description of consistent strategic product concepts. Additionally, current products of the considered company and competitors are evaluated, using the same characteristics as for the strategic product concepts. As one result, the competitive arena could be visualized by the similarity of the current products and the evaluated product concepts (represented by their distance) with the help of the multi-dimensional scaling. In a following step, a hierarchical structure of the products' functionality and a morphological box are developed to identify solution elements and technologies, which fulfill the required functions of a product concept. Then, necessary development tasks are derived and needed competencies are described. Next, these competencies are rated within a ""make, cooperate or buy portfolio"" by evaluating the company's competence position und the strategic relevance of a competence. The result is the ""make or buy rate"" of a product concept. In a last step, the market and technology priority of each product concept is rated and cumulated to determine their realization priority. Here, a management decision portfolio is created, to visualize the realization priority of the product concepts. In conclusion, we achieved a practicable combination of the market-based view and the resource based view within the strategic management. The validation case in the automotive industry shows, that the main benefit is given by the stepwise detailed and visualized information to support management decisions. The effort for generating this information is overcompensate by the decrease of uncertainties in the early product planning phase. In Addition, significant advantages regarding the consideration of a huge set of influence factors at one time could be achieved.",Rübbelke R.; Söllner C.; Gausemeier J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Paderborn University;Mercedes-AMG GmbH,Competence management ;  Complexity management ;  Innovation management ;  Resource planning ;  Strategic planning ;  Strategic product portfolio
"Technology, innovation and management for sustainable growth: A flexible toolkit for strategic technology management","Increased environmental and social responsibility awareness, while producing unique opportunities for sustainability-oriented innovations, has generated important challenges for companies. Based on the assumption that new technologies may support more sustainable business, the challenge of really integrating sustainability thinking into business processes is crucial. This paper aims at discussing the importance of sustainable growth thinking in business and strategic foresight as a backdrop to purpose a flexible toolkit for supporting strategic technology management in companies, based on Voros' conceptual model.

Analysis of the technical-scientific production of scholars grants CNPq on production engineering in Brazil: An assessment of years 2007-2009,"This paper analyses the academic production of researchers that have the so called ""productivity grants"" awarded by CNPq, the Brazilian research funding agency, in the field of Production Engineering in the period 2007-2009. The data was extracted from the resumes of Brazilian researchers in the Lattes Platform. The population of 101 researchers was grouped according to the level of their grants: 1ABSenior, 1CD, 2PQ and 2DT. The aggregate level 1ABSenior was found to be the one with the largest volume of high impact publications. Researchers in the aggregate group 1CD are the ones with the most publications in mid-impact journals. 2PQ and 2DT grant holders are the ones that supervise the most students at a masters' level. The 2DT researchers are more focused on hands-on technology and innovation. Based on that, one concludes that CNPq usually follows the award criteria for the grants. There seems to be logical coherence regarding the distribution of grants, at least with respect to the easily measurable progression criteria. However, there is some evidence that for criteria that are harder to assess, there may be some evaluation concerns that need to be addressed, in order to keep the process fair.",Picinin C.; Pilatti L.; Kovaleski J.; Graeml A.; Pedroso B.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná;Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa,Production engineering ;  Research grants ;  Scientific production
Restructuration of logistic networks: An industrial case study in Colombia,"In the current competitive environment, logistics has been considered one of the key elements that allows growth strategies for countries and companies. Emerging economies such as Colombia have implemented different plans to achieve sustainable development and technology advantages for the national firm's supply chain, but sometimes the region characteristics difficult the creation of networks. This inconvenient leads to the question: how can viable tactics lead companies to affront management logistic challenges in developing countries? The present paper introduces a proposal that contributes in the search of a possible solution in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry case in Colombia and similar regions. In first place, this paper presents the general variables that are affecting the management of logistic networks in Colombia based on specialized literature. After this, a Colombian FMCG corporation is studied in order to develop a simulation model and identify possible opportunities and solutions. Finally, relations between the results of the case study and the impact that would be generated through a general proposal for the country and comparable areas is established. As a result of this work, the status of Colombian logistics is evidenced, as well as the future perspectives and opportunities of strengthening in the management of networks in the country. Additionally, this investigation seeks to promote the discussion around possible applications and systems to increase the present performance in the FMCG business. People, organizations and productive sectors constantly need to update their methods and technology according to their objectives. The study aims to provide a divulgation space of experiences and impacts, and give logistics practitioners the opportunity to adapt the knowledge and strengthen the development of sustainable innovation for competitiveness. It is expected that over the years, the implementation of new procedures can be expanded to remote regions.",Gutierrez K.; Arguello L.; Jaimes W.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidad Nacional de Colombia,Development ;  Logistics ;  Network ;  Strategy ;  Supply chain management
The effect of mtm and the tam on innovation diffusion: A case in the construction industry,"The construction industry is perceived as not being innovative. However, innovation is a source of competitive advantage in the industry. Past research has shown that if architectural and engineering design firms fail to understand the mechanisms that drive innovation, the associated likelihood of economic growth will not be enjoyed. This research has therefore focused on determining the influence of Multiple Team Membership (MTM) on innovation diffusion within the framework of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The model developed for this research will aid with understanding the relationship between the TAM, MTM and innovation diffusion within teams. The results show that diversity dimension of MTM and Perceived Usefulness have impact on innovation diffusion. It is recommended that when an innovative technology is rolled out within an organisation, management should do so in teams of less diverse members and thoroughly educate employees on the usefulness of the innovation in their day to day jobs.",Dawood G.; Chan K.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Pretoria,Innovation diffusion ;  Multiple team membership ;  Technology acceptance model
Identifying the structure of research fields on venture,"""Venture businesses,"" ""start-ups,"" or and ""entrepreneurs"" bring many social and economic benefits. They promote innovation, boost the national economy, and create employment. Universities and research institutes are expected to foster human resources such as entrepreneurs to create the seeds of venture businesses. They also play an important role in the venture ecosystem by industry-government-academia cooperation. However, due to the rapidly increasing numbers of academic research papers on venture businesses, and the lack of a research overview, it is difficult to understand the whole structure of this field. This research overviews the studies on venture companies, reveals the emerging fields, and indicates the current state of venture research in Japan. We extracted academic papers including the words ""venture,"" ""start-up,"" or ""entrepreneur"" in the titles and abstracts from the Web of Science provided by Thomson Reuter's with data from 1900 to 2014. Then we conducted citation analysis for these papers using network analysis. With these search queries we extracted 67,130 papers. In addition, we specified five main clusters and fifteen sub-clusters (including 17,480 papers). From the result of analysis by country, we figured out that the share of Japanese papers was only about 1% in the data set. Also, through the time-series analysis, we identified young and growing research topics containing the keywords ""internationalization,"" ""born global,"" ""institutional entrepreneur,"" and ""political corruption"" in particular. In these fields, Japanese papers have a slight 0.2% share. Japan should invest human resources, goods, money, and information into the topics that are growing in this research field. We believe excellent researches will make policies more effective, increase the benefits through business, and contribute to the development of the Japanese and global economies.",Kuroda T.; Sakata I.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,The University of Tokyo,Academic landscape ;  Citation network analysis ;  Entrepreneur ;  Start-up ;  Venture
A case of sustainable innovation applied to textile industry,"In Italy a great amount of rustic wool is now discarded every year, with high environmental costs, or exported at very low price, because it constitutes a waste of the systems of ovine production of meat or milk. This wool is not of enough good quality for the traditional textile industry and for this reason is considered a waste which often is burned for avoiding its disposal cost, with further damages for the environment. In the last years some innovative enterprises and projects are trying to transform it from waste to sustainable resource, using it for the creation of high intrinsic value clothes, because sustainable for the environment and for the economic system. This paper present a case of sustainable innovation applied to textile industry and discusses structure and activity of a supply chain which is still under construction, where the organizational and managerial analysis (i.e. vertical integration, externalization) becomes very relevant and the costs are still high and extremely variable. The paper analyses in particular the results of an Italian National project born with the aim of experimenting the use of local rustic wools for creation of clothing, implementing a short chain sustainable productive process where starting from handcrafted knowhow, innovation should improve its social and environmental impact. The empirical analysis was based on interviews with operators and enterprises, focus-groups with operators and consumers and a questionnaire directed to different target of consumers. After a mapping of operators and firms involved in this new production chain (about 100 subjects along all the chain from sheep-breeding to clothes production), the paper analyses and discusses in particular two aspects: a) how concept of social and economic sustainability is declined, in terms of innovation and in relation to entire supply chain of textile; b) possible target market. The analysis of the new production chain shows the positive effects of network cooperation among small textile operators - still active throughout Italy despite growing production delocalization - in order to create an end product which combines local traditions and technological innovation. The early analysis of consumers reveals that the products manufactured through the experimental chain still have few sustainability attributes, insufficient to stimulate the purchase of a very different type of product, in terms of quality, from those usually found on the market. In particular, the short production chain and origin of the raw materials are the attributes which cause consumers to appreciate the project, but these attributes alone are not enough to make them truly like the end products.",Cariola M.; Moiso V.; Pagliarino E.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Consumer ;  Innovation ;  Rustic wool ;  Supply chain ;  Sustainability ;  Textile industry
Intellectual property co-ownership and commercialization in public-private partnerships in South Africa,"Prior to the promulgation of the Intellectual Property Rights from Publicly-Financed Research and Development Act (IPR Act) in August 2010, the publicly-funded research and development (R&D) organizations such as universities and science councils in South Africa dealt with issues of intellectual property ownership (IP) in whatever manner they deemed fit, as they had unfettered discretion to negotiate and/or agree on any terms of IP ownership with third parties such as private companies. The IPR Act has however brought about a new dispensation underpinned by specific provisions which dictate circumstances that must prevail for IP to be owned by the publicly-funded R&D organization, co-owned by the publicly-funded R&D organization and a private company, and where ownership of IP may be negotiable between the publicly-financed R&D organization and a private organisation. Several scholars and legal practitioners have criticized the legal effect of the IPR Act alleging that it might stifle innovation and make the R&D focused public-private partnerships unworkable, as it meant that ownership of IP generated from publicly-funded R&D can no longer arbitrarily vest in third parties as it was previously possible before the IPR Act became law. While it might appear premature to confirm or deny this allegation given that the IPR Act has been effective for only a period of four years and a few months, this paper discusses a practical case study of a public-private partnership involving a publicly-funded science council and a private company as a way of demonstrating that mutually-beneficial public-private partnerships are possible even under the IPR Act.",Hobololo V.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,"University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg",Intellectual property ;  Ownership ;  Public-private partnerships ;  Research and development
Developing a technology readiness assessment methodology for an energy company,"Petrobras, a Brazilian energy company, funds many universities and R&D institutions and performs internal R&D projects with high level of innovation. It is a challenge to effectively manage an R&D portfolio that has more than 800 projects, at different maturity levels, so a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) methodology is an important tool to support technology management. The Chemical Industry Information System (SIQUIM), a group actively involved in technology and innovation management from the Chemical School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, was invited to develop methodology with Petrobras. A task force was created to reach this goal, taking into consideration, as a reference, the TRA guide G 413.3-4A by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE). It was decided to keep the same concepts, process model and technology readiness levels of this original methodology, in order to preserve comparability. Petrobras selected four projects within its areas of knowledge, at distinct readiness levels, taking into account the different business cultures within areas, to be used as pilot projects for the development of the Petrobras TRA methodology, in a one-year timeframe, and considering the original DoE methodology as background. The new managing tool to be created should be suitable, effective and easy to apply in the Energy and Oil & Gas environment, using the existent technical and business jargon of the company. A Peer Reviewer, TRA Team and its leader were nominated for each project. A survey about TRA methodologies and implementation experiences available in the specialized literature was conducted, as well as a visit to a company, which had already developed its own TRA managing system. The adaptation and fit of the methodology to the energy business environment was performed, and the four projects were evaluated using this new tool. The deliverable of the work was Petrobras' TRA Methodology, which encompasses two versions of the Technology Readiness Level Calculator spreadsheet: a full version for the most critical, strategic and resources demanding projects, and a simplified version for appraising the regular projects of this large project portfolio.",Leite L.; Mendes F.; Parreiras V.; Gomes F.; Wiezel J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Petrobras;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,Innovation management ;  Oil & gas companies ;  R&D management ;  Technology readiness assessment (TRA) ;  Technology readiness level
Towards a framework for evaluation of renewable energy storage projects: A study case of hydrogen and fuel cells in Denmark,"Renewable energy is characterized by its intermittency and a general dislocation between places of production and places of use. To overcome the intermittency, renewable energy storage (RES) is critical in the design of a future carbon-free society. More than 700 RES projects are in the pipeline worldwide, and market potentials are projected as immense. RES is complicated, and projects persistently fail to present operational scale of operations except for a few ""classical"" storage technologies: Variants of lead-acid batteries and pumped hydro-power reservoirs. Most RES projects are relying on governmental subsidies or high-risk venture capital. RES projects are along the energy agenda following an agenda of industrial development.

Barriers and strategies for innovations entering BOP markets,"Companies that bring a new product to the market or enter a new market with an existing product, come across a number of barriers that prevent large-scale diffusion. In order to circumvent or remove these barriers, they can adopt alternative strategies. This paper looks into these barriers and focuses on niche-strategies for innovative technological products aimed at ""Base of the Pyramid"" (BoP) markets. The paper builds on existing literature describing barriers and strategies for introducing innovative technological products in western markets. The information sources are fourfold: (1) literature study, where literature is combined from the fields of Strategic Niche Management, Innovation Management, Innovation Systems and BoP markets; (2) interviews with experts on BoP markets; (3) secondary case studies on barriers for technological products on BoP markets; (4) interviews with companies that sell technological innovative products on BoP markets. We look at three types of products: cookstoves, solar lanterns and water purification technology in Africa or Asia. Based on these information sources we come to a list of 17 barriers and 11 niche-strategies that are adapted to the specific context of innovative technological products in BoP markets. Some examples of barriers are a lack of after sales service, lack of consumer awareness, and a lack of distribution channels. The barriers are also ranked in terms of their relative importance. Some of these niche strategies, which are further explained in the paper are the lead user niche strategy, the educate niche strategy and the redesign niche strategy. In the conclusion and discussion section we discuss, among other things, the generalizability of the relative importance of the barriers and the selected niche-strategies for introducing innovative technological products in BoP markets and how the insights in this paper can be extended to become more dynamic.",Kamp L.; Ortt J.; Harahap B.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Delft University of Technology,Barriers ;  Base of the Pyramid ;  Strategies ;  Technological innovations
Innovation in emerging markets: Brazilian productive sectors practicing reverse innovation?,"This paper proposes an analysis of current research on development and innovation (RD&I) activities in several sectors of the Brazilian economy. The main sources for the analysis are data extracted from the Brazilian National Survey (Pintec 2011). Based on this data, the most innovative sectors in terms of products and services for the global market were identified and analyzed. The analysis focuses on ""reverse innovation"", a concept describing an innovation process applied by a number of multinational companies that develop innovative products and services in emerging countries and then export this technology and know-how back to developed countries. Our study presents different levels and kinds of innovation, including product and process innovations in domestic markets, organizational and marketing innovations within companies, and new products and processes designed for global markets. We discuss several variables, measuring their marginal contribution to each of the variables preceding the evolution of the explained variable in order to prioritize them. We then present a mapping of the positioning of the sectors in terms of their degree of innovation in the domestic market, and their applicability to global innovation. At this point they should be in a position to propose their domestic models to the global market. The results of this research will reflect the nature of the ""reverse technology"" applied in certain sectors of the Brazilian economy.",Stainsack C.; Forterre D.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Université Paris-Dauphine;Business Administration Department,Brazil ;  Globalization ;  Industrial sectors ;  Research and development ;  Reverse innovation
Socioeconomic development through ICT use in Brazilian Enterprises: An analysis of labor force contribution,"This paper explores the relationship between Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and socioeconomic development from a business management perspective. ICTs undoubtedly influence the development of countries, especially those known as developing countries. Enterprises could be one of the main drivers of this shift as they create employment and produce direct income, and can indirectly improve education and quality of life. Business activities, however, have been affected in recent years by the rise of ICTs, in particular the Internet, which enable not only new ways of communicating and interacting with the general public, but also of conducting business globally, from a new perspective and at previously unknown speeds. In this sense, this article seeks to analyze the experience of Brazilian enterprises in ICT usage to discuss their level of adoption and impact on the country's development. The study will focus on the presence of an IT department within these enterprises as a factor for facilitating the adoption and use of ICT. The analysis relies on the dataset produced by the ICT Enterprise Survey, conducted annually since 2005 by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (CGI.br) through the Brazilian Network Information Center (NIC.br). This nationwide survey has more than forty indicators for investigating ICT usage and dissemination by formally established Brazilian enterprises with 10 employees or more. A factor analysis will be conducted from a selection of some variables related to Internet usage for the purpose of identifying factors regarding web presence, social network presence, e-commerce, basic activities, and infrastructure. Subsequently, a test of association will be made between these variables and the 'presence of an IT department' and 'hiring of IT experts' in order to investigate the impact of skilled labor on the level of ICT adoption. Should any dependence be identified among the variables, a logistic regression model will be used to estimate the relationship between the conditional variables. Preliminary studies have shown that an IT department in enterprises can in some way affect technology infrastructure, but there is little relationship with activities carried out on the Internet. Due to the importance given to ICT and their contribution to the development and the role of enterprises to help achieve this goal, it is important to discuss the keys aspects and obstacles to ICT adoption which includes issues related to specialized labor and entrepreneurial initiatives.",Mesquita L.; Alves S.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Fundacao Getulio Vargas;Lavras University,Development ;  Enterprises ;  ICT ;  Innovation ;  Internet usage ;  Specialized labor force
Challenges in open innovation for ICT companies in technology development zones,"Open innovation that is known as the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge with a view for accelerating firms' own internal innovation, and expanding the markets through external use of innovation, respectively is a very important window of opportunity for companies that are obliged to improve their innovativeness continuously due to intense competition environment. On the other hand, technology development zones are the platforms that act as an intermediary between the technology developer and technology diffuser to create value through transferring inventions and know-how from the university and research institution labs to the markets. These zones enable technology start-ups innovate and survive. Referring to their collaborative and networking nature, technology development zones have the potential to be connectors for open innovation across the universities, research Labs, start-ups, SMEs and large companies. However, to create and protect their technological know-how against larger and more competitive firms, start-up companies and SMEs in university based technology development zones may have the intention to keep their innovation systems closed and prefer to stay within the clusters of their collaboration network. This orientation to closed approaches prevents them from using technology development zones' eco-system and knowledge-sharing with similar companies as a leverage for growth. In this context, to address the obstacles and resources of open innovation for start-up companies and SMEs in technology development zones, this study aims to explore the perceptions of companies in technology development zones on open innovation. By conducting a survey among 98 information communication technology developer companies in major university technology development zones in Turkey, current open innovation practices and factors that act as obstacles for open innovation for these companies are searched. Types, scales, structures, shareholder types and experience of companies are also explored for their impacts on the orientation towards open innovation. Findings reveal that the IT companies in university based technology development zones do not utilize open innovation sufficiently, but they have intended to. Main constraints of companies in adapting open innovation practices are concluded as the lack of resources, while idea management and customer demand do not constitute critical constraints. However, they view import of technologies by inbound open innovation as a barrier. Customer immersion, lead users, collaboration and partly innovation intermediaries, innovation networks and platforming are among commonly practiced tools. However, because some of them strictly reject idea competitions, IP in-licensing and tech-out licensing, it is concluded that the IT companies in technology development zones are in need of improving their a practical understanding about open innovation.",Yildirim N.; Şimşek K.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi,Information technology ;  Open innovation ;  SME ;  Start-up ;  Technology development zone
The business model innovation map a framework for analyzing business model innovation,"Business model innovation has received substantial attention by both practitioners and researchers during the last fifteen years. While many companies have good processes and a shared sense of how to innovate technology, they are less capable when it comes to how they should innovate business models. This lack of practical skills is mirrored by the shortage of scholarly understanding, in which business model innovation as a phenomenon is poorly explained in comparison to e.g. product or process innovations. Although previous research has contributed greatly to the advancements of business model innovation, our conceptual understanding of business model innovation is still rather confused. Behind this study, lies two related assumptions; (i) not all business model innovations are the same, and, (ii) different types of business model innovation will challenge firms in different ways. To this background, the purpose of this study is to develop a framework that will allow for a conceptual differentiation between different types of business model innovation. The paper draws on previous studies in the field of technology and innovation management and develops a framework - ""The Business Model Innovation Map"" - that distinguishes between different types of business model innovation according to their degree of novelty. The framework is illustrated by several real-life examples of business model innovation. The paper adds to our understanding of innovation management as it allows for a better understanding of business model innovation as a distinct type of innovation. More specifically, it helps differentiating transformative business model innovations from mere incremental ones, and, as such, it presents a novel approach to categorize different types of business model innovation. The framework can serve as a basis for future in-depth empirical investigations of different types of business model innovation that can help firms to better understand how to manage such innovations.",Florén H.; Agostini A.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Högskolan i Halmstad;Einsights Pte.

Solving agricultural challenges in Japan through Scenario-based Amorphous Design approach,"This paper describes the process and result of a student team solving societal issues in Japan using systems-oriented design approach, namely Scenario-based Amorphous Design. Scenario-based Amorphous Design is a systems design methodology that follows the Vee model of systems engineering with emphasis on requirements collection and generation. Using systems design thinking, the team attacked multiple societal issues in Japan-agricultural dependence on food import, aging farming population and increasing unemployment rate. As a solution, they proposed retrofitting closed-down school buildings in megalopolis with hydroponic system and operating the facilities by employing younger population. As verification, the student team was awarded with funds by winning 1st place in Entrepreneur Grand Prix and 2nd prize from 6th Campus Venture Grand Prix to establish a start-up company.",Yagita H.; Shirasaka S.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Keio University,Agriculture ;  Design thinking ;  Innovation ;  Scenario-based Amorphous Design ;  System design ;  Systems thinking
Innovative performance and capabilities of interacting firms,"The subject of this paper is the relationship between innovative performance and capabilities of firms that, in the search for external knowledge to innovate, interact with scientific and research institutions. The innovation capability is understanding as major capability formed by development, operation, management and transaction capability (ZAWISLAK et al., 2012, 2013). Considering this, the aim of this paper is to understand the behavior of innovation capabilities and performance of firms that interact and the ones that do not interact with scientific and research institutions. For this, it was used data from a project survey (""Paths of Innovation in Brazilian Industry"") that aimed at deepening the understanding of Brazilian industries' innovation dynamics. Data analysis for this study comprised 1,331 valid questionnaires. The interacting firms cluster, which encompasses firms that interact with scientific and research institutions, consists of 370 firms, and the non-interacting firms cluster, which has firms that do not interact, presents 949 firms. Results show that there are differences between innovation capabilities of firms that interact compared to those that do not interact with scientific and research institutions. Firms that establish interactions have more development, operations, management and transaction capabilities. Therefore, a significant difference between the two groups of firms relates with the development capability. This finding corroborates what had already been described in the literature, that the interaction is one of the mechanisms whereby firms can improve their development capability by developing new products and new technologies. Interacting firms also have higher innovative performance, measured by firm revenue, profit and market share growth. Thus, it is noted that interaction with scientific and research institutions does not only improve firms' development capability, but it also makes them obtain the innovative profit.",Zawislak P.; Schaeffer P.; Reichert F.; Ruffoni J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul;Unisinos University,Brazil ;  Firm innovative performance ;  Innovation capabilities ;  University-industry interaction
Management capability and innovation: What is the relationship?,"Management capability may be understood as the responsible for coordinating all other capabilities related activities - development, operations and transaction - and, mostly, for aligning them with the company's strategy. However, management capability lives a paradox between the need to establish operational routines in order to maintain control and, at the same time, deal with dynamic nature of technology and the market, in other words, to innovate. This paper aims to identify the relationship between management capability and innovation. An extensive survey has been conducted with 1331 Brazilian firms from different industrial sectors. Since management capability can be divided into two different models - family and professional -, we identified their characteristics to better understand the relationship between management capability and innovation within companies. The results indicate that professional companies have a more developed set of capabilities, which brings them better performance than to the family companies. However, management capability is not the key factor. While professional companies do not have their innovative performance influenced by interventions on their management activities, improvements on the management activities of family companies promote positive impacts on their performances. The present research sheds light on actions that can improve the innovative performance of the companies.",Pufal N.; Zawislak P.; Reichert F.; Alves A.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,Family management ;  Innovation ;  Innovative performance ;  Management capability ;  Professional management
Additive manufacturing or 3D printing and its adoption,"This study is on additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing. Additive manufacturing is different from traditional manufacturing processes that shape products through milling, grinding etc. Instead, with additive manufacturing, layers are added to a product. This allows for three dimensional manufacturing and limited scrap. Additive manufacturing has been viewed by many as a disruptive innovation for society because it allows consumers to manufacture their own products. In this paper, an overview will be presented on the status of additive manufacturing. This includes the consumer perspective as well as the manufacturing perspective. For example, the consumer perspective has intellectual property protection as an emerging issue. The current status of 3D printers will be provided together with an analysis of the main producers such as Makerbot and Ultimaker (consumer markets) and Stratasys and 3D Systems (industrial markets), their models and their current capabilities and overall adoption. It is concluded that additive manufacturing is experiencing high growth but that, in particular for industrial applications, it is not yet competitive with traditional manufacturing systems.",Steenhuis H.; Pretorius L.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Pretoria;Eastern Washington University,3D printing ;  Additive manufacturing ;  Innovation ;  Technology diffusion
Assessment of innovation-activities of smes in Niger-Delta Nigeria,"Innovation performances are crucial determinant of competitiveness, national progress and sustainable development (OECD 2007). Recent studies have shown that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have the potential to greatly contribute to the innovation systems by introducing new products/services and adapting existing products to the need of customers. Very often though, SMEs in many developing economies try first and foremost to go for market shares and financial profits for survival and growth. However, the question remains whether SMEs consciously pay attention or pursue innovation as a long term strategy for profitability and sustainable growth. This paper tends to examine the state of art of innovation activities of SMEs in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria. The objective is to ascertain how innovative or non - innovative the SMEs are in the region. It examines the types of innovation activities conducted in the SMEs, identifies the factors that influence innovation and determine the linkage between innovation activities and the SMEs performances and sustainable growth. The methodology of the study involved use of structured questionnaires to gather data on innovation activities of some SMEs in different sectors within the region as well as empirical observations through an in depth case study of a typical high growth SME (Pepperoni Foods, Nigeria). Responses gathered and observations recorded were analyzed using statistical tools to interpret and deduce inferences from the study. Although there are other factors responsible for SMEs growth and profitability, our research findings show a strong linkage between innovation activities and sustainable growth of SMEs within the region. We also find out that most innovation activities are carried out in an informal way without proper linkage and support from the National innovation system. Given the importance of SMEs to development of the economy, we would recommend a more robust and structured intervention program to encourage and stimulate innovation in SMEs in Nigeria.",Otejere A.; Joe A.; Okorhi O.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Port Harcourt;University of Pretoria,Assessment ;  Innovation activities ;  SMEs and Sustainable growth
"Shared innovation system between industry, University and government","This paper describes the case study of GRAÑA & MONTERO as the promoter of a Shared Innovation System that aims to develop a culture of innovation in the community. Within this system, different institutions (academic community, government organizations and industry associations) interact and members of the engineering community (students, university teachers, principals, researchers and professionals) are involved. GRAÑA & MONTERO is a group of Peruvian companies dedicated to providing engineering services in Latin America. GRAÑA & MONTERO has four business segments: (i) Engineering & Construction; (ii) Infrastructure; (iii) Real State; and (iv) Technical Services. This case is based on the theory of the triple helix as a reference model to achieve proper interaction between university, industry, and government. Its specific objectives are: (a) describe the existing (internal and external) context for creating the system; (b) describe the components and programs covered by the system; (c) present the map of stakeholders and the different forms of participation in system programs; and finally (d) share the main findings and lessons learned. The system developed by GRAÑA & MONTERO has enabled them to share the key elements of the organizational culture of the company with the community, and also has enabled them to develop a network of cooperation that facilitates the generation of capabilities for innovation inside the company.",Ortiz J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,GRAÑA & MONTERO ;  Shared innovation ;  System of innovation ;  Triple Helix
Open innovation for automobile component manufacturing SMEs in Nigeria,"Some SMEs were involved in automobile component production in Nigeria but after the introduction of the Economic Structural Adjustment Programme of 1986, most of these firms (even those in the industrial cluster) could not match the steady increase in technological innovations, competitions in automobile sector and the constraints of the local business environment. This paper is proposing a model that will ensure the continuous participation of Nigerian automobile component manufacturing SMEs in the local and global automobile value chain. This paper draws on literature survey coupled with semi-structured interview with managers in automobile assemble firms that work with some local automobile component part supply firms in Nigeria Findings show progress made by SMEs in different sector through the process of Open innovation (OI), however there is still a divide on the use of open innovation in the automotive sector. One of the subsidiaries of a European multinational automobile companies surveyed in this study stated several local suppliers who could not fit in its supply chain when it introduced car models that were on different technology platforms. The fast integration & development of Mechatronics and material science in the automobile industry was disruptive for the Nigerian firms, even though some of these firms attempted to source for technology abroad to stay in business. There are question marks on the business strategies, absorptive capacities of these firms and also on the national support infrastructure. The model being proposed is suitable one for SMEs in the automobile component manufacturing in Nigeria. This paper concludes by stating that networking of SMEs into the global value chain remains an open innovation approach for SMEs in Nigeria and as a good learning mechanism, considering the structure of the innovation system found in most developing countries.",Emmanuel E.; Joe A.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Port Harcourt,Automobile ;  Automobile component manufacturing ;  Learning ;  Nigeria ;  Open innovation ;  SMEs
Conception of a knowledge management system for technologies,"For strategic product and technology planning of intelligent technical systems a holistic process and tool is needed to support a company in the innovation process. An important aspect within the innovation process, is technology planning. The Heinz Nixdorf Institute developed a technology planning concept, which is supported by an Innovation-Database. The Innovation-Database synchronizes aspects from the market pull and the technology push. Furthermore, it is used as a knowledge management system for innovations and technologies. The challenge is filling the technology pool with a minimum set of technologies in order to use the whole functionality of the Innovation-Database. Many resources are needed in order to fill the technology pool or to update it. There is in increase in information in the World Wide Web and most of the information is fuzzy. Our approach is to identify them automatically by using crawler technologies. Therefore a software tool was developed, which automatically crawls for technologies in the database of the European Patent Office and in the journal database IEEE Xplore. In these data sources, the tool identifies technologies automatically in natural texts, prepares the data and visualize them. It is not suitable to scan a text for a defined set of technologies in a dictionary, because then the tool is not able to find new technologies or to detect weak signals. In this paper, the architecture and features of the software tool is described. It uses text mining methods to detect technologies in unstructured, fuzzy data. As input data, the user has to provide a search field, which the search is performed for. Furthermore, the data sources have to be defined. The tool crawls these data sources in order to identify technologies, which can be relevant for a given search field. The tool suggests newly identified technologies for the search field, which are generally relevant. The user has to decide whether those technologies are important for him. This information is used as feedback for the text-mining model to improve the precision of future analyses. In order to support the user, a suggested technology is automatically provided with further information, like a description and an estimation of technological maturity. With this information a user can start an evaluation of the technology. For every technology a datasheet is created with detail information. It can easily be customized for specific demands. All technologies can be visualized on a radar. The radar shows all technologies for a search field according to its relevance. These information is used for strategic product and technology planning.",Placzek M.; Eberling C.; Gausemeier J.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Paderborn University,Big data ;  Knowledge management ;  Technology intelligence ;  Technology planning ;  Text mining
The eco-innovation concepts through a strategic perspective,"The eco-innovation has been playing a major role in the adaptation of organizations to climate changes. In this regard, several studies have been proposed in connection with the concepts and types of eco-innovation, as well as the effectiveness of environment management practices within companies. Although it is relatively simple to identify the concepts of eco-innovation which have achieved success, the analysis of the structure and content of potential eco-innovations has been a challenge - mainly regarding products development, which is more often associated with greater competitive advantage. With a focus on eco-efficiency, the eco-innovation presented in results of empirical studies seems to be far from the types of innovation that have the potential to achieve sustainable development. Despite of being broadly defined in a number of taxonomies and typologies, some conceptualizations of eco-innovation differ on the strategic nature that is directed towards environmental issues. Similarly, the approach of companies to the environmental dimension is not homogeneous, indicating different levels of practice, which can vary from mere compliance with applicable regulation, to the environmental pro-activity, which transforms environmental issues into business opportunities. These levels of practice are distinguished mainly by the articulation between environmental objectives and business strategy. This study aims to develop a theoretical framework through the analysis of taxonomies and typologies of eco-innovation comprising the definition of the term, the innovative potential and the patterns of corporate environment management. The research proposes a debate about the relevance of the environmental issues strategic nature in the concept of eco-innovation, in order to relate the strategic bias to its innovative potential - in terms of degree of novelty. Through the conceptual-theoretical research method, it could be verified that the inclusion of environmental issues as a guide to the development of an innovation, i.e. as part of the company strategic planning, brings greater possibilities for real sustainable potential. It was possible to confirm the importance of a strategic bias, in addition to the eco-efficiency, in the classification of eco-innovations. The proposed debate is extremely valuable to enrich the relevant field of knowledge and to stimulate changes in environmental perception and positioning within a organizational context.",Xavier A.; Naveiro R.; Aoussat A.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,LCPI Laboratoire de Conception de Produits et Innovation;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,Business strategy ;  Eco-innovation ;  Environmental management ;  Innovative potential
Web-based information system for innovation management in a brazilian electrical company,"In recent years, there has been growing government pressure for increased R&D investments in the Brazilian electrical power industry. The resulting surge in innovation activity, in this sector, however, was not accompanied by improved innovation management capabilities by Brazilian power companies. Usually, firms in this industry are characterized by informal and ad hoc innovation processes and a general lack of unified approaches to innovation management. In order to cope with these issues, some firms have developed web-based information systems to facilitate and organize idea generation, evaluation, prioritization, and implementation as innovation projects. This paper reports the development of such a system, a web-based corporate-level information system for innovation management at the Compania Estadual de Distribuição de Energia Elétrica (CEEE-D), an electrical power company situated in Southern Brazil. The system uses the organization's Intranet and is based upon a revised and improved innovation process map. The paper describes the inner workings of this system, focusing particularly in the transitions between innovation ideas, proposals, and projects, and the evaluation mechanisms.",Ribeiro J.; Cortimiglia M.; Pretto C.; Werberich B.; Correa C.; De Moura Ferreira Danilevicz Â.,Conference Proceeding,"IAMOT 2015 - 24th International Association for Management of Technology Conference: Technology, Innovation and Management for Sustainable Growth, Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul;Companhia Estadual de Distribuição de Energia Elétrica - CEEE-D,Electrical power industry ;  Innovation management ;  Innovation process ;  Web-based information system
Developing innovation in higher education: The catalytic effect of conference attendance,"Educational innovation through conference attendance is the main theme of this paper. It starts by describing and contrasting product and education innovation, highlighting the importance of the step of influencing and determining the future direction of the market or community of practice. It goes on to describe the important learning processes associated with copying, affirming its importance in the way that educational innovations spread and develop. The paper includes several personal examples where ideas have been copied and developed following E&PDE papers. The paper poses a further question regarding the place that subconscious innovation takes place, treating it as a topic for further research.",Dowlen C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Great Expectations: Design Teaching, Research and Enterprise, E and PDE 2015",2015-01-01,London South Bank University,Conference attendance ;  Copying ;  Educational innovation ;  Product innovation
Raising our game: Creating new learning experiences with research collaborations,"Within the University sector, there has been concern expressed in recent years over the accreditation of alternative higher education providers to deliver degree programs. This presupposes that the two sectors would be in direct competition for the same students with providers offering similar programs and content, and catering to students with similar learning styles for comparable outcomes. Arguably, if a University is failing to provide a learning experience that is significantly more elevated and substantially different to one that is offered by an alternative higher education provider, then it should be re-evaluating its own practice rather than trying to eliminate the opposition. Product Design programs have undergone a contracted evolution since their academic inception following the Industrial Revolution. Therefore, they are arguably best placed to lead an evolution of University education as they are less hampered by the weight of historical expectation than traditional academic disciplines. This paper is a reflective opinion piece that proposes new practice to provide innovative, high order thinking learning experiences inspired by cutting edge collaborative practice between international University research partners. This partnership is based on an aspiration model of authentic collaboration between product design and engineering, in a health and wellbeing context. It suggests a way forward that clearly differentiates and enhances University Product Design education for a next generation research design education nexus.",Loy J.; Reay S.; White D.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Great Expectations: Design Teaching, Research and Enterprise, E and PDE 2015",2015-01-01,Griffith University;Auckland University of Technology,Collaboration ;  ELearning ;  Innovation ;  Transdisciplinary ;  Transformative
On the appropriateness of appropriate judgements in design evaluation,"This paper discusses issues related to the knowledge universities can disseminate to commercial organizations in enterprise-driven ventures. It focuses on the area of automotive design. This industry is challenged with designing small, yet desirable and beautiful vehicles. In response, we present the findings of an empirical study which aimed to evaluate if, and to what extent, previously identified automotive design principles were related to vehicle aesthetics. Automotive design experts were asked to rate a set of vehicles. Research suggests that such ""appropriate judges"" - as defined by shared knowledge and experience - should have a considerable degree of consensus of opinion with regards to aesthetics. However, this study demonstrated that between experts, large differences existed with regards to their aesthetic appraisal and underlying design principles. These findings are at odds with the suggestion that experts should be able to reach a high level of consensus provided the ""judges"" share a common education and experience in the relevant domain. This paper puts forward possible explanations for these findings: (1) a lack of agreement in terms of the meaning of commonly used descriptive terms in automotive design; (2) existing descriptive principles may not fully account for differences in appreciation of automotive aesthetics; (3) philosophical issues related to 'essentialising' terminology which characterizes human experience. We conclude by suggesting that through conducting design research, academics may be able to challenge preconceived notions in design. This ability may in turn fuel design innovation and thus may be very valuable in enterprise ventures between universities and commercial organizations.",Diels C.; Ghassan A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Great Expectations: Design Teaching, Research and Enterprise, E and PDE 2015",2015-01-01,Coventry University,Aesthetics ;  Automotive design ;  Enterprise-driven research ;  Expertise ;  User experience
Improvement of modelling of LNG pool fires on water,"The aim of this study is to improve the validation of the models simulating LNG pool fires on water within the EVOLCODE 3.1 software developed by GDF SUEZ's Centre for Research and Innovation (CRIGEN), which is dedicated to the gas sector and new energy sources. This work relies on a detailed analysis of the validity of EVOLCODE 3.1 for this type of phenomenon. This analysis is based on experimental data currently available in scientific literature and, in particular, on tests recently carried out by the Sandia National Laboratory. EVOLCODE 3.1 is also compared to the 3D KFX software developed by ComputIT in an attempt to understand in detail the phenomena involved in these types of fires.",Osman K.; Belkaid S.; Herchin N.; Blanchetiere V.,Conference Proceeding,Institution of Chemical Engineers Symposium Series,2015-01-01,"Engie, France",
"Printed electronics, product design and the education of future industrial designers?","The knowledge transfer of printed electronics technology to the designers of products has the potential to make a significant impact. There is a perceived lack of exposure to this emerging technology among industrial designers. It is desirable for student designers to be made aware of the opportunities such technology affords in order to enhance the design of future products. It offers a diverse range of new flexible form factors, no longer constrained by a rigid circuit board. In order to understand this disruptive emerging technology, a knowledge framework is required to support the education of student designers. This paper focuses on three essential areas of knowledge for a framework: approaches to technology readiness; techniques used for printed electronics, and a taxonomy of printed electronics. This combined information with design examples and a technology readiness grading would provide a basis for the development of understanding printed electronics. This paper concludes that a knowledge framework of printed electronics can be achieved. The translation of other fields into a taxonomy then utilised for educational innovations has previously proved successful within the context of Industrial Designers and Engineering Designers understanding the respective language of their disciplines. The overall goal of this research is to create a printed electronics taxonomy that can be used to educate student designers and enhance future product design outcomes.",Nicola Y.; Southee D.; Mark E.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Great Expectations: Design Teaching, Research and Enterprise, E and PDE 2015",2015-01-01,Loughborough University,Industrial designers ;  Printed electronics ;  Product design
Conditions for the promotion and development of creative industries within higher education institutions,"Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) play an important role on the promotion and development of creative industries (e.g. product design companies). These roles, however, are not clearly defined. Previous studies by the authors, conducted in Colombia, encountered several critical internal factors as well as environmental relationships proper of the ecosystem of business that affect performance in creative industries. HEIs can promote specific activities to become agents that enhance the development of these creative industries, thus contributing to overcome environmental and critical internal factors. This paper presents a model that can serve as a starting point within HEIs to establish policies towards this goal. For such purpose, the present research extended the aforementioned studies to Argentina and the United States, countries recognized worldwide for the development of ""creative industries"" or ""creative economy"". Fieldwork was performed in nine cities: two in Colombia, two in Argentina and five in the United States. Data was collected via interviews and focus group studies conducted at universities and creative industries, as well as with experts, government representatives and support organisations. A PESTEL analysis was used to identify weaknesses that could become opportunities for action within HEIs. The results allow for the establishment of nine key roles of the HEIs (i.e. education, moderator of the ecosystem, research, foster discussion, investment, on-going support, dynamism, joker, and simulation/real environment) that can be related to these institutions' substantive functions (i.e. teaching, research, extension, and support and integration), which contribute to enhance the development of creative industries, their growth and long-term sustainability.",Hernandez M.; Podesta M.; Bedoya B.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Great Expectations: Design Teaching, Research and Enterprise, E and PDE 2015",2015-01-01,Universidad EAFIT,Creative economy ;  Creative industries ;  PESTEL ;  Role of higher education institutions
A research based on signage design experiment to test users' engagement,"This research was based on the signage system design experiment in College of Design & Innovation (D&I), Tongji University. The new building of D&I undertaking a multi-functional complex for students and staffs was built and put into use in 2014, which appearing to be fertile for promoting communication, collective activities, fostering design thinking and triggering interaction between users and the environment. As part of the design for the new building, our team designed the signage system, looking at how to encourage users' interaction and engagement in the co design process. With the theoretical research, we choose the following methods to testify the users' interactive behaviour and feedback: VERBAL COMMUNICATION, ENVIRONMANTAL VISUAL STIMULUS and PEER EDUCATION. This paper examines how those methods could improve in the users' engagement within the scope of a three-month prototype research. After the prototype and research process, relevant and informative statistics have been collected and analyzed. The findings so far have led us to conclude that properly and purposed stimulus and the sequence of stimulus phases can lead to a more dynamic, effective, and innovative user engagement in co-design process. Further more, the methods can make big difference according to difference users. Appropriate methods for specific users could lead to effective results.",Wu D.; Xu R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Great Expectations: Design Teaching, Research and Enterprise, E and PDE 2015",2015-01-01,Tongji University,Interaction ;  Participatory design ;  User's engagement
Old hopes through new schemes: A path towards innovation,"This paper seeks to provide a method of developing innovative thoughts, theories and ways of doing by unearthing and reconsidering theories proposed as a reaction to the circumstances created by the Industrial Revolution. These theories might not have had the desired impact at that time, but this study offers the option of looking at them through the eyes of the present and merging them with new conceptions and ideologies. In this way, it is possible to generate innovative and practical ways of solving problems that emerged more than a hundred years ago and with which we still struggle. The central purpose of this paper is to prove how innovation can also be found in past studies and thoughts if they are applied in different ways, with new tools and in a contemporary context. Once all these has been stated the main aim or research question of this work is formulated as following: How to provide a way to generate innovative and relevant ways of product development that might generate higher ethical standards within product and industrial design theory, based on hypotheses and propositions formulated in reaction to the Industrial Revolution.",Caro Del Castillo A.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Great Expectations: Design Teaching, Research and Enterprise, E and PDE 2015",2015-01-01,OsloMet – StorbyUniversitetet,Design processes ;  Ethics ;  Industrial arts ;  Innovation ;  Theories
Visualising workplace design,"Design is a learning process and the use of prototyping activities for the sake of learning increases the design thinking, i.e. the dialogue and feedback on ideas. Hence, representations ranging from sketches to different kind of models and animations are recommended to be used as prototypes to mediate user needs and to support communication within the team. Low-fidelity prototyping enables rapid visualisation of ideas, reframes failures into learning, generates perceptual progress and supports creativity. In product design, different visualisation techniques are used to generate and communicate ideas since thinking visually is seen as necessary for innovation. This paper describes the work of developing a course where you combine the task of workplace design with traditional industrial design visualisation methods like sketching, model making and 3D computer aids. By using the knowledge and experience from product design and incorporate it into workplace design, a process where all parties contribute in new ways could be achieved. In the course the students start by performing an individual investigation of the present research front for production visualisation by summarizing and analysing a number of scientific articles. A work place design project was then performed where exploratory, explanatory and persuasive visualizing techniques were implemented. Through a creative and constructive collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, Industrial Production Environment and Industrial Design, we have created and implemented a course in an area that has been lacking in our Master Program.",Håkansson A.; Stenberg M.; Öhrling J.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Great Expectations: Design Teaching, Research and Enterprise, E and PDE 2015",2015-01-01,Luleå University of Technology,Communication ;  Layout ;  Participation ;  Visualization ;  Workplace design

Engineering education in the Middle East and North Africa: An industry perspective,"The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is poised to undergo tremendous industrial development on the way to diversify its economy and become less dependent on oil and gas revenues. Industrial development has always been linked to the ingenuity and innovation of engineering minds. In this chapter, we examine engineering education in the MENA region from the perspective of a large industrial organization that has been depending on engineers, training them and developing them for more than 30 years. The critical engineering skills required by industry are discussed and the role of engineering education in helping industry succeed is emphasized. Close collaboration between industry and engineering schools is very important in order to ensure that students are well prepared to join the workforce and contribute to solving industry’s and society’s problems. This collaboration should focus not only on technical abilities but also on developing soft skills. Critical thinking and problem solving stand out as leading skills that are highly required for engineering graduates to succeed in industry.

"Leveraging pedagogical innovations for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the Middle East context","Background and Purpose Over the past 20 years, educational research across all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines has revealed traits common to many of the most successful pedagogical innovations; those that feature learning contexts that enable rich peer interactions and learning tasks that present students with real-world, ill-posed problems produce the most substantial learning gains in their students. Further refinements to pedagogies in the West increasingly come from research into related “affective factors”: motivations, expectations, and self-efficacy. This state of affairs raises important questions for the developing world. Mainly, how will pedagogical innovations and educational reforms, designed for Western cultures, function when implemented in a novel context, particularly in the Middle East? Design/Method/Approach This chapter closely examines the case of Khalifa University (KU) in Abu Dhabi and three course reform projects designed to introduce such pedagogical innovations to its largely Gulf Arab student body. These three are: (1) the Engineering Problem Solving Course offered by the Departments of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, (2) the University Physics I course offered by the Department of Applied Mathematics and Sciences, and the (3) Introduction to Biomedical Engineering offered by the Biomedical Engineering Department. All three were implemented in experimental formats, making significant to exclusive use of project-based learning, collaborative learning, and problem-based learning, respectively. Although the general core of the pedagogies used in course reform was mainly adopted from well-established Western educational models, the instructional strategies including the open-ended, ill-structured problems were specifically designed to “custom-fit” the KU and the UAE culture. Results/Anticipations In the case of KU, we find that problem-based, project-based, and collaborative learning modalities can be implemented with minimal modification to their core features. Our research results show that learning gains or favorable attitudinal gains in the three pilot courses studied are all improved relative to the traditional, lecture-centered version of the same courses and with the same student body. While there is still a gap between these and similar Western counterpart courses, there is evidence that the differences are likely due to pre-instruction factors, particularly second-language issues, and not to the effect of the particular pedagogy or implemented instructional strategies. Conclusions This result is not a “recipe-for-success” in similar institutions in the Gulf or broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Every institution has its own idiosyncrasies, which must be anticipated by educational innovators on the ground, but anticipation of such factors and adaptation to them is possible. Rather, we provide a proof of principle that contributes significantly to dispelling the beliefs that alternatives to traditional, lecture-based instruction are impossible to implement in particular cultures or that they could never be fruitful for student learning in the Gulf Arab context.",Balawi S.; Khalaf K.; Wesley Hitt G.,Book,"Advances in Engineering Education in the Middle East and North Africa: Current Status, and Future Insights",2015-01-01,Khalifa University of Science and Technology,Collaborative learning ;  Engineering education ;  Pedagogy ;  Problem-based ;  Project-based ;  STEM

"Decrease of morbidity in road traffic accidents in a high income country - An analysis of 24,405 accidents in a 21 year period","Background The WHO initiated the ""Decade of Action for Road Safety"" because the fatality on road traffic accidents could become the fifth leading cause of death in 2030. On the contrary, fatalities continue to decrease in high income countries. The aim of the study was to find evidence for changes in injury severity of passenger car occupants after road traffic accidents in Germany over time, and to find contributing factors. Methods Data from the German In Depth Accident Study (GIDAS), representative for Germany, was used. A total of 24.405 accidents, reported from 1991 until 2011. 44.503 adult passenger car occupants were examined. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to find reasons for observed trends over time. Results The relative decrease in mortality was 68.8% from 1991 until 2011. Between 2006 and 2011, the percentage of severely injured traffic victims was less than half, both in terms of the whole body and individual body regions. For injuries with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ≥2, the percentage of persons with lower leg injuries declined by 72.5%, followed by the percentage of persons with pelvic injuries (61.5%), upper extremity injuries (57.7%), head injuries (54.3%), thorax injuries (50.0%), and abdomen injuries (40.0%). The multivariable regression model found 13 independent variables associated with injury prevention (e.g. seat belt use: OR 0.41, CI 95% 0.32-0.49; airbag: OR 0.86, CI 95% 0.75-0.99). The implementation of protective factors increased over time while accident constellations with a high probability for severe injury decreased over time. Conclusion The decrease of severe injuries after road traffic accidents can be only attributed to a comprehensive approach including the enforcement of road safety policies and innovations in car engineering and emergency medicine. Traffic related measures and alcohol level control, and seat belt usage enforcement next to other technical advances are considered especially important.",Ernstberger A.; Joeris A.; Daigl M.; Kiss M.; Angerpointner K.; Nerlich M.; Schmucker U.,Journal,Injury,2015-01-01,AUDI AG;Klinikum der Universität Regensburg und Medizinische Fakultät;AO Clinical Investigation and Documentation,accident analysis ;  accident research ;  multiple trauma ;  passenger car accident ;  road traffic accident ;  seriously injured
Management of software engineering innovation in Japan,"This book assesses the achievements of the software engineering discipline as represented by IT vendors in Japan in order to deepen understanding of the mechanisms of how software engineering capabilities relate to IT vendors’ business performance and business environment from the perspective of innovation and engineering management. Based on the concepts of service science and science for society, the volume suggests how to improve the sophistication of services between the demand side, i.e., IT user companies, and the supply side, i.e., IT vendors, simultaneously. The author and his colleagues developed a structural model including innovational paths, such as service innovation, product innovation and process innovation, and a measurement model including the seven software engineering capabilities: Deliverables, project management, quality assurance, process improvement, research and development, human resource development and customer contact. Then they designed research on software engineering excellence and administered it with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Information-Technology Promotion Agency. Through statistical analyses of the results, they found that human resource development and R&D are significant fundamental conditions to improve the quality of the deliverables and that IT firms with high levels of deliverables, derived from high levels of human resource development, quality assurance, project management and process improvement, tend to sustain high profitability. In addition, they developed a measurement model based on Porter’s five forces and Barney’s resource-based view. A regression tree analysis suggested that manufacturer spin-off vendors tend to expand business with well-resourced R&D, whereas user spin-off vendors tend to depend heavily on parent company demand.",Kadono Y.,Book,Management of Software Engineering Innovation in Japan,2015-01-01,Ritsumeikan University Osaka Ibaraki Campus;Tokyo University of Foreign Studies,
Electronic systems for health management,"Several important societal and economic world problems can be addressed by the smart use of technology. The past 40 years have witnessed the realization of computational systems and networks, rooted in our ability to craft complex integrated circuits out of billions of electronic devices. Nowadays, the ability to master materials at the molecular level and their interaction with living matter opens up unforeseeable horizons. Networking biological sensors through body-area, ad hoc and standard communication networks boosts the intrinsic power of local measurements, and allows us to reach new standards in health management. The Swiss Nano-Tera program addresses applications of nanotechnologies to health management, and it has been instrumental in fostering research and innovation in this domain. The Nano-Tera program Nano-Tera addresses system engineering research that leverages micro-, nano-, information, and communication technologies. The broad objectives of the program are both to improve quality of life and security of people across different levels of education, wealth and age, and eventually to create innovative products, technologies and manufacturing methods, thus resulting in job and revenue creation. Although the principal application domains are health and environment, energy and security issues are also investigated as support areas. The intrinsic value of the underlying research is to bridge traditional disciplines, including electrical engineering, micro/nano-mechanical systems engineering, biomedical sciences, and computer/communication sciences, with the objectives of (i) deepening the understanding of enabling technologies, (ii) reducing scientific concepts to practice, and (iii) mastering the novel challenges of designing large-scale complex systems.",Micheli G.,Book,Handbook of Bioelectronics: Directly Interfacing Electronics and Biological Systems,2015-01-01,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,
How to cross the border from R to D? The example of conception of new medical devices,"The border between Research and Development for a new medical device is often unclear due to non-linear process of its development and frequent feedbacks from trials in clinical settings to a new conception of the product. Sometimes researchers under-estimate these translational studies since they do not lead to an increase of fundamental knowledge. However, and especially in the field of medical devices, users have to face specific difficulties due to the variability of the biological systems under study. Results obtained in translational research often depend on this variability and new questions or scientific obstacles arise from the confrontation to the real world. In order to address these new challenges, reverse translational research is required. Fundamental research is then fuelled by the results of translational research. A useful model of medical device development is presented here through several examples of translational research.",Pazart L.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2015-01-01,Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Besançon,Innovation ;  Medical device ;  R & D - clinical trials ;  Translational research

Prevention through Design Adoption Readiness Model (PtD ARM): An integrated conceptual model,"BACKGROUND: Prevention through Design (PtD), eliminating hazards at the design-stage of tools and systems, is the optimal method of mitigating occupational health and safety risks.Arecent National Institute of Safety and Health initiative has established a goal to increase adoption of PtD innovation in industry. The construction industry has traditionally lagged behind other sectors in the adoption of innovation, in general; and of safety and health prevention innovation, in particular. Therefore, as a first step toward improving adoption trends in this sector, a conceptual model was developed to describe the parameters and causal relationships that influence and predict construction stakeholder 'adoption readiness' for PtD technology innovation. METHODS: This model was built upon three well-established theoretical frameworks: the Health Belief Model, the Diffusion of Innovation Model, and the Technology Acceptance Model. Earp and Ennett's model development methodology was employed to build a depiction of the key constructs and directionality and magnitude of relationships among them. Key constructs were identified from the literature associated with the three theoretical frameworks, with special emphasis given to studies related to construction or OHS technology adoption. RESULTS: A conceptual model is presented. Recommendations for future research are described and include confirmatory structural equation modeling of model parameters and relationships, additional descriptive investigation of barriers to adoption in some trade sectors, and design and evaluation of an intervention strategy.",Weidman J.; Dickerson D.; Koebel C.,Journal,Work,2015-01-01,Virginia Tech College of Engineering;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Brigham Young University,Construction ;  Engineering controls ;  Prevention through Design (PtD) ;  Technology adoption
"A review of research and innovation in garment sizing, prototyping and fitting","Achieving well fitting garments matters to consumers and, therefore, to product development teams, garment manufacturers and fashion retailers when creating clothing that fits and functions both for individuals and for a retailer's target populations. New tools and software for body scanning and product development enhance the ways that sizing and fitting can be addressed; they provide improved methods for classifying and analysing the human body and new ways of garment prototyping through virtual product development. Recent technological developments place a growing demand on product development teams to reconsider their approach to prototyping, sizing and fitting. Significant, related changes are also being made in the fashion retail environment, including innovations in virtual fit to enable consumers to engage with fit online. For best effect in the short term, such advances need to relate well to existing manufacturing practices and to the methods that have, over many years, become embedded by practitioners into the processes involved in clothing product development and those used for establishing garment fit. The high rate of technological advance, however, places an urgent need on practitioners to change; established principles of pattern theory need to be recognised explicitly and followed consistently, otherwise, new techniques for developing and assessing products will not be able to be fully exploited. Practitioners will be pressed to adopt more data-rational approaches to product development, including adopting engineering principles into the practice of clothing product development. For example, comparisons made between the traditional two-dimensional garment pattern and the three-dimensional environment accessible through 3-D body scanning technology, provide both the stimulus and the data required to support a reexamination of how the measurements required for clothing product development should be defined. This should be coupled with a more explicit recognition of ease as a factor requiring quantification within clothing engineering. New methods of categorising the body in terms of its form also allow recognition of the restrictions of proportional theories in pattern construction; they afford promising opportunities for advancing the practices of sizing and fitting in clothing product development.",Gill S.,Trade Journal,Textile Progress,2015-01-01,The University of Manchester,3D body scanning ;  Anthropometrics ;  Augmented reality ;  Body shape ;  Clothing ease ;  Clothing fit ;  Clothing sizing ;  Human proportions ;  On-line fit technology ;  Online fashion retailing ;  Pattern construction ;  Product development ;  Virtual product interfaces ;  Virtual prototyping ;  Virtual try-on
Adaptive expertise and knowledge fluency in design and innovation,"Introduction. This chapter presents an overview of the adaptive expertise framework and describes how this framework holds promise for exploring knowledge fluency in the context of engineering design and innovation. Adaptive expertise is linked to research on knowledge transfer and the development of expertise. Each of these theoretical approaches explores how one recognizes when knowledge learned in one setting may apply in a novel setting, and the mechanisms for transfer of knowledge when challenged by an unfamiliar or ambiguous situation. The adaptive expertise framework is directly applicable in the context of design and innovation given the emphasis on how one develops adaptiveness in learning, and how to apply knowledge fluidly. The process of design and innovation involves developing a solution where one does not yet exist. From this perspective, every design situation is novel, embeds ambiguity, and has no one correct answer. The very nature of design requires one to recognize how prior knowledge might apply under new circumstances. Furthermore, research suggests that the nature of knowledge one employs in the process of design innovation is nuanced, complex, and spans the cognitive, metacognitve, and affective domains.",McKenna A.,Book,Cambridge Handbook of Engineering Education Research,2015-01-01,Arizona State University,
Curriculum design in the middle years,"Introduction. This chapter aims to call attention to the “middle years” of engineering study, which are often overlooked from a research perspective. There have been tremendous efforts over the past two decades focused on the first year and final year of engineering education. Although there have been efforts targeted at the middle years, which we summarize in this chapter, we argue that there is a need for more attention and research-driven innovations for these formative years for the emerging engineer. The second and third years of engineering study are times when students are focused on their specific engineering disciplines, beginning with the foundational engineering sciences and leading to discipline-specific core courses. Our goal is to highlight creative and successful efforts in these years. We hope this can inspire other instructors to use these examples as models for adaptation to their own disciplines and courses. We focus on several major engineering disciplines, but deliberately leave out computer science because at many institutions this department may not reside in the engineering school. Furthermore, we do not review the myriad literature related to distance and online learning, service-learning, or cooperative education. Our intended audience includes new engineering faculty, all engineering faculty interested in curriculum reform, and engineering education researchers, including graduate students pursuing this field of study. Finally, given our space limitations, we admittedly take a narrow view in focusing primarily on work in the United States.",Lord S.; Chen J.,Book,Cambridge Handbook of Engineering Education Research,2015-01-01,University of San Diego;California Polytechnic State University,
Design-based research in engineering education: Current state and next steps,"Introduction. Engineering education research is looking to research methods in education and related social sciences as a source for new approaches (Adams et al., 2011; Borrego & Bernhard, 2011; Case & Light, 2011; Davison, 2010; Ganesh, 2011; Johri & Olds, 2011; Pears, Fincher, Adams, & Daniels, 2008; Streveler & Smith, 2010). Design-based research in education, the focus of this chapter, is a natural source for ideas because this emerging methodology draws on engineering practices for some of its key values and approaches (e.g., Brown, 1992; Hjalmarson & Lesh, 2008; Middleton, Gorard, Taylor, & Bannan-Ritland, 2008). Indeed, inspiration for one of the early stage models for design-based research in education (Bannan-Ritland, 2003) was proposed by Woodie Flowers, an MIT engineer, at a National Science Foundation (NSF)–funded workshop (Kelly & Lesh, 2001). Design-based research can contribute to engineering education research because it also draws on (1) a tradition of studies in mathematics and science education (e.g., Cobb, McClain, & Gravemeijer, 2003; Kelly, Baek, Lesh, & Bannon-Ritland, 2008) and (2) frameworks from diffusion of innovations (Zaritsky et al., 2003) and more recently (3) from educational data mining (e.g., Baker & Yacef, 2009). In this chapter, I use one model for design-based research in education, the Integrative Learning Design (ILD) framework (Bannan-Ritland, 2003), and illuminate its use with examples from education and an engineering education study by Hundhausen, Agarwal, Zollars, and Carter (2011). I suggest next steps in design-based research for engineering education research, including the creation of a Design Exchange for Scholars that would actively integrate insights from educational and engineering education research and place a greater emphasis on learning analytics and educational data mining.",Kelly A.,Book,Cambridge Handbook of Engineering Education Research,2015-01-01,George Mason University,
The normative contents of engineering formation: Engineering studies,"Introduction. Engineering educators will be persuaded to alter pedagogy and curricula only when presented with rigorous research demonstrating better learning outcomes through alternative practices. So goes one justification for the recent rise of engineering education research (EER) as an arena of scholarship (Borrego, 2007; Lohmann, 2005). It builds on the view that engineering educators will be influenced most by educational research that best emulates the high value they place on rational, rigorous, especially quantitative, approaches to their own research. Rigorous EER will increase the frequency through which engineering educators adopt curricular innovations. Although engineering educators of the 1980s and 1990s showed themselves to not be influenced by the many calls for change that lacked supporting evidence, and no one advocates bad educational research, overemphasizing the assumption that engineering educators are rational actors who are most responsive to rational argument may prove, however, to be self-limiting. It fails in particular to place sufficient emphasis on the normative contents of engineering practice and, hence, the normative commitments in engineering teaching and learning. EER must critically examine not only what engineering educators do and how they do it but also why they do it. What is engineering for? What are engineers for? Engineering knowledge and practices always have normative contents. That is, engineers work in relation to or on behalf of a multitude of broader sociomaterial projects, that is, projects whose participants and implications extend beyond engineers and engineering. Because the education and training of would-be engineers seeks to prepare them for engineering work, a key issue for engineering education researchers to consider is the normative contents of engineering formation. I use the European term “formation” because it helpfully refers and calls attention to both formal education and informal training.",Downey G.,Book,Cambridge Handbook of Engineering Education Research,2015-01-01,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,

The theoretical connections between agile software development and innovative climate,"Agile software development methods are claimed to fully expose the innovation capabilities of a software development team. In the current business world, where the new innovations are seen as keys for survival and growth of the firm, these development methods have been welcomed and widely adapted. There, however, is a lack of understanding how these methods drive innovation. Therefore, in this study we analyse agile principles and practices against established innovation climate dimensions. The mapping used in analysis is done by the authors and provides a starting point for further scientific discussion.

Private-collective innovation and open source software: Longitudinal Insights from linux kernel development,"While in early years, software technology companies such as IBM and Novell invested time and resources in open source software (OSS) development, today even user firms (e.g., Samsung) invest in OSS development. Thus, today’s professional OSS projects receive contributions from hobbyists, universities, research centers, as well as software vendors and user firms. Theorists have referred to this kind of combined public and private investments in innovation creation as private-collective innovation. In particular, the private-collective innovation model seeks to explain why firms privately invest resources to create artifacts that share the characteristics of non-rivalry and non-excludability. The aim of this research is to investigate how different contributor groups associated with public and increasing private interests interact in an OSS development project. The results of the study show that the balance between private and collective contributors in the Linux kernel development seems to be changing to an open source project that is mostly developed jointly by private companies.",Homscheid D.; Kunegis J.; Schaarschmidt M.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2015-01-01,Universität Koblenz,Linux kernel ;  Open source ;  Open source community ;  Private-Collective innovation

Going mobile: Using snss to promote stemi on the backseat of a taxi across Africa,"This paper reports on the establishing of an educational service to promote Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Innovation (STEMI). The service uses MXit, a cost effective social media based on a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) to reach low income users primarily across Africa, though not necessarily restricted to this continent. Users are encouraged to submit STEMI-related questions to the care of MXit, a web or Facebook interface. The findings indicate a growing and diverse user group of 15 to 25 years old. The initial phases of the project showed South Africa as the highest user base. Analysis of the feedback from the users was used to refine the service through action research. Students asked a variety of questions which were assigned to 22 different categories of which Biology, Physics, Chemistry and general knowledge featured as the most frequent questions. Career Guidance and Health related categories were also prominent. Statistics indicate regular use of the service over a 24 h period, with prominent peaks before and after school, intimating that users were accessing the service from the back seat of a taxi on route to and from school.",Beyers R.; Blignaut S.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2015-01-01,North-West University,Developing Country ;  Mxit ;  Social network service (SNS) ;  STEMI
Towards a knowledge-based innovation tutoring system,We present a knowledge-based approach to implementing a tutoring system for innovation management. The knowledgebased approach proposed aims to solve the pervasive knowledge bottleneck problem of innovation and entrepreneurship. Solving this problem in emerging regions of innovation and entrepreneurship amounts to bridging the knowledge gaps associated with managing processes of technology innovation and entrepreneurship with a view to increasing the global competitiveness of emerging regions of innovation and entrepreneurship. We validated the main hypotheses on which this approach is based using the ICT industry in Chile as a quintessential example of an emerging region of technology innovation and entrepreneurship. We find empirical evidence to suggest that the knowledge-based management system approach proposed is a tenable approach to solving the knowledge bottleneck problem for companies arising out of the ICT industry in Chile and put the case that such an approach might be used to solve this problem in other emerging regions of innovation and entrepreneurship as well.,Paredes-Frigolett H.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2015-01-01,Universidad Diego Portales,Innovation management ;  Innovation management systems ;  Knowledge representation ;  Knowledge-based systems
The effect of information quality on user loyalty towards smartphone applications,"Today’s smartphone applications are well equipped with a number of technological innovations and advanced functionalities. At the same time, they have become more complicated in general due to a wide variety of functions. Some are neither easy to use, nor to understand. Even worse, most smartphones have a small display screen that may have a negative impact not only on the quality of information that smartphone applications offer, but also on the perceived usability of the applications. A review of the relevant literature found that past studies have not shown much interest in the impact of the quality of information that smartphone applications provide on the usability of the applications and user loyalty towards the applications. In addition, little research of the relationship between the usability of smartphone applications and user loyalty towards the applications was conducted. Therefore, this study aims to examine: 1) the effects of the quality of information that smartphone applications provide on both the perceived usability of the applications as well as user loyalty towards the applications, 2) the effect of the perceived usability of smartphone applications on user loyalty towards the applications. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze data collected through a survey. The results found that information quality significantly influenced the perceived usability of applications as well as user loyalty towards the applications. In addition, the perceived usability of applications also had a positive impact on user loyalty towards the applications.",Jung W.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2015-01-01,Dankook University,Application ;  Information ;  Loyalty ;  Smartphone ;  Usability
Structured requirements elicitation for product-service system,"For modern manufacturing companies the concept of product-service (PS) is representing a novel way to create new business opportunities, improve sustainability, support continuous innovation, and increase the product value. In this context, high-quality requirements elicitation is crucial for successful PS ideation and the following design. However, traditional product-centred approaches are not able to fully support manufacturing companies moving from product to services. This paper proposes a new methodology to support ideation and preliminary design of sustainable product-service systems (PSSs) within industrial chains. The method is based on quality functional deployment (QFD) approach and allows defining a set of robust requirements for creating new PSSs in respect with the specific customer needs and the sustainability principles of the industrial network. The research demonstrates the method validity on three case studies involving different industrial chains distributed all over Europe (i.e., white goods, machine tools, and textile industry). The case studies demonstrate how the method allows an easy definition of three distinctive PSS concepts starting for the specific market needs, and the robust requirements elicitation concerning both functional and ecosystem aspects.",Peruzzini M.; Marilungo E.; Germani M.,Journal,International Journal of Agile Systems and Management,2015-01-01,Università Politecnica delle Marche,Product-service systems ;  PSSs ;  QFD ;  Quality functional deployment ;  Requirements elicitation ;  Service engineering
Dynamic patent analysis of wind power systems and engineering asset development,"Patent analysis of new technology development can be focused on various aspects, e.g., identifying the competitiveness of a specific country or the technical advances of a firm in the given domain. The offshore wind power (OWP) has been promoted and encouraged by many countries for their renewable energy development. This research focuses on systematically discover the profile of OWP technology innovation extracted, analysed and synthesized from world patent databases dynamically using text and data mining techniques. In real time, all related patents are searched and collected. Afterward, the research builds an OWP ontology schema by identifying the OWP technical domain structure, the core concepts, and the relationships between the concepts. The ontology schema is constructed and refined dynamically using key phrases automatically extracted from patents and verified by domain experts. The research also emphasizes on the control of risk and reliable factors when evaluating the offshore wind power development. Thus, the research applies patent indicators, i.e., the patent family, the growth rates of domain technologies, the reference and citation network, the technology and function matrix, and the patent litigation information, to derive the OWP R&D landscape and strategy. After building the OWP patent knowledge base (KB), the potentials of OWP development opportunities for a specific region can be clearly identified with reliable measures based on patent map informatics.",Trappey A.; Lin C.; Wu C.; Fang P.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,2015-01-01,National Tsing Hua University;National Taipei University of Technology,Critical technology of green energy ;  IP risk management ;  Offshore wind power ;  Ontology ;  Patent strategy
The competing policy paradigms of agricultural biotechnology: Implications and Opportunities for emerging and developing economies,"Agricultural science and technology policies-including public funding of crop genetics research, intellectual property protections, and biosafety approvals of regulated crops-can be understood to work together within a 'policy paradigm' to influence the innovation and adoption of crop varieties involving agricultural biotechnologies. The political-economy or publicchoice approach views a given policy paradigm as a behaviorally rational response by policymakers to the range of pressures and inducements-such as political connections, lobbying, political donations, endorsements, elections, and popular movements- arising from the various segments of society and their respective interest groups. This article seeks to use the politicaleconomy approach to explain why it is, almost twenty-five years after the disruptive technology of genetic engineering was first commercially deployed in crop agriculture, that most countries have a policy paradigm for transgenic crop varieties that resembles the traditional policy paradigm for the chemical pesticide industry rather than the traditional policy paradigm for the seed industry. This more restrictive policy paradigm, we argue, favors the incumbents of agricultural input industries over the interests of almost all others in society, including (most) farmers and consumers. Moreover, we argue that-perhaps counterintuitively- it is consistent with the interests of the incumbents of the crop input industries for public opinion of crop biotechnology to remain relatively negative or at least uncertain. This can be seen as a rational strategy to minimize biotechnology's potential to disrupt the industry. Implications are then drawn for the potential of public-sector research and smaller entrepreneurial businesses in agricultural input markets to realize the broader. economic potential of crop biotechnology, including seeking to establish alternative policy paradigms for newly emerging genetic and breeding technologies.",Graff G.; Hochman G.; Suntharlingam C.; Zilberman D.,Journal,AgBioForum,2015-01-01,"Rutgers University–New Brunswick;University of California, Berkeley;Colorado State University",Biotechnology ;  Intellectual property policy ;  Political economy ;  Public choice ;  Regulatory policy ;  Science funding policy
Active internationalization of small and medium -sized software enterprises - Cases of French software companies,"Implementations of software production processes usually ignore organizational, market, and economical attributes of products that are to be inserted in international markets. Software engineering has begun to deal with the business aspects of software products only recently. The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge v3.0 presents two concepts of life cycle: the software development life cycle and the software product life cycle. The second is more concerned with business issues related to software products, but research on those issues is still due. In this sense, this paper aims to answer the following question: what factors allow small and medium software enterprises to offer high value added products in order to enter and remain in the international market? This work selects four research dimensions from literature and explores a number of variables inside those dimensions, which are considered as candidates to help explaining a successful process of active internationalization. The paper presents a multiple case study that shows that although innovation, entrepreneurship, and foreign market knowledge are important dimensions for the active internationalization, networking is not as relevant as it could be thought.",Galimberti M.; Wazlawick R.,Journal,Journal of Technology Management and Innovation,2015-01-01,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,Active internationalization ;  French software SMEs ;  Software internationalization ;  Software product life cycle

Material innovation and application of vertical garden system in Taiwan,"Nowadays, the vertical garden has become the architectural industry’s best way of promoting innovative green material in Taiwan. Except for its visual effects which can attract the audiences, its originality of combining the green image of the architecture with the temporal traces of the traditional architecture brings out unique architectural renovation as well as the green impression. This study employs green design concept and materials science to show the principles of social, ecological and aesthetic sustainability of the vertical garden system in Taiwan. We realize that the reason we take Taiwan’s vertical garden design as the main analytic subject is because of its uniqueness and necessity that represents one of the interpretations of using innovative green material in cultural and creative transition. By using Phenomenography and case study as our main methodologies, this research will follow the use of green cluster as our research theories. It hopes to attain the following three goals: 1) analyzing green design theories in terms of material application on vertical garden system in Taiwan, 2) learning to recognize and value the environmental criteria and guidelines for green materials, manufacturing, and quality through an analysis of papers and cases, and 3) suggesting how green cluster might link to educational aspects and contribute to cultural and creative industries in Taiwan. We believe that this present study, which draws on phenomenographic research methodology, will help us maintain a positive attitude in developing a broader perspective on material application in connection with the creative vertical garden design in Taiwan.",Peng L.; Hsueh C.,Conference Proceeding,"Innovation in Design, Communication and Engineering - Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Innovation, Communication and Engineering, ICICE 2014",2015-01-01,National Yunlin University of Science and Technology,
Developing a Kano-based evaluation model for innovation design,"This research focuses on developing a psychology-based evaluation procedure for innovative design. In this article, the extensive QFD developed by Wu has been adopted for the innovative design procedure. The major procedure of QFD is to identify the customers’ needs for the product and then convert it into appropriate technical characteristics. According to the priorities of product characteristics, the prior engineering parameters will be identified to be the key requirements to redesign. The extension method will aid the Customers’ Requirements (CRs) transform to product design attributes more comprehensively. For achieving the attractive design, we introduce the Kano model to construct the evaluation model. The proposed Kano-based evaluation procedure is mainly used in two stages of the innovative design. First, the evaluation process is used in QFD stage to help identify attractive customers’ needs, the other is used in the extension stage to help assess concepts. The flowchart of the proposed innovative design procedure with psychology-based evaluation has also been developed.

The importance of multidisciplinary work in undergraduate courses of Production Engineering to approach the job market with the academy: A contribution of entrepreneurship and innovation.,"Teaching of entrepreneurship and innovation in Brazilian universities has increased in recent years due to several factors such as the emergence of disciplines like biotechnology increased globalization reduced basic funding and new perspectives on the role of the university in the system of knowledge production Innovation is increasingly seen as an evolutionary process that involves different institutional spheres or sectors in society Entrepreneurship is a milestone on the road towards economic progress, and makes a huge contribution towards the quality and future hopes of a sector, economy or even a country. Entrepreneurship is as important in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and local markets as in large companies, and national and international markets, and is just as key a consideration for public companies as or private organizations. Entrepreneurship helps to encourage the competition in the current environment that leads to the effects of globalization. In the courses of Production Engineering, we have the need for research, whether basic or applied, but mainly linked to the labor market, professional culture and management techniques.

A knowledge-enriched problem solving methodology for the design phase of manufacturing equipment,"During the design phase of large-scale industrial engineering projects, numerous problems usually arise, which are related to the project analysis and methods used in each phase. Such projects are undertaken by multi-disciplinary teams of expert designers and planning managers that often communicate these problems to the members of their team via emails and telephone calls. However, the alignment of efforts towards solving these problems cannot be achieved effectively though these inherently limited communication and collaboration means. In parallel, the operation of manufacturing systems is evolving towards structures that are similar to social networks. The trend is to automatically connect to web-based collaboration platforms in order to search for the appropriate experts to deal with the problem in question. Towards this end, the proposed research work focuses on the development of a knowledge-based method, which is developed into a mobile app, and focuses on providing a collaboration space for reporting, tracking, and solving project-related problems. The methodology adopts concepts from the Root Cause Analysis method, which is further enriched with knowledge reuse features. Already reported and potentially solved problems, as well as other historical data are retrieved from a knowledge repository through advanced indexing techniques in order to support the identification of solutions for newly experienced problems. Results from the interpretation of the natural language that is considered to be used in the problem reporting phase and the accuracy of retrieved solutions are further discussed. Finally, the methodology is validated through a real-life case study obtained from the die construction department of an automotive industry.",Mourtzis D.; Doukas M.; Skrepetos T.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2015-01-01,University of Patras,Knowledge Management ;  Mobile Applications ;  Root Cause Analysis
Teaching mechanical design practice in academia,"In many research universities, mechanical engineering (ME) curriculum does not include courses that teach ME students essential professional knowledge needed to become a design engineer. Professional know-how is not regarded as an academic topic, although a mechanical designer who will get a job in industry will need to apply this knowledge from his first day. Topics such as selecting mechanical elements (motors, bearings, seals etc.) from a catalog or selecting a proper material or coating for a designed part, are rarely taught even in machine design courses. We believe that mechanical engineering students should learn practical skills and get basic design experience. To close this gap, we introduced a new ""Design and Manufacture Laboratory"" for senior ME undergraduate students. The paper describes the laboratory course, students' activities and design projects. The design projects performed in the lab, follow the learned design methodology and include design reviews and appropriate documentation. The designed systems are produced, assembled and tested by each team. In addition to the learned technical skills, ""soft skills"" are taught in the lab related to mechanical design that include: team work, self- management, time management, communication skills and presentation skills. These soft skills are an essential tool for every mechanical engineer who starts to work in the global and changing industrial world.",Cohen K.; Katz R.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2015-01-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Design laboratory ;  Mechanical design ;  Soft skills in mechanical engineering
Model based systems engineering in construction kit development - Two case studies,"To offer a large variety of end products with a limited number of components, more and more companies take advantage of the modular design, platform and type series principles resulting in a construction kit development. These standardization methods make the product development processes more complex. This can be encountered with the help of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). In order to support construction kit development with the help of MBSE in a long term, definitions of such terms as module, platform, type series and construction kit are analyzed and defined in the context of MBSE. As a result, some implications of these definitions are presented in this paper. In addition, first findings out of two research studies conducted at an automotive manufacturer are presented and put into the context of MBSE.

Fostering analogical reasoning and design skills through creating bio-inspired robotic models,"This paper proposes an approach in which students are engaged in scientific inquiry of biological systems, and in construction of robotic models of these systems. Analogical reasoning is used as a thread of the proposed approach, tying together learning by scientific inquiry and learning by technological design. The research questions posed in our educational study address: pedagogical characteristics of the proposed approach, patterns of students' analogical reasoning, and students' attitudes towards the learning experience. We developed a learning environment and a curriculum and conducted courses to 118 middle school students involved in outreach activities and to 41 prospective teachers of science and technology. Dozens of robotic models were designed and constructed by our students in this framework. The models featured topics such as plant, animal, and human behaviors. Findings of our study highlight the potential of using robotic models in science-technology education. They show that the exploration of analogies can furnish a synergetic combination of learning-by-inquiry and learning-by-design and foster development of analogical thinking skills.",Cuperman D.; Verner I.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2015-01-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,biological system modeling ;  design ;  inquiry ;  robotics ;  Science-technology education
Defining perceived quality in the automotive industry: An engineering approach,"Perceived quality is one of the most important factors underlying success of car manufacturers today. There is a significant amount of literature regarding perceived quality from a marketing research perspective, applied psychology and consumer research. From an engineering viewpoint, perceived quality is represented in the literature mainly by the work that assesses different aspects of perceived quality in order to evaluate them in the early design stages. As a result of this no theoretical framework has yet been compiled that combines customer view on perceived quality and the engineering prospects of this broad term. Consequently, terms regarding perceived quality components and elements often have multiple meanings or meanings similar to each other. There is a need to standardize the terminology and definitions related to perceived quality more concretely. This paper presents the basis of a theoretical framework in an attempt to build a model, including different aspects of perceived quality regarding automotive industry needs. Based on the literature review and industry examples, the authors propose a common terminology and perceived quality definition in the field of the automotive industry.",Stylidis K.; Wickman C.; Söderberg R.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2015-01-01,Volvo Car Corporation;Chalmers University of Technology,information and knowledge management in product development ;  manufacturing quality ;  perceived quality ;  product quality
Integrating analysis and design in mechanical engineering education,"Mechanical engineering (ME) departments in research universities face the challenge of educating mechanical engineers who will graduate with a balanced knowledge in engineering science and mechanical design. The source of this challenge is the inherent difference between teaching analytical thinking, which is required for most engineering-science courses, and design thinking, which is required for project-based design courses. The purpose of this paper is first to propose a new approach that can potentially bridge the educational gap between analytical and design thinking, which we refer to as integrated thinking. Second, we show how it can be applied to various ME undergraduate courses, which we refer to as integrated courses. Our approach reforms science engineering courses by (a) stressing the physical interpretation of mathematical derivations; (b) requiring students to analyze, design, and sketch simple mechanical devices based on the learned theoretical material; and (c) modifying project-based design courses to emphasize the importance of analysis as part of the creative design process. A pilot course focusing on dynamics and vibration, which we called Integrated Design and Analysis, was offered in the ME department at the Technion, where it was well-attended by senior ME students. The positive feedback of the students who took the course suggests that integrated thinking might be successfully applied in many areas of ME education, such as fluid mechanics and heat transfer, control, and mechatronics, and that our approach may contribute to changing the current divided pattern in ME education.",Katz R.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2015-01-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Analytical thinking ;  Design thinking ;  Integrated thinking
"A Framework for a Trans-disciplinary, Translational Research Group for Building Innovation","This paper outlines a framework for the formation of a research group aimed at promoting innovation in the building industry. The built environment in the United States is failing; economic, social, environmental and technological performance of buildings as well as the industry responsible for their creation has not kept pace with other industries essential to a ensuring a healthy society. While it would appear that research activity is prevalent in academia and, to some extent, in professional practice, the building industry is slow to change. The building industry is examined to identify the barriers currently in place that limit innovation. This paper proposes the formation of a trans-disciplinary group of academics and industry partners focused on translational research aimed at promoting much needed innovation in the building industry. The complexity of the problems needing to be addressed by the building industry is often beyond the scope of knowledge of any one particular field. This framework proposes to move beyond interdisciplinary research, where knowledge is transferred between collaborators, and rather strives for a trans-disciplinary model where team members transcend their own disciplines to inform one another's work. In addition, the research carried out by this group is intended to be translational. Modelled after the successful approach currently implemented in the medical profession, translational research results in a feedback loop where basic research is tested in application. Results become inputs to a new round of basic research, which are then tested again. This cycle continues with new research questions continuously being influenced by the limitations of previous questions. By more directly connecting the efforts of research in academia with the application in practice, the potential exists to make research more visible to both those with the power to implement it, practitioners and industry, and those able to benefit from it, end users.",Donofrio M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2015-01-01,University of Oregon,academic-industry partnerships ;  Innovation ;  trans-disciplinary research ;  translational research
An anti-recoil control design using the new riser hybrid tensioning system in deepwater drilling,"A new riser anti-recoil control design is presented in this research paper using the novel riser hybrid tensioning system by combining a fast acting electrically powered riser tensioning system with existing conventional hydro-pneumatic tensioners. This work is the further development of a control system for the previous work presented in the framework proposal of riser hybrid tensioning system. This innovation that we bring forward here is all designed to increase operating envelope of the vessel. A system model integrating both electrical and hydro-pneumatic tensioners and the riser string is built for anti-recoil control purpose. The main goal of this control design is a safer and more predictable position control of the riser string. A LQG control design technique is applied here. A feedback controller with Kalman estimator of the system state space variables is designed and implemented. The Matlab simulation helped to demonstrate the concept feasibility of this anti-recoil control strategy and to further verify that a more robust and accurate control performance could be achieved by this riser hybrid tensioning system. This control technique increases the testability of the riser anti-recoil system; reduce potential damage and increase operator's confidence. The new proposed data logging system improves the detectability of the anti-recoil system. And the position control, when the riser string ""soft hang-off"" on the tensioners, opens the possibility to extend the operability to other applications.",Wu Y.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,2015-01-01,Transocean Inc.,
Perspectives on collaboration in technology innovation for ageing,"Seven gerontechnology innovation projects spanning nineteen years were considered in terms of project activities, collaboration and management. The projects we considered were: PLANEC, OTIS, Care in the Community, SAPHE, SOPRANO, Smart Distress Monitor and COACH. Three interviews with project partners identified the nature and goals of the project, the composition of the team members, and the challenges, solutions, successes, and failures. Thematic analysis revealed three common themes spanning the projects which are likely to be issues in other technology innovation and research projects. The themes are navigating boundaries, succeeding at “things you’re not very good at”, and managing disparate teams. In this article we discuss the factors contributing to these thematic concerns, and present solutions that were helpful for the projects in the expectation that the knowledge generated from those working experiences is transferable to other projects that involve the intersection of technology development and social concerns.",Jackson P.; Sixsmith J.; Mihailidis A.; Sixsmith A.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2015-01-01,Simon Fraser University;University of Toronto;University of Northampton,Collaboration ;  Gerontechnology ;  Project Management ;  Transdisciplinarity

Developing a Kano-Based Evaluation Model for Innovation Design,"This research focuses on developing a psychology-based evaluation procedure for innovative design. The divergent thinking part of the main innovative design procedure which discussed in this paper is the extensive QFD developed by the author (Wu). The major performance of QFD is to identify the customers' requirements and their priorities. Then, the proposed extensive QFD helps transform the high priority requirements into appropriate technical characteristics. According to the priorities of product characteristics, the prior engineering parameters will be identified to be the key performances to redesign. For identifying the requirements and achieving the attractive design, we introduce the Kano model to construct the evaluation model. The proposed Kano-based evaluation procedure is mainly used in two stages of the innovative design. First, the evaluation process was used in QFD stage to help identify attractive customers' requirements, and the other was used in the extension stage to help assess concepts. The flowchart of proposed innovative design procedure with psychology-based evaluation has also been developed. A case study, exercise equipment design, is adopted to explain and verify feasibility of the proposed approach.",Wu C.; Wang M.; Liu N.; Pan T.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2015-01-01,National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology;National Kaohsiung Normal University;Shu-Te University,
Thermochemical Conversion of Microalgae: Challenges and Opportunities,"Research in Advanced Biofuels steadily developed during recent years. A number of highly innovative technologies have been explored at various scale: among these, lignocellulosic ethanol and CTO (Crude Tall Oil)-biofuel technologies already achieved the early-commercial status, while hydrotreating of vegetable oils (HVO, or HEFA) can be considered today fully commercial. However, despite the level of innovation in each specific technological process under consideration, the feedstock maintains a central role in making a biofuel chain really sustainable. In this context, microalgae grown in salt-water and arid areas offers a considerable opportunity for advanced biofuel production: at the same time, however, they also represent a considerable challenge. Processing microalgae in an economic way into a viable and sustainable liquid biofuel (a low-cost mass-produced product) is not trivial. So far, the main attention has been given to cultivating the microorganism, accumulating lipids, extracting the oil, valorising co-products, and treating the algae oil into biodiesel (through esterification) or HEFA (Hydrotreated Esthers and Fatty Acids), this second one representing a very high quality biofuels, almost a drop-in fuel (suitable either for road transport or for aviation), which production exceed 2 Mt y-1 today. However, extracting the algae oil at low cost and at industrial scale is not yet a full industrial mature process, and the still limited market size of algae-to-biofuels makes difficult the development of industrial-scale systems. Nevertheless, another option can be considered, i.e. processing the whole algae into dedicated thermochemical reactors, thus approaching the downstream processing of algae in a completely different way from separation. The present work examines the possible routes for thermochemical conversion of microalgae, distinguishing between dry-processes (namely pyrolysis and gasification) and wet-processes (near critical water hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrothermal gasification). Typical expected elementary composition of major products is given. Main peculiarities of batch versus continuous processing are also discussed from an engineering point of view. Major engineering advantages and challenges in thermochemically conversion of algae are identified and discussed, in view of the production of a transport biofuel. Finally, future perspectives for each route are given in terms of current and expected technological readiness level.",Chiaramonti D.; Prussi M.; Buffi M.; Casini D.; Rizzo A.,Conference Proceeding,Energy Procedia,2015-01-01,Università degli Studi di Firenze,biofuels ;  bioliquids ;  downstream processes ;  HTL ;  microalgae ;  pyrolysis

Radial deformations of working cylinder of hydraulic Legs depending on their extension,Current methods of calculation of parameters of hydraulic legs of powered supports are in most cases analytical and do not consider all complex of factors. Finite element model was developed to study this problem and used to analyze the influence of hydraulic legs extension on radial deformations of cylinder of different producers of powered supports at variation of hydraulic fluid pressure. It was revealed that radial deformations of cylinders along the axis of hydraulic legs increase in magnitude in direct proportion to the hydraulic fluid pressure and extension. Research results can be recommended to define optimal geometric parameters of hydraulic legs in respect to the minimal radial deformations of hydraulic cylinder increasing its impermeability and improving the work of cup seals.

Smart city research as an interdisciplinary crossroads: A challenge for management and organization studies,"This paper seeks to define the boundaries of Smart City research and to draw a map of the interdisciplinary community focusing on this emerging issue. To do so, we analysed the texts included in the websites of two major international Conferences on Smart Cities, and we used the Social Network Analysis (SNA) approach to examine a representative sample of 114 publications on Smart Cities. We found that Smart City research was hosted in Architecture and Social Sciences journals in the first place, but since 2007-2008 the interest in this issue boomed among Engineering and Computer Science scholars. Whilst there is a growing number of publications describing many ICT-enabled solutions for enhancing the competitiveness, sustainability and livability of cities, only few studies have addressed the organizational issues implied in such innovations so far. On the other side, our graph describing the interdisciplinary links within the 118 analysed publications shows that management studies occupy a strategic position within the interdisciplinary network of Smart City research. Then, Management and Information Systems scholars are given the opportunity to fill an important gap in an emerging stream of studies.",Ricciardi F.; Za S.,Conference Proceeding,Lecture Notes in Information Systems and Organisation,2015-01-01,Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore;LUISS University,
Testing live cables in nuclear power plants,"Cable faults have contributed to plant trips, unplanned shutdowns, and thousands of wasted maintenance man-hours to identify and locate the problem; often to no avail. According to a recent survey of the nuclear industry, the frequency of intermittent faults in nuclear power plant cables is increasing apparently due to aging of the current fleet. These faults often manifest themselves in signal anomalies which interfere with operation of the plant, cause problems in other plant equipment, produce false alarms, and even cause spurious or erroneous safety system actuations. Problems are compounded when cable circuits transmit inaccurate information that does not represent actual plant operating conditions and can challenge the plant protection and safety systems. Ironically, intermittent faults are almost always absent during troubleshooting attempts which currently depend on conventional test equipment and classical test techniques. This is especially true when the affected cables or circuits are de-energized for the test. To address these issues, Analysis and Measurement Services Corporation (AMS) was awarded a Department of Energy (DOE) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant to develop techniques for in-situ testing of live (i.e. energized) cables in operating nuclear power plants. Research and Development (R&D) data for this project was generated using representative nuclear plant circuits and end devices as a laboratory test bed with induced faults. The faults were identified and diagnosed using several different test methods including reflectometry techniques and bulk electrical measurements. Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) techniques are well-known and widely used electrical cable testing methods which involve injecting a test signal into the circuit and measuring its reflection. The reflected signal typically identifies any significant impedance changes along the cable and thereby helps identify and locate faults. When combined with other cable testing techniques and EMI/RFI measurements, the reflectometry methods can identify not only cable faults but also problems in connectors and end devices. The combination of electrical cable and end device measurements applied to live cable circuits will resolve the difficulty in diagnosing intermittent electrical faults and provide improved plant reliability for the nuclear power industry. This paper discusses the R&D of this project and its implementation in nuclear power plants.",McConkey J.; Nace D.; Hashemian H.,Conference Proceeding,"9th International Topical Meeting on Nuclear Plant Instrumentation, Control, and Human-Machine Interface Technologies, NPIC and HMIT 2015",2015-01-01,Analysis and Measurement Services Corporation,Cable degredation ;  Intermittent fault ;  Testing live circuits

Leverage technology for innovation: Do things better tomorrow than done today,"Nuclear power plants have significant challenges to reduce risks, drive cost efficiency and increase value. Competitiveness with other energy sources is a major concern to prevent premature plant closings due to economic considerations. Obsolescence of equipment and systems and heavy reliance on analog technology are making competitiveness more challenging. Plant operations are labor-intensive due to vast numbers of operational and support activities required by technologies mostly used in plants. A large percentage of experienced workers in plants are nearing retirement, which adds the burden of transferring knowledge to newer workers effectively. Innovation through use of technology is needed to make significant improvements in cost-efficient operation. The Electric Power Research Institute is developing innovative solutions to reduce risks and increase cost-efficiency. Extensive human factors engineering guidance, which is currently being updated and expanded, and decision-centered guidelines for design of human-system interfaces support reduction of the likelihood of human errors (and associated added costs) and improvement of situation awareness and decision-making. Knowledge transfer and training can be improved by using simulation with interactive capabilities so that the student is learning in an active mode, which has been shown to substantially improve knowledge retention. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for replacement of systems and components can result in less costly and easier to maintain approaches compared to microprocessor-based systems. Guidance on the design and implementation of FPGAs has been developed. Mobile applications provide support to reduce human error.

Use of additive manufacturing to model and develop advanced liquid propulsion designs: Distro-A: Approved for public release,"Additive manufacturing has become an increasingly more affordable and capable engineering tool over the last decade. Its role in the engineering industry is becoming ever more important as the technology improves in accuracy, speed, efficiency, and affordability. Additive manufacturing gives researchers the opportunity to develop and manufacture new designs that would have been impossible to produce with traditional, subtractive means. The ability of this technology to produce parts with many alloys allows for engineers to develop new innovations that can be used in real-world practice. This is particularly advantageous in the high-pressure and temperature environments in which rocket motors and engines perform. Along with its well-documented benefits in cost- and time-savings, additive manufacturing represents a more technically-effective solution to the manufacturing of aerospace propulsion systems. Recently, researchers at the United States Naval Academy have worked to acquire, develop, and collaborate with others within the engineering field that can perform additive manufacturing of parts. Through this research, additive manufacturing will be used to design, manufacture, test and confirm the ability of additive manufactured designs to reduce the weight of liquid propulsion systems, while still maintaining functionality and structural reliability. Computational modeling through SolidWorks will be used to design the injector as well as complete stress analysis of the structure. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will be completed using standard engineering CFD software. Injectors will be manufactured using fused deposition modeling (FDM) to test the feasibility of acceptable flow with additive manufacturing. This paper will cover the mission objectives, planning, design, and testing of additive manufacturing for injector applications.",Catina J.; Castonguay K.,Conference Proceeding,51st AIAA/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference,2015-01-01,,

In the fierce competition, how to design products for satisfying the needs of users, and attract users to download have become one of important issues for developers of game APPs. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to define the potential factors that influence users to download game APP based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT). Then, two feature selection methods, Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVMRFE) and Information Gain (IG) will be utilized to identify the key factors of downloading game APPs. Finally, a comparison between different groups will be provided. The results can be used as a reference for game developers and researchers to design game APPs.",Chen L.; Yen C.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2015-01-01,Chaoyang University of Technology,Diffusion of innovation theory ;  Feature selection ;  Game APP ;  SVM-RFE ;  Technology acceptance model
Organization learning from failure through knowledge network: Case study on an engineering company in Japan,"Making an attempt for new business and innovation to seek better performance is an essential matter for company to keep sustainable growth. Learning from failure is one of the ways to seek better performance, but it is extraordinarily rare for organizations to do it well. This paper reported a successful case study in Sangikyo Corporation in Japan. Since they succeeded in establishing a way to learn from failure, they had accumulated 41 failure case studies and lessons learned from the failures since 2005. In addition, they eventually earned thirty-five fold profits more over the past six years. In this paper, authors explored success factors for organizational learning from failure based on the case in Sangikyo Corporation, from points of willingness to serve, common purpose and communication. This paper however, just showed preliminary hypotheses for further research, and it is necessary to carefully examine them for being concrete hypotheses beyond this paper.",Nagayoshi S.; Nakamura J.,Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2015-01-01,Faculty of Commerce;Kanazawa Institute of Technology,Common purpose ;  Communication ;  Knowledge sharing platform ;  Organization learning from failure ;  Success factor ;  Willingness to serve
Ex vivo model of human skin (hOSEC) as alternative to animal use for cosmetic tests,"For ethical reasons, the use of experimental animals for skin irritation studies is not desired, mainly for cosmetical products. Alternative methods for skin irritation testing have been proposed, but no method has been yet successfully pre validated. Then, the research centers have searched alternative methods. We demonstrated the viability of ex vivo model of human skin (hOSEC: HUMAN ORGANOTYPIC SKIN EXPLANTED CULTURE) by proliferative capacity of skin keratinocyte for up to 75 days in culture and compared it to in vivo models (hairless and human), proving hOSEC method as an alternative for secure and efficacy tests of sun protection factor.",Andrade T.; Aguiar A.; Guedes F.; Leite M.; Caetano G.; Coelho E.; Das P.; Frade M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Engineering,2015-01-01,University of Birmingham;Università degli Studi di Brescia;Universidade de São Paulo;Universiteit van Amsterdam;Narcissus Clinical Research and Biotechnology Ltd;Lauro Souza Lima Institute,Animal use alternatives ;  Cosmetic tests ;  Feasibility studies ;  Free tissue flaps ;  Innovation ;  Skin physiological processes ;  Tissue culture techniques
Application of man–machine–environment systems engineering in financial innovation and the transition of central banks,"To analyze the financial innovation and the transition of central bank, the research framework of man-machine-environment system engineering (MMESE) on this field is proposed in this paper. The main conclusions are: central banks (“man”) needs to comply with the long-term trend of marketization of financial market (“environment”), to change its temporary and passive crisis aid system afterwards into active continuous innovation of monetary policy tools (“machine”), and policy transmission mechanism (“machine-environment relationship”). With breakthrough in its traditional function, the central bank can create a new “man-machine-environment system” to control financial risk and ultimately achieve its “safety, efficiency and economy” objectives.",Huang Y.; Hu Z.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2015-01-01,Chinese Academy of Social Sciences;Columbia Business School,Central banks ;  Conduction mechanism ;  Financial innovation ;  Man-machine-environment systems engineering ;  Monetary policy
The research of the cluster of modern service industry’s innovation mechanism under the social network perspective,"With the development of economic globalization, modern service industry has gradually become the main driver of economic growth, during which innovation has become the eternal topic, and clustering as well as networking have become the main trends in the development of modern service industry in the future. Based on the knowledge and funds, these two kinds of network resources acting as “bridge”, the paper highlights the main parts of the knowledge sharing and fund raising to improve the cluster enterprise innovation. The features of the cluster network include three aspects: network centrality, network density, and structural holes. Knowledge sharing and fund raising have a significant impact on cluster innovation mechanism, and on the contrary, the characteristics of cluster network will affect knowledge sharing and financing as well, and what follows next is that it will affect the cluster innovation mechanism.",Li Y.; Jiang J.; Wu Y.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2015-01-01,Xi'an University of Science and Technology;Shanghai Institute of Technology,Cluster of modern service industry ;  Innovation mechanism ;  Knowledge sharing

Basic investigations in incremental profile forming,"Increasing demands in profile manufacturing lead to a constant increase of the geometric complexity of the profile. Especially in times where lightweight design and load adaption are of huge importance, a need for new profile manufacturing technologies exists. In order to cope with this development a new profile forming method was invented, the Incremental Profile Forming (IPF). IPF allows the flexible manufacturing of profiles with varying cross section geometries along the longitudinal profile axis and offers therefore high potential for the manufacturing of lightweight design parts. Due to the high degree of innovation research work regarding the process fundamentals as well as the process limits is necessary. For this reason, the results of the first basic experimental and numerical investigations are presented. While in the experiments the potential of the process is shown in feasibility studies, first analysis of the forming process as well as the influence of diverse process parameters on the process was carried out in numerical investigations. Finally first analytical approaches for predicting the forming behavior are presented.",Grzancic G.; Becker C.; Khalifa N.; Tekkaya A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASME 2015 International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference, MSEC 2015",2015-01-01,Technische Universität Dortmund,
"Designing for system change: Innovation, practice and everyday water","In this paper we examine the installation and trial of a novel system of integrated water management from the perspective of household users in order to reveal the importance of considering social practices in the adoption of innovative water management systems, and in the process reframe the ways in which the implementation of water conserving technologies is understood. Drawing on a case study in peri-urban Victoria, Australia, this paper analyses the experiences of 25 household residents over an 18-month period to determine how household users adapted their everyday water use (or not) to a new water management system. This research focuses on three important domains of practice in water management - toileting, cleaning and communication - to reveal the tension between established and novel practices. Our findings demonstrate that the conventional focus on technocratic and engineering-oriented components of system innovation by the water sector may actually impede the successful implementation and use of innovative, potentially more sustainable, water and sanitation systems. This paper suggests what is needed is an approach to system innovation that takes daily discourses, community knowledge, practices and the localised contexts of water users as critical in influencing the successful uptake of small-scale innovative water systems.",Fam D.; Lopes A.,Journal,ACME,2015-01-01,University of Technology Sydney;Western Sydney University,
Patterns of practice and design: Towards an agile methodology for educational design research,"This paper proposes a framework which attempts to address the barriers to the development of successful educational design research through a process which identifies gaps in current practices and devises innovations to target them. Educational design research assumes an ambitious position: a dual commitment to understand and contribute to both theory and practice. This task is confounded by the complexity of the domain and the inherent multi-stakeholder nature of most initiatives. Three barriers to success are identified: the shortage of mechanisms for cross-stakeholder dialogue, the failure to account for existing practices and contexts, and the rigid processes dictated by the dynamics of research projects. We report early findings from an attempt to address these barriers, based on an extension and adaptation of the Participatory Pattern Workshop (PPW) methodology (This paper has received the support of the Learning Layers project co-funded by the European Commission; Grant Agreement Number 318209; http://learning-layers.eu/).",Mor Y.; Cook J.; Santos P.; Treasure-Jones T.; Elferink R.; Holley D.; Griffin J.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2015-01-01,University of the West of England;University of Leeds;Anglia Ruskin University;RayCom BV,Design narratives ;  Design patterns ;  Educational design research ;  Learning design ;  Patterned practices ;  Stakeholder participation
Learning analytics: Trends and issues of the empirical research of the years 2011-2014,"In very recent years, the advent of Learning Analytics (LA) has resulted in a number of publications reporting on empirical research. This literature overview identifies the mainstream of empirical LA research, and emphasizes insufficiently investigated directions that display a higher innovation potential. The mainstream consists of learning trajectory visualizations aimed to predict learner success. Single studies prove innovative by addressing in particular: informal educational settings, video and audio records as data sources, automated assessment and error/misconception analysis. A central issue of empirical LA research consists of the frequent lack of an explicit theoretical framework from educational perspective. We maintain that educational and psychological theories are urgently needed for significant progress of upcoming LA research.",Nistor N.; Derntl M.; Klamma R.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2015-01-01,Walden University;Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München;Universität der Bundeswehr München;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Empirical educational research ;  Learning analytics ;  Literature Review
The system of concurrent engineering,"Concurrent engineering (CE) has been a major theme in the 80s and 90s of the previous century in research and practice. Its main aim is to reduce time-tomarket, improve quality and reduce costs by taking into account downstream requirements and constraints already in the design phase. While starting with a design-manufacturing alignment, gradually the CE way of thinking has been ex-tended to incorporate more lifecycle functions together with a stronger focus on and involvement of both customers and suppliers. Application of CE in practice has led to remarkable cost savings, time reduction and quality improvement. However, many failures have been reported too. Often, the complex system of CE has not been sufficiently well understood, in particular because the system that is needed to market, produce, sell, and maintain the new product, the so-called production system, has not been considered sufficiently. The particular properties of the production system that is needed to really make the new product a success need to be understood well, because they heavily influence the CE process. In this chapter a history of CE is sketched as well as its major achievements and challenges. The essentials of the system of CE are described together with the system that is designed by it: the production system. The production system, as defined in this chapter, is an encompassing system, because it also comprises functions like marketing, sales, production, and maintenance. The interaction between the two systems needs to be taken into account in all CE processes in any application domain. The chapter ends with examples of the food application area. The variety of the system of CE, in terms of different innovation efforts, is illustrated. Some important properties of the result of a CE process, a food production system, are discussed, in particular a food supply chain and its coordination for quality.",Wognum N.; Trienekens J.,Book,"Concurrent Engineering in the 21st Century: Foundations, Developments and Challenges",2015-01-01,Wageningen University & Research,CE system ;  Collaborative engineering ;  Collaborative/open innovation ;  Concurrent engineering ;  Early supplier involvement ;  Production system
Intellectual property protection,"With the growth of the knowledge-based economy, intellectual property right (IPR) is recognized as a key factor to develop and protect strategic competitiveness and innovation of an enterprise. The increasing degree of collaboration in global relationships, ubiquitous digital communication techniques as well as tough competition has lead to an increasing importance of intellectual property protection (IPP) for enterprises. Since the law as well as ethical principles are not always adhered to, there are increasingly activities outside legal understanding. This situation is exacerbated in the context of rising crime through the misuse of modern ICT technologies (""Cyber Crime"") and now employs extensively state authorities. Piracy, counterfeits and unwanted know-how drain pose a significant problem for each market leader. Intellectual property is stored in product data too. Especially modern parametric and feature-based 3D-CAD systems have been enhanced towards acquiring, representing, processing and distributing knowledge to support knowledge-based engineering (KBE) within virtual product creation. However, it is very easy to exchange huge amounts of product data within a virtual enterprise that comprises an enterprise with its supplier network. There is an enormous threat that intellectual property could fall into the wrong hands and badly jeopardize the existence of the related company. This chapter contains an analysis of this conflict area, a picture of the legal framework, a discussion on the need for action in supply chain networks and attempts by research and development as well as best practices in industry for various aspects of IPP in the context of concurrent engineering (CE).",Stjepandić J.; Liese H.; Trappey A.,Book,"Concurrent Engineering in the 21st Century: Foundations, Developments and Challenges",2015-01-01,National Tsing Hua University;PROSTEP AG,Intellectual property protection ;  IPP ;  KBE ;  Knowledge-based engineering ;  Patent infringement ;  Product innovation ;  Virtual product creation

Biomedical engineering education in Peru in 2015: A unique and innovative collaboration in Latin America,"The Peruvian health sector has a major shortcoming in Latin America because it does not have enough biomedical engineers (BMEs). This situation leads to negative impacts on the quality of a number of outcomes, including: health services, research, management, policies, regulation, etc. Health technology today is engaged in all the key processes: planning, operational, financial, that supports the health organizations. Despite Peruvian health professionals’ efforts the lack of an appropriate technological environment and sufficient numbers of BME professionals prevents a good understanding and/or management of the situation, thus affecting the decisions applied to key aspects involved in the sustainability, effectiveness and health disparities in the Peruvian health organizations, both public and private. In addition, the costs due to these inefficiencies jeopardize the governmental investment (public health sector) and the gains of the health enterprises, leading to ineffective, unsafe and inequitable patient care. BME is a discipline devoted to the use of engineering principles and techniques to the study of biological, physiological and medical processes at all length scales. It is a fast growing career in both developed and developing countries, and contributes to the scientific, economic and social development and welfare of society. Its roots are firmly embedded in applying the engineering perspective to health delivery systems and health technology management (clinical engineering). It has been exceptionally successful in applying computational modeling techniques to describe complex biological systems and providing context for experimental approaches to molecular, cellular, tissue and organ system processes. Recently, understanding of biological phenomena has been informing the design of new engineering materials and processes (biomimetic). Most Latin American countries have this specialization at the undergraduate level; model programs exist in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Two leading Latin American private Peruvian universities, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Peru (PUCP) and Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) have agreed to create a joint world-class BME undergraduate program using the institutions’ strengths. Peruvian BME status is rising quickly. This academic project between PUCP-UPCH to develop the BME curriculum is a valuable and exciting collaboration. We report here the current situation in Peru with respect to the rise of BME.",Rivas R.; Vilcahuamán L.; Cieza M.; Clark T.; Voigt H.,Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2015-01-01,Boston University College of Engineering;Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia;Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru;The University of Vermont,Biomedical engineering ;  Collaboration ;  Education ;  Health ;  Innovation
Developing an appropriate and affordable expert system for medical diagnosis (ESMD) in developing countries,"Bringing intelligent healthcare informatics to bear on the dual problems of reducing healthcare costs and improving quality and outcomes is a challenge even in countries with a reasonably developed technology infrastructure. In the developing countries, like Nigeria, introduction of intelligent healthcare informatics then becomes constrained by considerations not only of affordability but also of appropriateness of the innovation. This research sets out to develop an appropriate and affordable expert system for medical diagnosis ESMD in developing countries. ESMD is designed to enable clinicians to identify diseases and describe methods of treatment to be carried out taking into account the user capability. The ESMD was designed using the C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS). CLIPS is rule-based expert system tool, which means that knowledge is represented in rules, based on experience. ESMD shell has four modules: the user interface, the explanation system, the inference engine and the knowledge base editor. The knowledge base of ESMD was organized among several clinical signs, symptoms and features associated to drug therapy. The prototype of the ESMD was ready for use after nine months. The system does many random questions in order to enable clinicians make diagnosis and suggest therapy. The system is user-friendly and presented good time-response to give therapy advice. The knowledge base is editable and can be used to generate personal configuration based on population characteristics.",Nkuma-Udah K.; Chukwudebe G.; Ahaiwe J.; Ejeta K.; Ndubuka G.,Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2015-01-01,"Federal University of Technology, Owerri",Affordability ;  Appropriateness ;  Artificial intelligence ;  Developing ;  Developing countries ;  Expert system ;  Medical diagnosis
Using trustworthy simulation to engineer cloud schedulers,"In recent years, researchers have contributed promising new techniques for allocating cloud resources in more robust, efficient, and ecologically sustainable ways. Unfortunately, the wide-spread use of these techniques in production systems has, to date, remained elusive. One reason for this is that the state of the art for investigating these innovations at scale often relies solely on model-driven simulation. Production-grade cloud software, however, demands certainty and precision for development and business planning that only comes from validating simulation against empirical observation. In this work, we take an alternative approach to facilitating cloud research and engineering in order to transition innovations to production deployment faster. In particular, we present a new methodology that complements existing model-driven simulation with platform-specific and statistically trustworthy results. We simulate systems at scales and on time frames that are testable, and then, based on the statistical validation of these simulations, investigate scenarios beyond those feasibly observable in practice. We demonstrate the approach by developing an energy-aware cloud scheduler and evaluating it using production and synthetic traces in faster than real time. Our results show that we can accurately simulate a production IaaS system, ease capacity planning, and expedite the reliable development of its components and extensions.",Pucher A.; Gul E.; Wolski R.; Krintz C.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2015",2015-01-01,UC Santa Barbara College of Engineering,
It's not just the pedagogy: Challenges in scaling mobile learning applications into institution-wide learning technologies,"Whilst m-learning pedagogy has received considerable attention (e.g. Sharples et. al. 2007, Kukulska-Hulme, 2012), the process of adopting this potentially disruptive innovation within universities has been neglected. Based on a PhD thesis (Bird, 2014), this paper presents some of the findings from a longitudinal study which examined the adoption of mlearning projects in five UK higher education institutions in the period 2008 to 2011. Many m-learning projects have been started as pilots often as a result of external research funding.

"Transforming rural communities in China and beyond: Community entrepreneurship and enterprises, infrastructure development and investment modes","This book represents one of the first attempts by a multidisciplinary research team, encompassing the social sciences, business, architecture and planning, engineering, and finance and economics, to help rural communities discover sustainable and self-reliant paths to development and transformation. The opening chapter outlines the background of the research, its importance in the context of China and other countries, the rationale for choosing the case study communities in rural China, and the composition of the research team. Chapter 2 explores key issues in the role of social entrepreneurship and leadership in rural community development. Chapter 3 analyses a green platform for a pilot transaction of China forest carbon sinks led by the Huadong Forestry Exchange. The fourth chapter examines carbon trade, forestry land rights, and the livelihoods of farmers in rural Chinese communities. Chapter 5 explores alternative energy development in rural Chinese communities, where the poor are often disproportionately dependent on fuel wood and solid biomass, causing environmental degradation, reduced productivity and the decline of income generating opportunities. Chapter 6 examines and tests the proposition that stronger communities will result from ‘connected up’, holistic, synergistic and inclusive planning of services and supporting infrastructure. Chapter 7 analyzes information and communications technology (ICT) based service innovations for supporting rural community enterprises. Chapter 8 highlights key elements of stronger rural communities, drawing together the themes and proposals of preceding chapters and constructing an integrated model. The authors demonstrate that interconnected community enterprises based on clean forest products, forest carbon and ecotourism can be underpinned by local infrastructure enterprises such as renewable energy, water, waste management, ICT and transport, and financial mechanisms like carbon finance, all involving skills development, leadership and social entrepreneurship coupled with corporate and investment partnerships. Such interconnected approaches are expected to generate increased employment and prosperity, improve social livelihoods, and benefit the environment.",Zhu Y.; Lan H.; Ness D.; Xing K.; Schneider K.; Lee S.; Ge J.,Book,"Transforming Rural Communities in China and Beyond: Community Entrepreneurship and Enterprises, Infrastructure Development and Investment Modes",2015-01-01,University of South Australia;Universität Wien;Renmin University of China;Nemopartners China Consulting Group;Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation,

The emerging concept of responsible innovation. Three reasons why it is questionable and calls for a radical transformation of the concept of innovation,"In this chapter, we challenge the presupposed concept of innovation in the responsible innovation literature. As a first step, we raise several questions with regard to the possibility of ‘responsible’ innovation and point at several difficulties which undermine the supposedly responsible character of innovation processes, based on an analysis of the input, throughput and output of innovation processes. It becomes clear that the practical applicability of the concept of responsible innovation is highly problematic and that a more thorough inquiry of the concept is required. As a second step, we analyze the concept of innovation which is self-evidently presupposed in current literature on responsible innovation. It becomes clear that innovation is self-evidently seen as (1) technological innovation, (2) is primarily perceived from an economic perspective, (3) is inherently good and (4) presupposes a symmetry between moral agents and moral addressees. By challenging this narrow and uncritical concept of innovation, we contribute to a second round of theorizing about the concept and provide a research agenda for future research in order to enhance a less naïve concept of responsible innovation.",Blok V.; Lemmens P.,Book,"Responsible Innovation 2: Concepts, Approaches, and Applications",2015-01-01,Radboud Universiteit;Wageningen University & Research,Engineering ethics ;  Innovation management ;  Responsible innovation ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Science and technology studies
Navigating service sector innovation using co-creation partnerships,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse a series of engineering services partnerships to better understand requisites needed in building high value co-creation alliances – especially where innovation is the strategic goal. Design/methodology/approach – Using a combination of quantitative surveys, qualitative “deep-dive” assessments and a small number of in-situ mini-case investigations this research sets out to analyse 99 joint-venture innovation partnerships. These ventures represent a variety of asymmetric and symmetric alliances within the engineering services sector. Particular emphasis is given to those where the prerequisites for co-creative innovation are either in place or could be built. Findings – Partnering and progressing innovative ideas are important behaviours for organisations seeking higher levels of commercial success and competitive advantage. Navigating the partnering dynamic can also be harder than expected, potentially hindered by misunderstandings and differing expectations between enterprises. Particularly for symmetric endeavours, success often hinges upon not only having clarity in the degree of innovation sought but also alignment as to the depth and stage of the partnering dynamic itself. However, when such collaboration works customer satisfaction and associated contract retention can increase significantly. Originality/value – Most inter-company innovation projects historically seem to occur where one firm is significantly larger than the other. In contrast, this study highlights issues encountered when innovation co-creation projects are undertaken by a mature (as opposed to maturing) organisation in collaboration with partners where the power balance is similar between the two enterprises. In such cases, customer satisfaction surveys can be useful tools for objectively navigating the innovation co-creation experience.",Burdon S.; Mooney G.; Al-Kilidar H.,Journal,Journal of Service Theory and Practice,2015-01-01,University of Technology Sydney,Alliance ;  Co-creation ;  Customer satisfaction ;  Innovation ;  Partnering ;  Service
Teachers’ experiences developing an innovative science program: A look at professional growth,"In 2005, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council funded five Centres of Research into Youth Science Teaching and Learning (CRYSTAL) across Canada in response to their concern that few Canadian students were choosing to pursue science careers. Each CRYSTAL had a specific theme. CRYSTAL Atlantique had the theme exploring the culture of science, mathematics, and technology across the Atlantic provinces with an initial focus on informal learning. Science in Action was created to study the impact of an innovative, afterschool science program on elementary and middle school students’ attitudes towards and understandings of science. By innovative, we mean a concept that generates improvement by moving outside of the status quo (Education Innovator-Office of Innovation and Improvement-U.S. Dept. of Education). Fullan (2000) warns that professional development is not innovative if it merely alters some language and structures, but does not alter the practice of teaching. Furthermore, innovation is also “the process of bringing new problem-solving ideas into use” (Amabile, 1988; Glynn, 1996; Kanter, 1983) by including idea development and implementation (West, 2009). Science in Action is innovative in its conception of science, its development and implementation, the nature of its research design and composition of its research team and, most importantly to this paper, the level at which program development and the research process began. The afterschool program portrays science as an enterprise, that is, something a group of people do to study things of interest to them and the ideas they generate as a result of their studies. We treat science as personal, practical, theory building, social, political, and financial. The focus is on understanding the lives and work of the people involved in science rather than merely the ideas they have generated-what is traditionally referred to as knowledge. We want students to understand more comprehensively what a day in the life of a scientist looks like and determine whether they would be interested in pursuing such a career.",Lom E.; Sullenger K.,Book,"New Ground: Pushing the Boundaries of Studying Informal Learning in Science, Mathematics, and Technology",2015-01-01,University of New Brunswick,
Laryngeal framework regeneration,"The laryngeal framework consists of complex tissues including the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, and arytenoid cartilage. This framework contributes to protecting the inner aerodynamic tract from external impact and aids in maximizing vocal fold motion through intra-laryngeal muscular contraction. This structure is affected by malignant tumors, laryngeal trauma, congenital anomalies, stenosis, or intractable inflammatory diseases. Once this rigid structure is damaged, restoration of mechanical power sufficient to compensate for normal laryngeal function is quite difficult. Conventionally, laryngeal defects have been reconstructed with autologous tissues or flaps. These reconstructive surgeries, however, required donor tissue, skilled technique and multiple surgeries. Locoregional blood supply also had to be carefully considered to maintain living donor tissue. Tissue regeneration strategies for the laryngeal framework, therefore, have been sought to alleviate these problems. Recently, tissue engineering has attracted great attention as a means of recreating organs. There are three fundamental components in tissue engineering: Cells, scaffolds, and growth factors. Among these, scaffolds play a central role in laryngeal framework regeneration because great mechanical power is required immediately after surgery to maintain airway structure. In situ tissue engineering techniques, which allow in vivo regeneration of organs through the application of scaffolds, have shown recent advancement due to biomaterial innovations. In this chapter, current progress and limitations of laryngeal framework regeneration will be discussed. To date, intraluminal epithelialization and subepithelial tissue regeneration have achieved some success after laryngeal resection. Research into the next steps, including functional tissue regeneration and development of suitable scaffolds for children, is now warranted.",Yamashita M.; Kitani Y.; Kanemaru S.,Book,Regenerative Medicine in Otolaryngology,2015-01-01,"Shizuoka General Hospital;Tazuke Kofukai, Medical Research Institute, Kitano Hospital",Cartilage ;  Framework ;  Larynx ;  Regeneration ;  Scaffold ;  Tissue engineering
"Designing technology, services and systems for social impact in the developing world: Strong sustainability required","In the post-Bruntland era of sustainable development, design has taken a decided turn towards social impact although shows limited understanding of sustainable development.

Despite its successes, design approaches, however, remain firmly embedded in the mainstream sustainable development (MSD) discourse of market environmentalism, populism and ecological modernization. This has led to short term successes and failures of technology innovation, which a broader and deeper understanding could have helped avoid. Beyond Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and eco-design for sustainability are development demands that question economic, social and environmental common sense, demanding systemic approaches to innovation and policy and governance change for sustainable livelihoods in BoP contexts. Focused on material and object constraints, industrial and product design is intellectually weak in this respect and divorced from actively participating in larger informed debates although new models, such as industrial ecology suggest new possibilities. From end-of-pipe pollution control to deep green ecology, the ladder of sustainable development ideologies position technology innovation relative to human and ecological well-being differently. Taking such an agenda seriously will demand radical change to design curricula to better integrate social impact economics and innovation. This paper proposes that sustainable development and social entrepreneurship and not sustainability and philanthropy should be the framework of choice for design’s theoretical and practical contribution to development in BoP. Contributing to this discussion are outcomes and experiences from a joint IITM (Madras) and Swinburne University (Australia) collaboration.",Melles G.; Kuys B.; Kapoor A.; Rajanayagam J.; Thomas J.; Mahalingam A.,Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2015-01-01,Swinburne University of Technology;Indian Institute of Technology Madras,Education ;  Socially responsible design ;  Sustainable development
Developing a set of human factors barriers for deepwater drilling risk assessment,"Objectives/Scope: Human error and human factors are contributing causes in over 50 percent of well control incidents, according to SINTEF data. While straight-forward cognitive errors and wrong actions contribute to 15 percent of incidents, the larger span of human factors includes communication failures, workload, management practices, and information availability and presentation problems that lead to mistakes, such as imperfect kick detection or underbalanced wells. Yet human factors is often treated as an issue of human reliability estimates and the need to define better procedures that design human error out of the system. There are, however, many shortcomings to the focus on procedures and human reliability estimates, for example, variations among installations, situations that lie outside existing procedures and estimates, and analyses of rote procedure-following that exclude situation variability and expert problem solving. What is needed is a deeper, human factors-centric, approach that looks beneath the procedures for underlying systemic causes: operator situation awareness and decision making, team common ground and collaboration, and resilient socio-technical organizational processes. Our project is taking this human factors approach with a comprehensive analysis of well control during deepwater drilling. Methods, Procedures, Process: Our novel approach is to marry the risk management framework of threats and barriers with the human factors concept of the decision cycle. The decision cycle concept outlines the cognitive steps involved in decision making from detection, to interpretation, deciding, and acting. Our innovation is that these concepts can be brought together to identify a set of 117 ""human factors barriers"" for effective detection of an influx. These human factors barriers support team situation awareness, communication, and decision making. These barriers include the availability and representation of data, user vigilance, support for critical thinking, crew resource management, shift change hand-off processes, system status availability, and change management processes. These human factors barriers can be applied readily to other decisions within well control. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: We have created a database of BSEE/BOEM incident reports and reviewed these incidents against the human factors barriers. We have identified a number of ""hot spots"" or trends where specific human factors barriers were frequently compromised. These trends include sensor placement for situation awareness, shift hand-off processes and team communication, and decision support for critical thinking and diagnosis of uncertain situations. Novel/Additive Information: These human factors barriers and the identified trends can be used a) pre-incident to review and audit drilling rigs and well plans to identify and then avoid potential problems, b) post-incident to investigate and report on incidents from a human factors perspective and thereby better inform the industry concerning these topics, and c) to identify key topics for further research and development of improved systems and processes.",St. John M.,Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2015-01-01,Pacific Science and Engineering Group,

Challenges to construct regional knowledge maps for territories’ sustainable development,"Knowledge management in organizations is a practice progressively implemented during the last decades. Their value is recognized as an asset to generate competitive advantage. This article translates the knowledge management’s potentials to a geographic territory, and explores how to apply to a territory the framework developed by knowledge management discipline to be applied in companies. The main point is how to build regional knowledge maps to satisfy needs expressed by some actors involved in regional policy and innovation in a territory. This work reports a research in progress, whose objective is to define a methodology to efficiently design territorial knowledge maps. It presents the theoretical background offered by other disciplines that could support knowledge management discipline. These disciplines are on the one hand, regional innovation systems and competitive - territorial intelligence, to explore components involved in a territory, and on the other hand text mining to extract information of big volumes of data contained in diverse sources of information related to a region. It shows also the theoretical framework designed to deal with this research, that identify which components should collect a regional knowledge map (structures, actors, infrastructures, resources and social capital), and how to study the contexts where knowledge is created to innovate and contribute to the regional development.

The implementation of new educational technologies as a tool for innovation management,"Social engineering, being innovative educational technology, aims at the development of socially significant mental and physical, moral and intellectual characteristics of graduates. In the article the preconditions and challenges impeding the implementation of social projecting in a modern educational system are formulated, the ways of this problem solving are outlined. The approaches of problem-oriented, object-oriented, subject-oriented nature to social projecting are examined. The state of society requires radical socio - economic and political changes, more and more demonstrates the urgency for the further improving of innovative processes institute management that perform the most difficult task of conscious, purposeful transformation of all forms of public life. Today the need for the professionalization of social engineering subjects is increasing with a great acceleration. The scale of the reforms carrying out in the country, affecting all spheres and levels of life, requires special efforts to focus on the implementation of social and engineering researches and the development of science-based projects, the optimal organizational forms of social relations. This specialization is more and more necessary, since the implementation of design and research are not the same. The development of social projects requires not only specific knowledge, but also a special way of thinking, and thus requires appropriate knowledge and skills, necessary for social engineering.

Current trends in the strategy of innovative development of industries in Russia,"Currently, Russian engineering industry is not competitive on the international market, which is largely due to its technological backwardness of the industrialized countries. One of the main reasons for this situation were shortcomings Existing-available methods of control in the engineering sector of the country, for the modernization which is necessary to accelerate the development and introduction of complex of measures approved international practice during the tse-quire monitoring of industrial policy, innovation policy. Accounting for me-zhdunarodnogo experience will clarify the evaluation indicators of innovational activities and determine the measures necessary for the functioning of the Russian-innovation system. Currently, the industrialized countries see innovation as an essential foundation for competitiveness in the global economy. Every year in these countries increased spending on research and development in various industries. In Russia, however, is still a very low level of expenditure on the development of new products, the development and introduction of new techniques and technologies, which leads to a low-competitiveness of the domestic manufacturing industry.

Management of Knowledge Sources Supported by Domain Ontologies: Building and Construction Case Studys,"This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework to support the creation of knowledge representations based on enriched semantic vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support. This work is focused on collaborative engineering projects where knowledge plays a key role in the process. Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target and knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The test bed for the assessment of the approach comes from the Building and Construction sector, which is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information among actors. Semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical levels, for example, are problems fundamentally originated through the employment of representations to map the 'world' into models in an endeavour to anticipate other actors' views, vocabulary and even motivations. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work relates to the process of formalization and representation of document contents, where most existing approaches are limited and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched through incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (semantic associations) modelled by domain ontologies with the addition of information presented in documents, by providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications. Future work and open issues are also discussed.",Costa R.; Lima C.,Journal,"Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management",2015-01-01,Universidade Federal do Oeste do Pará;Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias,Knowledge sharing ;  Ontology engineering ;  Semantic interoperability ;  Unsupervised document classification ;  Vector space model
Design of a field test for measuring the fracture toughness of sea ice,"Fracture of sea ice plays an important role in determining the ice loads on offshore structures. The importance of incorporating fracture mechanics principles into ice load calculation has long been recognised. However, any method developed based on fracture mechanics demands the knowledge of this rather important parameter, i.e., the fracture toughness of sea ice. There have been controversies about the scale invariant fracture toughness K<inf>IC</inf> of sea ice for over 25 years now, e.g., K<inf>IC</inf> = 115 kPa√m was reported from laboratory measurement while K<inf>IC</inf> = 250 kPa√m was reported from field scale. The size of the test specimen and the loading rate are the two major issues often raised when questioning the validity of a fracture toughness test. In view of such discrepancy in the reported values of fracture toughness, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) hosting the research-based innovation centre (SAMCoT), is making an effort to attack this long-existing problem. Two field tests in Svea at Spitsbergen are planned in the winters of 2015 and 2016. The rationale of the test is rather straightforward, i.e., we shall fracture a large enough ice floe with fast enough loading rate. The test in 2015 is a preparatory campaign for the main testing campaign in 2016. Based on existing fracture mechanics knowledge and precursors' experience with fracture toughness test, this paper describes the design process of the first test campaign with emphasis on the theoretical analysis. Interesting results regarding the size and loading rate requirement are obtained. By this paper, we hope to expose our work at this early stage to discussions, suggestions and criticism from worldwide experts in the field. Based on this test design, the first test campaign shall be carried out between March 20th-27th, 2015, after which we report the test results in a different paper separately.",Lu W.; Løset S.; Shestov A.; Lubbad R.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Port and Ocean Engineering under Arctic Conditions, POAC",2015-01-01,The University Centre in Svalbard;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,

Changing demographics: Preserving safety and increasing performance,"While process plants under development hold promise for innovative technology, movement from analogue to digital control rooms, and the latest in automation features, little attention has been given to the shifting demographics of future operators. This discussion addresses the safety considerations relative to people in systems. It is well-recognized that the need for energy, new and upgraded plants, and operator demographics are of concern worldwide. It is believed that increasing numbers of women as well as ethnic diversity are considerations. These populations impact anthropometric considerations. Moreover, as stated by at least one utility, the pool of operators for tomorrow's plant will come from the brightest and best of the high school students; therefore, at least for them a young demographic. This paper does not address that stance, so the assumption is that there will be a population of young people groomed to staff the plants. The shift in body type and size is an oft-discussed topic of the media. Will the plants and manual operations in the field, or those duties associated with the control room accommodate a young but larger, taller, and likely heavier workforce? The operators of today are aging. Worldwide, the entire workforce is aging. The pool of persons for start-up endeavors is shrinking. The data show that largely the workforce for new and upgraded plants will be the young workers and older workers. For the most part middle-aged workers are not among the likely candidates. The petroleum industry calls this phenomenon the ""big crew change"". The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) in 2005 predicted an ""age crisis on the horizon"" in light of the fact that at that time the average age of SPE members was 45 years old. This paper primarily addresses the concerns and accommodations of an aging workforce. In the process industries new plants and plant upgrades are underway. Additionally, more and more leading edge technology is being embraced. New operations and maintenance philosophies and conduct of operations must accommodate older workers. For operations, this is particularly true of control rooms. For the local plant, maintainers must be considered. It is believed that if older workers are accommodated then all the workers will be accommodated. What is the impact of aging on worker health and safety? Addressing these effects means looking at the physical, psychosocial and cognitive issues related to aging. Society cannot continue to run business as usual. This paper addresses the concerns of a changing and an aging workforce. It is known that human cognitive and physical capabilities change with age. Little research relative to aging has taken place outside of the experimental laboratory environment. The data relevant to operations is scarce. Nonetheless, quite a bit is known about older workers and how to accommodate them. The focus of this paper is on those issues of change and accommodation. Topics such as physical changes, cognitive changes, the impact of shift work, learning and training abilities and technological innovations are discussed. Recommendations are provided relative to how best to design these plants to retain and recruit older workers while recognizing the value of younger workers and ensuring that safety is preserved and the possibilities of human error are eliminated regardless of age, demographic, gender, or ethnic background.",Brooks D.,Conference Proceeding,30th Center for Chemical Process Safety International Conference 2015 - Topical Conference at the 2015 AIChE Spring Meeting and 11th Global Congress on Process Safety,2015-01-01,,Aging workforce ;  Human factors ;  Safety and health aging workers ;  Shifting demographics
Teaching innovation with technology to accelerate engineering students' learning,"The current rapid rise of mobile computing, cloud computing, and social and collaborative learning is transforming education. In particular engineering education has and will continue benefiting from this trend by leading this transformation. To stimulate the innovative use of technology for a better teaching and learning experience, the Educational Technology and Academic Affairs offices have jointly developed and introduced an annual competition to further encourage faculty and technical staff to use the digital technologies in the classrooms. This annual competition provides a collaborative opportunity to prototype and assess the impact of emerging learning technologies and facilitate educational technology innovation. Texas A and M University Qatar campus is one of the six American university campuses established in the Education City, Doha, Qatar. Texas A and M University at Qatar campus currently offers four ABET accredited engineering degrees including Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical, and Petroleum and has proven itself as one of the leading academic institutions in the region. The major trust of Texas A&M University at Qatar is to develop, implement, and assess the most innovative use of digital technology to further assist students learning and to make the primary and supplementary course materials at students' disposal. The educational technology steered by instructional design enables educators to achieve learning objectives and develop interactive, engaging, and personalized learning experience. Educators and instructional designers bear a responsibility to meet the demand for the use of digital technologies in academia for improved learning outcomes. This paper summarizes some of the recent projects utilizing computer and digital technologies to aide engineering students' learnings and reports on achievements observed over the past two years. These projects demonstrate that technology has a positive effect not only on learning, but also on students' motivation, on the classroom atmosphere and on teachers' willingness to experiment with new and innovative instructional approaches. In sum, teaching with technology transforms the entire learning experience.",Alaeddine N.; Parsaei H.; Kakosimos K.; Guo B.; Mansoor B.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Texas A&M University at Qatar,
Exploring the interest and intention of entrepreneurship in engineering alumni,"America's economic growth and international competitiveness significantly depend on its ability to innovate9. Entrepreneurship is an important pathway to innovation and leadership-however, until recently there has been little research exploring what factors influence whether or not engineering graduates will engage in entrepreneurial activities. This study explored how engineering alumni who are interested in starting a business or an organization may be similar to or different from their peers based on a number of measures. We also explored why some engineering alumni who co-founded or started a company in the past may no longer have an entrepreneurial interest. A logistic regression was conducted to explore what variables were the most important in predicting a student's intention and interest in pursuing entrepreneurial activities. Three research questions guided this study: 1. How do engineering alumni with high intentions and high interest in pursuing entrepreneurial activities compare with peers with low entrepreneurial intention and interest in terms of demographics, career-related characteristics, self-confidence and interest in technical concepts and problems? 2. What factors influence alumni's interest in and intention to pursue entrepreneurial activities? 3. For engineering alumni who have been entrepreneurs in the past, what activities led them to either become more entrepreneurially-minded or divert to a non-entrepreneurial career path? The participants in this study were 484 alumni who received their undergraduate engineering degrees in 2007 from four different universities in the United States. Our research aims to help engineering educators understand the factors that promote and contribute to entrepreneurial pursuits among engineering alumni. In addition, by identifying what factors or circumstances influence entrepreneurial activities, engineering schools may design programs and identify potential opportunities for intervention.",Rodriguez J.; Chen H.; Sheppard S.; Leifer L.; Jin Q.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Stanford University,
Building a broadband community with a baldrige based approach,This article makes a contribution by providing a conceptual framework for transforming the innovative use of information technology into business growth by simultaneously solving the combined technology and business problem. A total systems approach is facilitated by deploying the National Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence for evaluating business model improvements while embedding the disruptive use of information technology. See Clayton M. Christensen's pioneering work1. A key finding of this applied research is that by concurrently solving the business and technology innovations far greater financial success can be realized than when the engineering and engineering management functions are treated independently or in series. Leadership and technical leaders from all areas look for innovative technology that can enhance both business units. The business problem was solved using a non linear approach without disrupting the company's day to day operation. The result became two stand alone non linear businesses operating under a joint linear process.,Browder M.; Czuchry A.; Eads A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,East Tennessee State University;Bristol Tennessee Essential Services,
"Making practical experience: Teaching thermodynamics, ethics and sustainable development with PBL at a bioenergy plant","Bioenergy is a renewable energy made available from materials derived from biological sources. Today, it is important for the world and its future as well as for engineering students that are going to work in that field or related ones. At the same time, engineering students, especially chemical engineering students, need to learn about international issues related to energy such as ethics and sustainable development, preferably in a way that is natural to understand and directly related to their field. The aim of this paper is to present the experience of using Problem Based Learning (PBL) for teaching thermodynamics, ethics, and sustainable development by connecting this altogether with the student practical experience at a bioenergy plant. The students visit an energy plant that converts biogas from a landfill into electrical energy. By the time students are doing their PBL, they have to figure out how to improve the process in terms of ethics and sustainable development (biogas production, CO2 emissions, and the liquid waste that the plant produces). This allows the students to have practical experience on some topics such as thermodynamic cycles, measurements of composition at the site plant, knowing actual equipment of pumps, pipelines, and so on. The paper describes the innovative elements added to the PBL teaching strategy in order to connect all these issues. It also presents some of the research results, such as the engagement that is achieved by students, which lead them to the writing and publishing of papers with their own ideas. We are dealing with a new generation of engineers who are used to seeing, touching, and having first-hand experience more than they did ten years ago. They are highly motivated with the things they can see and understand. The results show some of these statements.",Del Carmen Ramirez D.; Ramírez P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Universidad Autónoma Chapingo;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Ethics ;  Innovation in engineering education ;  Making experience practical ;  PBL ;  Sustainable development
Raising interest in STEM education: A research-based learning framework for improving minority participation,"Despite efforts in the past three decades, participation of underrepresented minority groups is still an issue in STEM disciplines. Minority ethnic groups account for approximately 30% of the United States population, but only 9.1% of those working in STEM occupations. In this context, a program between the Community College of Philadelphia and Drexel University to provide research experience to underrepresented minority students (UMS) was implemented based on the hypothesis that learning about science and engineering is more effective if it is paired with the challenge of independent research in a specifically collaborative ""micro-environment"", as for example in active research laboratories. Six undergraduate UMS (three male, three female) were selected from a pool of twenty applicants in the inaugural year. Each student independently selected a faculty advisor and corresponding research group best aligned to their interests within the first two of the ten week program. From the outset, library integration underpinned the program. To this aim, students were personally introduced to key library professionals and digital library search tools and databases were immediately employed to review at least three journal articles relevant to their research foci, which assisted to form the basis for independent research proposals. By week four, students presented research plans before a panel of faculty and student judges. In order to complete the program, each student produced three final deliverables-an oral presentation, a technical poster and a paper describing their work. In addition, students were exposed to STEM research in an application-driven industrial setting through a visit to a private corporation known for its innovation. A final survey and individualized assessments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the program and progress of the individual students, respectively. Students demonstrated familiarity with basic research methods and universally reported increased interest in STEM education and careers, with four continuing to work in their labs beyond the program's formal duration. Beyond the summer research program, the partnership facilitated: (i) tutoring in community college STEM courses by Drexel graduate students, (ii) a STEM career discussion panel, and (iii) a discussion among faculty and staff from both institutions on addressing challenges UMS face in STEM education.",Christe D.; Shah A.; Bhatt J.; Mergenthal M.; Powell L.; Kontsos A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Drexel University College of Engineering;Community College of Philadelphia;Drexel University;Los Alamos National Laboratory Materials Science and Technology Division,
"Research experiences for high school teachers and college instructors in mechatronics, robotics and industrial automation","U.S. manufacturers are seeking highly skilled workers to hire in industrial automation and control jobs. Encouraging active participation of secondary school teachers and two-year college faculty in university research allows them to learn about recent discoveries and innovations, share about them in the classroom, and thereby encourage and stimulate students to pursue engineering and computer science careers such as industrial automation. The paper will describe program activities, research projects, outcomes, and lessons learned from a National Science Foundation-sponsored Research Experiences for Teachers program. Participants were recruited from science, technology, engineering and math departments in high schools and colleges throughout the U.S. Special effort was made to recruit teachers and instructors from districts and two-year colleges with large numbers of underrepresented minority students. Program objectives were to 1) provide opportunities for participants to actively participate in research and then translate their research experiences and new knowledge into classroom activities; 2) establish long-term collaborative relationships with the Mechatronics, Robotics, and Industrial Automation research community at Texas A&M University; and 3) disseminate findings and instructional materials developed for this program.

Perspectives of pedagogical change within a broadcast STEM course,"As calls for pedagogical transformation of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instruction intensify, the pace of change remains slow. The literature shows that research-based instructional strategies transfer only sporadically into STEM instructional practice. Difficulties associated with implementation and sustainment of instructional change may appear daunting - if not insurmountable - to many STEM change agents and teaching faculty. Subsequently, the path towards systematic and lasting pedagogical transformation in post-secondary STEM stands largely uncharted. To understand how challenges faced by STEM educators engaged in pedagogical change may be overcome, this paper uses qualitative inquiry to explore an emergent process of teacher change. The change process took place during implementation of an online innovation within an undergraduate engineering calculus course taught via synchronous broadcast at a mid-size, Western, public university. The instructional innovation required first year calculus students to participate in an asynchronous, online discussion forum for graded credit. Data, consisting of written reflections and transcribed interviews, were gathered from three STEM faculty members who each played a different role in the change process: a mathematics instructor implementing the online forum within his course; an engineering faculty peer-mentor assisting with the implementation of the online forum; and a STEM education faculty member evaluating the implementation and observing the process of change. Situated within the interpretive research paradigm, this study uses exploratory thematic analysis of narrative data to understand the ways in which contextual factors may influence pedagogical change.",Minichiello A.; Campbell T.; Dorward J.; Marx S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,College of Engineering;Utah State University,
Career advancement through academic commercialization: Acknowledging and reducing barriers for women engineering faculty,"Although schools of engineering are increasingly considering patenting, licensing, and commercialization in faculty bids for tenure and promotion, women candidates participate in these activities at disproportionately lower rates than their male counterparts.1-7 As research has shown that inventions by women are frequently designed to address important social problems, addressing the gap in engagement in academic commercialization activities has growing societal relevance.2,8 This gender gap can largely be explained by the significant obstacles that women faculty in engineering face as they advance their careers and as they engage in academic commercialization.9-11 Barriers such as gender discrimination, attitudinal and behavioral factors, work-life balance issues, and exclusion from networks impact the ability of women faculty to continue in the field, engage in academic commercialization, and ultimately advance their careers.3,7,8,12-17 This paper aims to synthesize relevant literature pertaining to impediments to academic commercialization and career advancement for women faculty in engineering and science. The purpose is to not only raise awareness of the likely origins of these issues, but to recommend ways that staff, faculty, departments, and universities can create a more equitable career trajectory for women faculty in engineering and science. Immediate and long term shifts in individual and institutional bias, policy, leadership, and training have the potential to make a significant difference in engineering innovation for social and environmental change.",Turrentine A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,VentureWell,
"Scholarship program initiative via recruitment, innovation, and transformation","The National Science Foundation's funded ($625,179) SPIRIT: Scholarship Program Initiative via Recruitment, Innovation, and Transformation at Western Carolina University creates a new approach to the recruitment, retention, education, and placement of academically talented and financially needy engineering and engineering technology students. Twenty-Seven new and continuing students were recruited into horizontally and vertically integrated cohorts that will be nurtured and developed in a Project Based Learning (PBL) community characterized by extensive faculty mentoring, fundamental and applied undergraduate research, hands-on design projects, and industry engagement. Our horizontal integration method creates sub-cohorts with same-year students from different disciplines (electrical, mechanical, etc.) to work in an environment that reflects how engineers work in the real world. Our vertical integration method enables sub-cohorts from different years to work together on different stages of projects in a PBL setting. The objectives of the SPIRIT program will ensure an interdisciplinary environment that enhances technical competency through learning outcomes that seek to improve critical skills such as intentional learning, problem solving, teamwork, management, interpersonal communications, and leadership. Support for the student scholars participating in this program incorporates several existing support services offered by the host institution and school, including a university product development center. This paper will discuss several aspects of the program including participant selection and initial cohort demographics; implementation of the vertical-based cohort model in PBL; program and student assessment models; and associated student activities and artifact collection used to foster student success in the program and after graduation. Successful implementation of the SPIRIT program will create a replicable model that will broadly impact 21st century engineering education and workforce preparedness.",Ferguson C.; Yanik P.; Chang G.; Kaul S.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Western Carolina University,Engineering ;  Engineering technology ;  NSF scholarship program ;  Project-based learning (PBL)
Stimulating and supporting change in entrepreneurship education: Lessons from institutions on the front lines,"This paper describes Pathways to Innovation (Pathways), a national program that uses a team-based guided change process to help faculty and institutions introduce and embed innovation and entrepreneurship into formal and informal educational experiences for undergraduate engineers. The paper briefly reviews the program design, its research-based foundations, and the sequence of activities for the initial cohort of twelve teams from twelve different schools. Initial results from teams' efforts, some of the ""lessons learned"" from the evaluation of the first year, and the implications of those lessons both for expansion of the program and for engineering education more generally are discussed. Each school's Pathways effort is led by a team1 and the teams themselves are in turn gathered into a national network.2 The schools vary widely in their institutional profile with regard to size, student demographics, governance, initial breadth of entrepreneurship education opportunities for engineering students, and availability of off-campus entrepreneurship opportunities in the surrounding region. Despite these differences, multiple factors were identified over the course of the program year that were associated with success in making entrepreneurship education more available and accessible for undergraduate engineering students. Participating schools implemented strategies that included introducing new courses and programs, developing learning spaces, and creating faculty development activities. Program staff modified elements of Pathways in response to formative evaluation activities, as well as to strengthen specific components associated with team success. The program now includes 37 schools and will continue to expand; while exciting, this growth presents scaling challenges for program staff.",Nilsen E.; Matthew V.; Shartrand A.; Monroe-White T.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,VentureWell;SageFox Consulting Group,
Integrating entrepreneurship into capstone design: An exploration of faculty perceptions and practices,"Incorporating entrepreneurship into the engineering curriculum is compelling for many reasons. Entrepreneurship education has been found to boost GPA and retention rates of engineering students, provides students with the skills and attitudes needed to innovatively contribute to existing organizations and pursue their own ventures, and has the potential to address current and anticipated workforce demands.1-3 Entrepreneurship is taught most effectively using experiential methods.4 Given that Capstone design courses are applied and experiential by nature, they provide an optimal context for integrating entrepreneurship into engineering education. Indeed, Ochs et al.5 illustrated ways to integrate entrepreneurship into Capstone while simultaneously adhering to ABET standards. Shartrand and Weilerstein also identified various practices for incorporating entrepreneurship into Capstone design courses, and identified traditional and entrepreneurial Capstone elements.6 However, it is unclear what Capstone design instructors actually practice in this area. To better understand how and to what degree entrepreneurial elements are integrated into Capstone design classes, 225 Capstone design faculty were surveyed with an instrument designed using the entrepreneurial Capstone practices described by Shartrand and Weilerstein.6 The survey sample included attendees of the bi-annual Capstone Design Conference, VentureWell grantees, Epicenter Pathways to Innovation team members and Pathways referrals. An explanatory multiphase mixed methods design was used involving the collection of quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data illustrate the extent to which faculty incorporate different entrepreneurial practices in their Capstone design courses and how important faculty believe it is to increase different entrepreneurial practices in Capstone design. The qualitative survey data provide additional insight about how faculty incorporate different entrepreneurial practices in their Capstone design courses and the challenges (perceived and actual) to implementing entrepreneurially focused Capstones. These challenges can be summarized into three overarching themes: 1) the Capstone tradition; 2) faculty exposure and experience; and 3) university culture and support. Implications, limitations, and future research are also discussed.",Matthew V.; Monroe-White T.; Turrentine A.; Shartrand A.; Jariwala A.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Georgia Institute of Technology;VentureWell;SageFox Consulting Group,
Innovative confidence: What engineering educators can do and say to graduate more effective innovators and intrapreneurs,"Many innovation leaders recommend attributes, mindsets and behaviors that require high levels of confidence and self-efficacy. As such, innovation rests upon the individual's sense of self and his/her confidence to perform various activities that are essential to innovation. These include creativity, ethnographic research, challenging the status quo, teamwork, making presentations and accepting constructive criticism, most of which are anxiety-producing for students, especially early in their engineering education. However, there is little engineering education research that focuses on the ways in which engineering faculty members might simultaneously develop the competence and the confidence of their students, especially as it relates to these activities, or how they can avoid creating the fear and subsequent insecurity that diminishes student performance of them. This paper first discusses previous research and relevant literature linking confidence and self-efficacy to innovation. It then examines the central activities of innovation and the ways in which student learning activities and faculty members' interactions with students may negatively impact student confidence, and, indirectly, their competence. A pedagogical strategy of ""scaffolding"" is proposed whereby confidence and competence repeatedly build upon each other, building upward in steps of increasing size. Recommendations are provided for ways faculty members can develop a milieu of innovation and apply scaffolding to key tasks of innovation, ethnographic research, creativity/ideation, design reviews and teamwork.",Hanifin L.; Lee R.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,University of Detroit Mercy;Villanova University,
"Creativity, innovation, and ingenuity summer enrichment program - Collaborating with a cultural institution and assessment results","Creativity, innovation, the ability to identify a customer need, and using creative problem solving to develop new ventures/products/solutions are vital skills for entrepreneurship. These are also some of the most highly sought skills by employers of engineering graduates. Thus many engineering colleges are incorporating innovation and creativity into the engineering curriculum, but often the topics are delivered piecemeal over multiple courses, losing focus and continuity. Therefore, Lawrence Technological University in collaboration with The Henry Ford (a nationally renowned cultural, historical, and educational destination in Dearborn, Michigan) developed and administered a week-long summer enrichment program (i.e., summer camp) for undergraduate engineering students focused on progressively building from the foundations of the creative process/competencies to the application of innovative techniques coupled with engineering design and problem solving. The program was available to students of multiple engineering disciplines from across the U.S. Throughout the week, the students explored the core competencies of creativity and innovation through activities and games, and they studied and implemented various methods of creative problem solving through teamwork on various problems and product development projects/tasks. To further emphasize innovation (and its relation to American history), two of the five weekdays were spent visiting The Henry Ford which includes the Henry Ford Museum, Greenfield Village, a Ford F-150 truck assembly plant, and the Benson Ford Research Center where they participated in a college-level version of The Henry Ford's Innovation 101 curriculum. This paper will explain the objectives and format of the program, summarize the benefits of collaborating with a local cultural institution, explain how this program can be transferable to other universities, discuss sustainability of a multi-college summer immersive experience, and present assessment results compiled from three separate camp offerings over three summers. Three unique assessments were performed. The first assessment was a pre- and post-camp survey conducted to determine the students' general perceptions of creativity, problem solving, teamwork, leadership, the role of creativity in engineering, and their personal view on their own creativity. A comparison of the pre- and post-camp surveys yields a positive shift in student perceptions. The second assessment was a survey administered to the students at the conclusion of the week to measure student perceptions of the effectiveness of the program, the delivery techniques, and the format. Based on this student input, these assessment results allowed for the program to be optimized between summers and in fact yielded increasingly positive results from year-to-year. The third assessment was specifically focused on the visit to the cultural institution. The results helped to streamline the connection between the curricula of the University and the cultural institution as well as strengthen the connection between the tour sites and the entire week's curriculum.",Gerhart A.; Carpenter D.; Gangopadhyay P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Lawrence Technological University College of Engineering;The Henry Ford Museum,
NASA's summer of innovation in the rio grande valley: Does summer STEM engagement increase student interest and teacher instruction among under-represented and underserved youth?,"This paper demonstrates the success of the Summer of Innovation program over a four year period and answers the question ""Does summer STEM engagement increase student interest and teacher instruction among underrepresented and underserved youth?"" Summer and after-school programs present a prime venue for fostering student interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) because of their informal atmosphere and their unique ability to inspire and excite children through enrichment experiences and hands-on, project-based group activities. Out-of-school time (OST) activities allow students to connect with STEM on a personal level, which is especially important for students who are underrepresented in these fields and may not have previously felt encouraged to pursue STEM. Summer of Innovation (SoI) was designed to give students an opportunity to engage in OST learning at an early age and during a critical period in the education cycle: summer. While professionals in STEM may attribute their decision to pursue STEM careers to an out-of-school experience, many formal and informal educators do not feel they have the skills and knowledge to successfully engage youth in programs to positively impact STEM learning. In 2009, President Obama announced the ""Educate to Innovate"" campaign to foster a renewed commitment to strengthen Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. In January 2010, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Summer of Innovation (SoI) project in response to the President's call to action. SoI's clearly articulated Vision, Mission, and Objectives are centered on building local educational capacity for supporting STEM education for underserved and underrepresented middle school students. This paper examines the SoI program in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of south Texas and its role in exciting students in engineering education. SoI is geared specifically towards underserved and underrepresented students in grades 4-9 and leverages a multi-faceted, partnership-based implementation approach to maximize the project's scale and research while allowing for local flexibility and innovation. By identifying local needs of schools and providing sustained professional development to certified educators in support of effective content delivery, we increase capabilities of summer programs to provide program models that are viable for replication or scalability of student interventions.",Baguio M.; Fowler W.; Ramirez S.; Ries J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Cockrell School of Engineering;The University of Texas at Austin;PSJA ISD,
Practicing civil engineers' understanding of statics concept inventory questions,"Background: Engineering concept inventories have been broadly used to assess student conceptual knowledge and evaluate the effectiveness of educational innovations. Concept inventory questions were developed to isolate concepts and typically include common misconceptions as possible incorrect answers. Situated cognition theory suggests that knowledge is an interaction between the individual and the context and that isolated concepts may be of limited value in solving engineering design problems. We began to test this proposition by administering the statics concept inventory to practicing civil engineers. Purpose: The purpose of this research is to gather data on practicing civil engineers' performance on the statics concept inventory. Methods: The statics concept inventory, implemented as an online survey, collected responses from practicing engineers with a range of experience from 1 year to 45 years as an engineer. Results: There were 25 participants, all of whom were practicing civil engineers. The average number of years of experience was 11.4 yrs. The participants, on average, answered 13 questions (out of 27 questions) correctly or a score of about 50%. Conclusions: Our results provide insights into professional civil engineers understanding of statics concept inventory concepts. Although the data set is not necessarily indicative of the larger community of professional engineers, it provides early evidence that not all concepts from the statics concept inventory may be relevant for practicing civil engineers. More research is needed to understand how and why academic concepts are important to civil engineering practice.",Urlacher M.; Brown S.; Steif P.; Bornasal F.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,College of Engineering;Carnegie Mellon University,
Facilitating successful global research among Engineering and Technology scholars: The case study of agricultural supply chain,"With the increase in demand for the global research, scholars in engineering and technology discipline do not hesitate in taking up global opportunity for conducting research. Scholars may lack the skill set to work in an international environment and encounter many surprises during field research, directly impacting their productivity. However, prior information regarding climate, work, and traditional culture, etc. will help scholars to acclimatize faster and produce effective results in new environment. Current research utilizes case study method for data collection and data analysis by drawing on experiences of the authors while conducting 18 months field research in Chhattisgarh, India. Where author one and two worked with various government and private sectors investigating the role of technology adoption and innovation in improving the efficiency of agricultural supply chain addressing the issue of global food security. This research highlights the potentials and challenges of conducting research in global setting. Additionally, the authors have developed a model that can be adapted by engineering and technology scholars to conduct research effectively in global environment. Furthermore this paper includes different ways in which international collaborators can be efficiently involved in the project (i) before reaching the field, (ii) during the field research and (iii) once the researcher has left the field. This helps build sustainable relationships between engineering and technology scholars and their international collaborators, which increases the proficient exchange of information, which is linked to positive outcome of the project. Lastly, this research enables the engineering and technology scholar to work with underserved communities globally and address the challenges faced by those in their communities in their day to day living.",Chopra S.; Rajan P.; Laux C.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,College of Engineering;Purdue University,
Not engineering to help but learning to (un)learn: Integrating research and teaching on epistemologies of technology design at the margins,"Locating engineering education projects in sites occupied by marginalized communities and populations serves primarily to reinforce the misapprehension that the inhabitants of such sites are illiterate, inept, incapable and therefore in need of aid or assistance from researchers, faculty and students. Drawing on the emerging literature on engineering education and social justice, I examine the stated objectives, content, duration, and outcomes of exemplar projects to develop a critique of the epistemological and axiological assumptions and privileges of educators, scholars and students who engage with communities that exist on the margins. I argue that as students, teachers, and researchers, we equate the minds of those who occupy economic and social margins with the possession of marginal intellect when we set out to help or aid them without recognizing the validity of and valorizing their ways of knowing. Learning how members of socially and economically marginalized communities apply their minds, mouths, hands and feet to solve locally occurring problems may help us interrogate our scholarly, pedagogical, and ethical objectives in a more reflexive manner. Drawing on ethnographic research and writing carried out across 11 months across 25 rural, semi-urban, and urban communities in India and the United States, I demonstrate how we may begin to recognize and relinquish our positions of privilege by observing local epistemologies of technology design while apprenticing the otherwise marginalized as they go about solving everyday problems. Such local epistemologies are articulated through knowledge practices that are communicative, relational and situated in local social and material contexts. I contend that our task is to learn from those who we otherwise imagine as being in need of the knowledge, skills and expertise located in academe. I employed a combination of open-ended interviews, guided conversations, and participant-observation of individual artisans, farmers, entrepreneurs, and their family members, friends and local collaborators to learn about the ways in which those who lack access to formal education or formal institutional support have developed novel, affordable technological solutions for problems in their local communities. My analysis suggests that individuals who develop technological innovations at the margins are motivated by a perceived responsibility toward their local communities. Such grassroots innovators articulate this perceived responsibility by remaining sanguine about the imitation of their designs by others. Their openness in sharing design-related knowledge is associated with the adoption of an empathic design process in which innovators leverage their social and material embeddedness in local communities to observe and reflect on users' technology-related behavior in naturalistic settings. Grassroots innovators engage with human needs in specific geographical, economic, social, and cultural contexts and embody the potential for knowledge-rich, resource-poor communities to develop successful indigenous solutions to local problems. Grassroots innovations represent a community-based and user-driven model of technology design based on empathy, sustainability and social responsibility that problematize rational, economic models of competitive innovation for profit that are prevalent in the literature and industry. Finally, I outline my efforts over the past two years to incorporate these findings into the syllabi and classes I teach to engineering majors studying a required course technical communication. This report of my pedagogical efforts is provided so that colleagues who share an interest in social justice may critique and improve my efforts at achieving coherent and sustainable pedagogical translations of my research on technology design at the grassroots. As engineering education scholarship develops its transnational agenda, I also offer this research design, my findings, and pedagogical efforts as points of entry for scholars and educators to reconfigure the relationship between teachers, learners, and the contexts in which their interactions are situated.",Rajan P.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Iowa State University,
On-ramping to academia: Women's experiences of transitioning from nonaca-demic to academic careers,"In 2008, the University of Washington's ADVANCE Center for Institutional Change received a National Science Foundation (NSF) ADVANCE Partnerships for Adaptation, Innovation, and Dissemination grant called ""On-Ramps into Academia."" (http://www.engr.washington.edu/onramp/) The goal of On-Ramps into Academia was to increase the pool of women faculty available to all universities by providing professional development to PhD-level women in industry or research laboratories who wished to transition into faculty positions. Unlike the more traditional strategy of institutions recruiting female faculty from other universities to increase the number of female faculty in science and engineering departments, this strategy increases the number of female faculty nationally. On-Ramps is a new approach to faculty recruitment. PhDs in science and engineering can leverage their nonacademic skills and experiences into successful careers as faculty members. Interviews with On-Ramps into Academia workshop participants revealed three core barriers that can influence the viability of transitioning to academia, particularly for women. We also discovered that the new career also has major rewards for those who make the transition. We next describe the On-Ramps workshops and discuss the challenges and benefits of on-ramping.",Carrigan C.; Riskin E.; O'Leary K.; Yen J.; Mody-Pan P.; O'Donnell M.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,"University of Washington;California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo",
Closing the gap between physics and calculus: Use of models in an integrated course,"This study focuses on bridging the gap between physics and mathematics by teaching an integrated first-year college course of physics and mathematics using Modeling Instruction (MI) and models and modeling perspective. This innovation involves redesigning the course's content, combining teaching strategies, reshaping the classroom setting, and using technology. In this study 37 first-year engineering students were enrolled in the integrated course. The research questions were: What elements of the physical and mathematical models do students use when solving a complex real problem? How does the consistency of students' model lead to a robust understanding of the problem? To answer these questions, students worked collaboratively on a project that involved the analysis of an extreme bungee jump. The performance of the students in this project revealed: a) students' integration of physical and mathematical models, b) different representations used in the solution and c) robustness of students' models. As conclusions we can state that as the students constructed more robust models, these were more helpful in their problem solving. Participating students constructed physical models that led them to mathematical models that required numerical methods. The use of numerical methods with technology as an aid in solving complex problems is part of the natural integration of physics, math and technology. Final presentations in a poster fair format provided students with the space and environment to present and share the models they constructed. Students were required to show their work and process to arrive to such solution to their peers. More importantly, the final project offered students the opportunity to realize how empowered they were in solving complex and non-familiar problems.",Dominguez A.; De La Garza Becerra J.,Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2015-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,
Exploring what we don't know about entrepreneurship education for engineers,"What do we still need to learn about entrepreneurship education for engineers? Who better to answer this question than a group of engineering educators, educational researchers, practicing entrepreneurs and innovators, and engineering students? Such a group was convened in August 2014 to examine and reflect on current knowledge of students' entrepreneurial development and pathways, entrepreneurship programming models, and the efficacy of various curricular approaches. The event, known as the Epicenter Research Summit, was held at Stanford University and co-hosted by scholars at three universities; 70 attendees from 29 different institutions and organizations contributed to panel and poster sessions over two days. These sessions and the continuous dialogue, along with a series of individual and group exercises, allowed this community to identify gaps in knowledge about educational environments and pedagogies that support engineering students in becoming creative, innovative and entrepreneurial thinkers. Findings from the interactive exercises led to the identification of three major research areas for future work: Linking Outcomes to Reform, Understanding Student Diversity, and Examining Contexts. Each of these areas includes a wide range of questions that could be collaboratively pursued in the coming years to direct the course of entrepreneurship and innovation education in engineering.

Physical model simulation 1:20 in geometric scale have been performed under regular wave conditions to simulate six types of structure model where differ in slope and height of free-board. The results showed an over-topping discharge (q) is significantly influenced by the parameters of the breakwater free-board relative to the wave height (Rc/Hi), the slope of the structure (tan α) and wave steepness (Hi/Lo). The result of over-topping discharge (q) equation was found smaller than the Van der Meer result in the breaker parameter (zp) less than 2, while in the zp higher than 2, the rate of q is much larger than the Van der Meer rate.

The moderating role of social networks within the radical innovation process: A multidimensionality of human capital-based analysis,"Knowledge, or intellectual capital, and innovation continue to be key areas subject to rapid change in the current environment. The complexity of the relationship between knowledge and innovation leads to the in-depth study of more specific linkages. Intellectual capital is divided into human, organisational and social capital. This paper attempts to provide empirical evidence relating to the relationship between human capital and radical innovation, along with social networks. Using data collected via a questionnaire, our hypotheses were tested empirically in a sample of 251 Spanish technology-intensive manufacturing firms. The paper provides new, empirically-based insights into the study of radical innovation by adopting a research framework which is built upon the intellectual capital-based view of the firm, based on the multidimensionality of human capital.

CMtrain - Remote training in coordinate metrology,"The authors will share new developments on an educational and training concept with a blended learning approach that takes account of the economical, technical and pedagogical vectors and which includes certification. The concept has been developed for coordinate metrology as a discipline with an important contribution to innovation related to modern manufacturing and its impact in national's economies. In this implementation, a combination of face-to-face training and practical experience is used as well as online learning for theory transfer using Internet's possibilities. This approach can be used to support certificated education and lifelong learning, largely independent on the learner's geographical location and the infrastructures available. This work has been developed according to the case study approach methodology and grounded on the eLearning tutorial model designed for ""CMTrain Training for Coordinate Metrology"". This is a certified education, with three levels that are oriented to several personal profiles such as manufacturing companies staff, research and development professionals as well as university students at different levels, focused on experiencing engineering and promoting a formal self-learning in a flexible way, using different media channels to achieve the contents and interact with the tutors. The paper will be grounded on the collaboration's experience of the Interstate University of Applied Sciences of Technology (NTB) and the Technological Centre for the Metal Working Industry (CATIM). Based on this experience as well on the feedback from participants, the further procedure for development of the training concept is discussed. New developments of the learning concept are pointed out with innovative ideas such as the use of new media channels for the distribution of learning and the use of new ways to present the learning material in a user-centred way. To do so, the needs of the participants using the approach of mobile learning were discussed.

An online game-based learning system for STEM knowledge and role models - The masters of STEM project,"The Masters of STEM project seeks to excite young people about the positive impact of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) research and innovation, both throughout history and in the current day, and to introduce and reinforce positive role models from the STEM community. The purpose is to promote broader knowledge of STEM and the impact it has had on society, and to encourage more young people to undertake higher education and follow careers in STEM. The project already has partners in Europe, USA and Brazil, and continues to grow the partnership and funding base. At the core of the project is the development and deployment of an online game platform, supporting users playing short game scenarios developed by the project, and allowing them to develop their own scenarios utilising characters developed by the project to represent the role models we identify, the Masters of STEM. The game platform will support multi-lingual versioning, and role models will be identified and characterised for the scenarios at both global and local level. Rules and constraints will be applied at character level to ensure the scenarios developed by users are within acceptable limits of behaviour and activity. A number of types of scenarios will be developed, offering interest and engagement for users of all ages, from infant to adult, and this will permit the development of a user community generating their own content for the platform. The project will disseminate these outcomes widely throughout the world, particularly through the schools networks. To achieve this, websites will be developed by the project partners providing localised information on STEM activities, careers and opportunities in different regions. This will permit the development of region-specific linguistic and cultural representation of information, and identification of role models, both real and media-generated. Information on these role models will feed through to the game platform, which will be linked to these websites to provide both general and region-specific scenarios. The project partners will also use online surveys to capture information on young peoples attitudes towards STEM, positive views on characters from the STEM community, and interest in games. Initial work on the games platform has already begun, based on the Unity games engine and existing work on the scenario-authoring tool from the Pandora+ platform. Contact has been established with a number of media groups to ascertain the potential to use media characters as STEM role models, e.g. Big Bang Theory & CSI characters, and, where possible, real individuals will be approached to give their permission for their images and stories to be used in the system. Historical characters should not require such permissions, but the project will ensure that all characters are treated with respect, and the system will not permit inappropriate scenarios to be generated. User evaluation of the system will be sought continuously through feedback surveys, frequency of use measures, and user ratings. Impact measures will be established by agreement with the wider community.",MacKinnon L.; Graven O.; Bacon L.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning, ICEL",2015-01-01,University of South-Eastern Norway;University of Greenwich,Automated game generation ;  Game based learning ;  Online scenario authoring ;  STEM role models ;  STEM student recruitment
Understanding the adoption of a student response system from an integrated approach,"The purpose of this study is to explore teacher usage and student attitude on student response system with emphasis on integration of information and communication technology (ICT) with pedagogy and subject content. Most research explains the intentions to adopt new information technologies in higher education settings with the vocabulary of technology acceptance, such as ease of use and usefulness of an innovation (Davis, 1989; Marchewka and Kostiwa, 2014; Lin, Lu and Liu, 2013), but not many employ an integrated approach incorporating other important parameters of education. This study investigates the relationships among technological-pedagogical-content knowledge (TPACK) (Mishra & Koehler, 2006; Koehler & Mishra, 2009), teacher usage and student attitude on SRS. TPACK, a term first coined by Mishra and Koehler (2006), is a framework underscoring the interaction of technology, pedagogy and content knowledge in education. Previous study demonstrated there is a significant difference between technological-pedagogical knowledge competencies and usage level of ICT (Yurdakul, 2011). Adopting the TPACK framework, the current study determines the parameters of technologicalpedagogical- content knowledge that contribute to the successful integration of SRS in tertiary education. The participants of the current study consist of 18 teachers and 553 students from various disciplines at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The 34 items on competencies of technological-pedagogical-content knowledge were adapted from the TPACK survey developed by Schmidt et al. (2009). Teacher usage on SRS were obtained from the session files of SRS implementation, whereas student behavioral intention on using SRS were collected and summarized from the self-report student survey launched on the Learning Management System (LMS). Pearson's correlation analysis reveals that technological knowledge was positively correlated with the actual usage of SRS. Teachers who were more competent in technology adopted SRS more frequently in their classes. Furthermore, findings supported the hypothesis on the associations among technologicalpedagogical- content knowledge and student attitude of using SRS. Results of the independent sample t-test suggested that students in classes of teachers with high levels of technological-pedagogical-content knowledge would like to use SRS more. Findings in the current study suggested that to promote SRS in university settings, besides enhancing technological knowledge of teachers, various aspects of technological-pedagogical-content knowledge need to be determined. The competencies of integrating technology, pedagogy and subject contents are all important components for the successful implementation of SRS in university.",Cheung G.; Chan K.; Wan K.; Ng O.,Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning, ICEL",2015-01-01,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Clickers ;  Hong Kong ;  Student response system ;  TAM ;  Technology in education ;  TPACK
Based on low-carbon environment electric industry development ideas,"In the twenty-first century, climate changes and energy issues have been plaguing mankind. Reducing fossil energy consumption, CO2 emissions and developing alternative sources are key elements in tackling climates and energy issues. Of all proven Chinese energy reserves, coal accounted for 94%, oil accounted for 5.4%, and natural gas accounted for 0.6%, the decision of Chinese energy structure dominated by coal, dependence up to 80%. Meanwhile, China has been ranked one of the two largest countries in the world with the largest CO2 emissions, facing enormous pressure to sustainable development and energy security, as well as emission reduction pressure from the international community. Thus, this requires a change in the power structure, in order to achieve the development of low carbon economic development goals. The concept of low carbon development in order to improve the energy efficiency, clean energy development as the core, mechanism of transformation of the mode of development and the innovation development as the key, with economic and social sustainable development as the goal, is the strategic orientation of Chinese economic and social development in the future. Lowcarbon development means lowenergy consumption, low pollution and low emissions based on the “three low” economic model. In essence, low carbon development means efficient use of energy, clean energy development and enhancing the integration of green GDP, and has at its core the energy technology innovation, emissions reduction technology innovation and industrial structure adjustment and institution innovation. It will be a national core competitive ability and the comprehensive national strength important symbol that whether low carbon development mode can achieve. Low carbon development helps implement the scientific concept of development, alleviat environmental constraints in the development of resources, and is conducive to grabbing low carbon technology as representatives of emerging competitive industries.",Li N.; Zhu Y.; Tian S.,Conference Proceeding,"Electronics, Information Technology and Intellectualization - International Conference on Electronics, InformationTechnology and Intellectualization, EITI 2014",2015-01-01,North China Electric Power University (Baoding);Henan Engineering Consulting Centre 3rd Department,Energy issues ;  Green GDP ;  Low carbon
Zero defect manufacturing: Detection of cracks and thinning of material during deep drawing processes,"The progressive automation and consistent rationalization in production of automotive components requires the use of new sheet materials as well as innovations in press and tool technologies. Sheet metal forming is getting more and more complex. Thus several structural defects like thinning, cracks and creases as well as geometrical imprecisions due to spring back may occur. At the same time, consumer demands are rising concerning product quality and value for money. Therefore optimized processes and efficient methods of quality control are required. As the main objective a 100%-in-process quality control throughout the process chain is demanded in press shops. The aim of the experiments presented here was to detect structural faults in formed body components. Thinning is often considered a failure criterion in the metal forming industry. At high-strained parts even cracks may develop as a result of excessive structural thinning. Especially in advancement of high-strength steels, edge cracking may be a significant failure mode in many sheet metal stamping processes. Furthermore research activities were focused on the quality of formed threads: their presence and accurate shape. Inline measurements by the help of electromagnetic and micromagnetic NDE techniques offer the opportunity for online measurements of physical parameters while feeding acquired data into calibrated regression models. Therefore changes in mechanical material characteristics can be predicted for ferromagnetic magnetorestrictive materials and failures can be discovered. Eddy current testing in conjunction with multivariate analysis methods have been used for quality control on formed body components. The method proved to be suitable to discover cracks and, in some cases, thinning. The results show a significant correlation between eddy current signals and critical amounts of thinning. Future research may investigate how to develop these testing methods for inline control.",Zoesch A.; Wiener T.; Kuhl M.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2015-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU;Imq-Ingenieurbetrieb GmbH,"In-process Measurement ;  Non Destructive Testing ;  Quality assurance ;  Sheet metal,Deep Drawing Process"
The essential federal role in highway research and innovation,"Highways are the arteries of the U.S. economy and society. Each year, motor vehicles travel nearly 3 trillion miles on these roads, enough for more than half a million trips from the earth to the moon and back. Travel on the nation's nearly 9 million lane miles of roads accounts for 86 percent of all person trips and more than 75 percent of the value of goods shipped by all modes. For all its success, the highway system is under great strain. This vast and aging asset, valued at nearly $2.8 trillion, is not keeping pace with demand as bridges and roadways deteriorate, roads become increasingly congested, and more than 30,000 lives-90 percent of the nation's transportation fatalities-are lost each year. Moreover, the funds available to federal, state, and local governments responsible for roads fall far short of what is needed to maintain the system, much less to expand it to meet the needs of a growing population and an increasingly globally connected economy. The user fees that provide for most highway investment continue to decline in real terms because of improved vehicle fuel economy and resistance to increases in these fees, even to account for the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. This situation portends a future of continued constrained resources. Innovation can help bridge the gap between available resources and the actions needed to maintain the performance of the highway system, but public agencies often hesitate to introduce new technologies and processes that involve risk and uncertainty. Barriers to innovation can be overcome, but not without significant time and effort. In this context, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has an essential role in fostering national deployment of innovations based on its own research and development and that of other highway research programs. The agency is also critical in the nation's highway research, development, and technology (RD&T) transfer through its investment in long-term, high-risk research and through the filling of gaps not covered in state department of transportation and other federal highway-related research programs. Examples of past successful innovations described in the report have reduced the time needed to deliver highway improvements, increased throughput, and improved safety, while reducing costs. These innovations have been developed with limited funding, with a level of federal funding for highway-specific research that is a mere fraction-only one-third of 1 percent-of the annual cost of maintaining the nation's highways. FHWA's RD&T role in the future will be critical in two other particularly important ways. First, the nation may soon realize profound improvement in safety through the connected vehicle initiative under development by government and industry. FHWA is the lead federal agency in developing and deploying safety applications to provide safety messages between infrastructure and vehicles. The safety alerts to motorists will depend on FHWA leadership in applying national standards to the variety of traffic signaling systems in use around the country. Second, FHWA is poised to work with states and local governments in deploying the innovations developed through the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2), a congressionally authorized 9-year, $223 million federal-state investment. SHRP 2 has developed dozens of innovations to renew aging infrastructure more quickly and cost-effectively, improve the reliability of travel time, provide capacity consistent with environmental protection, and improve safety. The benefits of this significant investment will be delayed or lost if FHWA's central role in fostering deployment is not continued. In the committee's judgment, reductions in FHWA's human and financial resources for RDS&T will hamper the agency's ability to continue to fulfill its essential roles and responsibilities. Other participants in national highway RD&T are unlikely to fill any void that is created. If substantial reductions do occur, the pace of innovation on the nation's highways will likely slow to a crawl at a time when public expectations for improved safety and greater reliability, as well as reduced revenues for maintenance and upkeep, are placing growing demands on the national highway system. The nation needs to ensure that FHWA has the resources to carry out its essential role in RD&T. FHWA has the national perspective, leadership, and ability to carry out these responsibilities to the benefit of the nation, now and in the future.",Meyer M.; Chesnik K.; Dixon K.; Gillette P.; Henkel T.; Kittelson W.; Morris M.; Paul H.; Roessner J.; Sack R.; Sinha K.; Wiggins S.; Winford J.; Godwin S.; Wilson J.,Journal,Transportation Research Board - Special Report,2015-01-01,"Applied Research Associates Incorporated;Texas A and M University System;New York State Department of Transportation;Louisiana Transportation Research Center;Purdue University;Minnesota Department of Transportation;SRI International;Colorado Motor Carriers Association;Prairie Contractors, Inc.;Modern Transport Solutions, LLC;Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority;North Central Texas Council of Governments;Kittelson and Associates, Incorporated",

Conceptualizing interactions between innovation characteristics and organizational members' readiness to adopt educational innovations,"Although substantial funding has been expended to develop new educational innovations, especially in engineering, few have found widespread acceptance in the classroom. Little is known regarding the interactions among the variables that influence successful dissemination and adoption. This research proposes a framework to show the interactions between innovation characteristics and the readiness of an educational organizations' faculty members, administration, and students to become aware, intend to adopt, adopt, and use educational innovations. One hundred eighty seven engineering education papers published during 2007-2012 were analyzed to identify the characteristics of educational innovations that influence their eventual dissemination. The researchers analyzed a sample of these articles (37) and synthesized the results to develop a framework. Interrater reliability among the researchers was 0.86. The proposed framework describes the interaction between characteristics of an educational innovation and an organizations' readiness to disseminate and adopt an innovation. The framework is then illustrated with examples. This framework provides a mechanism to link the outcomes, interventions, and context where the outcomes are the successful dissemination and adoption of educational innovations, the interventions are the characteristics of the innovation, and the context is the organizational readiness (readiness of faculty members, administrators, and students to adopt the innovation). For widespread dissemination and adoption to occur, educational innovators must incorporate positive characteristics in the innovations and implement them in organizations that are ready for such change.",Bourrie D.; Sankar C.; Jones-Farmer L.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2015-01-01,School of Computing;Raymond J.

Future of civil engineering materials: A review from recent developments,"The aim of this research paper is to address the futuristic construction materials. Relevant data of the developments made during the recent past are also presented. It is believed that nanotechnology is going to play an important role in the development of futuristic building materials. The innovations could be two-fold; one is the modification of classical materials and the other should cover the invention of novel materials. The primary goal of all such materials should be environment friendliness. Secondarily, they should be durable and cost effective. Thirdly, they should address the space shortage. Innovations are needed as man is also planning to colonize moon and other planets. Fourthly, they should have adequate strength to cater the natural and manmade calamities. In short, they should serve the coming generations in the best possible way, which is the sole purpose of an engineering discipline.",Khitab A.; Anwar W.; Mansouri I.; Tariq M.; Mehmood I.,Journal,Reviews on Advanced Materials Science,2015-01-01,Mirpur University of Science and Technology;Birjand University of Technology,
Advances in cotton harvesting technology: A review and implications for the John Deere round baler cotton picker,"To address the progressive increase in farmed land and the decline in labor, cotton production in more developed agricultural systems has seen a movement towards larger, heavier machinery with increased capacity. Recent innovation of on-board module building technology for cotton harvesters follows this trend, which has caused concern for the potential impact of the machine on the farming system. This review acknowledges past and present developments within the cotton harvesting system from both the machine- and soil-management perspectives to inform land managers, machinery manufacturers, technical advisors, and the scientific community of the incidence of soil compaction associated with technology uptake in cotton-based systems. Emphasis is made on the need to ensure that the effects of traffic-induced soil compaction are minimized. For this, the feasibility of confining compaction to the least possible area of permanent traffic lanes is examined along with engineering design constraints of commercially available cotton pickers. Fundamental information is elicited, which provided insights as to why this movement has occurred and how associated problems might be addressed. Within the Australia context, these cotton harvesters have undergone rapid adoption. This review uses this case-study to elucidate direct and latent impacts of the machine to help identify risks and develop management strategies as further technology is developed and adopted. Knowledge gaps that merit a research priority within soil compaction work for cotton-based systems are presented and a synthesis of how to proceed conceptualized.",Bennett J.; Woodhouse N.; Keller T.; Jensen T.; Antille D.,Journal,Journal of Cotton Science,2015-01-01,Forschungsanstalt Agroscope Reckenholz-Tanikon;Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet;Centre for Agricultural Engineering,
Innovation-based processes of integrated and high-level processing of natural and technogenic minerals,"The state-of-the-art of mineral mining and metallurgy industry in Russia is characterized by high demand of nonferrous, rare and rare earth metals and highgrade coal, on the one hand, and by involvement of natural and technogenic minerals with low content of valuable components, fine (nearly emulsion) dissemination of valuable components and close physicochemical and process properties. This calls for high-productive and ecology-friendly technologies for more efficient mineral beneficiation based on intensification of operating and new methods to extract valuable components from rebellious ore and technogenic minerals, relying on the last achievements of basic sciences, combination of dressing and chemico-metallurgical processes and using advanced pyro- and hydrometallurgical technologies. The transition to a new strategy of processing is only possible based on the new technological-mineralogical appraisal of a mineral raw material. Actually, the process mineralogy has a stock of modern high-resolution physical methods for analyzing composition, structure and properties of geomaterials, inclusive of micro- and nano-levels: - Identification of micro- and nano-size noble metals, and natural and induced formations on mineral surface; - Experimental validation of structural phase and chemical transformation of minerals under different energy input; - Justification of choice and mechanism of interaction between flotation agents and noble metals with complex material constitution; - Analysis of structural, phase and chemical transformations of sulfides and rocks under leaching. Thus, process mineralogy is an informational background for a unified theoretical approach to scientific justification of flowsheets of efficient mineral processing. The article gives a brief review of practices that have found application and proved to be of high economic efficiency. Such practices are: X-ray radiometry and photometry separation (Uchalinsky and Gaisky Mining and Processing Integrated Works of ALROSA); selective disintegration (equipment engineered by Mekhanobr-Tekhnika and IPKON RAS); process selectivity enhancement (IPKON RAS, Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Chinakal Institute of Mining, Siberian Branch RAS, etc.); bacterial gold leaching (Olimpiada MPIW, technologies developed the Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Nezhdaninsky deposit projects, etc.); combination processing at a mining and metallurgy plant (Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Company, Yaregsky deposit projects and others); processing of waste: overburden, mill tailings, slag, etc. (Kovdorsky MPIW, Svyatogor JSC, Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, plants designed by the Central Research Institute for Geological Exploration of Nonferrous and Noble Metals, Mining Institute of Kola Science Center RAS, Research Institute for Chemical Technologies); water conditioning in mineral dressing circuits (ALROSA, equipment by IPKON, etc.); utilization of process water (ALROSA, Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, Severalmaz JSC and others). Thus, Russia this time has the academic and engineering background for development of efficient energy-saving technologies for comprehensive advanced processing in accordance with the world's standards, or even higher in terms of a number of the technologies, which has continually been highlighted by participants of recent international congresses on mineral processing. Full implementation of the technologies in mines and at processing plants in Russia will allow enhancement of metal recovery by 10-15%, worldwide competitive high-quality production, reduced energy consumption, 2-3 times higher labor efficiency, processing of low-grade ore and mining waste, compensation of shortage of some metals (manganese, rare metals, rare earth metals) as well as dramatic improvement of ecological situation in mining regions.

Deep energy savings in existing buildings,"This report describes nine existing buildings that underwent deep efficiency projects, including building characteristics, efficiency measures, motivations, money, measured energy performance, market and tenant outcomes, and barriers and innovations. These buildings are all low energy compared to other buildings of their kind; seven of the nine save 50% more energy than the national average, according to the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and have an average energy use intensity (EUI) of just 39 kBtu/ft2/yr (0.44 GJ/m2/yr) (EIA 2003). Project details such as building characteristics, energy efficiency measures, business cases, and retrofit process notes are compared. The projects in this study are all offices, including three designated as historic buildings, with occupied floor space from 8,000-394,000 ft2 (700-36,000 m2). Building ownership and occupancy falls evenly into three categories: (1) private investor-leased property, (2) nonprofit, and (3) firms in architecture or construction focused on green business. Eight of the nine projects included energy efficiency as part of a renovation when significant changes to the structure and/or use involved major construction. This optimized the opportunity for deeper savings. For firms involved in design, engineering, or consulting, showing leadership and experience in areas of effective green approaches and emerging technologies is a necessary part of doing business. In economic terms, the nonprofits gained funding based on being exemplary in their missions; the firms gained clients or expanded the scope of client projects based on demonstrating best practices. The investor property owners stated that tenant volume, rates, and terms were improved, and costs reduced, through their efficiency investments. Owners faced barriers and challenges similar to those seen in most construction projects, frequently citing costs and historical constraints. Lessons learned from individual projects and as a result of this overall research effort are shared in an effort to improve future deep energy-efficiency retrofits in existing buildings.",Miller A.; Higgins C.,Conference Proceeding,ASHRAE Transactions,2015-01-01,New Buildings Institute,

The digital oil field hype curve: A current assessment the oil and gas industry's digital oil field program,"Objectives/Scope:: Cambridge Energy Research Associates came out with their 'Digital Oil Field of the Future' study in 2002. A lot has happened over the last ten plus years, some of it very impressive, some of it not. This seems like a good time to assess where the industry is at and where is it headed with their Digital Oil Field/Integrated Operations (DOF/IO) investments. The assessment of progress for DOF/IO programs are given in the backdrop of Gartner's familiar Emerging Technology Hype Curve. Methods, Procedures and Process:: The challenge is to figure out how to get more value from your Digital Oil Field investment. In each petroleum engineering and earth science discipline there are a number of significant opportunities including: drilling (monitoring of real-time drilling status, geo-steering and the prediction and mitigation of unplanned events, especially well control); completions (analysis of hydraulic fracturing operations, including microseismic and multi-stage fracturing); operations and maintenance (equipment health, well integrity, reliability analytics, and tank monitoring); production engineering (surveillance of oil, gas and water production, and virtual metering) and reservoir engineering (real-time reservoir management). Results, Observations, and Conclusions:: But barriers to adoption of DOF/IO solutions do exist. They include: 1) the ""Integration challenge"", 2) the ""Innovation challenge"", 3) the ""Complexity challenge"", 4) the ""Data Foundation challenge"", and 5) the ""Knowledge Exchange challenge"". Here are a few observations: 1) the trend of field automation, real-time systems and earth & reservoir modeling suggests that the Digital Oil Field has become a reality, 2) new engineers and earth scientists are entering the workforce with high digital literacy from lifelong experiences with consumer IT and with some training in programming from graduate school, 3) more 'intellectual property' from petroleum engineering and earth science comes in the form of software, but 4) significant gaps continue to surface (lack of reuse, fragile integration, poor data foundation, lack of end-to-end system design, unclear support). The ultimate goal of the Digital Oil Field is to make better, faster decisions but to that end, the focus is on analytics, and in order to support analytics, you need to have a strong data foundation. Novel/Additive Information:: Looking back on nearly a dozen years of activities by operators, service and technology companies can provide insight for future investments. The Digital Oil Field has been one of those initiatives that many in the industry have, at one time or another, considered or actually worked on the development and implementation of specific solutions. Some companies can take a look at the vision of the Digital Oil Field and conclude that they are not too far away, and they would be right. Other companies will view that same vision with skepticism and conclude it is too expensive, too risky, too much change to their current operations, and they would also be right.

Define value: Applying the first lean principle to product development,"Researchers and practitioners have proposed that the application of lean thinking to product development (PD) and indeed systems engineering will bring much benefit. The first step in any application of lean thinking is to define value.

"""design for automated assembly of large and complex products: Experiences from a marine company operating in Norway""","To compete in today's global market companies must continuously improve their products and manufacturing processes. During the past several years, many Norwegian-based companies have outsourced production due to the high operational cost level. The trend is that only the production of complex, knowledge-based products which require advanced engineering, strict quality requirements and high degree of customization remains in Norway. Even for this type of products, more cost-effective product realization methods need to be established in order to strengthen overall competitiveness long term. This paper presents results from an ongoing case study done in a global marine company with operations in Norway, seeking to increase competitive advantage by improving capabilities in automation solutions for manufacturing-despite the fact that the production of large and complex products is usually regarded as particularly difficult to automate in an economical way. This paper aims to research the multifaceted challenge of moving from a manual to an automated assembly process for this type of products when this endeavor involves transferring technology from the early premature phase to full industrial implementation in parallel with the product development process. The results presented in this paper are preliminary as the technology development project is still ongoing. One of the early findings indicates that by re-designing large and complex products for handling with standard robots, the case company was able to automate assembly of its products. Furthermore, having a dedicated team enabled delivering a demonstrator after only two years by applying an Open Innovation approach, pulling knowledge from external experts in automation and iteratively integrating this with own organizational capabilities including technology platform, manufacturing strategy, design for manufacturing/assembly and integrated product and process development.",Synnes E.; Welo T.,Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2015-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Industrialization ;  Integrated Product and Process Development ;  Organizational Capabilities ;  Systems Engineering ;  Technology Project

Sociotechnical systems (STS) coordination of virtual innovation work,"This paper reports on a comparative case study of 3 ongoing research and development (R&D) projects, each conducted virtually across multiple worksites, involving varying degrees of task uncertainty at differing stages on an innovation continuum. This NSF-funded study applied Pava's methodology of sociotechnical systems (STS) analysis to assess the influence of virtuality and task uncertainty on the quality of deliberations. Building on theory of organizations as information processing systems, different technical and social coordination mechanisms were then studied for their impact in mitigating knowledge development barriers at differing levels of task uncertainty. Technical elements, many based in information systems (IS), appeared to be most significant for coordination where task uncertainty and ambiguity were low. On the other hand, in the context of high task uncertainty, the most significant mechanisms were closely tied to the formal and informal social systems of virtual organizations. Using these findings, a trial application of a 4-step 'STS' methodology for design and use of IS and other coordination mechanisms has now been successfully completed in support of virtual knowledge work at a prominent North American research laboratory. In summary, these findings put into perspective the value of cross-organizational information systems, as a valuable part of the solution of virtual organization for innovation, but only within a larger sociotechnical systems framework that is the basis for a robust 'STS' collaboration platform.",Painter B.; Posey P.; Barrett B.; Merck B.; Tenkasi R.; Austrom D.,Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2015-01-01,Benedictine University;Indiana University Bloomington;STS Roundtable,Coordination mechanism ;  Deliberation ;  Information systems ;  Innovation continuum ;  Knowledge development barrier ;  Research and development ;  Sociotechnical systems ;  Virtual organization
The real engine of china’s robust economic growth-more mass and rapid transmission of innovative technology and application,"This paper has built on the fact that the economy of China has been growingwith an increasingly rising speed, exploring the truth of driving forces behind the economy. Paper measures empirical research method. It contrasts the differences of results in economic development between technology innovation countries, like America and technology application ones, like China. Besides, it also compares technology absorptive capacity between China and India which are both blessed with large size of population. It tries to find the reason why the economic development and technological innovation is not synchronous. Importantly, this paper has given an outcome that innovative technologies demonstrated with wider acceptance and more rapid spread are likely to be the real engine of China’s economy rising again. Therefore, strengthening the cooperation between technology innovation states and technology application countries and creating an open environment which is embracing and disseminating innovative technology could boost economic growth for many nationalities.",Mei H.; Zhang Z.,Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2015-01-01,Chongqing Technology and Business School,China’s economy ;  Empirical research ;  National economics

Potential rye bread consumers,"In the world, bread production is one of the industries in which new, more productive technologies and engineering solutions are introduced as well as traditional wood-fired bread-baking ovens for mass production are reintroduced. Consumers become more fastidious, desirous of innovation and want to return to traditional products. Producers have to choose the niche with the highest demand for products, for instance, healthy food. The research aim is to compare consumer behaviours in the context of bread consumption between Latvian and German youths. Methods: a longitudinal sociological experiment in Latvia and a sociological sensory experiment in Germany; an expert evaluation; a sociological survey for characterising respondents. Students from all continents study in Germany. Respondents from seven countries (five outside Europe) participated in a degustation of various kinds of rye bread. In the result, new ideas emerged how to globalise Latvia's original product - rye bread: not only finished products but also raw materials, technologies or technical solutions can be sold.",Eglite A.; Freytag-Leyer B.,Conference Proceeding,Engineering for Rural Development,2015-01-01,Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies;Fachhochschule Fulda,Bread industry engineering ;  Rye bread ;  Young consumer

"Engineering design education: Research, practice, and examples that link the two","Introduction. Designing is a key component of professional practice in many fields of human endeavor (e.g., architecture, engineering, industrial design, art, and literature). For engineers, designing integrates engineering knowledge, skill, and vision in the pursuit of innovations to solve problems and enable modern life. With this understanding, engineering educators have, for several decades, been infusing their programs with design curricula and pedagogical experiences in order to enhance the design competencies of engineering graduates. Paralleling the development of these curricula and experiences, a growing body of research has been providing a scholarly basis for engineering design education. The goal of this chapter is to acquaint readers with engineering design education research and practice. To situate engineering design education in the larger context, we first present a brief history of research on design processes across several fields and then move to a more specific description of research on engineering design processes. We then focus on research that investigates effective ways to teach and assess the design process and review curricular structures and pedagogies that are commonly used in undergraduate engineering programs.",Atman C.; Eris O.; McDonnell J.; Cardella M.; Borgford-Parnell J.,Book,Cambridge Handbook of Engineering Education Research,2015-01-01,College of Engineering;Central Saint Martins;University of Washington;Delft University of Technology,
Modeling and analysis in marine big data: Advances and challenges,"It is aware that big data has gathered tremendous attentions from academic research institutes, governments, and enterprises in all aspects of information sciences. With the development of diversity of marine data acquisition techniques, marine data grow exponentially in last decade, which forms marine big data. As an innovation, marine big data is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, there are many potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of marine data, which is widely used in marine-related fields, such as tsunami and red-tide warning, prevention, and forecasting, disaster inversion, and visualization modeling after disasters. There is no doubt that the future competitions in marine sciences and technologies will surely converge into the marine data explorations. On the other hand, marine big data also brings about many new challenges in data management, such as the difficulties in data capture, storage, analysis, and applications, as well as data quality control and data security. To highlight theoretical methodologies and practical applications of marine big data, this paper illustrates a broad view about marine big data and its management, makes a survey on key methods and models, introduces an engineering instance that demonstrates the management architecture, and discusses the existing challenges.",Huang D.; Zhao D.; Wei L.; Wang Z.; Du Y.,Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2015-01-01,Shanghai Ocean University,
How to cross the border from R to D?: The example of conception of new medical devices,"The border between Research and Development for a new medical devices is often unclear since the process of development of a new medical device remains non linear, with the need of feedback from trials in clinical situation to new conception of the product. More importantly, the classification of the different steps of a project impacts on 1/the identification of right partners for the project, 2/state aid intensities, generally lower for activities linked to development than for research related activities 3/impact factor of publication related to the phase of the project. Sometimes researchers under-estimate these studies because it is thought that, although essential to set-up new investigation tools, they do not lead to an increase of fundamental knowledge. However, and especially in the field of medical devices, users have to face specific difficulties due to the variability of the biological systems under study. Results obtained in translational research often depend on this variability and new questions or scientific obstacles arise from the confrontation to the real world. In order to address these new challenges, reverse translational research is required. Fundamental research is then fed from the results of translational research. In this position paper, we would like to present a useful model of medical device development through several examples of translational research to illustrate the adequacy of research to bridging fundamental research results to the closest to the patients.",Pazart L.,Conference Proceeding,"BIODEVICES 2015 - 8th International Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices, Proceedings; Part of 8th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2015",2015-01-01,Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Besançon,Clinical trials ;  Innovation ;  Medical device ;  R&D ;  Translational research

Methods of assessing the efficiency of public spending on research and development design work,"The study research is devoted to the analysis of the effectiveness of public spending on scientific research and experimental development (hereinafter - R & D), providing intellectual capital growth and the economy reindustrialization. The urgency of this problem is confirmed by the fact that Russia currently holds a leading position in the world for public funding of research and development (70%), but has a relatively low level of patent activity and imports technology three times more than it exports. Production of the technologies not attractive for business at the expense of the budget is the most important problem hindering enhance of national competitiveness and technological independence, taking into account the current economic and geopolitical challenges. The aims and objectives of the study include following: the development of methodology for assessing the efficiency of public spending on R & D to address the economic, social problems and problems of state security. The study shows that the efficiency of public spending undertaken by public authorities, as the main managers of budgetary funds can be evaluated and analyzed based on strategic targets, as well as basic and advanced performance indicators of investment in R & D. This assessment will, if necessary, timely adjust the direction of spending in order to achieve maximum cost-effectiveness. We prove that the assessment of the public spending on R & D effectiveness is an essential element of public administration that provides reindustrialization by creating a critical mass as a fundamentally new technologies and techniques removing import dependence. It has been revealed that the developed method defines a single approach to monitor the effectiveness of the federal executive authorities, aimed at developing an innovative economy that provides a transition to more efficient management models of R & D investment. Key indicators and the procedure for determining the effectiveness of public financial support for the implementation of research, development and engineering works, and use of R & D results into economic circulation have also been identified in order to ensure sustainable economic development. It is concluded that the method of evaluating of the public spending on R & D effectiveness, proposed by the authors, will help to make timely management decisions contributing to the achievement of economic, social problems and problems of state security. In turn, this should facilitate the transition to a new model of innovation development of economy based on the timing of investment flows in research and development, patent activity, as well as the import of technologies, licenses and high-tech products.",Ilyina I.; Sergeeva O.,Journal,Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences,2015-01-01,"Russian Research Institute of Economics, Politics and Law in Science and Technology (RIEPL)",Knowledge-intensive sectors of the economy ;  Performance evaluation ;  Performance indicators ;  Public expenditure ;  Research and development design development
Opportunities for disruption,"In view of the importance of Disruptive Innovations (DIs) in both emerging and advanced economies, a better understanding of how to cultivate opportunities for DIs is called for. We provide case study exemplars that illustrate how entrepreneurs have deliberately undertaken DIs for customers of low-end and new markets. Our findings show how the entrepreneurial opportunities embedded in these DIs are purposefully discovered and created.

Antecedents and implications of disruptive innovation: Evidence from China,"A growing recognition of the importance of disruptive innovation has led researchers to examine the question of how disruptive innovation comes about and to what extent it reflects ""discovery"" versus ""creation"" of opportunities. Earlier research has focused on the organisational preconditions for disruptive innovation to arise. Much less attention has been paid to the role of innovation processes, including their goals and design, in promoting disruptive innovation. In this paper we aim to begin to fill this gap by better understanding how new innovation processes can act as antecedents for disruptive innovation. We adopt an inductive theory-building methodology using a set of case studies of Chinese firms to develop propositions about how novel R&D and production processes can foster disruptive innovation. We find that in the case of China the adoption of new innovation processes that re-define the focus of innovation and re-engineer traditional R&D processes in ways that allow the novel deployment of Chinese cost advantages can create offerings that incorporate the key elements of disruptive innovation in the sense that they challenge incumbents' established business models. Realising disruptive innovation opportunities requires proactive initiatives. We conclude by discussing the managerial implications and possible responses as well as directions for future research.",Wan F.; Williamson P.; Yin E.,Journal,Technovation,2015-01-01,Cambridge Judge Business School;Beijing Normal University,China ;  Disruptive innovation ;  Emerging markets ;  Innovation ;  R&D ;  Speed

Barriers to biomedical engineering commercialisation,"The healthcare sector faces severe problems due to increasing costs, decreasing workforce and an increasing share of elderly people. Innovation is proposed as the main cure. However, there are several barriers that prevent new ideas from becoming innovations. In this chapter we focus on the biomedical engineering sector and the barriers to commercialisation that are present for applied research projects within this sector. We describe and categorise the barriers and discuss their implications and how they could be overcome. This study has a longitudinal approach and is based on data collected annually through half-structured interviews for approximately 40 research and development projects at four universities, two hospitals and one municipality healthcare centre, across eastern and central Sweden. Our results found a broad range of barriers to commercialisation, which have been categorised as follows: (1) Barriers coupled to the healthcare sector per se, for example security regulations, procedures for governmental procurement and the industry structure. (2) Barriers related to the market structure, for example public procurement matters and the fact that hospitals commonly look for holistic solutions rather than pieces and gadgets that solve isolated parts of problems. (3) Barriers related to entrepreneurship attitudes among researchers. The findings contribute to research on the ability to create innovation in a highly prioritised sector.",Norrman C.; Öberg C.; Hult P.,Book Series,New Technology Based Firms in the New Millennium,2015-01-01,,
"Immigration, international collaboration, and innovation: Science and technology policy in the global economy","Globalization of scientific and technological knowledge has reduced the US share of world scientific activity, increased the foreign-born proportion of scientists and engineers in US universities and in the US labor market, and led to greater US scientific collaborations with other countries. China’s massive investments in university education and research and development (R&D) have, in particular, made it a special partner for the United States in scientific work. These developments have substantial implications for US science and technology policy. This paper suggests that aligning immigration policies more closely to the influx of international students, granting fellowships to students working on turning scientific and technological advances into commercial innovations, and requiring firms with R&D tax credits or other government R&D funding develop “impact plans” to use their new knowledge to produce innovative products or processes in the United States could help the country adjust to the changing global world of science and technology.Globalization of knowledge, knowledge creation, and innovation has widened the framework for assessing the economic effects of science and technology (S&T) policies. As an advanced country at the frontier of knowledge, the United States relies on investments in science and technology to improve economic performance and maintain comparative advantage in the high-tech industries that employ highly educated workers. Expansion of tertiary education, increases in research and development spending, and the manufacturing and assembly of high-tech products in low-income countries as well as in other advanced countries challenges the US position at the knowledge frontier.1 This makes S&T policies more important in determining economic outcomes than in earlier post–World War II decades when the United States naturally dominated the production and application of knowledge to the economy.This paper analyzes the globalization of science and engineering and knowledge production in the twenty-first century and its implications for US science and technology policies.Section I documents the spread of advanced knowledge and knowledge creation around the world in terms of its impact on the US share of the world’s science and engineering activity. It stresses that the rapid catch-up in knowledge-creating activities and production in low-wage developing countries, most notably China, constitutes a major challenge for the United States. The catch-up undermines the “North-South” model of trade that posited that advanced countries inevitably have comparative advantage in the production of high value-added innovations.2Section II shows that the catch-up has “globalized” science and engineering within the United States by increasing the foreign-born share of science and engineering graduate students and postdocs in US universities and the foreign-born share of the US’s science and engineering workforce, and by spurring international collaborations in knowledge production and innovation, thereby speeding knowledge creation and the spread of new knowledge worldwide.Section III examines possible changes in US policies regarding international students, postdoctoral workers and science and engineering (S&E) immigrants, and regarding the link between technology-based innovations and production. It argues that globalization of knowledge makes S&T policies the “industrial policy” of the twenty-first century, with implications for economic performance broadly. To maximize the benefits of the globalization of knowledge requires the United States to balance investments that expand the stock of global knowledge and policies that localize a share of the gains in the domestic economy.",Freeman R.,Book Series,Innovation Policy and the Economy,2015-01-01,Harvard and NBER,
Model test of a 1:8-scale floating wind turbine offshore in the Gulf of Maine,"A new floating wind turbine platform design called VolturnUS developed by the University of Maine uses innovations in materials, construction, and deployment technologies such as a concrete semisubmersible hull and a composite tower to reduce the costs of offshore wind. These novel characteristics require research and development prior to full-scale construction. This paper presents a unique offshore model testing effort aimed at derisking full-scale commercial projects by providing scaled global motion data, allowing for testing of materials representative of the full-scale system, and demonstrating full-scale construction and deployment methods. A 1:8-scale model of a 6 MW semisubmersible floating wind turbine was deployed offshore Castine, ME, in June 2013. The model includes a fully operational commercial 20 kW wind turbine and was the first gridconnected offshore wind turbine in the U.S. The testing effort includes careful selection of the offshore test site, the commercial wind turbine that produces the correct aerodynamic thrust given the wind conditions at the test site, scaling methods, model design, and construction. A suitable test site was identified that produced scaled design load cases (DLCs) prescribed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines. A turbine with a small rotor diameter was selected because it produces the correct thrust load given the wind conditions at the test site. Some representative data from the test are provided in this paper. Model test data are compared directly to full-scale design predictions made using coupled aeroelastic/hydrodynamic software. Scaled VolturnUS performance data during DLCs show excellent agreement with full-scale predictive models. Model test data are also compared directly without scaling against a numerical representation of the 1:8-scale physical model for the purposes of numerical code validation. The numerical model results compare favorably with data collected from the physical model.",Viselli A.; Goupee A.; Dagher H.,Journal,Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,2015-01-01,Maine College of Engineering and Computing;University of Maine,
Exploring the determinants of technology innovation in MSMEs,"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) make a significant contribution, by reducing unemployment in India. They need to operate efficiently and productively in order to maximize their contribution to nation, as well as national economies. MSMEs play a significant role in the economic growth of the country owing to production, exports and employment. They contributes 8% to the country's GDP, 45 % to manufactures output and 40% to the country's exports. It provides employment to 60 million people. The aggressive competition situation arising out of globalization and liberalization is forcing the organization across the globe to realize that their survival is not feasible in the absence of technological innovation. Technology innovation reflect a critical way in which organization respond to either technological or market challenges. Therefore, the importance of technology innovation in organizations competitiveness is an undeniable fact. The literature reveals that most significant determinants of technology innovation associated with MSMEs are technological collaboration and monetary management. These determinants are relatively significant in improving the manufacturing performance of MSMEs.",Singh D.; Khamba J.; Nanda T.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Research in Africa,2015-01-01,Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology;Punjabi University,Collaboration ;  Manufacturing performance ;  Monetary management ;  MSMEs ;  Technology innovation
Toward a science of learning systems: A research agenda for the high-functioning Learning Health System,"Objective The capability to share data, and harness its potential to generate knowledge rapidly and inform decisions, can have transformative effects that improve health. The infrastructure to achieve this goal at scale-marrying technology, process, and policy-is commonly referred to as the Learning Health System (LHS). Achieving an LHS raises numerous scientific challenges. Materials and methods: The National Science Foundation convened an invitational workshop to identify the fundamental scientific and engineering research challenges to achieving a national-scale LHS. The workshop was planned by a 12-member committee and ultimately engaged 45 prominent researchers spanning multiple disciplines over 2 days in Washington, DC on 11-12 April 2013. Results: The workshop participants collectively identified 106 research questions organized around four system-level requirements that a high-functioning LHS must satisfy. The workshop participants also identified a new crossdisciplinary integrative science of cyber-social ecosystems that will be required to address these challenges. Conclusions: The intellectual merit and potential broad impacts of the innovations that will be driven by investments in an LHS are of great potential significance.

Hard tissue regeneration using bone substitutes: An update on innovations in materials,"Bone is a unique organ composed of mineralized hard tissue, unlike any other body part. The unique manner in which bone can constantly undergo self-remodeling has created interesting clinical approaches to the healing of damaged bone. Healing of large bone defects is achieved using implant materials that gradually integrate with the body after healing is completed. Such strategies require a multidisciplinary approach by material scientists, biological scientists, and clinicians. Development of materials for bone healing and exploration of the interactions thereof with the body are active research areas.

Understanding the landscape of overruns in transport infrastructure projects,"Cost and schedule overruns are endemic features of transport infrastructure projects. Despite the considerable amount of research within the field of transport and planning in the past thirty years, limited progress has been made to improving the performance of projects. We contend that this will continue to be an issue as long as research efforts focus on the ‘outside view’ with emphasis being placed upon strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias. Understanding ‘why’ and ‘how’ projects overrun, particularly from both ‘outside’ and ‘inside’ perspectives, is pivotal to reducing their impact and occurrence. Thus, in conjunction with the transport and planning literature, references to cost-overrun studies undertaken within the field of construction and engineering are examined. Our objective is to provide policy makers, industry, voluntary organizations, and the public at large with an ameliorated understanding about time-overrun and costoverrun phenomena. Suggestions to mitigate overruns based upon recent process and technological innovations are identified and discussed.",Love P.; Smith J.; Simpson I.; Regan M.; Olatunji O.,Journal,Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design,2015-01-01,Bond University;Curtin University;CSi Global Services,Cost ;  Overruns ;  Schedule ;  Transport infrastructure projects

"Science, technology and innovation policy to sustain agricultural biotechnology in emerging economies: Evidence from Mexico","This paper analyses agricultural biotechnology in emerging economies. Particularly, the case of Mexico is studied as an example of how agricultural biotechnology has evolved in these countries. A system dynamics (SD) model is developed to evaluate alternative science, technology and innovation (STI) policy scenarios of biotechnology activity in Mexico. From this analysis, it seems that cooperative and mission STI policies are more suitable for supporting and developing agricultural biotechnology. This analysis supports the idea that the presence of venture capital markets, a positive attitude among consumers for consuming genetically modified organisms (GMOs), an entrepreneurial attitude among scientist, and the development of management capabilities are core variables to advance biotechnology innovation systems (BISs) in emerging economies.",Rodríguez J.; Navarro-Chávez C.; Gómez M.; Mier M.,Journal,International Journal of Biotechnology,2015-01-01,Centre Urbanisation Culture Société;Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo,Agricultural biotechnology ;  Biotech-dedicated firms ;  Biotechnology innovation ;  Biotechnology innovation systems ;  BISs ;  Emerging economies ;  Management capabilities ;  Mexico ;  Science ;  SD methods ;  STI policy ;  System dynamics methods ;  Technology and innovation policy ;  Venture capital markets

From the social shaping of technology to the staging of temporary spaces of innovation - A case of participatory innovation,"This paper addresses recent developments within the social shaping perspective, specifically the forward-looking and political dimensions of intervening in processes of innovation. With a focus on the concept of 'temporary spaces' as an analytical framework we present a study of a case on participatory innovation concerned with indoor climate practices in the building sector. Based on an analysis of the travel and uptake of narratives derived from field studies in industrial and research environments, we discuss the role of intermediaries such as ethnographic provocations concerning user practices in the staging of these temporary spaces. While the direct uptake of qualitative knowledge on user practice in the engineering worlds of indoor climate is limited, the paper highlights the role of staging temporary spaces and intermediary objects in collaboration with stakeholders as a way of reframing conceptions of indoor climate practices.",Clausen C.; Gunn W.,Journal,Science and Technology Studies,2015-01-01,"Aalborg University;University of Southern Denmark, Kolding",Indoor climate practices ;  Participatory innovation ;  Temporary spaces
Tissue engineering of the temporomandibular joint disc: Current status and future trends,"Introduction: Temporomandibular joint disorders are extremely prevalent and there is no ideal treatment clinically for the moment. For severe cases, a discectomy often need to be performed, which will further result in the development of osteoarthritis. In the past thirty years, tissue engineering has provided a promising approach for the effective remedy of severe TMJ disease through the creation of viable, effective, and biological functional implants. Methods: Although TMJ disc tissue engineering is still in early stage, unremitting efforts and some achievements have been made over the past decades. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the available literature on the progress and status in tissue engineering of the TMJ disc regarding cell sources, scaffolds, biochemical and biomechanical stimuli, and other prospects relative to this field is provided. Results and Conclusions: Even though research studies in this field are too few compared to other fibrocartilage (e.g., knee meniscus) and numerous, difficult tasks still exist, we believe that our ultimate goal of regenerating a biological implant whose histological, biochemical, and biomechanical properties parallel native TMJ discs for clinical therapy will be achieved in the near future.",Shu W.; Liu L.; Bao G.; Kang H.,Journal,International Journal of Artificial Organs,2015-01-01,Lanzhou University;Northwest Minzu University;Lanzhou Hospital of Stomatology,Cell sources ;  Fibrocartilage ;  Scaffolds ;  Signals ;  Temporomandibular Joint disc ;  Tissue engineering
The case against disruptive innovation,"Several researchers and experts share their views against the concept of disruptive innovation. They state that the use of the term as an all-purpose concept can distract focus from the real issues with emergent products and companies. Michael Raynor states that disruption, like innovation, is a well-formed English word with a non-technical meaning, while Christensen has attached to that word a very specific meaning. Other researchers show that people use this term in a number of ways that has nothing to do with Christensen's work, and are yet deeply invested in invoking the findings of that work.",Gobble M.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2015-01-01,,
Knowing communities in the front end of innovation,"OVERVIEW: Drawing on a case study at Ubisoft, a major creative firm in the videogame industry, this article shows how a firm can nurture and engage with its knowing communities to fuel the front end of innovation. Actions taken by management can catalyze four types of knowing community activities: unscripted internal activities, which are emergent, spontaneous activities internal to the firm whose content and output are not directed by management; unscripted external activities, which take place outside the firm's boundaries; scripted internal activities, which are knowledge creation activities within the firm that are prescribed by management; and scripted external activities, which occur outside the firm. The findings provide insight that can help managers better understand how to foster those activities in which knowing communities can engage in order to bolster creativity and innovation.",Harvey J.; Cohendet P.; Simon L.; Borzillo S.,Journal,Research Technology Management,2015-01-01,SKEMA Business School;Harvard Business School;HEC Montréal,Idea generation ;  Knowing communities ;  Knowledge management

The application of water absorbing geocomposites to support plant growth on slopes,"Increasing interest in vegetation covers on slopes of engineering structures has been noticeable for several years. This concerns in particular the slopes of road embankments, flood banks, dams, rehabilitated municipal and industrial landfills and other slopes that are created during the rehabilitation of degraded land. Factors determining the development of plants constituting vegetation covers of slopes for erosion control include water deficits, disadvantageous exposition to the sun, soil that does not foster plant growth. The role of roots in the soil as elements that reinforce and participate in the shearing process was described, among others, by Norris et al. [2008], Gray and Leiser [1982], Hawllet et al. [1985], Wu et al. [1988], Najder [2003], Morgan et al. [2005] Jez [2008], Gajewska and Rafalski [2003], Zuazo and Pleguezuelo [2008]. In any case of the morphological structure, the roots increase the resistance of soil by counteracting the shearing forces on the plane of shear. This increase is a function of the density and number of roots, the tensile strength of roots, the proportion of root length to diameter, the curvature of roots, their roughness, and orientation in relation to the main stresses [Coppin and Richards 1990, Jez 2008]. The article presents results of experiments with a new type of water absorbing geocomposite and its influence on the strength (resistance) of biotechnological protection. The geocomposite influences the increase of water retention in soil and the improvement of the conditions of plant vegetation. It eliminates one of the causes of poor development of plants, which is water deficit in the soil. It retains rainwater or irrigation water, of which a significant part is normally lost and remains unavailable for plant roots. The test results presented in this study describe the influence of water absorbing geocomposites on the resistance of selected vegetation covers. The tests were carried out on a slope constructed specially for this purpose, of a height of 2.0 m (6.5 ft.). The inclination of the slopes was 1:3 and 1:1.5. The surface of the slopes was divides into experimental fields. Part of these fields was planted with grass and part with bushes. The fields were arranged alternatingly, with water absorbing geocomposite and without it. After the installation of geocomposites and planting, observations and typical maintenance (cultivation) activities were carried out for three years. Water absorbing geocomposites developed at the Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences are spatial structures designed for capturing water in the soil. The water retained inside the geocomposite is available to plants, which helps them develop faster and increases their resistance to droughts and water deficits. The structure of the geocomposite consists of external textile that captures the water infiltrating into the soil and directs it to the inside of the geocomposite. This water is then absorbed by the superabsorbent in form of gel. The skeleton structure made of plastic enables free swelling of the gel (and thus, water absorption). This provides space that allows for the absorption of water or its solutions by the superabsorbent without being affected by the load resulting from the weight of soil above it. Such structure enables to fully benefit from the properties of superabsorbents. It allows for free application on slopes without the risk of deterioration of their strength parameters. Water absorbing geocomposites have contributed to the improvement of the condition of biotechnological reinforcements and, eventually, to the increase in the resistance of earth structures to water erosion. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the new solution. On fields sown with grass mixture the application of geocomposite resulted in an increase in root volume by 129,7% (2013), increase in average diameter by 55.8% (2013), in surface area by 47.7% (2013) and in maximum root length by 9.6-27.3% (2011-2013). Dry mass of overground parts increased in comparison to the field without geocomposite by 49.4%-73.1% (2011-2013), aboveground biomass increased by 58.0%-83.3% (2011-2013). The increase in the shearing strength of roots reaches 66.7% for bushes and 20.1% for grass. Increased growth of the root system and the overground parts of both bushes and grass was noted. The solution was patented (PL 211198) and application for international patent protection in PCT mode was filed (PCT/PL2011/050008). In 2012 the concept of water absorbing geocomposites was commercialized. Research was conducted as part of the interdisciplinary project ""Water absorbing geocomposites - innovative technologies supporting plant growth"" carried out under the Operational Programme Innovative Economy co-financed by the European Union from the European Regional Development Fund.",Lejcus̈ K.; Dąbrowska J.; Garlikowski D.; ͆pitalniak M.,Conference Proceeding,Environmental Connection Conference 2015,2015-01-01,Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Sciences,Erosion control ;  Shear strength ;  Slope protection ;  Vegetation covers ;  Water absorbing geocomposites

"Tissue-engineered cartilage: The crossroads of biomaterials, cells and stimulating factors","Damage to cartilage represents one of the most challenging tasks of musculoskeletal therapeutics due to its limited propensity for healing and regenerative capabilities. Lack of current treatments to restore cartilage tissue function has prompted research in this rapidly emerging field of tissue regeneration of functional cartilage tissue substitutes. The development of cartilaginous tissue largely depends on the combination of appropriate biomaterials, cell source, and stimulating factors. Over the years, various biomaterials have been utilized for cartilage repair, but outcomes are far from achieving native cartilage architecture and function. This highlights the need for exploration of suitable biomaterials and stimulating factors for cartilage regeneration. With these perspectives, we aim to present an overview of cartilage tissue engineering with recent progress, development, and major steps taken toward the generation of functional cartilage tissue. In this review, we have discussed the advances and problems in tissue engineering of cartilage with strong emphasis on the utilization of natural polymeric biomaterials, various cell sources, and stimulating factors such as biophysical stimuli, mechanical stimuli, dynamic culture, and growth factors used so far in cartilage regeneration.

"Control systems engineering in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing may 20-21, 2014 continuous manufacturing symposium","This white paper provides a perspective of the challenges, research needs, and future directions for control systems engineering in continuous pharmaceutical processing. The main motivation for writing this paper is to facilitate the development and deployment of control systems technologies so as to ensure quality of the drug product. Although the main focus is on small-molecule pharmaceutical products, most of the same statements apply to biological drug products. An introduction to continuous manufacturing and control systems is followed by a discussion of the current status and technical needs in process monitoring and control, systems integration, and risk analysis. Some key points are that: (1) the desired objective in continuous manufacturing should be the satisfaction of all critical quality attributes (CQAs), not for all variables to operate at steady-state values; (2) the design of start-up and shutdown procedures can significantly affect the economic operation of a continuous manufacturing process; (3) the traceability of material as it moves through the manufacturing facility is an important consideration that can at least in part be addressed using residence time distributions; and (4) the control systems technologies must assure quality in the presence of disturbances, dynamics, uncertainties, nonlinearities, and constraints. Direct measurement, firstprinciples and empirical model-based predictions, and design space approaches are described for ensuring that CQA specifications are met.Ways are discussed for universities, regulatory bodies, and industry to facilitate working around or through barriers to the development of control systems engineering technologies for continuous drug manufacturing. Industry and regulatory bodies should work with federal agencies to create federal funding mechanisms to attract faculty to this area. Universities should hire faculty interested in developing firstprinciples models and control systems technologies for drug manufacturing that are easily transportable to industry. Industry can facilitate the move to continuous manufacturing by working with universities on the conception of new continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit operations that have the potential to make major improvements in product quality, controllability, or reduced capital and/or operating costs. Regulatory bodies should ensure that: (1) regulations and regulatory practices promote, and do not derail, the development and implementation of continuous manufacturing and control systems engineering approaches; (2) the individuals who approve specific regulatory filings are sufficiently trained to make good decisions regarding control systems approaches; (3) provide regulatory clarity and eliminate/reduce regulatory risks; (4) financially support the development of high-quality training materials for use of undergraduate students, graduate students, industrial employees, and regulatory staff; (5) enhance the training of their own technical staff by financially supporting joint research projects with universities in the development of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing processes and the associated control systems engineering theory, numerical algorithms, and software; and (6) strongly encourage the federal agencies that support research to fund these research areas.",Myerson A.; Krumme M.; Nasr M.; Thomas H.; Braatz R.,Journal,Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,2015-01-01,"GlaxoSmithKline, USA;Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Novartis International AG",Analysis ;  Control systems ;  Dynamic simulation ;  Manufacturing ;  Mathematical model ;  Multivariate analysis ;  Process analytical technology ;  Processing ;  Quality by design ;  Systems integration
Are team personality and climate related to satisfaction and software quality? Aggregating results from a twice replicated experiment,"Context: Research into software engineering teams focuses on human and social team factors. Social psychology deals with the study of team formation and has found that personality factors and group processes such as team climate are related to team effectiveness. However, there are only a handful of empirical studies dealing with personality and team climate and their relationship to software development team effectiveness. Objective: We present aggregate results of a twice replicated quasi-experiment that evaluates the relationships between personality, team climate, product quality and satisfaction in software development teams. Method: Our experimental study measures the personalities of team members based on the Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) and team climate factors (participative safety, support for innovation, team vision and task orientation) preferences and perceptions. We aggregate the results of the three studies through a meta-analysis of correlations. The study was conducted with students. Results: The aggregation of results from the baseline experiment and two replications corroborates the following findings. There is a positive relationship between all four climate factors and satisfaction in software development teams. Teams whose members score highest for the agreeableness personality factor have the highest satisfaction levels. The results unveil a significant positive correlation between the extraversion personality factor and software product quality. High participative safety and task orientation climate perceptions are significantly related to quality. Conclusions: First, more efficient software development teams can be formed heeding personality factors like agreeableness and extraversion. Second, the team climate generated in software development teams should be monitored for team member satisfaction. Finally, aspects like people feeling safe giving their opinions or encouraging team members to work hard at their job can have an impact on software quality. Software project managers can take advantage of these factors to promote developer satisfaction and improve the resulting product.",Acuña S.; Gómez M.; Hannay J.; Juristo N.; Pfahl D.,Journal,Information and Software Technology,2015-01-01,"Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros Informáticos, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Tartu Ülikool;Norwegian Defence Research Establishment;Universidad Autónoma de Madrid;Universidad CEU San Pablo",Meta-analysis ;  Personality factors ;  Replication ;  Satisfaction ;  Software quality ;  Team climate
Enhancing the future impact of Six Sigma management,"Though Six Sigma has proven to be an effective framework for performance improvement in a wide variety of industries for many years, the future development of Six Sigma needs to be explored. In this paper, we briefly review the background and development of Six Sigma and suggest ways to enhance and extend the effectiveness of Six Sigma in the coming years. We propose the future development of Six Sigma from three perspectives: strategy, integration and innovation. Some challenges are addressed for Six Sigma's spreading to service systems. Research shows that when Six Sigma becomes more pervasive and inclusive, it will offer opportunities for excellence in performance in the production of goods and services in a wide variety of businesses.",He Z.; Goh T.,Journal,Quality Technology and Quantitative Management,2015-01-01,Tianjin University;National University of Singapore,Continuous improvement ;  DMAIC ;  Organizational excellence ;  Quality management ;  Six sigma
The relationship between strategic technology innovation orientation and organizational performance: Mediating effects of core competency,"This paper suggests a structural model that explains the relationship between strategic technology innovation orientation and organizational performance. The model was built on the synthesis of strategic orientation and resource-based theory. The key mediating variable is organizational core competency. The empirical test proved that the technology innovation orientation did not affect performance directly, but through the core competency indirectly. The test results suggest that if an innovative firm would like to enhance business performance, first of all, the firm has strategic innovative orientation view and concentrates on core competency. The more a firm has core competency, the more it will increase their productivity, and finally will get higher financial performance.",Jeong D.; Yoon D.; Choe M.,Journal,"ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications",2015-01-01,Gyeongsang National University,Core competency ;  Performance ;  Productivity ;  Technology innovation
Materials Research for Group IV Semiconductors,"This volume is a collection of papers presented at Symposium X ""Materials Research for Group IV Semiconductors: Growth, Characterization, and Technological Developments"" at the E-MRS Spring Meeting 2014 held from May 26-30 in Lille, France. Different from the recent past, the major challenges for fundamental research and technological development in microelectronics and photovoltaics are no more confined to bulk silicon and silicon devices but to a variety of options based on silicon alloys, nanocrystalline silicon, silicon nanowires, Ge films on silicon, and graphene. Group IV elements are dominating microelectronics, photovoltaics, and nano-technology in their whole variety and with ongoing innovation potential. The overall development is driven more and more by defect engineering procedures, optimized deposition processes and growth techniques, advanced diagnostics and modeling tools. Basic research on point defects and extended defects remains in the center of interest for both electronic and photovoltaic applications, being still important for solving defect related problems, for improved defect engineering, and to increase the efficiency of gettering processes in photovoltaic and electronic materials. Crystal growth for electronic applications moves towards 450 mm diameter silicon ingots while photovoltaic applications are seeking a tradeoff between high quality of large volumes and cost efficiency. Advanced float-zone processes open new opportunities, and modeling of crystal growth and defect generation for Si, Ge and Si-Ge alloys can help to facilitate these developments. Optimization of epitaxial deposition of nitrides on silicon substrates as well as novel methods for the growth of graphene on silicon are in the center of interest because of their innovation potential for the optoelectronic and microelectronic industry. Selective epitaxy for advanced electronic applications and strain engineering in strained layer epitaxy are still important for the heterogeneous integration of Si or Ge in high-end silicon device technologies. Eventually, nanocrystalline group IV semiconductors in their whole variety from quantum dots, nanowires and superlattices offer a number of novel opportunities for new applications in view of ""more than Moore"". The symposium addressed its interest to all these topics and provided a successful forum for scientists coming from research institutions and industry of Asia, America, Australia, Africa, and Europe to discuss recent results and developments in materials research on group IV elements. In total, 72 oral and 113 poster presentations have made this symposium a fruitful expert meeting, with mutual benefits arising from technical and scientific interactions between academy and industry.",Pizzini S.; Kissinger G.,Journal,Physica Status Solidi (C) Current Topics in Solid State Physics,2015-01-01,,
First responders field trials of saliant technology,"SALIANT - Selective Antibodies Limited Immuno Assay Novel Technology is the title of the research project developed and realised by a European consortium of biotechnology companies, universities and government forensic laboratories within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), Security Theme. The aim of this project was to develop a hand-held device for real-time analysis of trace levels of explosives, chemicals and drugs. The key innovation was a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is rapid, highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders and Forensic Service Providers at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. The Faculty of Special Engineering of the University of Zilina (FSE) as a project team member, was responsible for the task of evaluating the efficacy and sensitivity of the SALIANT technology for explosives detection for emergency responders' use.

Specific professional skills development for engineering studies: Spatial orientation,"The spatial skills are an active field of research, especially in the engineering area. Several authors connect high levels of spatial kills with the success in technical careers. One of the components of spatial skills is spatial orientation. Many studies show that providing the appropriate material may develop spatial skills. However, a plan aiming for the development of spatial orientation skills in formal teaching is still missing. This paper presents an innovation in the teaching strategies through a Geographic Information Technologies workshop which aim is development of the spatial orientation. The workshop's study was completed during four academic courses with 248 university engineering students involved. A control group was created with 35 students using conventional teaching methods for determining if the increase in the spatial orientation skill is due to the effect of this workshop. The result shows significant statistical gains over the spatial orientation skill of 19.21 degrees. The results from the control group confirm that students who have not undertaken specific training didn't develop their spatial orientation skill.",Carrera C.; Martín-Dorta N.; Pérez J.; De La Torre Cantero J.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2015-01-01,Universidad de la Laguna,Geographic information technologies ;  Infrastructure for spatial information in Europe ;  Spatial orientation ;  Spatial skill
Addressing biomedical problems through interdisciplinary learning: A feasibility study,"Interdisciplinary learning is often limited to student groups which already have significant overlap in either their curricular content or whose day-to-day duties entail regular interactions. This is not generally the case for engineers and clinicians, and almost never the case for students of engineering and medicine. In this feasibility study, interdisciplinary learning outcomes were assessed in six teams comprising undergraduate engineering and medical students at a major Irish university. Three key factors differentiated the current study from complimentary approaches; (i) the module places undergraduate medical and engineering students in interdisciplinary teams, (ii) students are educated in a systematic methodology (TRIZ) of design and innovation, which is then applied to a clinical challenge and (iii) the present study places student learning outcomes as the primary mission of the module, rather than the project deliverables. Feedback from both students and clinical mentors was assessed using focus groups and individual interviews. The learning outcomes were convincingly imparted as evidenced by feedback, which was overwhelmingly positive from both students and clinicians. As an added benefit, the tangible outputs (e.g., prototype or software tool) from each of the 6 teams represented a worthy proof-of-concept, in some cases suitable for future research or commercial exploitation. This initial feasibility study highlights the potential benefits of a new structured methodology in to solving clinical problems in the context of interdisciplinary learning.",Cantillon-Murphy P.; McSweeney J.; Burgoyne L.; O'Tuathaigh C.; O'Flynn S.,Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2015-01-01,School of Medicine;University College Cork,Biomedical design ;  Interdisciplinary learning ;  Medical education ;  Theory of inventive problem solving ;  TIPS ;  TRIZ

Forecasting demand on mega infrastructure projects: Increasing financial feasibility,"Indonesia is a country with large and dynamic economic activities reflected by an average economic growth reaching 6% per annum. Sunda Street Bridge (SSB) is one of the mega projects offered by the Indonesia government that would spend about US$ 25 billion. In line with the SSB main function as an efficient mean for transporting people and goods between two major islands in Indonesia, potential additional functions have been explored including installation of liquid and gas pipes, fiber optics, industrial area development and renewable energy utilization. This research establishes the approach to forecast demand in the case of conceptual design. The SSB is associated with innovations to determine the functions using value engineering methods. The approach involves forecasting demand with a System Dynamics simulation model that could provide a reliable estimate and generate scenarios to compare the financial feasibility of the project before and after the process involving innovation of project functions. Analysis involving demand forecasting with the System Dynamics Approach has confirmed that the Sunda Strait Bridge development with additional functions would increase the revenues of the overall project up to US$61.59 Million, in order to obtain an increased Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the overall project up to 7.56% with a positive Net Present Value (NPV).",Husin A.; Berawi M.; Dikun S.; Ilyas T.; Berawi A.,Journal,International Journal of Technology,2015-01-01,Universitas Indonesia,Demand forecast ;  Financial feasibility ;  Innovation ;  Mega infrastructure project ;  System dynamics
The impact of analogies on creative concept generation: Lessons from an in vivo study in engineering design,"Research on innovation often highlights analogies from sources outside the current problem domain as a major source of novel concepts; however, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not well understood. We analyzed the temporal interplay between far analogy use and creative concept generation in a professional design team's brainstorming conversations, investigating the hypothesis that far analogies lead directly to very novel concepts via large steps in conceptual spaces (jumps). Surprisingly, we found that concepts were more similar to their preceding concepts after far analogy use compared to baseline situations (i.e., without far analogy use). Yet far analogies increased the team's concept generation rate compared to baseline conditions. Overall, these results challenge the view that far analogies primarily lead to novel concepts via jumps in conceptual spaces and suggest alternative pathways from far analogies to novel concepts (e.g., iterative, deep exploration within a functional space).",Chan J.; Schunn C.,Journal,Cognitive Science,2015-01-01,University of Pittsburgh,In vivo ;  Analogy ;  Creativity ;  Design cognition ;  Problem solving
Pigments for generating electric power - An overview,"Innovation of novel renewable energy technologies is of utmost importance in the present scenario. Among the several non conventional energy technologies available, harnessing the abundantly available solar energy remains challenging to the human society. Compared to the conventional silicon based diodes, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC's) have gained considerable attention over the past two decades. This topic has attracted numerous research groups in recent days and constant focus is done on the various aspects of DSSC's such as molecular engineering of photosensitizing materials, better fabrication procedures, development of counter electrode materials etc. In this review paper, we have discussed the recent progress in this novel field of research in a broader sense and also emphasized the importance of natural photosensitizer's and their reported conversion efficiencies by various researchers. In addition, few recommendations are suggested for the better performance of the photovoltaic devices based on naturally extracted dyes.",Mary Rosana N.,Journal,"Research Journal of Pharmaceutical, Biological and Chemical Sciences",2015-01-01,Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology,Conversion efficiency ;  Natural photosensitizers ;  Renewable energy ;  Solar cells
Virtual generative BIM workspace for maximising AEC conceptual design innovation: A paradigm of future opportunities,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to find optimal solutions for conceptual design automation, which can be integrated with Building Information Modelling (BIM) support for construction automation. Problems relating ostensibly to failures in computational support for the conceptual design stage are well-documented in extant literature. These failures are multifarious and significant, with several deficiencies being acknowledged in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Whilst acknowledging this, extant literature has highlighted the importance of computational design in the AEC industry; and failures in this area include the need to strengthen the congruent links and support mechanisms in order to exploit the opportunities presented by new computational design methods. Given this, it is postulated that the application of generative design could enhance the design experience by assisting designers with the iterative generation of alternatives and parameterisation (change management) processes. Moreover, asBIM applications are increasingly providing comprehensive support for modelling and management, then additional synergies could be examined for further exploitation. Design/methodology/approach - This paper focusses on the potential for developing an interactive BIM environment that purposefully adopts generative design as a method of computational design for the early design stages. This research facilitates the automation of the conceptual architectural design process, using BIM as the central conduit for enhancing the integration of the whole building design process (including design interfaces). This approach is designed to improve designers' cognition and collaboration during the conceptual architectural design process. Findings - This paper evaluates the existing methods and decision support mechanisms, and it introduces the potential of combining different concepts into a single environment (generative design/ BIM). Originality/value - This research is novel, in that it critically appraises virtual generative workspaces using BIM as the central conduit. The outcome and intervention of this research forms a theoretical basis for the development of a ""proof of concept"" prototype, which actively engages generative design into a single dynamic BIM environment to support the early conceptual design process.",Abrishami S.; Goulding J.; Pour Rahimian F.; Ganah A.,Journal,Construction Innovation,2015-01-01,University of Central Lancashire,BIM ;  Computer-based environment ;  Conceptual design ;  Generative design ;  IT/Design ;  Parametric design
Factors influencing higher education students to adopt podcast: An empirical study,"Podcast, which is one of the technologies that was developed for personal entertainment or for information usage, has become one of the fastest growing technologies in distance learning over the past several years. Using the Technology Acceptance Model and Diffusion of Innovation Theory as base models, this study investigates the technological, individual, and social aspects that influence the adoption of podcast use in education. Previous research on podcast use in education attempted to study its adoption and diffusion; however, these studies have been rather isolated small case studies than a holistic, integrative research. This study overcomes this limitation by examining the student podcast adoption with survey data collected from 352 students in a higher education institution using a comprehensive model. The hypotheses were confirmed using structural equation modeling analytical procedures and the findings supported the proposed model. Based on the findings, implications for theory and practices are discussed.",Merhi M.,Journal,Computers and Education,2015-01-01,Judd Leighton School of Business and Economics,Distance learning ;  Mobile learning ;  Online learning ;  Podcast adoption ;  Technology adoption
Innovation in Robotic Surgery: The Indian Scenario,"Robotics is the science. In scientific words a Robot is an electromechanical arm device with a computer interface, a combination of electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering. It is a mechanical arm that performs tasks in Industries, space exploration, and science. One such idea was to make an automated arm-A robot-In laparoscopy to control the telescope-camera unit electromechanically and then with a computer interface using voice control. It took us 5 long years from 2004 to bring it to the level of obtaining a patent. That was the birth of the Swarup Robotic Arm (SWARM) which is the first and the only Indian contribution in the field of robotics in laparoscopy as a total voice controlled camera holding robotic arm developed without any support by industry or research institutes.",Deshpande S.,Journal,Journal of Minimal Access Surgery,2015-01-01,Swarup Hospital,Camera holding robotic arm ;  laparoscopic ;  robotic arm
Paving the road toward Smart Grids through large-scale advanced metering infrastructures,"Upgrading current electricity grid to the so-called Smart Grid represents one of the major engineering challenges ever. Hence, the road toward the Smart Grid will be long and needs to be paved gradually, certainly driving the next wave of research and innovation in both the energy and the ICT (Information and Communications Technologies) sectors. Currently, the earliest stages of such a complex project are being undertaken and AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructures) stand out as the first steps toward the Smart Grid. The Spanish R&D (Research and Development) demonstration project PRICE-GEN aims to be a flagship AMI project at both national and international level. It is focused on increasing the awareness of the status of the low voltage power distribution network through an optimal and interoperable communications architecture which provides detailed information on customers' consumption and generation. The project entails the deployment of over 200,000 smart meters in the area of Madrid, such a pilot scheme being also used as reference in other European R&D projects, such as the IGREENGrid (IntegratinG Renewables in the European Electricity Grid). This paper presents the communications architecture and technologies which are deployed in the field, analyzing how they fit some specific Smart Grid communications requirement. In addition, the paper describes in detail the pilot itself along with the services which are currently been delivered as well as with the foreseen ones.

The role of pilot and demonstration plants in technological development: synthesis and directions for future research,"Pilot and demonstration plants (PDPs) play important roles in technological development. They represent bridges between basic knowledge generation and technological breakthroughs on the one hand, and industrial application and commercial adoption on the other.

Fundamental ecology is fundamental,"The primary reasons for conducting fundamental research are satisfying curiosity, acquiring knowledge, and achieving understanding. Here we develop why we believe it is essential to promote basic ecological research, despite increased impetus for ecologists to conduct and present their research in the light of potential applications. This includes the understanding of our environment, for intellectual, economical, social, and political reasons, and as a major source of innovation. We contend that we should focus less on short-term, objective-driven research and more on creativity and exploratory analyses, quantitatively estimate the benefits of fundamental research for society, and better explain the nature and importance of fundamental ecology to students, politicians, decision makers, and the general public.

Learning Through STEM-Rich Tinkering: Findings From a Jointly Negotiated Research Project Taken Up in Practice,"The Maker Movement has taken the educational field by storm due to its perceived potential as a driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation (Honey & Kanter, ; Martinez & Stager, ). Making is promoted as advancing entrepreneurship, developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, and supporting compelling inquiry-based learning experiences for young people. In this paper, we focus on making as an educative inquiry-based practice, and specifically tinkering as a branch of making that emphasizes creative, improvisational problem solving. STEM-rich tinkering activities are designed to support interdisciplinary investigations and creativity using a STEM-rich palette of tools, concepts, and phenomena. To date, the majority of research on making has focused on analysis of makerspaces, maker communities, and design and implementation of maker activities. In this paper, we describe a study that documented dimensions of learning in tinkering programs designed for museum visitors. The study, which was jointly negotiated among a team of researchers and practitioners, led to the development of a Tinkering Learning Dimensions Framework and a publicly available video library of tinkering exemplars, both of which are being actively used by tinkering practitioners in their direct service to the public and professional development work for the field.",Bevan B.; Gutwill J.; Petrich M.; Wilkinson K.,Journal,Science Education,2015-01-01,,
BORM-II and UML as accessibility process in knowledge and business modelling,"This paper presents two systems and knowledge modelling techniques that may be used as a tool to coordinate the communication between researchers and users from the agriculture problem domain. The paper is focused on th eusage of a general approach UML (Unified Modelling Language) and an innovative approach BORM-II (Bussiness Object Relation Modelling, second generation) as communication standards within research projects. The first part of this paper describes the framework, laying out the main aspects of both notations, metamodel and theoretical background as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The paper analyses practical examples from agriculture, rural and organization modelling domains. These innovation processes in both approaches are aplied on the same business process description and evaluates the impact on researchers and users of research. The main part is focused on the transformation model to model based on BORM-II. The transformation is in line with UML and SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules) standards from OMG (Object Management Group). My predecessor worked on model transformation BORM to UML. This work follows PetrS ˇ plíchals work and goes further. This transformation will be composed into a modelling tool and will be based on approach HOT (High Order Transformation). The objective of this research is to achieve documentation output like SBVR, and bridge the gap between business people (users) and designers (researchers) of information systems (IS). The paper concludes that the gap between IS designers (software engineers) and domain experts can be bridged by automated transformation of previously mentioned models. The main goal is to achieve a documentation output similar to SBVR, and ICT Accessibility for business people.",Merunka V.; Pergl R.; Tůma J.,Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2015-01-01,Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,Business object relation modelling ;  Business process and knowledge modeling ;  ICT accessibility ;  Model transformation ;  Semantics of business vocabulary and rules ;  Tool ;  Unified modeling language
Complex concrete structures: Merging existing casting techniques with digital fabrication,"Over the course of the 20th century, architectural construction has gone through intense innovation in its material, engineering and design, radically transforming the way buildings were and are conceived. Technological and industrial advances enabled and challenged architects, engineers and constructors to build increasingly complex architectural structures from concrete. Computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques have, more recently, rejuvenated and increased the possibilities of realizing ever more complex geometries. Reinforced concrete is often chosen for such structures as almost any shape can be achieved when placed into a formwork. However, most complex forms generated with these digital design tools bear little relation to the default modes of production used in concrete construction today. A large gap has emerged between the possibilities offered by the digital technology in architectural design and the reality of the building industry, where actually no efficient solutions exist for the production of complex concrete structures. This paper presents construction methods that unfold their full potential by linking digital design, additive fabrication and material properties and hence allow accommodating the construction of complex concrete structures. The emphasis is set on the on-going research project Smart Dynamic Casting (SDC) where advanced material design and robotic fabrication are interconnected in the design and fabrication process of complex concrete structures. The proposed fabrication process is belonging to an emerging architectural phenomenon defined first as Digital Materiality by Gramazio & Kohler (2008) or more recently as Material Ecologies by Neri Oxman [1].",Lloret E.; Shahab A.; Linus M.; Flatt R.; Gramazio F.; Kohler M.; Langenberg S.,Journal,CAD Computer Aided Design,2015-01-01,ETH Zürich,Casting techniques ;  Complex concrete structures ;  Digital fabrication ;  Formwork ;  Slipforming ;  Smart dynamic casting
Supercritical water gasification research and development in China,"Supercritical water gasification is a promising technology to convert coal/biomass/organic wastes to hydrogen cleanly and efficiently. Extensive investigations on supercritical water gasification were conducted in China. State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow in Power Engineering (SKLMFPE) together with other universities/institutes established experimental device with the reactor type of quartz tube reaction system, tubular reactor and fluidized bed reactor. The fluidized bed reactor system solved the blocking problems to guarantee continuous and stable gasification. Typically Hongliulin coal as a typical coal in China was completely gasified in supercritical water fluidized bed system and the hydrogen yield was 77.5 mol per kg of coal. A pilot scale demonstration plant for supercritical water gasification driven by solar concentration system was established with a handling capacity of 1 t/h and it proves the feasibility of the system scale up. A novel thermodynamics cycle power generation system based on coal gasification in supercritical water was proposed with the obvious advantages of high coal-electricity efficiency and zero pollutant emission. An Integrated Cooperative Innovation Center with the name of A New Type of High-efficient Coal Gasification Technology and its Large-scale Utilization was founded in order to vigorously enhance the industrialization of the technology.",Guo L.; Jin H.; Lu Y.,Journal,Journal of Supercritical Fluids,2015-01-01,State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow in Power Engineering,Biomass ;  Coal ;  Supercritical water gasification
The antecedents and consequences of affordable value innovations for emerging markets,"Emerging markets offer tremendous growth opportunities for firms. While established multinational firms typically focus on premium segments in emerging markets, they often fail to leverage additional growth opportunities in so-called good enough or low-income segments in emerging markets. Customers in these low-income markets have substantially different requirements and are very price sensitive. Theoretical and case-based research suggests that innovating for these low-income segments in emerging markets differs significantly from innovating for premium or traditional Western markets. We argue that tapping successfully into low-income segments in emerging markets requires the development of new products that meet the low price expectations while at the same time offering also value to customers in these segments. We refer to these new products as affordable value innovations. We analyze the antecedents of affordable value innovation for emerging markets. We draw on institutional theory to derive three potentially relevant antecedents of affordable value innovation for emerging markets. These are bricolage, local embeddedness, and standardization. We test our hypotheses using multiple informant data from 47 multinational corporations involving 103 innovation projects that target low-income customers in emerging markets. Our empirical analysis shows that all three antecedents have significant effects on the level of affordable value innovation: while bricolage and local embeddedness are positively related to the level of affordable value innovation, standardization has a negative impact. We also examine the relationship between the level of affordable value innovation and performance. We find evidence for our basic assumption that a firm's capability to develop and launch affordable value innovations is key to success in emerging markets. It indicates that a firm's investments in affordable value innovations for emerging markets pay off financially. Finally, a cross-regional comparison of our data shows that the key findings on antecedents of affordable value innovation and its impact on performance do not vary across various emerging markets. Overall, our findings offer important implications for research on and the practice of innovation for low-income segments in emerging markets.",Ernst H.; Kahle H.; Dubiel A.; Prabhu J.; Subramaniam M.,Journal,Journal of Product Innovation Management,2015-01-01,Carroll School of Management;University of Cambridge;WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,
Implementing precision irrigation in a humid climate - Recent experiences and on-going challenges,"There is growing scientific interest in the potential role that precision irrigation (PI) can make towards improving crop productivity, and increasing water and energy efficiency in irrigated agriculture. Most progress has been made in arid and semi-arid climates for use in high value crop production where irrigation costs coupled with concerns regarding water scarcity have stimulated PI innovation and development. In temperate and humid climates where irrigation is supplemental to rainfall, PI is less developed but nevertheless offers scope to make more effective use of rainfall, help reduce the non-beneficial losses associated with irrigation (deep drainage, nitrate leaching) and provide farmers with evidence to demonstrate environmentally sustainable practices to processors and retailers. This paper reports on recent experiences in developing precision irrigation in UK field-scale agriculture, drawing on evidence from field research and modelling studies. By combining data from these sources, a critical evaluation focusing on selected technical, agronomic and engineering challenges that need to be overcome are described, including issues regarding PI scheduling, and the delineation of irrigation management zones to ensure compatibility with existing methods of overhead irrigation. The findings have relevance to other countries where irrigation is supplemental and where precision agriculture is gaining popularity.",Daccache A.; Knox J.; Weatherhead E.; Daneshkhah A.; Hess T.,Journal,Agricultural Water Management,2015-01-01,Cranfield University,Electrical conductivity ;  Irrigation uniformity ;  Precision agriculture ;  Soil mapping ;  Soil variability ;  Variable rate irrigation
Interoperable tools for designing energy-efficient buildings in healthcare districts,"The EU funded collaborative research project STREAMER aims on Energy-efficient Buildings (EeB), focusing on mixed-use healthcare districts. Besides innovations in EeB technology, special emphasis is laid on improving methodologies and tools used in the design process of new or retrofitted hospital buildings. STREAMER follows a model-based, holistic approach by integrating design data on both building and district level.Advanced ICT methods like Semantic Web, Ontologies, Parametric Modelling or Knowledge Based Systems, will be reviewed, adapted, and improved to use them during the energy-efficient-buildings design process. The project not only aims on developing theoretical concepts, but also on practical case studies: based on already existing software, a number of interoperable software tools shall be developed and evaluated in four demonstration projects. The paper describes the system architecture and provides a functional spectrum of the design tools, focusing on interoperability issues. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group.",Benner J.; Häfele K.; Bonsma P.; Bourdeau M.; Soubra S.; Sleiman H.; Robert S.,Conference Proceeding,"eWork and eBusiness in Architecture, Engineering and Construction - Proceedings of the 10th European Conference on Product and Process Modelling, ECPPM 2014",2015-01-01,"CEA, Institut LIST;Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek- TNO;CSTB",
Briefing of CSC and Its R & D activities for metal forming,"China Steel Corporation was founded in 1971 being the largest integrate steel mill in Taiwan. After several stages of expansion projects, its crude steel production has reached 16.5 million tons annually. CSC has made consistent efforts on its technology innovation mainly carried out by two R & D departments. One of the major tasks of its R & D activities is to establish the advanced technologies for the manufacturing better steels and aluminum alloys as well as product application technology for downstream users. This presentation will mainly brief the research activities of CSC in the field of metal forming including rolling, sheet metal forming and thermal-mechanical simulations carried out at Gleeble 3800. Work rolls with continuously variable crown (CVC) were applied to produce hot-rolled strips having precise profile and flatness. Lubrication rolling technology with high speed steel rolls was developed to diminish the wearing of work rolls at hot strip mills. The campaign life of rolling cycle was greatly prolonged. Computer-Aided engineering (CAE) simulation technology of sheet metal forming has been established which proved to be an effective way to deal with the sever spring back and breakage of the cold forming of high strength steel automobile parts. Hot stamping has also been developed to support the technology innovation of CSC's downstream customers. Flow stress and microstructure evolution during hot rolling for aluminum alloys were investigated using a Gleeble 3800 simulator. Both high strength AA5182 for can end and low earing AA3104 for can body aluminum sheets have been successfully developed. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",Wang S.,Book Series,Key Engineering Materials,2015-01-01,China Steel Corporation Kaohsiung,Automatic profile and flatness control ;  Can body ;  Can end ;  Computer-Aided engineering ;  Continuously variable crown ;  Gleeble simulation ;  Lubrication rolling ;  Sheet metal forming
Cloud-based design and manufacturing: A new paradigm in digital manufacturing and design innovation,"Cloud-based design manufacturing (CBDM) refers to a service-oriented networked product development model in which service consumers are enabled to configure, select, and utilize customized product realization resources and services ranging from computer-aided engineering software to reconfigurable manufacturing systems. An ongoing debate on CBDM in the research community revolves around several aspects such as definitions, key characteristics, computing architectures, communication and collaboration processes, crowdsourcing processes, information and communication infrastructure, programming models, data storage, and new business models pertaining to CBDM. One question, in particular, has often been raised: is cloud-based design and manufacturing actually a new paradigm, or is it just ""old wine in new bottles""? To answer this question, we discuss and compare the existing definitions for CBDM, identify the essential characteristics of CBDM, define a systematic requirements checklist that an idealized CBDM system should satisfy, and compare CBDM to other relevant but more traditional collaborative design and distributed manufacturing systems such as web- and agent-based design and manufacturing systems. To justify the conclusion that CBDM can be considered as a new paradigm that is anticipated to drive digital manufacturing and design innovation, we present the development of a smart delivery drone as an idealized CBDM example scenario and propose a corresponding CBDM system architecture that incorporates CBDM-based design processes, integrated manufacturing services, information and supply chain management in a holistic sense. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
