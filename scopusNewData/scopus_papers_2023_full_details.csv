Research progress and prospect of laser shock peening technology in aircraft structure,Light alloys such as aluminum alloy and titanium alloy are widely used in load-bearing structures such as aircraft beams，frames and panels. Since critical problems such as stress concentration and high working stress exist in the local areas such as holes，grooves，sockets and joints of aircraft，fatigue cracks are easy to occur under alternating load during service，restricting the service life of aircraft structures and even affecting flight safety. As a novel surface plastic-strengthening technology，Laser Shock Peening （LSP） can significantly improve the fatigue performance by imparting compressive residual stress and improving microstructure in the surface layer of the material without changing the material and structure size. Engineering applications of LSP have been realized in the U. S. F-22，F-35 and other aircraft. In this paper，the research progress and unsolved problems in LSP of typical aircraft structures including holes，welding，chamfers and high-bearing regions are deeply discussed. Besides，the research history and development characteristics of LSP of aircraft structures in recent years are analyzed and summarized. Moreover，research prospects are made from the aspects of equipment，mechanism，process and engineering application. By systematically teasing the research progress and technical problems，this paper aims to clarify the theoretical support and key technology required for future engineering application，facilitate the rapid development and collaboration of related innovation and industrial chains，and promote the large-scale application of LSP technology in anti-fatigue manufacturing and life-extension repairing of aircraft structures in China.,"Nie, Xiangfan;Li, Yang;Wang, Yazhou;Wan, Quanhong;He, Weifeng",Journal,Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica,2023-12-25,Chengdu Aircraft Design and Research Institute;Air Force Engineering University China,aircraft structures ;  anti-fatigue manufacturing ;  fatigue performance ;  laser shock peening ;  life-extension repairing

"Summary Report APE 2023, 10-12 January, Berlin, Germany Berlin Re-Visited: Building Technological Support for Scholarship and Scientific Publishing","This paper summarizes the 18th Academic Publishing in Europe (APE) Conference: Berlin Re-Visited: Building Technological Support for Scholarship and Scientific Publishing, held as a hybrid event 10 and 11 January 2023, and organized by the Berlin Institute of Scholarly Publishing (BISP), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing publishers, researchers, funders, and policymakers together. This year's conference theme “Out with the old, in with the new!” was discussed and presented in keynote speeches, the APE lecture, and several panel discussions. Current challenges within scholarly publishing, e.g., with research integrity, trust, and research assessment, have much to do with the old ways of doing things. To move science forward, new technologies and innovations, like the decentralized web, FAIR digital objects, and blockchain technology are needed to shape new paradigms. In many sessions it was stressed that not just new technologies are needed to move science forward, but human collaboration and partnerships as well. The changing role of the journal and the importance to recognize more diverse research outputs, beyond the journal article, was a topic of importance. Not only research assessment reforms and improved collaboration amongst different stakeholder groups are needed to address this, new publishing systems, better metadata, and open infrastructures as well. A session presenting different start-ups showcased how Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and software technology can be used to tackle problems in e.g., finding relevant funders and peer reviewers, and detecting image plagiarism. It was also discussed what publishers can do to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Collaboration, data transparency and sharing best practices amongst researchers, funders, and policy makers are key. Another important topic during this year's APE was how publishers can support Early Career Researchers: establishing new workflows and infrastructures that enable publication of a wider range of research outputs, and broader recognition of these outputs, will incentivize ECRs. This year's APE was concluded with the APE Award Ceremony. The winner - Vsevolod Solovyov from Prophy - has used AI to enhance the current peer review system and made a very important contribution to improving the scholarly communication system.","Duine, Maaike",Journal,Information Services and Use,2023-12-22,,APE 2023 ;  artificial intelligence (AI) ;  data management ;  diversity and equity ;  early career researcher ;  FAIR digital objects ;  FAIR principles ;  inclusion ;  innovation ;  nanopublications ;  open access ;  open infrastructure ;  open science ;  paper mills ;  persistent identifiers ;  predatory journals ;  publishing trends ;  research assessment ;  research integrity ;  research metrics ;  research outputs ;  scholarly communication ;  scholarly infrastructure ;  scholarly record ;  sustainability ;  Sustainable development goals
Epistemic Metadata for Computational Engineering Information Systems,"Digitalization is a priority for innovation in the engineering sciences. The digital transformation requires making the knowledge claims from scientific research data machine-actionable, so that they can be integrated and analysed with minimal human intervention. Up until now, the depth of digitalization is often too shallow, with annotations that are only of use to a human reader. In addition, digital infrastructures and their metadata standards are tedious to use: They demand too much effort from researchers, much of which goes into metadata that contribute nothing to an improved reuse of knowledge. These shortcomings are related. Data documentation and annotation are complicated and of little use whenever the metadata that make knowledge reusable are not prioritized. Addressing this gap, we discuss metadata standardization efforts targeted at documenting the knowledge status of data; we refer to such an annotation as epistemic metadata. We propose a schema for epistemic metadata, with a focus on knowledge and reproducibility claims, that is designed to be user-friendly and flexible enough to apply to a spectrum of circumstances and validity assessments. These developments are implemented as part of the PIMS-II ontology. They were conducted in line with requirements procured through a case study on papers and claims from molecular modelling and simulation.","Horsch, Martin Thomas;Chiacchiera, Silvia;Guevara Carrión, Gabriela;Kohns, Maximilian;Müller, Erich A.;Šarić, Denis;Stephan, Simon;Todorov, Ilian T.;Vrabec, Jadran;Schembera, Björn",Book Series,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,2023-12-21,Rheinland-Pfälzische Technische Universität Kaiserslautern-Landau;Universität Stuttgart;Imperial College London;Technische Universität Berlin;Norges Miljø- og Biovitenskapelige Universitet;Daresbury Laboratory,Applied ontology ;  epistemic metadata ;  process data technology
Human-machine interface improving quality of patient care,"Care for patients needs doctors and nurses to communicate well with one other. There is a growing need for a two-way communication not just within the team but also with the medical equipment used to track and manage patients' conditions. Most HCIs include some kind of visual or aural display, and they have been the source of well-documented worries despite much testing. Remarkably few interfaces look at the benefits of multimodal communication despite abundant research that proves the brain's sensitivity to multimodal inputs. One of the most promising cutting-edge technical disciplines nowadays is medicine, thanks to the explosion of recent scientific knowledge and technological innovation in the field. As allowing users to automate their lives (by controlling everyday chores with just their minds) and even enjoy themselves, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has broadened the definition of rehabilitation beyond its traditional medical context (hands-free gaming). This chapter examines the current state of the art in HMI design as it pertains to the field of biomedical engineering, with a focus on its potential for facilitating direct brain-computer interface. This strategy relies on the creation of a revolutionary miniaturized system for the covert detection of a biological signal via the use of sensors incorporated into an advanced HMI. This chapter explains current research that may have future relevance in human-computer interface design (HMI). The development of a low-cost mechanism for improving medical communication would have far-reaching effects on patient care and the expanding medical technology industry.","Sharma, Rishav;Malviya, Rishabha",Book,Human Machine Interface: Making Healthcare Digital,2023-12-19,Galgotias University,Amplitude envelope ;  Auditory alarms ;  Brain-computer interface ;  Human-machine interface
Criteria-based comparsion of Systems Engineering and agile methods A fundamental comparison of two development methods,"This paper compares two popular design methods used in product development, namely Systems Engineering (SE) and agile methods. The comparison is based on various criteria, such as ease of implementation, object of innovation, software-dependency, customer relations, human centricity, organizational structure, values, and innovative capability, which were developed in a previous paper. The content of the comparison is supported by a literature review and a workshop with industry professionals. The findings show that both SE and agile methods have similarities and differences based on the criteria examined, and the choice of methodology depends on the project's specific context and objectives. While this paper provides only a general overview of each criterion and their compatibility, the results can assist product development teams in selecting the most appropriate approach for their needs. However, more research is necessary to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of both approaches. This paper is a useful resource for practitioners and researchers interested in understanding the similarities and differences between SE and Agile and making informed decisions regarding their use.","Humpert, Lynn;Mundt, Enrik;Bretz, Lukas;Anacker, Harald;Bretz, Vanessa;Dumitrescu, Roman",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-12-16,Fraunhofer Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design IEM;Miele & Cie.

Civil engineers must embrace innovation to ensure hospitals keep pace with demand,"The science of healthcare is constantly evolving, making it vital that medical facilities can keep pace with change. To meet this challenge, civil engineers and the construction industry in general must embrace innovation. Only if they start approaching medical facilities differently will it be possible to construct buildings that are as adaptable as the medical technology, discoveries and methodologies they are home to. A recent example is the challenge faced by the Christie NHS Foundation Trust - the UK's leading experts in cancer care, research and education - in the design of the new Paterson cancer research centre in Manchester, which opened in May 2023. The team knew that in as little as a decade the research happening under the Paterson building's roof might look very different from the research happening today. The building also had to house three different leading organisations - the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, the University of Manchester and Cancer Research UK - to enable closer collaboration and embrace the ethos of team science, helping to make the centre one of the leading cancer research and treatment hubs in the world. This meant flexibility and adaptability were vital to the building from the offset.","Ellis, Adam",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Civil Engineering,2023-12-15,Arup Group Limited,

"Path mechanism and spatial spillover effect of green technology innovation on agricultural CO<inf>2</inf> emission intensity: A case study in Jiangsu Province, China","Green technology innovation (GTI) is one of the most important factors influencing agricultural carbon emission intensity (ACEI). Various studies have explored the impact of GTI on ACEI, but the path mechanism has not been fully explained. This study incorporates GTI and ACEI into the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function and constructs a theoretical model to analyse their direct impact mechanisms. Drawing on the substitution effect theory and the Marshall–Arrow–Romer (MAR) externalities theory, this study introduces two regulatory mechanisms: optimization of energy structure and agricultural industry agglomeration (AIG). Additionally, it explores the pathway mechanisms under the influence of spatial spillover effects based on Tobler's first law of geography. Then, taking Jiangsu Province in China as a case study, empirical tests are conducted using LSDVC and dynamic spatial SAR models. The results are as follows. (1) GTI effectively inhibits ACEI directly, and has significantly positive spatial spillover effects on ACEI reduction in the short and long terms. (2) Energy structure optimization positively regulates the effect of GTI on ACEI reduction, and energy structure optimization in nearby cities may help GTI restrain ACEI in the local city in the short term. (3) AIG has a positive regulating effect on GTI reducing ACEI, and the moderating effect of AIG has positive spillover effects in the short term. (4) When both regulatory pathways are employed simultaneously, the moderating effect of AIG in local or neighbouring areas is expected to become ineffective. These findings are useful for solving the problem of ACEI reduction by managing the transfer and distribution of GTI between different regions, considering spatial spillover and moderating effects.","Rong, Jing;Hong, Jun;Guo, Quan;Fang, Zhou;Chen, Shikun",Journal,Ecological Indicators,2023-12-15,Tianjin University of Finance and Economics;Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden Chinese Academy of Sciences;Suzhou Polytechnic Institute of Agriculture,Agricultural carbon emission intensity ;  dynamic SAR model ;  Green technology innovation ;  LSDVC ;  Moderating effect ;  Spatial spillover effect

The impact of corporate environmental responsibility on green technology innovation: An empirical analysis of listed companies in China's construction industry,"How to enhance competitiveness in the green building market and achieve green sustainable development is a challenge that construction industry enterprises face. To explore the impact and mechanism of corporate environmental responsibility (CER) on green technology innovation (GTI), this article selects data from listed construction companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share from 2011 to 2020 for empirical analysis. The results show the following: ① Improving the level of CER in the construction industry can promote GTI. ② Financing constraints only mediate the impact of CER on strategic GTI and have no effect on real GTI. ③ The educational background of the executive team positively moderates the promotion of CER on GTI. ④ The ownership nature of state-owned enterprises exhibits a negative moderating effect on CER's influence on strategic GTI, while its moderating effect on real GTI is not significant. ⑤ Media attention positively moderates the promotion effect of CER on strategic GTI, while its promotion effect on real GTI is not significant. After potential endogeneity issues are considered and a series of robustness tests is conducted, these conclusions still hold. The research findings help reveal the relationship between CER and GTI and provide references from the perspective of environmental responsibility for promoting the sustainable development of enterprises.","Xu, Jianwei;Liu, Shuxin",Journal,Energy and Buildings,2023-12-15,Fujian University of Technology,Construction industry ;  Corporate environmental responsibility ;  Financing constraints ;  Green technology innovation ;  Sustainable development
Know-why? and know-how? in the development of nuclear talents: An analysis of recent nuclear engineering Ph. D. research,"The relationship between the industry and academia is widely considered the key driver or obstacle in producing and using new knowledge. This is, at least in part, a consequence of different forms of knowledge being of different utility for the industry and academia (conceptual, e.g., why? and procedural, e.g., how?). In so-called “high-tech” industries, where the attraction and development of new talents are in significant part carried out through academic research-based higher education system, successful cooperation in the development of new knowledge automatically results in successful attraction and development of new talents. In well-established, strongly regulated, and very procedural industries, such as nuclear power, the pragmatic focus on procedural over conceptual knowledge may also result in the pathways of talent development outside of the research-based higher education system. Some definitions, features, and risks of different approaches to conceptual and procedural knowledge are outlined and discussed in the paper and an attempt is made to connect them with the notions of basic and applied research. It is suggested that suitable sequences and balance of know-why? and know-how? may lead to the best results in the attraction and development of new nuclear talents, while minimizing the risks of reduced ability to manage unexpected, reduced need for innovation and weakening the nuclear knowledge centers outside of the industry and regulators. This is supported by an analysis of 51 Ph.D. theses in nuclear engineering developed in Slovenia since 1993 to discern their contributions towards basic or applied research. The Pasteur's quadrant, developed by (Stokes, 1997), was used as the underlying framework. Ph.D. graduates and supervisors were independently asked to evaluate the basic and applied contributions through three variables, describing the stages of the creative research process: input, processing, and output, respectively. The predominantly mixed (basic and applied) contributions of the analyzed Ph.D. theses indicate that academic nuclear engineering education is an enabler of successful careers in academia and industry.","Cizelj, Leon;Kljenak, Ivo;Tiselj, Iztok",Journal,Nuclear Engineering and Design,2023-12-15,"Univerza v Ljubljani;Institut ""Jožef Stefan""",Applied research ;  Basic research ;  Careers of nuclear graduates ;  Conceptual knowledge ;  Education ;  Nuclear engineering ;  Procedural knowledge ;  Training

Pedagogical innovation in engineering education: Technology and flipped classroom,"Pedagogical innovation is one of the constant challenges in Higher Education because it combines frameworks of educational systems, adaptation to society's changes and needs for employment, curricula, technological transformations and recent trends in research in the area of education and pedagogy. This article aims toanalyze the challenges of pedagogical and technological innovation and present the flipped classroom model as one of the successful strategies in current pedagogy, namely in Higher Education. Nowadays, in active learning, the studenttakes on a more active mission, in which he solves problems, develops projects and creates opportunities for the construction of knowledge. This concept has been promoted through several strategies using research, gamification, Problem Based Learning (PBL) and the ""flipped classroom""concept, which MIT and Harvard have used and deeply researched. These universities have explored innovation and educational technologies, with a focus on the student, who studies before class, making the classroom an active learning space, with practical activities, accompanied by theteacher, who now has a new mission, different from the traditional content presentation. Therefore, the theoretical basis of the article is focused on pedagogical and technological innovation, active methodologies and the strategy of the ""flipped classroom"". The coronavirus pandemic has turned the world upside down and made us take a fresh look at innovative blended learning technologies and, in particular, flipped classroom technology. The article discusses theprinciples on which the learning process in the ""flipped classroom""model should be based. The platforms and services that provide the most effective transfer of materials to students for study and are maximally focused on the independentwork of students are discussed. The indicators of adaptation of students to the conditions of blended learning are analyzed (actual results of educational activities; degree of student satisfaction with the results of their educational activities; self-assessment of readiness to use remote learning technologies in the educational process; formation of skills and abilities of independent work and self-organization).","Kovalenko, Olena;Cardoso, Luis;Bondarenko, Tetiana;Nesterenko, Roman",Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2023-12-07,Ukrainian State Engineering Pedagogical Academy;Politécnico de Portalegre,
AI for technological innovations and practices in engineering education,"The increasing requirements for graduates of engineering specialties are due to the growing complexity of manufactured products and technological processes. In research paper authors considered global trends and concepts of engineering education. The main ones are the increasing requirements for knowledge and skills that modern engineers must possess, and the need to bridge the gap between fundamental training and the practical application of the acquired skills. To ensure the required level, it is necessary to make adjustments to the educational process, in which a practice-oriented approach plays a significant role, being a link between theoretical disciplines and real tasks. For the most effective implementation of this approach, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between universities and industrial enterprises. The article provides examples of the use of AI in educational programs in order to solve these problems improve the quality of engineering education and better prepare graduates for solving real production problems.","Rzhevska, Nataliia;Dobroskok, Irina;Horbatiuk, Roman",Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2023-12-07,Hryhorii Skovoroda University in Pereiaslav;Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University,
Pedagogical strategies for teaching Virtual Production pipelines,"The incorporation of LED walls and virtual production tools in the film industry is a recent development that has significant pedagogical implications (BLISTEIN, 2020; FARID and TORRALBA, 2021). The use of LED walls combines physical and digital realities, potentially reducing post-production time and resource usage (ONG, 2020). Virtual production can facilitate immediate on-set decision-making and mitigate the need for certain post-production adjustments (EPIC GAMES, 2020). MIT researchers posit that such practices may also reduce the carbon footprint associated with location filming (FARID and TORRALBA, 2021). Nonetheless, further research and innovation are needed to overcome any limitations and fully harness the potential of this technology. The utilization of Unreal Engine software and other real-Time tools in visual effects education aligns with industry trends and enhances student preparedness for professional practice (FLEISCHER, 2020). It has been suggested that engaging students with these tools can foster an understanding of the virtual production pipeline, thus aligning the educational curriculum with evolving industry standards (BALSAMO et al., 2021). As educators at Auckland University of Technology, we recognized the necessity of early integration of these paradigm-shifting tools into our curriculum to prepare students for impending and ongoing industry changes. In anticipation of procuring LED walls, we explored the potential of leveraging existing resources to initiate a pedagogical foray into the virtual production sphere. The available resources encompassed a large green screen studio, a motion capture studio, and virtual reality (VR) headsets and trackers. This paper offers two pedagogical responses that were deployed in courses situated in the final (third) year of undergraduate studies for an Animation, Visual Effects and Game Design Major, Bachelor of Design, at the School of Art and Design, Auckland University of Technology. One course is positioned within a motion capture minor and the other an option within a major capstone project framework. These two responses form case studies in the technical modification of existing teaching equipment and the need to push the limits of existing software and hardware resources within the attendant budgetary constraints of a tertiary education institution. This, in turn, is in the service of meeting shifting tertiary curriculum demands in response to a technologically fluid and future-focused industry.","Bennett, Gregory;Najafi, Hossein;Jackson, Lee",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Educators Forum, SA 2023",2023-12-06,Auckland University of Technology,compositing ;  computer graphics ;  education ;  motion capture ;  virtual production ;  virtual reality
Organizational innovation and its relationship with the performance of Ecuadorian public companies,"Due to the uncertain environment, companies are looking for strategies to motivate their workers to improve innovation capabilities that positively affect their performance. This research analyzes the relationship between organizational innovation and performance of the Public Company of General Services and Engineering of the Technical University of Manabí, Ecuador. A questionnaire was applied to identify the types of organizational innovation with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.802 and another to diagnose the performance of the Public Company, which obtained a coefficient of 0.985. The data were processed with SPSS 23. The informants were the 7 workers who worked in the company during the confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed a Spearman correlation coefficient of-.764, which shows an inverse relationship between organizational innovation and business performance: the more innovative the company is from an organizational perspective, its performance tends to decrease. It is concluded that the results of the correlation may be due to the process of assimilation of organizational innovations or the level of stress that workers may have experienced while adapting to them during confinement.","Arteaga Ampuero, Jenniffer Monserrate;Flores Urbáez, Matilde Josefina",Journal,Revista Venezolana de Gerencia,2023-12-06,Universidad Técnica de Manabí,business performance ;  Organizational innovation ;  public companies ;  types of organizational innovation
Cation exchange doping by transition and non-transition metals: embracing luminescence for band gap tunability in a ZnS lattice,"When designing sensors for optoelectronic devices, fluorescent materials are always the choice of material chemists. Among the existing fluorescent molecules, the most widely used sensing materials are colloidal nanocrystals, which are classified as quantum dots (QDs). Photoluminescence and tuning of the band gap are the two domains that are explored while engineering optically active crystals. The selection of dopants in a host lattice is the initial step towards achieving the material of choice and designing tailor-made stable materials. Among various QD materials, doped ZnS quantum dots have emerged as a fascinating class, showcasing distinctive characteristics resulting from both transition and non-transition metal doping. This work reviews recent developments in the synthesis, structural characterization, and applications of transition and non-transition metal-doped ZnS quantum dots. Transition metal doping, involving elements such as Mn, Co, and Cu, imparts remarkable photoluminescence properties to QDs, rendering them suitable for optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes and displays. Non-transition metal doping, involving elements such as Al, Mg, and Ga, facilitates bandgap engineering, paving the way for enhanced light absorption and utilization in photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Transition and non-transition metal-doped ZnS quantum dots exhibit diverse applications across multiple domains. In the field of biomedicine, their biocompatibility, tunable fluorescence, and ability to generate reactive oxygen species under light irradiation present opportunities for cellular imaging and photodynamic therapy. Moreover, their integration into composite materials holds the potential for enhanced electronic and optoelectronic device performance. Challenges in this field include achieving precise control over dopant concentrations, uniformity, and stability, while also addressing scalability issues for large-scale production. Future directions include exploring novel doping strategies, co-doping schemes, and surface functionalization techniques to further enhance the properties of doped ZnS quantum dots. In conclusion, transition and non-transition metal-doped zinc sulphide quantum dots showcase a realm of exciting possibilities for technological innovation. Their unique properties, enabled by judicious dopant incorporation, make them valuable materials for applications spanning optoelectronics, energy conversion, and biomedical sciences. As research in this field advances, these doped quantum dots are poised to significantly contribute to the progression of next-generation technologies.","Pandey, Tejasvi;Singh, Abhishek;Kaundal, Rajinder Singh;Pandey, Vivek",Journal,New Journal of Chemistry,2023-12-06,Lovely Professional University,
An Operations Management Perspective on Design Thinking,"Over the past 20 years, design thinking as an innovation approach has received substantial and increasing interest from both practice and academia. Companies have hired Chief Design Officers, trained their employees in design thinking, and acquired entire design firms. Similarly, academic researchers across a substantial variety of fields have tried to identify the successful application of design thinking tools, practices, and mindsets. And yet, this interest and efforts have so far not produced a reliable method in the literature on how to operationally manage design thinking successfully: a search for “design thinking” across the top 10 operations management journals over 30 years returned only three articles. A major issue behind this problem is the lack of reliable design thinking process measurements. To address this issue, I apply an operations management lens to design thinking and construct a set of literature references across multiple disciplines and domains covering the last 30 years (1992-2022). Building on a simple operations model I expand it in two directions. First, the outcome measurement is stepwise expanded to include not only the design thinking project, but also the design thinker, the team, the organization, and ultimately the society and the environment. Second, I unpack the design thinking process into its phases empathy, synthesis, ideation, and prototyping, and add considerations of the elements of the overall process gestalt and team diversity. For each of these specific aspects of design thinking, I identify the current state of knowledge in the literature and provide suggestions for future research to expand the current frontier. This analysis produces major insights in two arenas. One insight is that the better measures that are needed for the study of the operations of design thinking processes will have to be more complex by integrating multiple dimensions of process metrics and performance outcomes. To accomplish this will require more interdisciplinary work beyond operations management, including disciplines such as organizational behavior, ethics, psychology, design, engineering, and systems thinking. The second insight suggests that the increasing diffusion of digital tools, especially the rapidly evolving world of data science and artificial intelligence, across innovation work such as design thinking, will reshape many, if not all, of the process steps involved. Both arenas offer fertile ground for future research on design thinking for operations management.","Fixson, Sebastian",Journal,"Foundations and Trends in Technology, Information and Operations Management",2023-12-04,Babson College,
China s silk technology innovation since the reform and opening up from the perspective of state science and technology awards,China s silk industry has a long history and advanced technology but it gradually declined in modern times. With the establishment of the People s Republic of China in 1949 silk production gradually increased and until the reform and opening up in 1978 it achieved great development in science and technology. Science and technology awards provide material and spiritual rewards for scientific discoveries and technological inventions. The state science and technology awards are one type of science and technology awards. They are currently the highest awards for science and technology in China. They have officially resumed awards since the reform and opening up in 1978. Currently there are five awards. The silk award in the state science and technology awards represents the highest level of China s silk technology and is also a witness to the development of silk technology since the reform and opening up. According to the statistics of this paper the silk industry won 54 awards with focus on the three awards of the State Natural Science Award the State Technological Invention Award and the State Scientific and Technological Progress Award. In this paper the issue of the state science and technology awards was divided into three time stages 1979 1985 1986 1999 and 2000 2020 and 54 silk award￣winning achievements were divided into two parts sericulture and industry. The quantitative change regional distribution transfer of research and development subjects and the growth and decline of award￣winning industries were analyzed and the characteristics laws and trends were further summarized to provide historical reference for future silk technology innovation. Five conclusions were drawn. First the number and proportion of the state science and technology awards for silk decreased but the quality increased which was in line with the reform trend of China s science and technology award system. Second the largest number of silk awards in the Yangtze River Delta region shows that its silk research was in a leading position in China and had the characteristics of complementary sericulture and industry. The award￣winning projects in other eight regions with relatively advanced silk technology were either sericulture or industry. Third based on the type of the first contributor with the largest contribution and a leading role for statistics the award￣winning research institutions regarding sericulture had always been dominated by scientific research institutes in the three stages while the award￣winning research institutions in the silk industry had experienced a transfer from enterprises to universities. This shows that the current scientific research capabilities of silk enterprises have not been fully utilized. In the future silk enterprises should strengthen scientific research innovation and conduct more cooperation. Fourth silkworm varieties received the most awards in sericulture followed by silkworm diseases and silkworm medicines mulberry trees and comprehensive utilization of silk resources. The focus of scientific research changed from silkworm diseases and silkworm medicines to silkworm varieties in the three stages and the main objective changed from increasing production to improving quality. The industry received the most awards for machinery and equipment followed by dyeing and finishing silk weaving and silk reeling. The focus of scientific research changed from machinery and equipment to dyeing and finishing in the three stages and the main objective changed from improving both production scale and product quality to mainly improving production quality. Fifth the accumulation of scientific research results and the improvement of the level of science and technology provide the possibility for sericulture and industry to break barriers and realize the extension of the industrial chain. In the future the silk industry may achieve subversive development in genetic engineering and biomaterials.,"Zhang, Ninghui;Yang, Xiaoming",Journal,Journal of Silk,2023-12-02,Donghua University,industry ;  regional distribution ;  scientific research unit ;  sericulture ;  silk ;  state science and technology awards ;  technological innovation
Research on a Novel Terminal Water Supply System Based on the Diversion Process,"The pipeline direct drinking water system (PDDWS) has emerged to ensure the quality of direct drinking water. Nevertheless, the existing literature suggests that the PDDWS suffers from inherent structural technological deficiencies, and various internal and external factors hinder its reliability, which raise concerns about the scientific and rational basis of the PDDWS. To address these issues, a new-type terminal differentiated water system (TDWS) is proposed to establish an efficient and health-oriented household water supply system. A water purifier is directly installed at the user’s terminal, and, due to its diversion process, differentiated water is provided, including direct drinking water, clean water and flushing water. Direct drinking water can be produced on demand, without secondary contamination. Clean water is also not stored, thus preventing microbial growth and ensuring superior water quality compared to tap water, suitable for kitchen usage. Flushing water is mixed with tap water for laundry, bathing and toilet flushing. Engineering verification has demonstrated that the quality of the direct drinking water and the clean water exceeds national standards. With the diversion process, the TDWS exhibits benefits related to health, the economy, applicability and environmental friendliness, and it can serve as a supplement and innovation for the PDDWS.","Sun, Wanghu;Sun, Yuning;Zhang, Yuan;Hong, Xiaochun",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-12-01,University of Science and Technology of China;Yangzhou University,automatic flushing ;  diversion process ;  environmental friendliness ;  pipeline direct drinking water systems ;  secondary contamination ;  terminal differentiated water system ;  wastewater discharge

Construction and rethinking on public service platform for autonomous driving test,"To promote the development of autonomous driving technology in China, by conducting a comprehensive survey and adhering to the principles of instrumental design, the transportation and vehicle engineering discipline of the National Natural Science Foundation of China proposed a public service platform for autonomous driving tests (OnSite). The platform embodied the principles of socially co-constructed scenario library, agile development environment, system-under-test decoupling, lightweight test deployment, and transparent test result sharing. To ensure the independent development and smooth operation of the public service platform, the strategic committee, technical committee, user committee, and innovation foundation were set up through the self-decision-making. In 2021, research in this field was launched rapidly through the support of general programs by the transportation and vehicle engineering discipline. From 2022, research related to the autonomous driving technology testing was supported by the key and general programs. The construction of the OnSite platform was promoted, and the organized scientific research was actively carried out. A five-stage construction plan for the public service platform was devised, which follows the steps of single-item decision-making and planning testing, from single-item testing to full-stack testing, from virtual testing to virtual-real fusion testing, from single-vehicle testing to fleet testing, and from testing-orientation to development testing. The first phase of the construction goals was accomplished, and the testing capability for the single-item decision-making and planning functions was developed. Relying on the OnSite platform, the First OnSite Autonomous Driving Algorithm Competition was successfully held by the transportation and vehicle engineering discipline, which assisted researchers in pinpointing research gaps and promoted the realization of a demand-driven and problem-oriented research paradigm. It broke the barriers between the scientific research institutions and the industrial sectors and realized the accurate and rapid docking among industry, academia, and research.

Research on Processor Value Prediction,"The extreme imbalance between processor performance and memory bandwidth/latency limits the overall performance of computing systems. In the post-Moore era, it is challenging to obtain processor performance benefits through the iteration of the integrated circuit manufacturing process, and memory performance is not sensitive to the process. Therefore, people tend to obtain higher-performance computing systems through architectural innovation. Processor value prediction technology is a solution that can effectively alleviate the memory wall problem without changing the storage system. By speculatively breaking the true dependency of data, more instructions can be executed in parallel in an out-of-order processor. There is no need to wait for the execution of long-cycle instructions caused by memory access, etc. In recent years, value prediction has made significant progress in various aspects. However, no commercial processors are using this technology, mainly because the development of value prediction technology still faces many challenges: the pipeline architecture of existing processors cannot directly use value prediction techniques; the register file read and write ports required for value prediction are physically challenging to implement; the huge storage overhead of the value predictor makes it difficult to implement on-chip; due to the significant performance loss when the value prediction is wrong, the value predictors with low prediction accuracy will reduce processor performance. In response to these problems, this paper focuses on value prediction technology. It discusses in detail the research at home and abroad and its solutions to problems and challenges around the value prediction pipeline architecture, value predictor structure, and misprediction recovery mechanism related to value prediction technology. Finally, this paper summarizes processor value prediction techniques and provides an outlook on future research directions.","Huang, Li Bo;Yang, Ling;Yang, Qian Ming;Ma, Sheng;Wang, Yong Wen;Sui, Bing Cai;Shen, Li;Xu, Wei Xia",Journal,Tien Tzu Hsueh Pao/Acta Electronica Sinica,2023-12-01,National University of Defense Technology China;Key Laboratory of Advanced Microprocessor Chips and Systems,data dependency ;  memory wall ;  pipeline ;  processor ;  superscalar ;  value prediction
Innovative Teaching-Learning Method for Engineering Mathematics Through Video Lectures in Rural Areas,"Mathematics is an important subject required for the foundation and has applications in all branches of engineering. Mathematical knowledge and skills are required for higher study, developing new technology and innovations. But creating students' interest in learning activities is always a challenging task for every mathematics teacher. Many engineering students are failing in the first year of their studies. This problem becomes more important and challenging in rural areas. There is always a concern about the problem that why students are not taking interest in learning? Out of many possible ways to deal with this problem, the use of flipped classrooms (FCR) plays an important role. This paper deals with the use of FCR for engineering students from rural areas. In addition to classroom teaching, for technology-based learning, video lectures (VLs) are provided to students of first-year engineering for the subject of engineering mathematics. Starting with a review of FCR, experimentation of VLs, and its impact on learning activities and result has been presented. Various surveys at different levels and examination results are considered for conclusions. Through this action research, we have shown that VL is one of the most useful tools for enhancing learning and improving the results of students in rural areas. It has been further shown that this method is very much accepted by students.","Hiwarekar, A.

The shale revolution and basic geological theory problems of shale and tight oil and gas,"The shale revolution has weaned the US from its dependence on imported oil and gas to become a net exporter. This paper reviews the history of the shale revolution in the United States, summarizes the characteristics of shale oil and tight oil and gas, analyzes the development status of the shale oil and gas revolution in China, and puts forward the basic geological theory of shale oil and tight oil and gas. The research shows that: (A) The United States has advantages such as good resource endowment, strong scientific and technological innovation ability, huge investment capacity, and strong engineering construction capacity, and has already realized the shale revolution. China's shale revolution is now under way. (B) Compared with conventional oil and gas, shale oil and tight oil and gas have different accumulation modes and development methods. They have the characteristics of continuous large-area distribution, self-sealing oil and gas accumulations, huge development and production engineering, and the ""distributed"" characteristics of oil and gas field production can flexibly cope with the characteristics of production reduction and low recovery. (C) Seven conditions need to be met for the further production of shale oil and gas in China: These are (1) Clear resources; (2) Mature horizontal well and fracturing technology; (3) The cost is controllable; (4) The engineering space of enhanced oil recovery in the late stage is large; (5) Meet environmental requirements; (6) Adequate capital investment; (7) Strong engineering construction ability. (D) The whole oil and gas system has a sequence of conventional oil and gas, tight oil and gas and shale oil and gas. Shale oil and gas and tight oil and gas reservoirs have the basic characteristics of tight reservoirs, complex fluid composition and phase state, and diverse reservoir driving modes, and we are faced with the problem of unclear reservoir geological and flow models. It is necessary to carry out further theoretical research of the whole oil and gas system, and vigorously develop sweet spot evaluation technology and fracturing technology.","Jia, Chengzao;Jiang, Lin;Zhao, Wen",Journal,Petroleum Science Bulletin,2023-12-01,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;China National Petroleum Corporation,basic geological theory problem ;  shale oil and gas ;  shale revolution ;  tight oil and gas
Policy destruction and creation. A systems engineering approach to organizational innovation,"Throughout history, the armed forces have responded with innovations to perceived strategic challenges posed by the evolving dynamics of conflict. Research has served as the means to address these challenges, yielding innovation as a tangible outcome. The confusion between objectives and outcomes is common but should be avoided. For instance, rather than prioritizing the pursuit of profit, prosperous corporations with enduring lifespans consistently engage in strategic problem-solving. Similarly, organizations striving for innovation should prioritize identifying and solving strategic problems. Such problems may vague and exist only in the minds of leaders yet be concrete enough to cause discomfort. Confronting them is challenging, as the strategic body of knowledge lacks the necessary tools to diagnose problem symptoms and prescribe remedial action. Hence, the term “destruction” acknowledges that current approaches fall short when addressing strategic problems. In turn “creation” suggests adopting mathematical modeling and Systems Engineering methods to gain insights into the symptoms, to formulate and validate solutions, and to develop execution plans. A NATO case study illustrates this approach, whose primary drawback lies in the educational requirements prior to achieving widespread adoption.","Pedro Mendes, J.;Água, Pedro B.",Journal,Direccion y Organizacion,2023-12-01,CINAV – Portuguese Navy Research Center;Instituto Superior Técnico,Innovation ;  policy design ;  strategic problems ;  symptoms ;  systems
Enhanced oil recovery in complex reservoirs: Challenges and methods,"Enhanced oil recovery draws increasingly interests from the research and development phases to oilfield implementation worldwide. Due to the complexity of the developed reservoirs and requirement of carbon footprint reduction, new innovations are urgently needed to increase enhanced oil recovery efficiency and/or reduce emissions simultaneously. This paper presents the strategies to improve the enhanced oil recovery performance of carbon dioxide flooding, polymer flooding and imbibition in complex reservoirs. Field trials conducted at Mahu reservoirs demonstrated the potential of nanoemulsion imbibition in stimulating tight oil recovery. These results can provide constructive envision for the development and application of enhanced oil recovery technologies for challenging systems.","Wu, Runnan;Wei, Bing;Li, Songyan;Zhang, Yan;Luo, Qiang",Journal,Advances in Geo-Energy Research,2023-12-01,State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering;China University of Petroleum (East China);Southwest Petroleum University China;China National Petroleum Corporation,CO -enhanced oil recovery and storage 2 ;  complex reservoirs ;  Enhanced oil recovery ;  self-adaptive polymer
Architects and Engineers in the Digital Communication Age. A Study in the North-East of Italy,"The development of digital technologies can alter the professional fields. In this essay we will analyse the potential and risks of ICT for Friulian engineers and architects. To do this we will use two research methods-the first research method is qualitative and consists of 15 semi-structured interviews administered to experts; the second is quantitative and consists in a survey involving 329 architects and 335 engineers, using techniques of descriptive statistics. We will firstly evaluate the impact of BIM, 3D printing and robotics on professional practices and secondly identify and study the most important factors for the use of digital technologies. Starting from the public policies that the institutions insisting on Friuli Venezia Giulia have put in place, we will assess what kind of training of professionals (in a lifelong learning perspective) can play a significant role in supporting the innovation process of architects and engineers in the Friuli area.","Giacomini, Gabriele",Journal,Italian Journal of Sociology of Education,2023-12-01,,architecture ;  digital technologies ;  engineering ;  ICTs ;  lifelong learning ;  professions
Research on the motivation of “Manufacturing chain + Platform” dual mode value co-creation based on system dynamics,"A supply chain with the manufacturing company at its core is usually referred to as a manufacturing chain. Constructing the “Manufacturing chain + platform” dual mode by building a platform based on the manufacturing chain is an important way for China’s traditional manufacturing industry to achieve digitalization and service transformation. Based on value co-creation theory, starting from the structure of dual-mode value co-creation system, this paper systematically analyzes the internal and external motivations of dual-mode value co-creation and their realization mechanism. By relationalizing the mechanism, an overall causal loop diagram of the system is formed to fully capture the feedback effects among the factors. On this basis, in order to understand the path and degree of the influence of each factor on the value co-creation system from a dynamic perspective, and then identify the key factors affecting the effect of dual-mode value co-creation, this study constructs a system dynamics model and conducts simulation experiments by using Vensim software. It is found that resource, relationship, and network structural motivations differentially contribute to value co-creation, and the technological innovation indirectly influences value co-creation through acting on the internal structural motivation. In the early stage, the flow and innovation of diverse resources and the integration and collaboration of complementary resources take the lead in stimulating the accumulation of co-creation value; in the middle stage, the building of explicit relationships and the strengthening of the interaction of implicit relationships on the platform can effectively maintain the vitality of multi-subject value co-creation; and the expansion of the scale of subjects driven by the network effect is the key aspect of the final formation of dual-mode ecology. Moreover, improving the compound ability of the focal enterprise, platform technology investment and cross-side network effect can significantly improve the value co-creation effect of dual mode and the accumulation of subject scale; reducing customer learning cost has a certain contribution to the increase of the number of subjects, but has a less significant effect on co-creation value; while the professional ability of supply-side partners has a weaker impact on the value co-creation effect and ecological construction of dual mode.","Li, Yongjian;Li, Jiajia;Sun, Xiaochen;Bai, Xuanming",Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2023-12-01,Tianjin University,simulation analysis ;  system dynamics ;  value co-creation driving factor ;  “manufacturing chain + platform” dual-mode
The Innovation Landscape After the Covid-19 Crisis and During the Energy Crisis,"The aim of this paper is finding an answer to a question how the current crises caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and changes in the energy sector have affected research and development and innovation? It seems likely that the COVID-19 crisis caused financial weakness for many actors, having the most significant impact on the willingness or ability of smaller firms to support R&D and innovation. However, where firms are able to sustain these investments, they will be more likely to survive, grow more strongly, and have higher profitability. A big challenge that companies face is energy changes. While the post-pandemic effects were slowly brought under control by enterprises, the energy crisis poses new challenges to companies. And here the most important challenge is not just financing, but sometimes a complete change in the line of products offered, by moving away from traditional energy sources based on oil and gas. The subjects of the analysis are companies in Poland engaged in continuous research and development activities and implementing innovations. This research was conducted by the Ayming Institute in several editions, starting in 2020, and the surveyed companies belonged to seven identified sectors: Chemical and Civil Engineering, IT & Telecoms, Energy & Biotech, Automotive & Industrial, Consumer Goods & Manufacturing, Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals and Finance & Capital.","Karpińska, Kinga",Journal,"Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric",2023-12-01,Uniwersytet w Bialymstoku,COVID-19 ;  crisis ;  energy crisis ;  innovation ;  R&D
The Role of 3D Printing in Engineering and its Historical Perspective in Civil Engineering-A Review,"Printing in three dimensions has opened the door to new practices and set new standards in a number of different industries, including civil engineering. Prototypes were the first step in the development of three-dimensional printing. Currently, it manufactures specialized concrete formwork, state-of-the-art structural components, and accurate scale models for the construction of structures. In this study, the literature review is carried out for the multi-disciplinary use of 3D Printing, and the major focus is on 3D Printing in Civil Engineering. This technology has the potential to improve design flexibility as well as efficiency on construction sites, which could result in changes to building practices in civil engineering. This may revolutionize building. The field of civil engineering is gradually gravitating towards the use of 3D Printing technology because of substantial investments in research and development. Printing in three dimensions has enabled the construction of bridges and structures, in addition to other novel ideas. The conventional notion is challenged by these principles, which also make it possible to construct infrastructure that is beneficial to the economy, the environment, and the public good. The broad application of three-dimensional printing in civil engineering is a game-changer since it guides in an era of innovation in the building of infrastructure. In conclusion, the use of 3D Printing in civil engineering will make it possible to create more complex designs and speed up construction. Using this technology, sustainable infrastructure might completely change the way things are currently done and significantly increase productivity.","Sundaram, V.;Sivakumar, Vidhya Lakshmi;Raju, Anand;Saravanan, A.;Richard, Titus",Journal,SSRG International Journal of Civil Engineering,2023-12-01,Saveetha School of Engineering,3D concrete ;  3D Printing technology ;  Civil engineering ;  Historical perspective ;  Mixed-methods
Determining the Characteristics of Papers That Garner the Most Significant Impact: A Deep Dive into Mexican Engineering Publications,"Engineers make things, make things work, and make things work better and easier. This kind of knowledge is crucial for innovation, and much of the explicit knowledge developed by engineers is embodied in scientific publications. In this paper, we analyze the evolution of publications and citations in engineering in a middle-income country such as Mexico. Using a database of all Mexican publications in Web of Science from 2004 to 2017, we explore the characteristics of publications that tend to have the greatest impact; this is the highest number of citations. Among the variables studied are the type of collaboration (no collaboration, domestic, bilateral, or multilateral), the number of coauthors and countries, controlling for a coauthor from the USA, and the affiliation institution of the Mexican author(s). Our results emphasize the overall importance of joint international efforts and suggest that publications with the highest number of citations are those with multinational collaboration (coauthors from three or more countries) and when one of the coauthors is from the USA. Another interesting result is that single-authored papers have had a higher impact than those written through domestic collaboration.","Gonzalez Brambila, Claudia N.;Ponce, José I.;Gonzalez Brambila, Silvia B.;Milia, Matias F.",Journal,Publications,2023-12-01,Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana - Azcapotzalco,article citation analysis ;  collaboration ;  engineering ;  Mexico ;  research impact
"Sculpting Waves with Complex Electromagnetic Structures: 2023 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering presented to Nader Engheta, Ph.D.","Complex electromagnetic structures have been the subject of numerous studies by scientists and engineers worldwide over the last 150 years since James Clerk Maxwell postulated his now famous namesake equations in 1865. Physicists, electrical engineers, and material scientists have pondered whether one can use inclusions of various geometrical shapes, compositions, alignments, periodicity, and arrangements, distributed within a host dielectric medium, in order to alter and shape the scattering response of the medium due to an impinging incident electromagnetic wave, and as a result design materials with novel, and sometimes exotic, functionalities not found in natural materials, including those in the periodic table. In particular, Victor G. Veselago first theorized in 1967 electrodynamics of materials with Negative Permittivity and Negative Permeability, i.e., the so-called Negative Refractive Index (NRI) or Double-Negative (DNG) metamaterial. Since the 1980s many research groups worldwide have worked on both theory and applications of not only DNG but complex EM structures in general. The works of Nader Engheta stand out in depth, novelty, diversity, and scientific impact among his peers. Engheta started his work on EM materials in 1982 (his first paper on chiral media) and has since made transformative contributions and significant innovations to the theory, experimental verifications, and novel applications of complex electromagnetic structures. He is known as the father of four areas in metamaterials and complex electromagnetic structures: (i) Plasmonic cloaking, which has possible applications in cloaking sensors and antennas, reduction of co-site interference, and RCS reduction of objects. (ii) Near-zero-index metamaterials, with possible applications in supercoupling between guiding structures in both visible and invisible electromagnetic spectrum, as well as in photonic doping, flexible photonics, giant optical nonlinearity, directive thermal emission, and zero-index quantum optics. (iii) Optical lumped nanocircuits (“optical metatronics”), which has possible applications in optical processors at nanoscale, modularized photonics, wireless at nanoscale, analog computing nanomachines, and one-atom-thick optical devices. (iv) Analog computing with materials, with possible applications in information processing at nanoscale, matrix inversion with waves, analog image parallel processing, inverse scattering solvers, and parallel computing.","Hoorfar, Ahmad",Journal,Journal of the Franklin Institute,2023-12-01,Villanova University,
Dual-Core PLC for Cooperating Projects with Software Implementation,"Development of a general-purpose PLC based on a typical dual-core processor as a hardware platform is presented. The cores run two cooperating projects involving data exchange through shared memory. Such a solution is equivalent to a single-core PLC running two tasks by means of a real-time operating system. Upgrading to a typical programming tool involves defining which of the global variables are shared, and whether a variable in a particular core is read-from or written-to the shared memory. Extensions to core runtimes consist of read-from at the beginning of the scan cycle and write-to at the end, and of an algorithm for protecting the shared memory against access conflicts. As an example, the proposed solution is implemented in an engineering tool with runtime based on a virtual machine concept. The PLC prototype is based on a heterogeneous ARM dual-core STM32 microcontroller running different projects. The innovation in the research lies in showing how to run two projects in a dual-core PLC without using an operating system. Extension to multiple projects for a multi-core processor is can be accomplished in a similar manner.","Hubacz, Marcin;Trybus, Bartosz",Journal,Electronics (Switzerland),2023-12-01,Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Design Decisions of Process Bus Technology for a Distribution Utility,"Sydney, Australia is the 10th most expensive city in the world and is undergoing significant growth whilst transitioning to renewable energy sources. Innovative design principles were required to re-engineer the next generation of substations to provide a sustainable and efficient design delivery whilst maintaining a safe and reliable network. The rollout of IEC 61850 digital substations has gained momentum and popularity over the past two decades, with most protection engineers across the globe having exposure to some degree of digital substation with mixed emotions towards the transition. A small team embarked on a journey of discovery to map out the pathway to implementing simplified and successful modern digital substations to increase our organisations agility and efficiency to defer investment, reduce capital expenditure, project timelines and operational maintenance costs. This paper provides insight to the comprehensive research and development carried out and some of the design decisions which have been successfully implemented in several substations focusing on providing clarity to field technicians and protection engineering teams to demystify IEC 61850 substations. Previous experiences with Generic Object Orientated System Event (GOOSE) and Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) provided a strong foundation for the successful transition to process bus. Savings of approximately 22% in capital expenditure and 58% protection system operational costs are realised with the modernised digital substation design philosophy adopted here when compared to a conventional secondary system and brick-and-mortar build.","Robinson, R.;Armstrong, B.;Malvern, K.",Journal,CIGRE Science and Engineering,2023-12-01,Endeavour Energy,Digital Substation ;  GOOSE ;  IEC 61850 ;  Innovation ;  Process Bus ;  Sampled Values ;  Station Bus ;  Virtual Isolations
Exploring Technology- and Sensor-Driven Trends in Education: A Natural-Language-Processing-Enhanced Bibliometrics Study †,"Over the last decade, there has been a large amount of research on technology-enhanced learning (TEL), including the exploration of sensor-based technologies. This research area has seen significant contributions from various conferences, including the European Conference on Technology-Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL). In this research, we present a comprehensive analysis that aims to identify and understand the evolving topics in the TEL area and their implications in defining the future of education. To achieve this, we use a novel methodology that combines a text-analytics-driven topic analysis and a social network analysis following an open science approach. We collected a comprehensive corpus of 477 papers from the last decade of the EC-TEL conference (including full and short papers), parsed them automatically, and used the extracted text to find the main topics and collaborative networks across papers. Our analysis focused on the following three main objectives: (1) Discovering the main topics of the conference based on paper keywords and topic modeling using the full text of the manuscripts. (2) Discovering the evolution of said topics over the last ten years of the conference. (3) Discovering how papers and authors from the conference have interacted over the years from a network perspective. Specifically, we used Python and PdfToText library to parse and extract the text and author keywords from the corpus. Moreover, we employed Gensim library Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to discover the primary topics from the last decade. Finally, Gephi and Networkx libraries were used to create co-authorship and citation networks. Our findings provide valuable insights into the latest trends and developments in educational technology, underlining the critical role of sensor-driven technologies in leading innovation and shaping the future of this area.","Gomez, Manuel J.;Ruipérez-Valiente, José A.;García Clemente, Félix J.",Journal,Sensors,2023-12-01,Universidad de Murcia,bibliometrics ;  natural language processing ;  sensor-based learning ;  social network analysis ;  technology-enhanced learning
Current State of Application of Machine Learning for Investigation of MgO-C Refractories: A Review,"Nowadays, digitalization and automation in both industrial and research activities are driving forces of innovations. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely applied in these areas. A paramount direction in the application of ML models is the prediction of the material service time in heating devices. The results of ML algorithms are easy to interpret and can significantly shorten the time required for research and decision-making, substituting the trial-and-error approach and allowing for more sustainable processes. This work presents the state of the art in the application of machine learning for the investigation of MgO-C refractories, which are materials mainly consumed by the steel industry. Firstly, ML algorithms are presented, with an emphasis on the most commonly used ones in refractories engineering. Then, we reveal the application of ML in laboratory and industrial-scale investigations of MgO-C refractories. The first group reveals the implementation of ML techniques in the prediction of the most critical properties of MgO-C, including oxidation resistance, optimization of the C content, corrosion resistance, and thermomechanical properties. For the second group, ML was shown to be mostly utilized for the prediction of the service time of refractories. The work is summarized by indicating the opportunities and limitations of ML in the refractories engineering field. Above all, reliable models require an appropriate amount of high-quality data, which is the greatest current challenge and a call to the industry for data sharing, which will be reimbursed over the longer lifetimes of devices.","Sado, Sebastian;Jastrzębska, Ilona;Zelik, Wiesław;Szczerba, Jacek",Journal,Materials,2023-12-01,AGH University of Krakow;Zakłady Magnezytowe ”ROPCZYCE” S.A.,ANN ;  artificial neural networks ;  machine learning ;  MgO-C ;  refractory ;  steel
Emerging Schemes for Advancing 2D Material Photoconductive-Type Photodetectors,"By virtue of the widely tunable band structure, dangling-bond-free surface, gate electrostatic controllability, excellent flexibility, and high light transmittance, 2D layered materials have shown indisputable application prospects in the field of optoelectronic sensing. However, 2D materials commonly suffer from weak light absorption, limited carrier lifetime, and pronounced interfacial effects, which have led to the necessity for further improvement in the performance of 2D material photodetectors to make them fully competent for the numerous requirements of practical applications. In recent years, researchers have explored multifarious improvement methods for 2D material photodetectors from a variety of perspectives. To promote the further development and innovation of 2D material photodetectors, this review epitomizes the latest research progress in improving the performance of 2D material photodetectors, including improvement in crystalline quality, band engineering, interface passivation, light harvesting enhancement, channel depletion, channel shrinkage, and selective carrier trapping, with the focus on their underlying working mechanisms. In the end, the ongoing challenges in this burgeoning field are underscored, and potential strategies addressing them have been proposed. On the whole, this review sheds light on improving the performance of 2D material photodetectors in the upcoming future.","Liang, Huanrong;Ma, Yuhang;Yi, Huaxin;Yao, Jiandong",Journal,Materials,2023-12-01,Sun Yat-Sen University,2D materials ;  improvement strategies ;  photodetection ;  photodetectors
Emergence of New Concepts in Skin Physiopathology through the Use of in vitro Human Skin Explants Models,"Background: This review summarizes uses and new applications for dermatological research of in vitro culture models of human skin explants (HSEs). In the last decade, many innovations have appeared in the literature and an exponential number of studies have been recorded in various fields of application such as process culture engineering, stem cell extractions methodology, or cell-To-cell interaction studies under physiological and pathological conditions, wound-healing, and inflammation. Most studies also concerned pharmacology, cosmetology, and photobiology. However, these topics will not be considered in our review. Summary: A better understanding of the mechanisms driving intercellular relationships, at work in the maintenance of 3D tissue architectures has led to the improvement of cell culture techniques. Many papers have focused on the physiological ways that govern in vitro tissue maintenance of HSEs. The analysis of the necessary mechanical stress, intercellular and cell-matrix interactions, allows the maintenance and prolonged use of HSEs in culture for up to 15 days, regardless of the great variability of study protocols from one laboratory to another and in accordance with the objectives set. Because of their close similarities to fresh skin, HSEs are increasingly used to study skin barrier repair and wound healing physiology. Easy to use in co-culture, this model allows a better understanding of the connections and interactions between the peripheral nervous system, the skin and the immune system. The development of the concept of an integrated neuro-immuno-cutaneous system at work in skin physiology and pathology highlighted by this article represents one of the new technical challenges in the field of in vitro culture of HSE. This review of the literature also reveals the importance of using such models in pathology. As sources of stem cells, HSEs are the basis for the development of new tissue engineering models such as organoids or optical clearing tissues technology. This study identifies the main advances and cross-cutting issues in the use of HSE.","Cousin, Ianis;Misery, Laurent;De Vries, Philine;Lebonvallet, Nicolas",Journal,Dermatology,2023-12-01,Laboratoire des Interactions Epitheliums Neurones (LIEN);Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest,Human skin explants ;  In vitro ;  Stem cells
Karyotyping of aneuploid and polyploid plants from low coverage whole-genome resequencing,"Background: Karyotype, as a basic characteristic of species, provides valuable information for fundamental theoretical research and germplasm resource innovation. However, traditional karyotyping techniques, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are challenging and low in efficiency, especially when karyotyping aneuploid and polyploid plants. The use of low coverage whole-genome resequencing (lcWGR) data for karyotyping was explored, but existing methods are complicated and require control samples. Results: In this study, a new protocol for molecular karyotype analysis was provided, which proved to be a simpler, faster, and more accurate method, requiring no control. Notably, our method not only provided the copy number of each chromosome of an individual but also an accurate evaluation of the genomic contribution from its parents. Moreover, we verified the method through FISH and published resequencing data.

Android-Based Courseware as an Educational Technology Innovation for Electrical Circuit Course: An Effectiveness Study,"This study investigates the effectiveness of Android-Based Courseware (AC) in teaching electrical circuits to vocational students in higher education. The courseware was developed using Android Studio and was implemented in the Electrical Circuit Course (ECC) at the Industrial Electrical Engineering study program, Universitas Negeri Padang, Indonesia. The AC consists of four primary menus designed to facilitate learning implementation: learning materials, simulations, animations, and interactive quizzes for evaluations. The study utilized a pre-experimental design with a one-group pre-test-post-test design involving a group of students who used the AC in the learning process. The cluster random sampling technique was employed to select the research subjects. This study involved 68 students as research subjects. Data was collected through a written test, utilizing a multiple-choice test as the research instrument. The effectiveness of the AC was evaluated based on the differential analysis of pre-test and post-test scores using the paired-sample t-test. Furthermore, the effect size of the AC on the learning process was determined using Cohen’s d effect size analysis. The results showed a significant difference (alpha significance value is 0.000 and less than 0.05) between the post-test and pre-test scores, with the post-test scores (= 85.00) being higher than the pre-test scores (= 60.00). This indicates that the courseware effectively improves the learning process of the ECC. Additionally, the effect size analysis results show that the effect of using the courseware falls within the large category. These findings suggest that the AC can be an effective tool in the learning process of the ECC and can improve student learning outcomes. Specifically, the AC has a significant impact on enhancing students’ cognitive and practical abilities concerning electrical circuit concepts.","Yanto, Doni Tri Putra;Eliza, Fivia;Ganefri, ;Sukardi, ;Hastuti, ;Kabatiah, Maryatun;Andrian, ",Journal,International Journal of Information and Education Technology,2023-12-01,Universitas Negeri Medan;Universitas Negeri Padang,Android-based courseware ;  effectiveness analysis ;  electrical circuit course ;  vocational students
Heterogeneous effect of digital economy on carbon emission reduction,"The vigorous development of the digital economy (DIEC) offers a substantial potential for China and global economies to realize the goal of “double carbon”. This study attempts to analyze the heterogeneous effect of DIEC on carbon emission reduction (CERE), in order to extend a valuable reference for effectively achieving the dual-carbon goal. Accordingly, the effect of DIEC on carbon emission scale (CESC) and carbon emission intensity (CEIN) are examined in this paper by using dual fixed effect model and intermediate effect model, respectively. The study findings show that, at first, DIEC significantly supports the CERE while significantly constraining the uplift in CESC and CEIN. Simultaneously, the CERE effect of DIEC contains digital economy dimensional heterogeneity, industry heterogeneity, production and life heterogeneity, and urban-rural heterogeneity. Finally, the DIEC boosts the technological innovation (TEIN) and residents' income (REIN) levels, in order to heighten the CERE. Further, improving invention technology innovation and TEIN is more conducive to catalyzing the reduction of carbon emission in the whole society and the production field. Conversely, the improvement of non-invention technology innovation and rural- and urban residents’ income impedes CERE in the field of life. Thus, the implications of this study are of vital significance for China and the rest of the world to foster CERE and achieve the “dual carbon” goal through DIEC development.","Wang, Xiangyan;Li, Jinye",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-12-01,Xinjiang University;Institute for Macroeconomy High-Quality Development of Xinjiang,Carbon emission intensity ;  Carbon emission reduction ;  Carbon emission scale ;  Digital economy ;  Heterogeneity
Emerging breakthroughs in biomaterials for orthopedic applications: A comprehensive review,"The field of orthopedics has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, primarily driven by the development and utilization of innovative biomaterials. This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of emerging breakthroughs in biomaterials for orthopedic applications, focusing on the diverse range of materials employed in this sector. Biomaterials have revolutionized orthopedic surgery by offering tailored solutions for various musculoskeletal conditions, enhancing patient outcomes, and improving overall quality of life. This review categorizes biomaterials into three main groups: metals, ceramics, and polymers, with a special emphasis on composite biomaterials. Metal alloys, such as titanium and its alloys, continue to be pivotal in orthopedic applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Ceramics, including hydroxyapatite and bioglass, have found wide acceptance for their capacity to mimic natural bone and promote osseointegration. Polymer-based biomaterials, including biodegradable polymers, offer versatility and can be engineered to meet specific requirements in orthopedic devices.

Research on stability of major engineering technology innovation consortia based on evolutionary game theory,"Currently, major engineering projects have become increasingly complex, necessitating continuous technological innovation in response to improved social productivity. Innovation consortia, as typical organizations driving technological advancement, face challenges such as uncertain decision-making behavior and organizational instability, particularly in major engineering technology innovation consortia (METIC). This study aims to explore innovation behavior strategies and investigate the factors influencing consortium stability. Drawing from extensive literature research and practical scenarios, this paper outlines the evolutionary game problem and theoretical assumptions within METIC, focusing on the interplay between construction enterprises and research institutions. By constructing and deducing an evolutionary game model, we analyze the effects of various factors, such as the initial state, distribution coefficients of innovation income, reputation loss, and others, on the stability of innovation consortia. Additionally, we simulate the dynamic evolution process of strategy selection. Our findings reveal that evolution behavior is significantly influenced by the initial state. Furthermore, an optimal range of innovation income distribution coefficient exists, and factors like government incentives, penalties, and reputation loss positively influence the evolution towards active strategies. Conversely, factors like absorptive capacity, risk coefficient, and distrust coefficient inhibit the evolution towards active strategies. The research outcomes and managerial implications presented in this study serve as a valuable reference for enhancing the stability of METIC, thus fostering successful technological innovation and progress in major engineering projects.","Qian, Yingmiao;Yu, Xian an;Chen, Xueli;Song, Malin",Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023-12-01,Anhui University of Finance and Economics;Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,Evolutionary game ;  Innovation consortia ;  Major engineering technology innovation (METI) ;  Stability analysis
Single-electron transfer reactions on surface-modified gold plasmons,"Photoredox catalysis's relevance in organic synthesis research and innovation will increase in the coming decades. However, the processes rely almost exclusively on expensive noble metal complexes, most notably iridium complexes, to absorb light and transfer a single charge to a substrate or a catalyst to initiate cascade transformations. Light-triggered plasmon resonances generate a non-Fermi-Dirac energy distribution with many hot carriers that decay in ∼1 ps. Their ultrafast relaxation makes performing single electron transfer (SET) transformations challenging. Herein, a novel photosystem is proposed based on surface-modified gold nanoparticles (aka plasmon “molecularization”), which improved charge separation and, more importantly, enabled SET reactions, expanding the portfolio of photocatalysts available for photoredox catalysis. The photosystem was made into an electrode, permitting its use in photoelectrochemical arrangements that leverage electro- and photo-chemical approaches' benefits and chemical engineering solutions, helping the synthetic chemistry efforts towards greener synthesis and synthesis of more complex structures on a scale.","Bericat-Vadell, Robert;Sekar, Pandiaraj;Patehebieke, Yeersen;Zou, Xianshao;Kaul, Nidhi;Broqvist, Peter;Lindblad, Rebecka;Lindblad, Andreas;Arkhypchuk, Anna;Walletin, Carl Johan;Sá, Jacinto",Journal,Materials Today Chemistry,2023-12-01,Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences;Ångströmlaboratoriet;Göteborgs Universitet;Uppsala Universitet,

How does green finance affect energy efficiency? The role of green technology innovation and energy structure,"As climate warming intensifies, reducing greenhouse gas emissions has become a national consensus for many countries. Green finance plays an important role in promoting energy efficiency and lowering such emissions, but there is scant literature that analyzes the impacts and mechanisms of green finance on energy efficiency. Based on China's provincial panel data from 2010 to 2018, this research measures the green finance index using the panel entropy weighting method and systematically evaluates the relationship between green finance and energy efficiency using the fixed-effects model. The results show the following. (1) Green finance significantly contributes to energy efficiency and remains the same after a series of robustness tests such as endogeneity treatment, replacement of explanatory and interpreted variables, and replacement of regression models. (2) Green technology innovation and energy structure optimization are the transmission mechanism of green finance for energy efficiency, which means that green finance improves energy efficiency by promoting green technology innovation and energy structure optimization. (3) There is regional heterogeneity, temporal heterogeneity, and industry heterogeneity in the impact of green finance on energy efficiency. The positive effects of green finance on energy efficiency are more pronounced in resource-dependent regions, regions with irrational industrial structure, north regions, industrial sectors, and after 2013. The conclusions of this paper offer some policy recommendations, including promoting the development of green finance, building a cooperation platform for green finance and technological innovation, enhancing the depth and breadth of renewable energy utilization, and building differentiated green finance strategies according to local conditions.","Lee, Chien Chiang;Wang, Chang song;He, Zhiwen;Xing, Wen wu;Wang, Keying",Journal,Renewable Energy,2023-12-01,Adnan Kassar School of Business;Hubei University Of Economics;Nanchang University,Energy efficiency ;  Energy structure ;  Green finance ;  Green technology innovation

Revisiting energy justice: Is renewable energy technology innovation a tool for realizing a just energy system?,"Renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) is crucial in facilitating the energy transition while promoting a just transition. This paper examines the RETI and energy justice comprehensive indexes for 30 provinces in China between 2006 and 2019. Then, we study the relationship between RETI and energy justice and investigate their mediating roles and asymmetric relationships. Furthermore, we explore the potential of each of five RETI indicators for a just transition. The results show that RETI effectively contributes to distributive justice, procedural justice, recognition justice, and restorative justice and, in general, has a positive impact on energy justice. Moreover, all types of RETI indexes effectively promote energy justice, with wind and solar energy technology innovation having the most notable impacts. Finally, RETI also enhances energy justice by improving green total factor productivity (GTFP). Overall, this study believes that both the Chinese and global governments should actively develop renewable energy technologies, proactively seek innovation, and promote a just energy transition and sustainable development.","Dong, Kangyin;Yang, Senmiao;Wang, Jianda;Dong, Xiucheng",Journal,Energy Policy,2023-12-01,University of International Business and Economics,China ;  Energy justice ;  Green total factor productivity (GTFP) ;  R&D intensity ;  Renewable energy technology innovation (RETI)
Advancements in technology and innovation for sustainable agriculture: Understanding and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils,"In recent decades, Technology and Innovation (TI) have shown tremendous potential for improving agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. However, the adoption and implementation of TI in the agricultural sector and its impact on the environment remain limited. To gain deeper insights into the significance of TI in enhancing agricultural productivity while maintaining environmental balance, this study investigates 21 agriculture-dependent Asian countries. Two machine learning techniques, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and Elastic-Net, are employed to analyze the data, which is categorized into three regional groups: ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), and GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council). The findings of this study highlight the heterogeneous nature of technology adoption and its environmental implications across the three country groups. ASEAN countries emerge as proactive adopters of relevant technologies, effectively enhancing agricultural production while simultaneously upholding environmental quality. Conversely, SAARC countries exhibit weaker technology adoption, leading to significant fluctuations in environmental quality, which in turn impact agricultural productivity. Notably, agricultural emissions of N2O (nitrous oxide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) in SAARC countries show a positive association with agricultural production, while CH4 (methane) emissions have an adverse effect. In contrast, the study reveals a lack of evidence regarding technological adoption in agriculture among GCC countries. Surprisingly, higher agricultural productivity in these countries is correlated with increased N2O emissions. Moreover, the results indicate that deforestation and expansion of cropland contribute to increased agricultural production; however, this expansion is accompanied by higher emissions related to agricultural activities. This research represents a pioneering empirical analysis of the impact of TI and environmental emission gases on agricultural productivity in the three aforementioned country groups. It underscores the imperative of embracing relevant technologies to enhance agricultural output while concurrently ensuring environmental sustainability. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in formulating strategies to promote sustainable agriculture and technological advancement in the context of diverse regional dynamics.","Qayyum, Muhammad;Zhang, Yanping;Wang, Mansi;Yu, Yuyuan;Li, Shijie;Ahmad, Wasim;Maodaa, Saleh N.;Sayed, Shaban R.M.;Gan, Jiawei",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2023-12-01,Guangzhou University;Nankai University;City University of Hong Kong;College of Sciences,Agricultural productivity ;  Asian countries ;  Emission gases ;  Environmental sustainability ;  Machine learning ;  Technology and innovation

CRISPR applications in cancer diagnosis and treatment,"Cancer remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating the exploration of novel and more precise therapeutic options beyond conventional treatments. In this regard, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems have emerged as highly promising tools for clinical gene editing applications. The CRISPR family encompasses diverse CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins that possess the ability to recognize specific target sequences. The initial CRISPR system consisted of the Cas9 protein and a single-guide RNA, which guide Cas9 to the desired target sequence, facilitating precise double-stranded cleavage. In addition to the traditional cis-cleavage activity, the more recently discovered Cas12 and Cas13 proteins exhibit trans-cleavage activity, which expands their potential applications in cancer diagnosis. In this review, we provide an overview of the functional characteristics of Cas9, Cas12, and Cas13. Furthermore, we highlight the latest advancements and applications of these CRISPR systems in cancer gene therapy and molecular diagnosis. We also emphasize the importance of understanding the strengths and limitations of each CRISPR system to maximize their clinical utility. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of CRISPR technology in cancer research, we aim to inspire further exploration and innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

Teaching and Assessing Thinking Skills and Applying Educational Technologies in Higher Education,"Integrating thinking skills into higher education pedagogy requires suitable models, methods, and tools for both instruction and assessment. Some of these tools apply one or more educational technologies. The articles in this special issue focus on higher education with four common themes: online or virtual courses and modules, science and engineering education, active learning methods, and critical thinking. This special issue sheds light on the critical importance of thinking skills development and assessment in higher education and underscores the need for continued research and innovation in the realm of educational technology.","Dori, Yehudit Judy;Lavi, Rea",Journal,Journal of Science Education and Technology,2023-12-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology Isarel,Educational technology ;  Engineering education ;  Higher education ;  Science education ;  Technology in education ;  Thinking skills
A window into the academic term control mechanism: a thorough presentation of processed terms in the process of completing an environmental science dictionary,"The evaluation and improvement of scientific terminology translation plays a crucial role in consistently and accurately communicating knowledge at an academic level as well as in applying this theoretical knowledge in practice. This becomes even more important in countries such as Greece where the majority of scientific innovations originate from other, predominately English-speaking, countries. Consequently, the dissemination of this knowledge must go through a translation process. Within this context, the author is conducting postdoctoral research in the academic field of Environmental Engineering and Hydraulics in the School of Engineering of the AUTh, Department of Civil Engineering. The research focuses on evaluating English to Greek handbooks in the academic field of Environmental Engineering and Hydraulics by using a translation control mechanism based on seven variables firstly derived from the studies of Belgian translatologist Dirk Delabastita. The outcomes so far highlighted the quality of academic and translation work, but also identified a number of translation ambiguities, different semantic variations of terms within the source text in relation to their context, the complete absence of certain terms in the translated text, and the use of an incorrect term’s translation. The evaluation of all these cases constitutes a comprehensive decision-making process that can be applied by any translator of technical texts. This process involves first evaluating the translated texts in their mother tongue and then suggesting enhanced term translations, ultimately contributing to the establishment of a more cohesive scientific consensus in Environmental Engineering terminology to implement the optimal utilization of scientific environmental methods by the Greek academic community to protect the environment, particularly in the highly sensitive Eastern Mediterranean region. Moreover, this process represents an initial step toward creating a state-of-the-art tool in teaching technical translation and lexicography to Environmental Engineering students as well as introducing foreign terminology to students in the faculty of engineering and the schools of English language and literature in the department of translation and intercultural studies, with specialization in technical translation.","Christidou, S.",Journal,Euro-Mediterranean Journal for Environmental Integration,2023-12-01,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Environmental engineering ;  Solid waste management ;  Term evaluation ;  Term processing ;  Translation control mechanism

Understanding how platform modularity enhances network effects,"With modular architecture, digital platforms comprise decomposable modules and well-defined interfaces that provide the technical capabilities for reconfiguring, extending, and evolving products. Drawing on research in engineering design and industrial economics, we investigate how the architectural modularity of platforms can be employed to enhance network effects. We illustrate how the structural elements and capabilities of modular architecture can be leveraged to strengthen network effects and how the objective of scaling platforms can drive the formulation of modularization principles to define modules and interfaces. We then discuss Microsoft Power BI, a business intelligence platform, as a specific example and describe how the components and functions of Power BI are utilized to strengthen network effects. Our study highlights the interplay between platform architecture and network effects, showing how architectural modularity can lead to network growth. It contributes to research on digital platforms and digital product innovation.","Dai, Qizhi",Journal,Electronic Markets,2023-12-01,LeBow College of Business,Digital platforms ;  Modular design ;  Modularity ;  Network effects ;  Platform architecture ;  Power BI

Exploring senior engineering students’ engineering identity: the impact of practice-oriented learning experiences,"Background: Engineering identity reflects students' acceptance and recognition of engineering, which has a great influence on their willingness to enter and stay in the engineering field. Existing studies have shown that curricular and co-curricular practice-oriented experiences may be helpful for developing students’ engineering identity. However, the actual impact of various practice-oriented learning experiences remained to be further examined. This quantitative study aims to explore the impact of three types of practice-oriented learning experiences (capstone experiences, technological innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and engineering-related internships) in the development of engineering talents' engineering identity. A theoretical framework of engineering identity, which consists of three dimensions, that is, Interest, Performance/Competence and Recognition, was adopted to guide the research. Results: Through responses from 160 senior engineering students at a leading research intensive Chinese university, the study explored the relationships between engagement in practice-oriented learning experiences and engineering identity. Senior capstone design was found to be associated positively with students' development of engineering identity and recognition by others. Participating in two or more technological innovation and entrepreneurship competitions associated positively with students' development of engineering identity, performance/competence and recognition. Meanwhile, internships did not show any statistically significant effect on engineering identity. Moreover, by analyzing the potential mediating effect, we found that recognition played a complete intermediary role between senior capstone design and engineering identity. In addition, recognition and performance/competence mediated the relationship between twice or more technological innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and engineering identity. Conclusions: These findings add to our current understanding about the role of different practice-oriented learning activities on students’ development of engineering identity. These findings point to the importance of learning activities, including technological innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and senior capstone design, on the development of engineering identity. Moreover, the results highlighted the important role of students’ engagement in multiple authentic engineering projects throughout the curriculum and their gaining recognitions through these project experiences. Based on these findings, practical suggestions are proposed to help nurture students’ engineering identity. In addition, future qualitative investigations about the underlying mechanisms are recommended to facilitate the understanding of students’ development of engineering identity.","Ju, Tongjie;Zhu, Jiabin",Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2023-12-01,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Capstone design ;  Engineering identity ;  Internship ;  Technological innovation and entrepreneurship competition
Revolutionizing genetic disease treatment: Recent technological advances in base editing,"Treating human genetic diseases has posed a significant and longstanding challenge to the medical community with traditional approaches often limited by their targeting scope, precision, and safety. In recent years, the development of Base Editors (BEs) has revolutionized the genome editing field, offering a precise and effective therapeutic option for correcting single nucleotide mutations responsible for more than half of human genetic diseases without causing unintended DNA damage. Since their invention in 2016, BEs have been successfully used in both research and clinical settings to treat many human genetic diseases, including sickle cell disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review summarizes the most impactful developments in BE technology between 2020 and 2023, particularly emphasizing the methodology used to enhance this revolutionary tool. By offering a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in BE technology, we hope to provide a framework to accelerate future innovations in this field.","Daniel, Tyler C.;Zeng, Hongzhi;Osikpa, Emmanuel C.;Gao, Xue",Journal,Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering,2023-12-01,George R.

Factors that influence the adoption of rehabilitation technologies: a multi-disciplinary qualitative exploration,"Background: Technological innovation is recognised as having the potential to enhance rehabilitation for people with disability. Yet, resistance to, and abandonment of, rehabilitation technology is prevalent and the successful translation of technology into rehabilitation settings remains limited. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop an in-depth, multi-stakeholder perspective on what influences the adoption of rehabilitation technologies. Methods: Semi-structured focus groups were conducted as part of a larger research project aiming to facilitate the co-design of a novel neurorestorative technology. Focus group data were analysed using a five-phase hybrid deductive-inductive approach to qualitative data analysis. Results: Focus groups were attended by 43 stakeholders with expertise in one or more of the following fields: people with disability, allied health, human movement science, computer science, design, engineering, ethics, funding, marketing, business, product development, and research development. Six main themes influencing the adoption of technology in rehabilitation were identified: cost beyond the purchase price, benefits to all stakeholders, trust to be earned in technology, ease of technology operation, ability to access technology, and the ‘co’ in co-design. All six themes were found to be interrelated; in particular, the importance of direct stakeholder engagement in the development of rehabilitation technologies (the ‘co’ in co-design) was prevalent in all themes. Conclusions: A range of complex and interrelated factors influence the adoption of rehabilitation technologies. Importantly, many of the issues that have the potential to negatively impact rehabilitation technology adoption may be addressed during development by utilising the experience and expertise of stakeholders who influence its supply and demand. Our findings state that a wider cohort of stakeholders needs to be actively engaged in the development of rehabilitation technologies to better address the factors that contribute to technology underutilisation and abandonment and facilitate better outcomes for people with disability.","Mitchell, Jessie;Shirota, Camila;Clanchy, Kelly",Journal,Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation,2023-12-01,Menzies Health Institute Queensland;Griffith University,Clinical translation ;  Co-design ;  Qualitative analysis ;  Rehabilitation technology
"Implementing educational technology in Higher Education Institutions: A review of technologies, stakeholder perceptions, frameworks and metrics","In a world driven by constant change and innovation, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are undergoing a rapid transformation, often driven by external factors such as emerging technologies. One of the key drivers affecting the design and development of educational delivery mechanisms in HEIs is the fast pace of educational technology development which not only impacts an institution’s technical capacity to infuse hardware and software solutions into existing learning infrastructure but also has implications for pedagogical practice, stakeholder acceptance of new technology, and HEI administrative structures. However, little is known about the implementation of contemporary educational technology in HEI environments, particularly as they relate to competing stakeholder perceptions of technology effectiveness in course delivery and knowledge acquisition. This review fills that gap by exploring the evidence and analyses of 46 empirical research studies focussing on technology implementation issues in a diverse range of institutional contexts, subject areas, technologies, and stakeholder profiles. This study found that the dynamic interplay of educational technology characteristics, stakeholder perceptions on the effectiveness of technology integration decisions, theoretical frameworks and models relevant to technology integration in pedagogical practices, and metrics to gauge post-implementation success are critical dimensions to creating viable pathways to effective educational technology implementation. To that end, this study proposes a framework to guide the development of sound implementation strategies that incorporates five dimensions: technology, stakeholder perceptions, academic discipline, success metrics, and theoretical frameworks. This study will benefit HEI decision-makers responsible for re-engineering complex course delivery systems to accommodate the infusion of new technologies and pedagogies in ways that will maximise their utility to students and faculty.","Chugh, Ritesh;Turnbull, Darren;Cowling, Michael A.;Vanderburg, Robert;Vanderburg, Michelle A.",Journal,Education and Information Technologies,2023-12-01,CQUniversity Australia,College ;  EdTech ;  Educational technology ;  HEI ;  Higher Education Institution ;  Implementation ;  University
Designing a deep-tech venture builder to address grand challenges and overcome the valley of death,"A vital problem of the European economy has long been its limited capacity to transform technological inventions and breakthroughs into successful new companies that help solve grand challenges in, for example, climate change, energy production, and poverty. Various measures and initiatives addressing this problem have not yet resulted in increasing numbers of successful ventures overcoming the so-called valley of death, especially in the case of deep-tech innovations arising from technological breakthroughs in, for example, new materials, mechatronics, high-precision engineering, and photonics. In this paper, we adopt a design perspective on crafting a Deep-Tech Venture (DTV) builder that creates, supports, and develops new ventures arising from deep-tech breakthroughs accomplished in leading research institutes in Europe. This approach to building DTVs incorporates key elements of extant theories and tools in the field of entrepreneurship but also moves beyond the contemporary body of knowledge. As such, the DTV approach provides a comprehensive system for creating and scaling deep-tech ventures—the most complex and risky, yet most impactful breed of ventures. The DTV blueprint was implemented and further developed in a venture builder that sources technologies from leading research institutes, such as CERN and European Space Agency. The initial results are highly promising. The main contribution of this study involves a comprehensive system design for building deep-tech ventures that help solve the SDGs, one that is (a) grounded in the literature on technology sourcing, entrepreneurship, ecosystems, entrepreneurial finance, and talent acquisition and (b) tested in a major European venture builder.","Romme, A.

Expert retrieval based on local journals metadata to drive small-medium industries (SMI) collaboration for product innovation,"Innovation in the small-medium industries (SMI) sector, which has limited human resources, requires collaboration with academic researchers. Thus, SMI needs an appropriate search tool to find a suitable researcher. Since the skill classification of researchers arranged in an academic environment is very formal and hierarchical, it tend to be challenging for laypeople to understand that skills classification. This study proposes a method to combine expert retrieval based on portfolio content with expert topic maps based on search keywords from user preferences using local journal publication sources indexed at Portal Garuda. This research evaluates the TFIDF-VSM method with the BM25 Okapi for expert retrieval and text rank with text network analysis (betweenness centrality value) for the construction of a map of the topic of its expertise. Furthermore, the prototype was tested with the System Usability Scale instrument to measure the level of usability. The combined use of the BM25 Okapi method and the text network analysis with betweenness centrality value shows a pretty good usability with a value of 73,489. The different backgrounds of academics and SMI practitioners require an appropriate search method approach. Therefore, combining expert retrieval with expert topic maps based on keywords becomes a solution that can help ordinary people (SMI practitioners) find expert researchers to support product innovation in their SMI.","Al Hakim, Shidiq;Sensuse, Dana Indra;Budi, Indra;Subroto, Imam Much Ibnu;Siagian, Al Hafiz Akbar Maulana",Journal,Social Network Analysis and Mining,2023-12-01,Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional;Universitas Indonesia;Sultan Agung Islamic University,BM25 ;  Expert finding ;  Expert retrieval ;  System usability Scale ;  Text network analysis ;  Topic map
New energy technology innovation and sustainable economic development in the complex scientific environment,"Energy is the material basis of national development, which supports national economic development. With the sustained and rapid economic growth, the energy problem has become the bottleneck hindering sustainable economic and social development, and countries around the world are paying attention to its impact. The development and utilization of New Energy (NE) are inseparable from the support of technological innovation. Technological innovation is an important part of technological philosophy in technological philosophy and the embodiment of value theory. At the current stage of NE economic and ecological development, the contradiction of social values can be solved, because these contradictions can be solved through technological innovation” has been added to the article. To some extent, NE technologies are becoming a new basis for influencing the global pattern and human development. The research on the impact of technological innovation on energy is also helpful to study the impact of science and technology on society. Therefore, this paper studied the relationship between energy technology innovation and economic sustainability by analyzing the characteristics, elements, and challenges of NE technology innovation. Finally, the corresponding implementation strategy was optimized according to the current situation of the NE industry. The resource utilization rate, energy system perfection, and economic benefits after NE technology innovation in complex environment were higher than those before technology innovation. Among them, the resource utilization rate after NE technology innovation was 12.3% higher than that before NE technology innovation; the degree of energy system perfection after NE technology innovation was 9.4% higher than that before NE technology innovation; the economic benefit after NE technology innovation was 9.4% higher than that before NE technology innovation. In short, energy technology innovation was closely related to economic sustainability.","Li, Dongxin;Ge, Aidi",Journal,Energy Reports,2023-12-01,"Shandong University, Weihai;Huizhou University",New energy ;  Scientific environment ;  Sustainable economic development ;  Technological innovation
Engineering student experience and self-direction in implementations of blended learning: a cross-institutional analysis,"Background: Much of researchers’ efforts to foster wider implementation of educational innovations in STEM has focused on understanding and facilitating the implementation efforts of faculty. However, student engagement in blended learning and other innovations relies heavily on students’ self-directed learning behaviors, implying that students are likely key actors in the implementation process. This paper explores the ways in which engineering students at multiple institutions experience the self-directed selection and implementation of blended learning resources in the context of their own studies. To accomplish this, it adopts a research perspective informed by Actor-Network Theory, allowing students themselves to be perceived as individual actors and implementors rather than a population that is implemented upon. Results: A thematic analysis was conducted in two parts. First, analysis identified sets of themes unique to the student experience at four participant institutions. Then, a second round of analysis identified and explored a subset of key actors represented in students’ reported experiences across all institutions. The findings show clear similarities and differences in students’ experiences of blended learning across the four institutions, with many themes echoing or building upon the results of prior research. Distinct institutional traits, the actions of the instructors, the components of the blended learning environment, and the unique needs and preferences of the students themselves all helped to shape students’ self-directed learning experiences. Students’ engagement decisions and subsequent implementations of blended learning resulted in personally appropriate, perhaps even idiosyncratic, forms of engagement with their innovative learning opportunities. Conclusion: The institutional implementation of blended learning, and perhaps other educational innovations, relies in part on the self-directed decision-making of individual students. This suggests that instructors too hold an additional responsibility: to act as facilitators of their students’ implementation processes and as catalysts for growth and change in students’ learning behaviors. Developing a greater understanding of students’ implementation behaviors could inform the future implementation efforts of faculty and better empower students to succeed in the innovative classroom.","Evenhouse, David;Lee, Yonghee;Berger, Edward;Rhoads, Jeffrey F.;DeBoer, Jennifer",Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2023-12-01,College of Engineering and Applied Science;Purdue University,Blended learning ;  Instructional change ;  Self-directed learning ;  Student experience ;  Study behaviors
Is the carbon emissions trading system conducive to the urban green technology innovation level? Evidence from China,"Although the academic community has come to accept the Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme (CETS) as a viable market incentive for environmental control, more research is needed to determine if the creation of such a scheme can spur the development of green technologies. Based on the panel data of 274 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2017, this paper uses the propensity score matching-difference in difference (PSM-DID) method to empirically test the green innovation effect of the pilot areas relative to the non-pilot areas before and after the implementation of the policy, uses the mediating effect model and the moderating effect model to test its internal influence mechanism, and further examines the heterogeneity of the policy effects. The findings indicate that pilot CETS deployment can significantly improve green technology innovation (GTI), and the conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. Moreover, the human capital input and the science and technology support have a significant partial mediating effect in the policy effect of CETS on GTI, with the latter contributing greatly. The overall marketization and the financial development positively moderate the impact of CETS on GTI, but government involvement have a reverse moderating effect. In addition, the policy effects is better in cities with higher administrative levels in China and in cities in eastern and western China, while the policy effects in cities with lower administrative levels and in central China is weak or not significant. This study has far-reaching theoretical value and momentous practical significance for China and other developing countries in terms of further deepening and improving the CETS, enhancing GTI, and promoting urban sustainable development.","Han, Yan;Zhe, Caihong;Liu, Xuemei",Journal,Energy Reports,2023-12-01,"Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;Lanzhou Jiaotong University",Carbon emissions trading scheme ;  Green technology innovation ;  Influencing mechanism ;  PSM-DID
Inspecting Technology-Related Quality of Teaching Artifacts to Understand Teachers' Technology Adoption,"Teachers' technology adoption primarily aims to integrate technology into the curriculum and to improve teaching and learning. Teaching artifacts encapsulate the attributes that can reflect teacher expertise in the authentic context. This study inspects the implicit quality of teaching artifacts to examine teachers' technology adoption throughout the evolution process of teaching artifacts. We demonstrate how patterns within the artificial synthesis of digital tools and teaching practice can be identified by examining the technology-specified quality of digital artifacts shaped by teachers of a primary school in Shanghai. To address the potential challenges of artifact analysis, we conduct a set of semiautomatic processes to manage the quality properties of teaching artifacts and measure quality indicators by training a series of automatic annotations. The artifact quality changes over nine semesters demonstrated that teachers increase technology flexibility, content variety, instruction diversity, and richness of artifacts as their technological understanding gradually improves. Other than the mainstream technology adoption research, this study revealed details regarding technology adoption: the introduction of new technology in schools should involve the enhancement of the technological understanding of teachers, the encouragement of teachers to adapt each component of their teaching practice to technological contexts, and the quality and use frequency of artifacts. Moreover, the proposed inspection of artifact quality can reflect the teacher's adoption process in an unconstrained environment. The artifact analytic approaches we created can contribute to the technology adoption from a more objective perspective.","Zheng, Longwei;Wang, Chao;Liu, Tong;Gu, Xiaoqing",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,2023-12-01,East China Normal University;Shandong Normal University,Artifact quality ;  automated artifact analyses ;  phase-related technology adoption ;  teachers' technology adoption ;  teaching artifacts

Using artificial intelligence to find design errors in the engineering drawings,"Artificial intelligence is increasingly becoming important to businesses because many companies have realized the benefits of applying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in their operations. ML and DL have become attractive technologies for organizations looking to automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual work and free up resources for innovation. Unlike rule-based automation, typically used for standardized and predictable processes, machine learning, especially deep learning, can handle more complex tasks and learn over time, leading to greater accuracy and efficiency improvements. One of such promising applications is to use AI to reduce manual engineering work. This paper discusses a particular case within McDermott where the research team developed a DL model to do a quality check of complex blueprints. We describe the development and the final product of this case—AI-based software for the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) industry that helps to find the design mistakes buried inside very complex engineering drawings called piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs). We also present a cost-benefit analysis and potential scale-up of the developed software. Our goal is to share the successful experience of AI-based product development that can substantially reduce the engineering hours and, therefore, reduce the project's overall costs. The developed solution can also be potentially applied to other EPC companies doing a similar design for complex installations with high safety standards like oil and gas or petrochemical plants because the design errors it captures are common within this industry. It also could motivate practitioners and researchers to create similar products for the various fields within engineering industry.","Dzhusupova, Rimma;Banotra, Richa;Bosch, Jan;Olsson, Helena Holmström",Journal,Journal of Software: Evolution and Process,2023-12-01,Malmö Universitet;Chalmers University of Technology;McDermott,"artificial intelligence ;  deep learning ;  engineering drawings ;  engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) industry ;  object recognition ;  piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs)"

Analyzing human factors and complexities of mining and O&G process accidents using FRAM: Copiapó (Chile) and FPSO CSM (Brazil) cases,"The study presented in this research is a systematic human factors approach comparing two striking process accidents in Latin America: the Copiapó mining accident (2010), at the San José copper–gold mine, in Chile, and the FPSO CSM accident (2015), at Camarupim offshore oil field, in Brazil. Despite being different industrial segments—mining and O&G—more similarities than differences were observed in the treatment of process safety anomalies, especially those related to major accidents. The intense interactions between workers, equipment and processes, in both industries, have been making significant developments in the edge of innovation and technology, however increasing the complexity of risks in the workplaces. Furthermore, the differences between the preparation and handling of emergency situations show how complex, and critical, process safety is in these industrial areas. Aiming to adequately evidence how this complexity is intrinsically part of the various system that form the entire process, the FRAM (Functional Resonance Analysis Method) was utilized to model and analyses both accidents, under a human factors approach.

Heading Towards Sub-Discipline Rankings for Higher Education Institutions,"Although the system for annual rankings of higher education institutions (HEIs) faces considerable criticism, these rankings are here to stay. Having become competent in assigning holistic ranking scores to HEIs, reputed ranking entities have now started focusing on subject-specific and regional rankings. However, in experts' opinion, the process of assigning rankings should be more consistent, transparent, and representative. This study focuses on enhancing the credibility of the academic ranking process, by performing fine-grained assessment of the academic data pertaining to the computing discipline. The proposed assessment approach explores the data at the sub-discipline level, analyzing several ranking dimensions, including the research productivity, research impact, and research contribution of influential research scholars affiliated with renowned HEIs in the computing discipline. The analysis considers highly curated data published by three well-known international academic ranking entities, namely, Academic Rankings of World Universities (ARWU), Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), and Times Higher Education (THE), in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Researchers' profiles are obtained from the Scopus repository, and the DBpedia repository is used to retrieve information about HEIs and their locations. For a stable comparison of the subject-specific academic rankings, the grand average rank measure is employed, whereas for finding the most influential researchers in computing, the ResRank measure is used. The sub-discipline-specific academic rankings provide more detailed insight into the academic rankings, thereby providing more robust decision support. This analysis, which focuses on the computing sub-discipline, is among the first few such efforts.","Qureshi, Muhammad Sajid;Daud, Ali;Hayat, Malik Khizar;Song, Min;Park, Yejin",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,2023-12-01,"The University of Haripur;Abu Dhabi School of Management;Foundation University, Islamabad;International Islamic University, Islamabad;Yonsei University",Bibliometrics ;  DBpedia ;  higher educational institution (HEI) rankings ;  Scopus ;  sub-discipline specific rankings ;  subject-specific academic rankings
Does Institutional Distance Affect Transnational Knowledge Spillovers between Countries?,"This article studies the impacts of the institutional distances between home and host countries on technology spillovers and reverse technology spillovers of multinational investment. Extant research has studied the impacts of the technological spillover effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) and outward FDI (OFDI) on the technology innovation of home and host countries and the impact of the institutional environment on the technological spillovers of transnational investments. However, these studies have failed to distinguish the impacts of institutional profiles and institutional distances on multinational investments. The impacts of institutional profiles and institutional distances on cross-border business activities require additional, diligent theoretical and empirical research. We believe that the technological spillovers of multinational enterprises (MNEs) are affected not only by their institutional environments but also (and perhaps more importantly) by the institutional distances between home and host countries. We used data for Chinese investment in 11 countries over the past 15 years, and the analytical results showed some interesting conclusions. China's OFDI has not produced significant technology spillover effects, so overseas investment by MNEs needs to be more mature and return to rationality. However, FDI has a significant technology spillover effect, and institutional distance has indeed hindered FDI technology spillovers in China.","She, Yi;Hong, Jin;Ji, Chuwei;Qian, Furong",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-12-01,University of Science and Technology of China;Hefei University of Technology,FDI ;  institutional distance ;  knowledge spillovers ;  multinational enterprises ;  OFDI
What semantic analysis can tell us about long term trends in the global STI policy agenda,"The scope, complexity and the “volume” of knowledge accumulated render producing an overview of the core themes of science, technology and innovation policies difficult. Reviews of this policy domain mostly either refer to general issues without deep immersion into details or focus on specific narrower aspects. The paper uses semantic analysis to identify major themes of science, technology and innovation policies over the last three decades and to trace their evolution towards current policy setting. We use semantic tools for processing and analysing documents produced by one of the major and highly reputable international expert bodies, the OECD Working Party on Technology and Innovation Policy. We show that selected themes remain in the mainstream even though being affected by regular policy adjustments and refinements and which disappear or appear with new challenges and expected solutions. Other themes appear niche or exotic themes which are under discussion for some time only.","Gokhberg, Leonid;Meissner, Dirk;Kuzminov, Ilya",Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2023-12-01,HSE University,Big data analysis ;  Evidence based policy ;  International policy agenda ;  OECD Working Party on Technology and Innovation Policy ;  Science policy ;  Semantic analysis ;  Technology and innovation policies ;  Text mining
STRESS ANALYSIS OF THE FRAME OF A CORN HARVESTING TRACTOR,"The extent of existing corn land in Indonesia and the activities carried out by farmers in corn farming requires the innovation of an effective and efficient corn harvesting machine. This underlies the Research Center for Appropriate Technology located at the Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Negeri Padang to design a corn harvesting tractor that can facilitate the community in carrying out activities in the agricultural sector. The design of the corn harvester tractor consists of the harvester mechanism, the frame, the engine, and the powertrain. The frame is a crucial component of the corn harvester tractor, and its strength depends on its shape and proportions. The construction’s strength of the frame must take into account both safety considerations and the structure’s strength. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the frame strength of a corn harvester tractor made of steel of the ASTM A36 type. In this study, the von Mises stress that exists in the frame is used to calculate the strength of the frame of a corn harvester tractor. In numerical analysis, the chassis utilizes two tests with various load variations, namely the concentrated load and the load that is evenly distributed on the surface. The simulation results show that the frame of the corn harvester tractor can withstand the load well. The results of the stress analysis that occurs on the frame of the corn harvester tractor are that the maximum stress that occurs due to the concentrated load on the frame is 3.248 MPa. While the maximum stress that occurs due to the distributed load acting on the frame is 3.510 MPa. In addition, information was obtained that the value of the safety factor for the frame with ASTM A36 type met the component requirements that could withstand concentrated loads and distributed loads.","Putra, Randi Purnama;Waskito, ;Yuvenda, Dori;Adri, Junil",Journal,"EUREKA, Physics and Engineering",2023-11-30,Universitas Negeri Padang,ASTM A36 type ;  corn harvesting machine ;  steel frame ;  stress analysis
"Built in, not bolted on: responsible innovation in UK Centres for Doctoral Training – the new normal?","Purpose: The purpose of the study detailed here was to engage with Directors of Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) during the first year of their new Centres to form a snapshot view of the nature and type of training that was being incorporated and how this might affect the wider institution – in this case the university. Using an organisational learning lens, this paper empirically examines the work-in-progress of the responsible innovation (RI) training in CDTs to assess how new RI understandings are being created, retained and transferred within the CDTs, questioning whether this process represents a programme of “institutionalisation”. Design/methodology/approach: During the past decade, RI has become increasingly embedded within the EU and UK research context, appearing with greater frequency in funding calls and policy spaces. As part of this embedding, in its 2018 funding call for CDTs, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) required RI training to be included in the programme for all doctoral students. Findings: The paper concludes that, at present, institutionalisation is highly variegated, with the greater organisational change required to truly embed RI mindsets. Originality/value: The paper provides original, empirical research evidence of RI institutionalisation in UK CDTs, and, using a “learning organisation” lens, examines areas of value to both RI and learning organisation theory.","Ten Holter, Carolyn;Stahl, Bernd;Jirotka, Marina",Journal,Learning Organization,2023-11-30,University of Oxford;De Montfort University,Institutionalisation ;  Learning organisations ;  Responsible innovation
RMA in Belarus: Not yet a full-fledged profession but an important part of R&D Activities,"The chapter presents an overview of the state of Research Management and Administration (RMA) in Belarus. The country enjoys sound traditions in basic and applied research in some areas relevant to its economy, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The current science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy is focussed on the commercialisation of domestic research and development (R&D) results and the effectiveness of the national STI system. The majority of competitive budget funds are allocated within different types of programmes that support R&D and innovation. Formal RMA positions exist at the programme level and are based in research centres, universities and companies being grounded on a solid legal basis. Roughly 150-250 people within 50 legal entities are directly involved in RMA. At the project level, the RMA activities are either combined with scientific supervision or informally distributed within the project team. A possible increase in overall R&D expenditures in the country, the eventual enlargement of the scope of publicly supported STI projects and their collaborative nature, as well as their internationalisation and widening of international cooperation may significantly increase the demand for RMA professionals.","Meerovskaya, Olga",Book,The Emerald Handbook of Research Management and Administration Around the World,2023-11-29,BELARUSIAN INSTITUTE OF SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION SUPPORT OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SPHERE,Belarus ;  Lead executing organisations (LEOs) ;  Profession ;  Research Management and Administration ;  RMA ;  State Committee on Science and Technology (SCST)
Mining math-bio rule in recognizing pattern using machine intelligence,"In following the famous quote ""Science is the concept, Technology is the innovation and Engineering is the implementation"", the aim of this research work is to propose a definite Mathematical structure (in Von Neumann [1], Kantorovich[2], Kumar & Bonnett [3], H.L. Andrews[4]) behind every effort to recognize patterns in a versatile field of studies. Pattern recognition is widely considered as a branch of Mathematical cybernetics that deals with methodological aspects of classification, identification and recognition of entities, objects, process and situations that can be identified using finite set of features. The motivation behind this work is to make an attempt to narrow the gap between Science and Technology in the domain of Pattern Recognition by providing specific mathematical structure. A rigorous GAP analysis is only signifying that the emerging need of more concrete Industry -Academia collaboration largely depends on Science-Technology cohesion. The need, behind every proposed industrial application-invention or innovation, is the scientific clarification behind technological / engineering proposal to be well defined, designed and augmented. The above motivation at very elementary level may be illustrated by the fact that, behind every technology there is a mathematical backbone. The use of Binary arithmetic in Computer Organization or Architecture, use of recurrence relation in Complexity analysis of Algorithm analysis and design, Computational geometry behind Computer Graphics and Digital Image Processing, use of Stochastic and Fuzzy programming in engineering design /model in non-deterministic situation in an environment with uncertainties, imprecision, partial truth or inexactness, the use of Laplace Transform or Discrete / First Fourier transform in Voice and Speech recognition, that of Wavelets and Fractals in Signal processing, use of Time Series Analysis in a whole lot of Technological application from Software Engineering to Geographical Information Systems (GIS), use of Statics / Dynamics in Robotics and Mechatronics, Use of Trigonometry in Civil Structural Design, use of special functions in Signals and Systems are only few illustrations.","Saha, Sourav;Dhar, Abhishek;Gupta, Somsubhra",Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2023-11-28,Swami Vivekananda University,Data Mining ;  Machine Intelligence ;  Math-bio rule ;  Mathematical structure ;  Pattern Recognition
Materials Design and System Innovation for Direct and Indirect Seawater Electrolysis,"Green hydrogen production from renewably powered water electrolysis is considered as an ideal approach to decarbonizing the energy and industry sectors. Given the high-cost supply of ultra-high-purity water, as well as the mismatched distribution of water sources and renewable energies, combining seawater electrolysis with coastal solar/offshore wind power is attracting increasing interest for large-scale green hydrogen production. However, various impurities in seawater lead to corrosive and toxic halides, hydroxide precipitation, and physical blocking, which will significantly degrade catalysts, electrodes, and membranes, thus shortening the stable service life of electrolyzers. To accelerate the development of seawater electrolysis, it is crucial to widen the working potential gap between oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution reactions and develop flexible and highly efficient seawater purification technologies. In this review, we comprehensively discuss present challenges, research efforts, and design principles for direct/indirect seawater electrolysis from the aspects of materials engineering and system innovation. Further opportunities in developing efficient and stable catalysts, advanced membranes, and integrated electrolyzers are highlighted for green hydrogen production from both seawater and low-grade water sources.","He, Wenjun;Li, Xinxin;Tang, Cheng;Zhou, Shujie;Lu, Xunyu;Li, Weihong;Li, Xue;Zeng, Xiaoyuan;Dong, Peng;Zhang, Yingjie;Zhang, Qiang",Journal,ACS Nano,2023-11-28,UNSW Sydney;Tsinghua University;Kunming University of Science and Technology;City University of Hong Kong,chlorine evolution reaction ;  corrosive effect ;  green hydrogen ;  long-term stability ;  materials engineering ;  membrane-based reactor ;  oxygen evolution reaction ;  seawater electrolysis ;  seawater purification ;  selectivity
Using Virtual Reality To Facilitate Teaching-Learning Of Technology Innovation Systems,"Virtual Reality is a key tool for educators to enhance the teaching-learning process. After the pandemic, academia confronted the situation of how to find new ways to teach students to keep them interested and motivated. While plenty of studies are related to the use of innovative technologies in education, only a few specifically discuss novel teaching resources for engineers soon to graduate. To fill this gap, this study presents an exploratory approach based on the use of Virtual Reality, which is seen as a tool that will bring new opportunities for their future professional careers. For this, the course on Technology Innovation Systems, which belongs to an Industrial Engineering major from a private University in Mexico, is presented. Results show that students were motivated to do their best in the assignments delivered if they experienced Virtual Reality and in addition, it promoted more integrated and collaborative work. This research adds value to people who want to be on the front line of education by introducing new technologies for students in the final part of their studies.","Rodriguez-Salvador, Marisela;Algarra-Chavez, Maria Fernanda",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-11-25,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Teaching-Learning process ;  Virtual Reality

Advances in Skeletal Muscle Engineering in Biomedical Research,"Skeletal muscle contributes significantly to human health, which is closely relevant to human locomotion, energy metabolism, immune regulation, and aging. Skeletal muscle holds the potential to recover its healthy condition via self-repairing after minor damage. However, the capacity of sarcous self-repair becomes incompetent following massive trauma or some myopathy, which raises a huge demand for skeletal muscle regeneration. Skeletal muscle engineering aims to rebuild muscle tissues in vitro to repair muscle injuries, develop pathological models, advance myopathy-related research, and explore myopathy-related medications. This review summarizes the advances in skeletal muscle engineering, including the cell resources that can be used in muscle regeneration, the recent progress of rebuilding methods for skeletal muscle engineering, as well as the biomedical applications of engineered skeletal muscle for tissue repair, drug testing, disease modeling, and soft robots. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives are discussed on improving skeletal muscle engineering by integrating multidisciplinary approaches, thus accelerating the technological innovation and translational application of this area.","Zhao, Mengqian;Liu, Haitao;Zhang, Xu;Qin, Jianhua",Journal,Advanced Materials Technologies,2023-11-24,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences;University of Science and Technology of China;Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences,disease modeling ;  drug testing ;  microfabrications ;  skeletal muscle engineering
An investigation of Malware Detection System using Deep Learning on computing Systems,"In our digital age, security breaches brought on by malicious software (malware) attacks are on the rise and pose a serious security risk. Due to the exponential rise in malware attacks, which has had a negative impact on many computer users, businesses, and governments, malware detection is still a popular research area. Increased use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for malware detection. These systems can learn from patterns and anomalies, improving their ability to detect new and sophisticated malware strains. The static and dynamic analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns used by current malware detection tools is time-consuming and has shown to be unsuccessful at detecting unknown infections. Modern malware uses polymorphic, metamorphic, and other evasive strategies to swiftly change malware behavior and produce a lot of new infections. Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are now frequently used to analyze malware effectively because these new malwares are typically versions of previous malwares. However, these methods take a lot of time because they require intensive feature engineering, learning, and representation, the feature engineering stage can be entirely skipped by employing the more sophisticated MLAs, like deep learning recently disclosed works in this area demonstrate how their algorithms perform when given biased training data, which restricts their usefulness in urgent circumstances. Keep in mind that the landscape of cybersecurity is dynamic, and new innovations and challenges are likely to have emerged since my last update. It's essential to stay informed about the latest developments in malware detection to effectively protect against evolving threats. There is a strong case for evaluating these to reduce bias approaches separately to create a new, improved technique for efficient zero-day virus detection. This article prepares the way for an impactful visual scalable and hybrid deep learning frameworks for real-time deployments for malware detection.","Srivastava, Satyajee;Raju, Kommisetti Murthy;Dudeja, Deepak Dudeja;Gagandeep, ;Shaik, Nazeer;Yadav, Abhishek",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-11-23,"Shri Vishnu Engineering College For Women;Srinivasa Ramanujan Institute of Technology;Chandigarh University;Babu Banarasi Das University;Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University), Mullana;MMEC",analysis and forecast crime ;  crime prediction ;  LSTM and ARIMA based crime prediction ;  multi-scale ;  public security

Analysis of Enterprise Data-Driven Innovation Diffusion Supervision System Based on the Perspective of Green Supply Chain,"To promote the market substitution of digital innovation technology and green products and alleviate the pressure of energy and environment, a three-party evolutionary game model of innovation diffusion based on core manufacturers, affiliated enterprises and the government is established in the article to explore the adjustment of the three-party game strategy of core manufacturers and affiliated enterprises under government supervision, and then analyze the optimal stability conditions that are conducive to the innovation diffusion of digital innovation technology. It is found that the core manufacturers would choose the diffusion strategy of digital innovation technology, which would take the initiative to adopt the diffused digital innovation technology due to cost considerations, without easily choosing independent research and development (hereafter R&D strategy); the reward and punishment mechanism made by the government for core manufacturers’ digital innovation technology diffusion could effectively promote technology diffusion in the market.","Pan, Wenjun;Miao, Lin;Lin, Zhenxing",Journal,Journal of Organizational and End User Computing,2023-11-22,Tianjin University;Huaqiao University;Liming Vocational University,Data driven ;  Evolutionary game ;  Green supply chain ;  Regulatory system ;  Simulation

Synthetic biology as a breakthrough direction in the creation of biological systems,"Synthetic biology as a scientific direction appeared at the beginning of the 21st century on the basis of the accumulated scientific and technological base and discoveries in the fields of systems biology, biotechnology, molecular biology, bioengineering and genetic engineering. The formation of synthetic biology as a separate area fell on the period of 2000–2010, when the first discoveries were made related to the standardization of DNA parts, combinatorial synthesis of the genetic network, synthetic schemes that promote the penetration of bacteria into tumor cells, etc., and the first scientific - research centers and teams (Craig Venter Institute and the Center for Synthetic Biology and Innovation at Imperial College London), the first international conference on synthetic biology Synthetic Biology 1.0 was held. Since 2010, there has been an intensive development of this direction, as well as an increase in the number of developments with applied applications (creation of the first synthetic cell, artemisinin synthesis, the first computer-generated genome, etc.). One of the main factors in the development of synthetic biology has been the expansion of data analysis and modeling capabilities, the active digitalization of research and the development of interdisciplinary areas, such as bioinformatics. Today, the areas of application of synthetic biology are actively expanding (medicine, pharmaceuticals, food industry, agriculture, cosmetics, textile industry, energy, etc.), which leads to an increase in its role in ensuring economic growth.","Turpal, Khasanov",Conference Proceeding,BIO Web of Conferences,2023-11-20,Kadyrov Chechen State University,
Active and transformative learning in STEAM disciplines: From curriculum design to social impact,"Active and Transformative Learning in STEAM Disciplines is a unique reference volume for the new student-centric and objectives-oriented learning environment where individual and team learning paths enhance problem solving capabilities.

How does the digital transformation of corporates affect green technology innovation? An empirical study from the perspective of asymmetric effects and structural breakpoints,"With the continuous advancement of the digital economy and green development strategies, exploring the impact of digital transformation on corporate green technology innovation becomes an importantly urgent issue. Based on the perspectives of asymmetric effects and structural breakpoints, this paper empirically analyses the effect of digital transformation on green technology innovation, as well as its heterogeneity and non-linear characteristics, using fixed effect models and panel threshold model with a sample of Chinese A-share-listed corporates from 2011 to 2021. The findings suggest that digital transformation of corporates can significantly promotes green technology innovation, which remains valid after a series of endogenous and robustness tests. Heterogeneous regression results shows that digital transformation exhibits an asymmetric impact on green technology innovation, with greater incentive effect for state-owned corporates, manufacturing corporates, and corporates located in areas with stricter environmental regulations. Additionally, threshold effect analyses prove that a positive non-linear relationship between digital transformation and green technology innovation, when corporate human capital, industry competition and regional institutional quality exceeded their respective structural breakpoints, the marginal contribution of digital transformation is further strengthened. This research provides clearer policy insights for corporates to promote cleaner production and low carbon development through digitization.","Dou, Qianqian;Gao, Xinwei",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-11-20,China University of Petroleum (East China),China ;  Digital transformation ;  Green technology innovation ;  Heterogeneous effect ;  Threshold effect
Systematic framework to select the sustainable best design for an automated fertiliser blending system,"The innovative device to automatically irrigate nutrients and water to the plants without affecting the environment has become increasingly important in sustainable agriculture and food production. This research aims to propose a prototype for a control-based Automated Fertiliser Blending System by investigating a comprehensive conceptual design framework and specific requirements from the market survey in designing the new device. The House of Quality, Morphological Chart, and Pugh tools were adopted to select the best conceptual design among the available design options. The approach of product design selection is based on ranking in engineering characteristics to generate design options. The benchmark design in this study is a timer system with two stock tanks. Conceptual Design 4 was selected as the advanced conceptual design because this system uses a Programmable Logic Controller to control the blending process of fertiliser solutions precisely with minimal nutrient loss and water runoff. A design prototype was developed for Design 4 using SolidWorks by considering all selection parameters of chosen criteria that were analysed based on the HOQ and Pugh methods. Conclusively, the proposed design of the Automated Fertilizer Blending System can provide technological innovation in designing this device. This will assist in coordinating better product development for potential product commercialization toward achieving sustainable and precise agriculture.","Che Aziz, Dhiya’ Hawina;Razak, Nurul Hanim;Zulkafli, Nur Izyan;Klemeš, Jiří Jaromír",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-11-20,"Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering;Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka",Automated fertiliser blending system (AFBS) ;  Best design selection ;  Fertigation ;  House of quality (HOQ) ;  Pugh method ;  SolidWorks model
"Load capacity factor and carbon emissions: Assessing environmental quality among MINT nations through technology, debt, and green energy","The surge in global environmental degradation, which has resulted in a tremendous increase in species extinction, increased deforestation rates, and increased proximity to the 2-degree critical temperature thresholds, demands more attention. Although existing studies have examined the individual effects of technology innovation, external debt, and green energy consumption on various sustainable outcomes, no existing study has considered their interrelation focusing on the load capacity factor (LCF). Also, no existing study has examined the aforementioned variables' environmental impact by comparing the outcomes of CO2 emissions and LCF for MINT economies. This study, therefore, proposes a theoretical framework integrating these constructs, providing a roadmap for sustainable and effective mitigation strategies using MINT nations and comparing the LCF results to carbon emissions. By using data from 2002 to 2020 and the Driscoll-Kraay standard error estimator with fixed effects, we have found that while long-term external debt, renewable energy, and access to clean energy improve load capacity factor, changes in non-renewable energy and technological innovation decrease load capacity factor of MINT countries. We recommend that these nations prioritize investments in research and development to foster technological innovation across various sectors while enforcing environmental compliance to minimize the negative externalities associated with non-renewable activities.","Ali, Ernest Baba;Opoku-Mensah, Evans;Ofori, Elvis Kwame;Agbozo, Ebenezer",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-11-20,Ural Federal University;University for Development Studies Ghana;Chengdu University of Technology;University of Galway,External debt ;  Green energy consumption ;  Load capacity factor ;  MINT nations ;  Technology innovation
Sustainability process innovations resulting in new value-added byproducts: principal lessons from second-order system-dynamics engineering (SOSDE),"Purpose: Second-order system-dynamics engineering (SOSDE) involves constructing and running enterprise manufacturing simulation models with new proposals for operational processes, byproducts, supply chain and/or downstream marketing designs. This paper aims to describe sustainability the principal lessons from enacting SOSDE research for achieving goals in large manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a case research commentary in the agricultural industry that contributes abductively derives six principal lessons from SOSDE research on introducing sustainability-focused manufacturing and product innovations. Operational processes in large-scale poultry processing plants in an emerging market represent the specific industry and firm domain of this case study. Alternative SOSDE simulation models of decisions, materials flow and outcomes with versus without operational innovations were constructed following one-to-one interviews with experienced farm managers and entrepreneurs. Findings: The principles demonstrate how large farms in a developing nation (i.e. Bangladesh) go about adopting radically innovative manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations to improve traditional operations. This study confirms and expands on the general observation that SOSDE can help achieve sustainability and environmental, social and governance goals, contribute new value outcomes by converting unused production wastes into valuable byproducts and introduce design efficiencies in production, supply chain and marketing processes. SOSDE complements, while being a revolutionary departure from, “six sigma management programs” that focus on achieving exceptional and near mistake-free manufacturing operations. Both represent distinct philosophies and sets of actions that sometimes can conflict with one another. Embracing both successfully in the same enterprise is a goal that may appear unreachable, seemingly impossible to achieve and yet represents a manufacturing/marketing epitome that is observable in exceptional enterprises. Research limitations/implications: This paper may generate controversy as well as advance interest in applying SOSDE in introductions of improved manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations aiming to accomplish radical improvements in sustainability goals. Practical implications: This commentary describes how using SOSDE and running alternative production simulations with versus without including superior, radically new, process innovations enable the firm to find and eliminate glitches in system changes and reduce the fear associating with breakdowns and financial losses due to inadequate knowledge of operating new industrial procedures and outcomes. Social implications: Introductions of superior radically new innovations in industrial manufacturing and marketing via SOSDE frequently include manufacturing firms embracing new environment sustainability objectives and additional marketable byproducts from the firm's main productions lines. This commentary offers details on how this process is enacted in poultry manufacturing in an economically emerging nation. Originality/value: Running simulations in SOSDE research offers a low-cost, fast and in-depth method to test “what-if” impacts of enhanced and radical innovations into product/service manufacturing operations – benefits supporting the recommendation to apply systems dynamics in business and industrial marketing.","Shamsuddoha, Mohammad;Woodside, Arch G.",Journal,Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,2023-11-20,Boston College;Western Illinois University,Radical innovation ;  SOSDE ;  Supply chain ;  Sustainability ;  System dynamics
New strategies to promote physics under gender mainstreaming in Mexico,"After the last International Conference on Women in Physics, the Mexican team continues work with additional strategies to create a gender equity environment for the development of education, research, technology, and innovation. For instance, the Mexican Physical Society (SMF, for Sociedad Mexicana de Física) adopted a code of conduct to avoid gender inequity and discrimination during all SMF's activities, which resulted in the creation of the Equity and Nondiscrimination Committee. From 2017 to 2019, during the Mexican National Physics Congress, we interacted with undergraduates to promote the Mexican Women in Physics group. Additional projects aim to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) vocations to young girls (between 5 and 8 years old). For junior and senior high school girls, we worked with the Network of Science, Technology and Gender to create multidisciplinary guidelines to promote gender mainstreaming in STEM vocations.

This paper elucidates the intricate coupling mechanism of hydrate dissociation, seepage, and heat transfer within marine sedimentary layers, all of which are induced by installing suction anchors. Employing a multi-physical field coupling methodology, numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the influencing factors and spatiotemporal evolution of hydrate dissociation and the impact of hydrate dissociation on seepage and pressure fields. The results indicate that the increases in negative installation pressure, penetration depth, and stratigraphic sensible heat promote hydrate dissociation. The hydrate dissociation enhances seepage, reduces the pressure gradient in the anchor, and decreases the suction anchor sinking force. Consequently, this research holds practical implications for guiding suction anchor installation within seabed characterized by buried hydrate.","Han, Shuxin;Deng, Xuejing;Li, Wangchen;Yu, Long;Guan, Longfei",Journal,Ocean Engineering,2023-11-15,State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering;China University of Petroleum (East China),Hydrate dissociation ;  Multi-field coupling ;  Pressure field ;  Suction anchor negative pressure installation ;  Two-phase flow
Optimal innovation strategies of automakers with market competition under the dual-credit policy,"Implementing the dual-credit policy has brought about a milestone shift in China's automotive market, which plays a significant role in automakers’ innovation. This study constructs an evolutionary game model based on the Hotelling theory to explore the impact of the dual-credit policy on the innovation strategies of conventional automakers (CAs) and new energy automakers (NAs). Further, a multi-agent simulation model is used to analyze the intrinsic mechanism of the endogenous and exogenous elements of the policy on innovation-decision behaviors. The results show that the dual-credit policy can effectively promote CAs’ technology innovation and electrification, but the incentive effect shows a high degree of heterogeneity across the different scales of NAs. Notably, the competitive market environment significantly affects the incentive effect of the dual-credit policy on NAs’ technology innovation. The revision of the dual-credit policy will mainly affect the innovation dynamics of NAs: the effect of the new energy vehicle (NEV) accounting multiplier is positive, whereas the effect of proportion requirements for NEVs production and standard model credit is negative. The findings further show the threshold effect of the credit transaction price on automakers’ innovation incentives, with the price threshold being higher for NAs than for CAs.","Yu, Hui;Li, Ying;Wang, Wei",Journal,Energy,2023-11-15,ECUST School of Business;Hohai University,Agent-based simulation ;  Automakers ;  Dual-credit policy ;  Evolutionary game model ;  Hotelling model ;  Innovation strategy

A Health Evaluation System for Modern Ecological Irrigation Districts in Ningxia Based on FAHP Analysis Research & Empirical Evidence,"To make a scientific and rigorous assessment of the construction of modern ecological irrigation districts, this paper based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to address the issues of randomness, repeatability, and incompleteness in indicator selection. Focusing on objectives of large-scale irrigation district modernization in China, a comprehensive evaluation system for the health of the modern ecological irrigation district in Ningxia was developed. The evaluation system comprised six aspects, including modernization of safety assurance and service capacity, modernization of engineering facilities, modernization of innovation capabilities, modernization of management systems, water-saving efficiency and production efficiency, and optimization of the ecological environment. By applying an index optimization model, the number of evaluation indicators was reduced from 44 to 27, capturing approximately 90.37% of the overall system's essence. This optimization achieved the desired outcome of fewer indicators while maintaining a high level of comprehensiveness. Taking the pilot counties of Ningxia modern ecological irrigation district as the evaluation object, an empirical study of the evaluation system was conducted. The results showed that 57.85% of Litong District was at a healthy level, which was consistent with the actual situation of the irrigation district. The evaluation system could effectively reflect the main achievements, existing challenges, and deficiencies of the pilot counties'efforts to promote the construction of a modern ecological irrigation district.

Exploring User Perceptions from the User-Centered Usability Perspective of the Museum Online Virtual Exhibitions,"Users' perceptions of online museums' virtual exhibitions still need vivid exploration, public museums are increasingly adopting technological innovations for online virtual exhibitions, but further studies are required to understand how audiences and users respond to them. This preliminary research study aimed to explore users' perceptions of the museum's online virtual exhibition from the user-centered usability perspective, which refers to the process of evaluating products and services based on their usability for users. In this study, we put forth a conceptual and theoretical framework to guide our investigation and employed descriptive statistics and factor analysis. The analysis identifies two key factors, F1 and F2, that influence users' perceptions and reveal their relationship with the examined factors. Factor 1 (F1) reflects user experience (0.612), user ease (0.754), user satisfaction (0.580), and user expectation (0.551) from Scale 1. While displaying an inverse relationship with Scale 2-5 items, including impact on the user (-0.881), user attitude (-0.732), user satisfaction (-0.881), and usefulness of techs (-0.634). Factor 2 (F2) exhibits high loadings for user overall experience (0.930) and user experience of virtual tools (0.657) from Scale 1. These findings indicate the significant influence on how users perceive the experience of the museum's online virtual exhibition. Thus, a comprehensive approach integrating user-centered usability perspectives, user perceptions, and technological innovations, is essential for creating an optimal public museum's online virtual exhibition experience under the transdisciplinary engineering principles.","Gilani, Fazal;Wang, Chang;Li, Fan;Lee, Ching Hung",Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2023-11-07,Xi'an Jiaotong University;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Online museum ;  User perceptions ;  User-centered usability evaluation ;  User-centered usability perspective ;  Virtual exhibition
Active Learning in Engineering Education: Case Study in Mechanics for Engineering,"A task force on outcome-based approaches (OBE) to develop higher education was focused on by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI) and Mahidol University (MU). MU had already started emphasizing student outcomes in its quality reviews and considered OBE a logical next step in advancing higher education. Active learning, in the concept of 'teach less, learn more', is a teaching method that involves engaging students in the learning process through activities such as discussion, boardgame, project-based solving, and collaborative activities. It was claimed that academic attainment could be enhanced by active learning. In the field of engineering education, active learning has been shown to be an effective way to enhance student learning and improve outcomes. This paper gives a comprehensive study case of the subject 'Mechanics for Engineer' including how the instructor created the active learning activities for each module, the indicators used to assess students' learning outcomes, an analysis of the results of using active learning, and the reflections of stakeholders. The presented activities in this paper consist of 3D equilibrium & Application: Think-Pair-Share, Vector addition - Board game, and Structural analysis - Project-based learning.

The Challenges of Conducting Transdisciplinary Engineering Research: A Case Study of the Made Smarter Innovation: Centre for People-Led Digitalisation,"In order to meet growing complexity in societal and industrial requirements for engineering projects, there is a growing need for research projects that transcend traditional single discipline silos. Widespread experience and a growing academic literature suggest that there are inherent challenges in conducting transdisciplinary research together with further issues arising from institutional barriers, working across diverse teams, and an evolving industrial and funding environment. Failure to engage with these issues may be remiss in discouraging future projects or negatively impacting the success and influence of extant transdisciplinary engineering endeavours. Within this paper we present a case study of the Made Smarter Innovation: Centre for People-Led Digitalisation, a £5 million, engineering led, transdisciplinary research Centre. The approach of the Centre - governance, and research centre design - are presented and through a workshop, the Centre's Principal Investigators reflected upon common challenges and how management and design of the Centre might have mitigated these issues. Conclusions find that strategies employed in the design of the Centre have alleviated some common challenges to transdisciplinary research, however, integration of senior academics and the lack of broad organisational oversight within non-academic key contacts can be problematic. Future work will look to expand the study and incorporate the perspectives of researchers working within the Centre.","Lattanzio, Susan;Goh, Yee Mey;Houghton, Robert;Newnes, Linda",Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2023-11-07,University of Bath;University of Nottingham;Loughborough University,Transdisciplinary ;  Transdisciplinary Engineering ;  transdisciplinary research
Global Patent Technology Portfolio Study of Agricultural UAV Innovations,"With the rapid development of technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly called drones, will become affordable with a wide variety of applications. UAV technologies in agriculture are critically important due to climate changes and the continuous growth of global populations that need huge food production. Demand for food and produce is increasing, while agricultural labor forces continue to decline. According to a report presented by The World Bank, the percentage of the global workforce related to agriculture has already fallen from 40% in 2000 to 27% in 2019. To plant efficiently and manage agricultural labor issues, many countries are investing in agricultural UAV technologies and applications. By analyzing the patent portfolio of UAV-related technologies for agricultural applications, this technology mining research helps to discover the critical trends and potentials of agricultural UAV development. This study demonstrates the crucial necessity of transdisciplinary engineering practices that are closely related to precision, automation, and even intelligent agricultural activities and productions. We identify the transdisciplinary domain knowledge ontology schema, i.e., the integrated agriculture, UAV-related technologies and their sub-technologies. These domain patents are searched and found using intelligent patent text analysis techniques. Finally, a strategic agricultural UAV R&D plan is presented to promote precision farming with high efficiencies and profitability (e.g., Taiwan farmers focus on organic farming, quality excellence of produce, and happy agriculture) using innovative UAV technologies.","Trappey, Amy J.C.;Lin, Joseph G.B.;Chen, Kevin H.K.;Chen, Mickey M.C.",Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2023-11-07,National Tsing Hua University,advanced agriculture ;  patent portfolio ;  Precision agriculture ;  technology mining ;  transdisciplinary innovations ;  unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
Future Perspectives for the Identification and Sequencing of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide-Capped RNAs,"Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is composed primarily of four canonical building blocks. In addition, more than 170 modifications contribute to its stability and function. Metabolites like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) were found to function as 5′-cap structures of RNA, just like 7-methylguanosine (m7G). The identification of NAD-capped RNA sequences was first made possible by NAD captureSeq, a multistep protocol for the specific targeting, purification, and sequencing of NAD-capped RNAs, developed in the authors’ laboratory in the year 2015. In recent years, a number of NAD-RNA identification protocols have been developed by researchers around the world. They have enabled the discovery and identification of NAD-RNAs in bacteria, archaea, yeast, plants, mice, and human cells, and they play a key role in studying the biological functions of NAD capping. We introduce the four parameters of yield, specificity, evaluability, and throughput and describe to the reader how an ideal NAD-RNA identification protocol would perform in each of these disciplines. These parameters are further used to describe and analyze existing protocols that follow two general methodologies: the capture approach and the decapping approach. Capture protocols introduce an exogenous moiety into the NAD-cap structure in order to either specifically purify or sequence NAD-capped RNAs. In decapping protocols, the NAD cap is digested to 5′-monophosphate RNA, which is then specifically targeted and sequenced. Both approaches, as well as the different protocols within them, have advantages and challenges that we evaluate based on the aforementioned parameters. In addition, we suggest improvements in order to meet the future needs of research on NAD-modified RNAs, which is beginning to emerge in the area of cell-type specific samples. A limiting factor of the capture approach is the need for large amounts of input RNA. Here we see a high potential for innovation within the key targeting step: The enzymatic modification reaction of the NAD-cap structure catalyzed by ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ADPRC) is a major contributor to the parameters of yield and specificity but has mostly seen minor changes since the pioneering protocol of NAD captureSeq and needs to be more stringently analyzed. The major challenge of the decapping approach remains the specificity of the decapping enzymes, many of which act on a variety of 5′-cap structures. Exploration of new decapping enzymes or engineering of already known enzymes could lead to improvements in NAD-specific protocols. The use of a curated set of decapping enzymes in a combinatorial approach could allow for the simultaneous detection of multiple 5′-caps. The throughput of both approaches could be greatly improved by early sample pooling. We propose that this could be achieved by introducing a barcode RNA sequence before or immediately after the NAD-RNA targeting steps. With increased processing capacity and a potential decrease in the cost per sample, protocols will gain the potential to analyze large numbers of samples from different growth conditions and treatments. This will support the search for biological roles of NAD-capped RNAs in all types of organisms.","Möhler, Marvin;Jäschke, Andres",Journal,Accounts of Chemical Research,2023-11-07,Universität Heidelberg,
"Mapping horizon scanning systems for medical devices: similarities, differences, and lessons learned","Objectives This article presents the mapping of horizons scanning systems (HSS) for medical devices, conducted by the Medical Devices Working Group of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative (IHSI MDWG). It provides an overview of the identified HSS, highlights similarities and differences between the systems, and lessons learned. Methods Potentially relevant HSS were identified through literature searches, scan of an overview of EuroScan members, and input from the IHSI MDWG members. Structured information was collected from organizations that confirmed having an HSS for medical devices. Results Sixteen initiatives could be identified, of which 11 are currently ongoing. The purposes of the HSS range from raising awareness of trends and new developments to managing informed decisions on innovative health services in hospitals. The time-horizon is most often 3 years up to a few months before market entry. Three models of identification of new technologies crystallized: a reactive (stakeholders outside HSS inform), a pro-active (actively searching multifold sources), and a hybrid model. Prioritization is often conducted by separate committees via scoring or debate. The outputs focus either on in-depth information of single technologies or on a class of technologies or on technologies in specific disease areas. Conclusions The identified HSS share the common experience that horizon scanning (HS) for medical devices is a resource-intensive exercise that requires a dedicated and skilled team. Insights into the identified HSS and their experiences will be used in the continued work of the IHSI MDWG on its proposal for an IHSI HSS for medical devices.","Ormstad, Sari Susanna;Wild, Claudia;Erdös, Judit;Moulton, Kristen",Journal,International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care,2023-11-07,Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health;Folkehelseinstituttet;Austrian Institute for Health Technology Assessment GmbH,diffusion of innovation ;  equipment and supplies ;  horizon scanning ;  international cooperation ;  medical devices

Strength and environmental evaluation of building bricks using industrial waste for liveable environments,"Researchers around the world have been enthusiastically using industrial waste to develop eco-friendly building materials. The main objective of this study was to explore the potential of using local industrial waste, such as Solid Waste Fly Ash (SWFA) and Paint Sludge (PS), as alternative to non-renewable laterite soil. During the preliminary stage, compacted cylinders of two systems were investigated: Laterite Soil (LS) and SWFA at 50:50 ratio, and a combination of LS, SWFA and PS (LSP) at 50:25:25 ratio. Traditional stabilisers Hydrated Lime (HL) and Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), as well as Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), were used at different ratios (10%, 20%, 30% and 40%) for these cylinders. The cylinders were cured for 7, 28 and 60 days prior to strength and water absorption test. The results showed that 30% stabiliser dosage provided the best strength and economic benefits. Based on these findings, pilot industrial and commercial trials were conducted using full-sized unfired bricks. The LSP brick system with the blended stabiliser HL-GGBS performed exceptionally well in terms of engineering properties. The investigation suggests that SWFA and Paint Sludge can be promising substitutes for clay in unfired bricks production, promoting waste recycling and reducing the impact of landfills. Using local available waste materials to manufacture unfired bricks present a viable alternative to fired bricks, especially in low-load bearing situations. This research contributes to innovation, enhanced waste management, and the concept of green building. Moreover, it minimizes energy usage and hazardous emissions associated with brick firing, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","Rahmat, Mohamad Nidzam;Saleh, Ani Maslina",Journal,Construction and Building Materials,2023-11-03,Universiti Teknologi MARA,Building material ;  Industrial waste ;  Sound insulation ;  Strength ;  Sustainable development goals (SDGs) ;  Thermal comfort
COVID-19 CRISIS ERA; ENGINEERING INTERVENTIONS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA,"Despite numerous notable contributions by Africans during the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak, little effort has been made to document these contributions in a comprehensive publication. Herein this work, an attempt was made to bring together African-based technological interventions proffered in Sub-Saharan Africa during this period. Across Africa generally, different engineering methods were used to develop several contrivances such as ventilators as well as deploying Artificial Intelligence to facilitate contact-free human-human and human-object interactions. Broadly, these approaches center on two key areas which are efforts to mitigate the spread of the infectious disease, and management of the infected, which are the focus of this present work. Indeed, a comprehensive report of these efforts is essential to appraise the contributions of the home-based researchers and to create an archive for future research and decision making across the African continent, thus necessitating the need for this systematic appraisal.","Oyejide, A.

Learning Effects of Augmented Reality and Game-Based Learning for Science Teaching in Higher Education in the Context of Education for Sustainable Development,"In the course of digitalization, new technologies and innovations are continuously introduced to the educational sector. For instance, augmented reality (AR) is increasingly applied in science teaching in both school and higher education. Combining real and virtual content potentially enhances interactivity and understanding of the learning process. This teaching and learning approach can positively impact various learning outcomes, such as learning gains and motivation. This paper aims to investigate the positive learning effects of AR using a game-based AR learning environment: “Beat the Beast”. In line with the concept of an education for sustainable development (ESD) topic, microplastics, this learning environment follows an interdisciplinary approach, combining the subjects of biology, chemistry, and engineering. To determine and distinguish the effects of implementing the technology AR in science learning environments as well as the principles of game-based learning, we contrasted the learning environment into two factors: one with AR and one without AR and the other with a game and without a game. A quasi-experimental design with 203 pre-service teachers of the first semester of all subjects was chosen to evaluate the four different types of settings with questionnaires on motivation, technology acceptance, user engagement, cognitive load, computer self-efficacy, knowledge, and ESD outcomes in higher education. Our research demonstrates that although augmented reality (AR) imposes a relatively elevated cognitive load, it does not negatively affect learning effects. In spite of the increased cognitive load, learners in AR settings do not exhibit lesser knowledge acquisition compared to those in alternative environments. Moreover, our investigation highlights AR’s potential to amplify motivation and user engagement. Contrary to expectations, in the context of the selected subject matter and target audience, game-based adaptations of the educational environment fail to enhance learning outcomes. These versions actually underperform compared to other formats in both motivational and engagement metrics.","Czok, Valerie;Krug, Manuel;Müller, Sascha;Huwer, Johannes;Weitzel, Holger",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-11-01,Universität Konstanz;Pädagogische Hochschule Weingarten;Thurgau University of Teacher Education,augmented reality ;  cognitive load ;  computer self-efficacy ;  DPACK ;  engineering teaching ;  game-based learning ;  motivation ;  science teaching ;  technology acceptance ;  TPACK ;  user engagement
Unraveling Debris-Enhanced Local Scour Patterns around Non-Cylindrical Bridge Piers: Experimental Insights and Innovative Modeling,"Bridge structures face a critical threat from localized scour-induced damage, prompting urgent attention to civil infrastructure resilience. Prior research has primarily focused on the influence of pier shapes on scour patterns. However, the exploration of the combined effects of various debris shapes, each possessing distinct properties, on predictive scour depth models around the non-cylindrical pier has hitherto remained less researched. This study explored the complex dynamics governing local scour around bridge piers, focusing on the influence of surface and near-surface debris. This research shed light on changes in scour depth by investigating factors like pier geometries, debris arrangements, and submersion depths. The experiments and analysis revealed the effects of various pier shapes—cylindrical, square, rectangular, oblong, oval, and lenticular—on scour patterns. Different geometries influenced primary scour zones and affected areas, with square piers causing the deepest scour and lenticular ones showing shallower instances. Scour depths typically peaked upstream across geometries, but ogival and lenticular shapes exhibited unique patterns. The research also introduced a formula that integrated debris attributes into predictive scour depth modeling, validated with favorable accuracy. Ultimately, this predictive model advances scour prediction, particularly in debris-laden flows, offering valuable insights for engineering and management practices in understanding real-world scour mechanisms and hydraulic dynamics.","Al-Jubouri, Muhanad;Ray, Richard P.;Al-Khafaji, Mahmoud Saleh",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-11-01,Al-Nahrain University;Széchenyi István University,bridge structures ;  civil infrastructure resilience ;  debris interaction ;  localized scour ;  pier geometries
Exploration on the Innovation Model of County Urbanization Development with the Resource Constraints in China,"The 14th Five-Year Plan for China proposes to promote the urbanization process from a county perspective, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to develop county urbanization. However, in the context of relatively limited resources, insufficient funds, and comparatively lower land values in Chinese counties, how to promote county urbanization remains the primary challenge, which has not been studied yet. This study first analyzes the necessity of promoting county urbanization from four dimensions: national development strategy, industrial policy development, local government status, and enterprise development demands using literature research and survey interviews. Based on field research conducted in 32 counties in China, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis is carried out on the county urbanization process in this study. By analyzing the developmental status and challenges of major urban areas, expansion areas of counties, and their surrounding countryside, this paper proposes a “three-level gradient integration” concept for the spatial integration of county urbanization. Furthermore, the mechanism of multi-agent linkage to promote county urbanization was explored based on the theory of urban governance and the characteristics of county urbanization. Subsequently, relying on the analysis of policies, such as land acquisition and integrated land improvement, and adopting modes, such as “Investor + Engineering Procurement Construction + Operation” (investor + EPC + O) and renovate–operate–transfer (ROT), we propose a pathway for promoting county urbanization through the linkage of government, enterprises, and residents. This study provides insight into promoting the county urbanization process. Additionally, each country faces the common issue of how to use limited resources to promote regional development, and this article can provide valuable insights and inspiration for addressing this shared issue by the principle of adapting to local conditions and adhering to the concept of efficient market and proactive government.","Zhou, Runchen;Guo, Yang;Wu, Yuzhe",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-11-01,"School of Public Affairs, Zhejiang University;Hangzhou City University",county urbanization ;  mechanism ;  multi-agent linkage ;  pathway ;  resource constraints
Analyzing Core Competencies and Correlation Paths of Emerging Engineering Talent in the Construction Industry—An Integrated ISM–MICMAC Approach,"The structure of core competencies is the key to constructing the “Chinese Standards” of engineering education and cultivating quality emerging engineering talent. This article synthesized the research results of existing theoretical analyses and educational practices. In total, 11 core competencies of emerging engineering talent were extracted via a literature review and the Delphi method, of which the hierarchical relationships and correlation paths between the core competencies of emerging engineering talent were determined via the use of Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Matrice d’ Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliqués à un Classement (MICMAC), where corresponding improvement strategies were eventually proposed. It was found that professional knowledge and engineering thinking, as independent factors, have the greatest impact on the core competencies of emerging engineering talent. Taking the lead in cultivating the core competencies, which are dependence factors, including entrepreneurial ability, lifelong learning ability, professional ethics, patriotism and collectivism, and intercultural competence, is more conducive to improving the quality of emerging engineering talent, enabling the cultivation of high-quality composite talent with strong engineering practical abilities, innovation abilities, and international competitiveness. The hierarchical relationships and correlation paths determined in this study provide theoretical support for developing scientific objectives for emerging engineering talent training, carrying out educational practice, and reducing the difficulty in application practices. The results of this research support the viewpoint that “professional foundation and practical ability” should be stressed. Limited by the disciplinary backgrounds of the authors, the compatibility between the core competencies’ framework of emerging engineering talent proposed in this article based on the construction industry and other industries still needs to be further explored.","Zhang, Ping;Ma, Shuai Ge;Zhao, Yue Nan;Cao, Xin Ying",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-11-01,Guizhou Normal University;Loughborough University,core competencies ;  correlation paths ;  emerging engineering talent ;  engineering education

Typical difference analysis and benefit⁃oriented development countermeasures of normal and high pressure shale gas in southeastern Chongqing,"Southeastern Chongqing is located in the transition zone of the southeastern margin of Sichuan Basin. Shale gas reservoirs of normal and high pressure are developed in this area. In order to promote normal pressure shale gas development benefits, starting from the typical difference analysis of normal and high pressure shale gas, through the research of drilling, core observation, experimental analysis, accumulation conditions, and produc⁃ tion dynamics, combined with shale gas exploration and development practices in southeastern Chongqing, it is clarified that the normal pressure shale gas has the typical geological characteristics of small thickness of high⁃ quality shale, low porosity, poor preservation conditions, and medium gas content. The accumulation of normal pressure shale gas is controlled by sedimentary facies, preservation conditions, and in⁃situ stress field. Affected by multi⁃stage structural transformation and differential uplift, the mechanism of normal pressure shale gas genera⁃ tion is complex, which has the characteristics of low initial production, short stable production period, slow decline, and high flowback rate. There are obvious differences between normal and high pressure shale gas in geological characteristics, enrichment regularities, generation mechanism, and production law. Considering the poor grade of normal pressure shale gas resources in southeastern Chongqing, four key countermeasures for the benefit⁃based development of normal pressure shale gas are put forward: (1) The basic geological research is furthered and the enrichment regularities and sweet spots are clarified. (2) The development technology of variable well spacing, long horizontal section, small inclined angle, strong transformation, low height difference and controlled pressure difference is established to increase the production of single well. (3) The innovation of engineering technology such as low⁃cost drilling and efficient fracturing is increased to achieve speed acceleration, efficiency improve⁃ ment, and cost reduction. (4) The institutional mechanism is innovated and an efficient organization and opera⁃ tion mode is created. The four key countermeasures effectively promote the transformation of normal pressure shale gas from resources to reserves and from reserves to benefits, facilitating the efficient development of normal pressure shale gas in southeastern Chongqing.","Zhou, ;He, Xipeng;Zhang, Peixian",Journal,Petroleum Geology and Experiment,2023-11-01,Sinopec,difference ;  efficient development countermeasures ;  geological characteristics ;  normal pressure shale gas ;  southeastern Chongqing
Specifics of humanitarization of engineering education: analysis of engineering students' perceptions and requests,"Introduction. The relevance of the research is conditioned by the need to intensify the processes of humanitarization of engineering education due to the increasing importance of social aspects of technological innovations in the situation of aggravating challenges of the high-tech world. The purpose of the study is to analyze the perceptions and requests of engineering students regarding the significance and demand for humanitarian training in engineering education. Research methods. The empirical study was conducted on the basis of Novosibirsk State Technical University (NSTU). 218 students of engineering and IT specialties participated in the survey, questionnaire and associative experiment. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results of the study. The conducted research has shown that the overwhelming majority of respondents (80.5%) have a generally positive attitude towards the category and concept of humanization of engineering education, with the level of enquiry and interest of second year students (89%) being higher than that of first year students (69%). The associative method also reveals generally positive connotations to the image and idea of humanizing the educational process. The ethics course is seen as a separate subject or discipline by 21% of respondents, the majority of students (57%) regard it as an optional course and 11.5% of respondents consider it appropriate to include it as a separate module or thematic section in existing courses. The demand for the inclusion of new ethics courses and modules in the organization of engineering education has been identified. Conclusion. The obtained results can be used as a basis for adjusting training programmes for engineering and IT specialties. Considering the identified certain problematic aspects and shortcomings in students' humanitarian training, it is necessary to expand the segment of courses focused on mastering the tools of ethical regulation in future professional activity.

Gender Differences in Responses to Competitive Organization? A Field Experiment on Differences Between STEM and Non-STEM Fields from an Internet-of-Things Platform,"Prior research, primarily based on laboratory experiments of children and students, suggests that women might be more averse to competition than are men; women might, instead, be more inclined toward collaboration. Were these findings to generalize to working-age men and women across the workforce, there could be profound implications for organizational design and personnel management. We report on a field experiment in which 97,678 adults from a wide range of fields of training and career stages were invited to join a product development platform. Individuals were randomly assigned to treatments framing the opportunity as either involving competitive or collaborative interactions with other participants. Among those outside of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, we find differences in the willingness of men and women to participate under competition. Thus, patterns in non-STEM fields conform to the usual claims of gender differences. However, among those in STEM fields, we find no statistical gender differences. Results hold under a series of alternative specifications, controls, and stratified analyses of 17 narrowly defined STEM subfields. The results are consistent with sorting into fields on the basis of competitiveness, as suggested by prior research, as well as other explanations we discuss. Overall, heterogeneity among women and heterogeneity among men appear to be at least as important as population-wide gender differences.","Boudreau, Kevin J.;Kaushik, Nilam",Journal,Organization Science,2023-11-01,D'Amore-McKim School of Business;Indian Institute of Management Bangalore;National Bureau of Economic Research,diversity ;  field experiment ;  gender ;  innovation ;  online distributed work ;  Platforms ;  sorting ;  STEM

"Robust Machine Learning Framework for Modeling the Compressive Strength of SFRC: Database Compilation, Predictive Analysis, and Empirical Verification","In recent years, the field of construction engineering has experienced a significant paradigm shift, embracing the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies, with a particular emphasis on forecasting the characteristics of steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC). Despite the theoretical sophistication of existing models, persistent challenges remain—their opacity, lack of transparency, and real-world relevance for practitioners. To address this gap and advance our current understanding, this study employs the extra gradient (XG) boosting algorithm, crafting a comprehensive approach. Grounded in a meticulously curated database drawn from 43 seminal publications, encompassing 420 distinct records, this research focuses predominantly on three primary fiber types: crimped, hooked, and mil-cut. Complemented by hands-on experimentation involving 20 diverse SFRC mixtures, this empirical campaign is further illuminated through the strategic use of partial dependence plots (PDPs), revealing intricate relationships between input parameters and consequent compressive strength. A pivotal revelation of this research lies in the identification of optimal SFRC formulations, offering tangible insights for real-world applications. The developed ML model stands out not only for its sophistication but also its tangible accuracy, evidenced by exemplary performance against independent datasets, boasting a commendable mean target-prediction ratio of 99%. To bridge the theory–practice gap, we introduce a user-friendly digital interface, thoroughly designed to guide professionals in optimizing and accurately predicting the compressive strength of SFRC. This research thus contributes to the construction and civil engineering sectors by enhancing predictive capabilities and refining mix designs, fostering innovation, and addressing the evolving needs of the industry.","Abbas, Yassir M.;Khan, Mohammad Iqbal",Journal,Materials,2023-11-01,King Saud University,feature importance ;  graphical user interface ;  machine learning ;  partial dependence plots ;  prediction model ;  steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC)
Enhancing Smart IoT Malware Detection: A GhostNet-based Hybrid Approach,"The Internet of Things (IoT) constitutes the foundation of a deeply interconnected society in which objects communicate through the Internet. This innovation, coupled with 5G and artificial intelligence (AI), finds application in diverse sectors like smart cities and advanced manufacturing. With increasing IoT adoption comes heightened vulnerabilities, prompting research into identifying IoT malware. While existing models excel at spotting known malicious code, detecting new and modified malware presents challenges. This paper presents a novel six-step framework. It begins with eight malware attack datasets as input, followed by insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Feature engineering includes scaling, One-Hot Encoding, target variable analysis, feature importance using MDI and XGBoost, and clustering with K-Means and PCA. Our GhostNet ensemble, combined with the Gated Recurrent Unit Ensembler (GNGRUE), is trained on these datasets and fine-tuned using the Jaya Algorithm (JA) to identify and categorize malware. The tuned GNGRUE-JA is tested on malware datasets. A comprehensive comparison with existing models encompasses performance, evaluation criteria, time complexity, and statistical analysis. Our proposed model demonstrates superior performance through extensive simulations, outperforming existing methods by around 15% across metrics like AUC, accuracy, recall, and hamming loss, with a 10% reduction in time complexity. These results emphasize the significance of our study’s outcomes, particularly in achieving cost-effective solutions for detecting eight malware strains.","Almazroi, Abdulwahab Ali;Ayub, Nasir",Journal,Systems,2023-11-01,University of Jeddah;Air University Islamabad,classification ;  deep learning ;  GhostNet ;  Internet of Things ;  Jaya Algorithm ;  malware detection ;  optimization methods
Numerical study for bioconvection in Marangoni convective flow of Cross nanofluid with convective boundary conditions,"The current study investigates incompressible, MHD flow of Cross nanofluid containing of gyrotactic microorganisms and thermophoretic particle deposition over a sheet with activation energy and variable thermal conductivity. The variable characteristic of thermal conductivity is considered as a linear function of temperature. The present study’s insights can optimize the design of nanofluid-based systems, enhance drug delivery methods, improve environmental monitoring, refine materials engineering, advance microfluidics for diagnostics, boost renewable energy technologies, and upgrade electronics cooling solutions. Moreover, this study contribution to scientific understanding will catalyze further research across disciplines, fostering innovation and progress.

Adoption of Pedagogical Innovations: Social Networks of Engineering Education Guilds,"This work investigates how innovations propagate through two professional networks (guilds): the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) and the Consortium to Promote Reflection in Engineering Education (CPREE). Previous research has demonstrated that the adoption of pedagogical innovations is supported by the socialization of the innovation among potential adopters. In this work, we use social network analysis to explore the impact of professional connections on innovation adoption. Our research questions are: (1) How does overall social structure differ between guilds? (2) How do measures of social network structures relate to innovation adoption? A survey was distributed to members of KEEN and CPREE to capture the interactions respondents had while adopting the guild’s innovation. Social networks were generated for each guild and each respondent. These networks were analyzed to identify relationships between social network measures and the frequency of use of the innovation. Responses to open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic coding. The guilds’ overall structures impacted the formation and structure of distinct clusters/cliques, but these differing structures did not appear to affect sustained adoption. Individuals’ ego networks demonstrated a weak negative correlation between the frequency of adoption and the individual’s ego network density. Our results imply that having a diverse network exposes instructors to more ideas or allows them to see one idea from many perspectives leading to a higher likelihood of adoption.","Riley, Darby;Mallouk, Kaitlin;Faber, Courtney;Coso Strong, Alexandra",Journal,Education Sciences,2023-11-01,Henry M.

Technological and Modelling Progress in Green Engineering and Sustainable Development: Advancements in Energy and Materials Engineering,"Due to a growing number of environmental issues, including global warming, water scarcity, and fossil fuel depletion, the topic of modern materials in energy is becoming crucial for our civilization. The technological advancements that have been observed bring many innovations that significantly impact how energy can be generated, stored, and distributed. Moreover, new opportunities have emerged in energy and materials engineering due to the increasing computational capability of current data processing systems. Methods that are highly demanding, time-consuming, and difficult to apply may now be considered when developing complete and sophisticated models in many areas of science and technology. Combining computational methods and AI algorithms allows for multi-threaded analyses solving advanced and interdisciplinary problems. Therefore, knowledge and experience in this subject, as well as the investigation of new, more efficient, and environmentally friendly solutions, currently represent one of the main directions of scientific research.

Joint engineering-medical school programs prepare physicians for clinical challenges: An observational study,"Background and Aims: Modern health care faces a plethora of challenges including the delivery of quality and cost-efficient care. Physicians are first-hand observers of clinical problems but may lack the requisite training and education to develop innovations that improve patient care. Few medical education programs address innovation, leadership, and transdisciplinary collaboration despite being highlighted by national medical and education organizations including the American Medical Association. The University of Minnesota has implemented the Augustine program over the last 10-years to produce physicians that are leaders in medical innovation. Methods: As a novel joint engineering-medical school curriculum to educate medical students, residents, and fellows, the Augustine program incorporates engineering coursework, biomedical research, and a multidisciplinary design and business development experience to produce physicians capable of designing and marketing “disruptive technologies.” The Augustine program takes 1-year to complete in addition to the 4-year medical education and provides a Master of Biomedical Engineering upon completion. Results: Augustine program graduates (n = 6) have reported significant contributions related to the joint engineering-medical education including peer-reviewed publications (Median: 13), deployable assets (Median: 2), and intellectual property (Median: 1). Most surveyed graduates (n = 5, 83%) continue to be active contributors to medical innovation and all (n = 6, 100%) utilize their transdisciplinary education to improve patient care. Conclusion: Augustine program graduates impact the entire spectrum of innovation and continue to improve patient care. The program will seek to emphasize the inclusion of physician residents and fellows with position expansion. The addition of a multi-week medical innovation clerkship will provide a more focused experience for students unable to dedicate an entire year to a transdisciplinary experience.","Gathman, Tyler J.;Vasdev, Ranveer M.S.;Smetak, Miriam R.;Williams, Anthony;Budde, Anna;Iaizzo, Paul A.",Journal,Health Science Reports,2023-11-01,College of Science and Engineering;University of Minnesota Twin Cities;University of Minnesota Medical School;Vanderbilt University,engineering ;  innovation ;  medical education ;  transdisciplinary education

The machines involved include industrial robots, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) lathes and milling machines, and PLCs (Programmable Logic Controls). In a traditional training model, an instructor guides the users in learning how to manipulate the equipment. This proposal intends that the participants use their mobile devices to receive each machine's instruction and the necessary documentation. The participants' learning pace varies. So, the research aimed to reduce the deficit in the disciplinary competencies since, in the traditional methodology, there is no heterogeneity in understanding the contents. We designed a competency development strategy with six laboratory practices, integrating multimedia elements to address the significant learning content of each manufacturing cell device. Each lesson contained information about each device and a practice activity and self-evaluation to ensure learning the content.","Hernández-Rodríguez, Felipe;Guillén-Yparrea, Nicia",Journal,Heliyon,2023-11-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Augmented reality ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering education ;  Higher education ;  Learning management ;  Manufacturing theory ;  Virtual learning
Adoption of Digital Tools Among Geoscience Students Based on the TAM Model,"This research examines the adoption of digital tools by university students in the field of geosciences based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) for emerging economies. A quantitative analysis was conducted using a questionnaire administered to 198 students at the National University of Colombia. Among the results, the perception of self-efficacy stands out as one of the most influential variables of the model, which is associated with the perceived ease of use of digital tools. Likewise, perceived usefulness conditions the level of acceptance of digital tools in teaching geoscience subjects.","Palacio-Jiménez, David;Valencia-Quiceno, Juan David;Valencia-Arias, Alejandro;Benjumea-Arias, M.",Journal,Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,2023-11-01,Benjamin M.

Teacher Leadership Competencies for Student Inclusion Through the Promotion of Technology,"This research was conducted with the aim of examining teacher leadership competencies for student inclusion through the promotion of technology, as perceived by university students. The study approach is quantitative, non-experimental and cross-sectional. A questionnaire is used involving 116 students from 3 universities in Chile, who are studying in the Propaedeutic Programmes developed in these institutions (north, centre and south of the country). The results show differences between students; those studying at the university in the centre of Chile reveal a better understanding of teacher leadership competencies for inclusion through the promotion of technology, having observed that the leader dedicates much of their time management and effectiveness to student education, demonstrates human and technical qualities and deals with all forms of exclusion and inequality. Findings show that the presence of competent leadership encourages greater promotion of technologies in Chilean universities because, to the extent that the teacher fosters a climate of empathy and motivation and integrates ICTs, this contributes to inclusion in the Propaedeutic Programmes, constituting an experience that strengthens inclusive culture and pedagogical practice.","Villalobos-Egaña, Lenin;Delgado-García, Manuel;Villegas, Francisco Javier Villegas",Journal,Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,2023-11-01,Universidad de Huelva;Universidad de Antofagasta,Inclusion ;  leadership ;  skills ;  student ;  technology
Recent Developments in Security-Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow: Overview of Challenge 1 in the ARPA-E Grid Optimization Competition,"The optimal power-flow problem is central to many tasks in the design and operation of electric power grids. This problem seeks the minimum-cost operating point for an electric power grid while satisfying both engineering requirements and physical laws describing how power travels through the electric network. By additionally considering the possibility of component failures and using an accurate alternating current (AC) power-flow model of the electric network, the security-constrained AC optimal power flow (SC-AC-OPF) problem is of paramount practical relevance. To assess recent progress in solution algorithms for SC-AC-OPF problems and spur new innovations, the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy organized Challenge 1 of the Grid Optimization (GO) competition. This special issue includes papers authored by the top three teams in Challenge 1 of the GO Competition (Teams gollnlp, GO-SNIP, and GMI-GO). To introduce these papers and provide context about the competition, this paper describes the SC-AC-OPF problem formulation used in the competition, overviews historical developments and the state of the art in SC-AC-OPF algorithms, discusses the competition, and summarizes the algorithms used by these three teams.

Evaluation and calculation of urban carbon emission reduction potential based on spatiotemporal geographic model,"With the growth of urban carbon emissions, found that the current urban carbon emission reduction potential assessment and calculation in carbon emissions data source, research index selection and cost are some problems, to promote the realization of low carbon emission reduction target, it is necessary to use space and space and geographical weighted regression model to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of urban carbon reduction. This article combined geographic information system (GIS) technology to construct a spatial database. Based on the geographic weighted regression (GWR) model, a time dimension was introduced to construct a spatiotemporal GWR model, which was used to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution information of urban CEs and draw a spatial distribution (SD) map of urban CE reduction potential (RP). This article also conducted experimental tests on the carbon reduction potential (CRP) of Chinese cities by combining different carbon reduction (CR) measures. This paper uses three CR methods to test P of these cities respectively measure A adjust industrial structure, measure B to promote low carbon technology innovation and measure C is to optimize the urban space structure, the experimental results show that the average carbon emission intensity of measure A cities is 0.72 tons / yuan, 0.02 tons / 0,0.04 tons / yuan less than measures B and C; the average CE efficiency of measures A cities is 0.85,0.02 and 0.05 compared with measures B and C respectively. From the above data, adjusting the industrial structure can effectively improve the CE efficiency of various cities, reduce the CE, reduce the CE intensity, and promote the realization of CE reduction in cities.","Wang, Guangwei;Meng, Xinyuan",Journal,International Journal of Thermofluids,2023-11-01,Guilin University of Aerospace Technology,Carbon emission intensity ;  Carbon reduction potential ;  Carbon sequestration ;  Geographic information system ;  Low-carbon technology innovation ;  Urban carbon emissions ;  Urban consumption expenditure
Exploring the dynamics of active swimmers microorganisms with electromagnetically conducting stretching through endothermic heat generation/assimilation flow: Observational and computational study,"Enhancements brought about by motile gyrotactic microorganisms encompass improved mixing, efficient oxygen and nutrient transfer, environmental sensing, and reactions, as well as potential applications in bioremediation, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in fluid dynamics and biological locomotion. These microorganisms find utility in various fields such as biotechnology, environmental engineering, and fluid dynamics research, among others, playing a pivotal role in numerous ecological processes. The present study places its focus on the investigation of the effects associated with mass and heat transport in a fluid flow scenario featuring the presence of a heat source or sink. Specifically, the study aims to examine the impact of nanoparticles on Powell-Eyring fluid flow in the presence of a magnetic field (MHD) across a stretched sheet, taking into account factors such as activation energy, heat sources, and thermal radiation. Furthermore, the study explores the influence of motile gyrotactic microorganisms on various parameters. Recognizing the dearth of research in the realm of polymer extrusion processes, this study strives to bridge this research gap. Its primary objective is to develop a mathematical formulation employing a boundary layer approach, which encompasses the consideration of the interrelated effects of mass and heat transport in Eyring-Powell fluid flow across a stretched sheet in the presence of thermal radiation and chemical reactions from figure it shows that temperature profile rises as result of radiation parameter's increasing values (0.1<Rd<0.4). The impact of Lb is also showed with the help of graph. Greater diffusive mixing is implied by higher Lb for (0.1<Lb<0.4), which tends to distribute the microbes more equally throughout the fluid. This research study serves as an inspiration for the innovation of endogenous heat generation/consumption within the flow of motile organisms exhibiting gyro-taxis in the presence of magnetic flux density on a stretching sheet. To address the complexity of the problem, the renowned BVP4C package, a computational software tool in MATLAB, is utilized for solving a set of highly intricate and nonlinear coupled differential equations. The nonlinear nature of these equations poses significant challenges, necessitating the application of specialized numerical methods to ensure accurate and efficient solutions.","Li, Yijie;Leng, Yuchi;Baazaoui, Narjes;Arain, Muhammad Bilal;Ijaz, Nouman;M Hassan, Ahmed",Journal,Case Studies in Thermal Engineering,2023-11-01,Faculty of Engineering & Technology;King Khalid University;Yantai University;University of St Andrews;Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics;Punjab Group of Colleges,Computational and numerical study ;  Electromagnetically conducting ;  Endothermic heat generation/assimilation ;  Eyring-powell fluid model ;  Swimming gyrotactic microorganisms
Medical device regulatory challenges in the UK are affecting innovation and its potential benefits,"The increase in regulatory challenges on medical technology developed and deployed in the UK is having a negative impact on innovation. In this paper we show how the limited capacity of Approved and Notified Bodies is one more barrier in the innovation pipeline, that could push more teams to consider applying for FDA approval instead of UKCA marking, potentially limiting how much our patients benefit from the world-leading research undertaken in UK universities.","Beddoe-Rosendo, Jacqueline;Heaysman, Clare L.;Hajnal, Joseph V.;Ourselin, Sebastien;Vanhoestenberghe, Anne",Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine",2023-11-01,King's College London,approved body capacity ;  innovation ;  Medical device regulation ;  MHRA ;  UKCA marking
Will the blockchain solve the supply chain resilience challenges? Insights from a systematic literature review,"Frequency and severity of supply chain disruptions are increasing, and new solutions for improving supply chain resilience (SCRES) are demanded. Operations managers and scholars place great hopes on recent technological innovations, particularly blockchain technology. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive review at the intersection of SCRES and blockchain, making it difficult to understand the relations between both fields holistically. This research gap was addressed by systematically analyzing 72 peer-reviewed papers. More specifically, the link between specific blockchain characteristics, SCRES antecedents, and supply chain risk types was explored. The results reveal that visibility and validation are the most relevant blockchain characteristics for improving SCRES. The SCRES antecedents agility, collaboration, and supply chain (re-)engineering can all benefit from blockchain implementation, whereas the effect on risk management culture is widely unexplored. While there is consensus on blockchain's usability for mitigating security, operational, and supply risks, the effect on demand risks requires further attention. To facilitate the practical implementation of this paper's results, the findings served as a foundation for discussing SCRES opportunities from well-known blockchain applications such as smart contracts and tracking solutions. Moreover, seven future research avenues and managerial implications are presented.","Beck, Janina;Birkel, Hendrik;Spieske, Alexander;Gebhardt, Maximilian",Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023-11-01,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Blockchain ;  Distributed ledger ;  Literature review ;  Supply chain disruption ;  Supply chain resilience ;  Supply chain risk management
Thermal performance of Oldroyd-B hybrid nanofluid in solar energy-based water pumping systems and entropy generation minimization,"The growing need for reliable energy supply to enhance productivity in industrial and residential sectors underscores the importance of conserving solar energy. This can be achieved through measures such as optimizing solar collector coatings and optical heat processes. The environmental risks posed by fossil fuels, like coal and diesel, for electricity generation, further highlight the urgency of seeking alternative solutions. Solar energy has emerged as a highly promising option, capturing global attention for its potential to improve productivity and sustainability. The study focuses on examining aluminum alloy-titanium alloy/ethylene glycol hybrid nanofluid in the flow of non-Newtonian Oldroyd-B through a parabolic trough surface collector located in the solar water pumps (SWP). The Galerkin weighted residual method was utilized to solve the group of equations that describe momentum, energy, and entropy generation. The findings show that the hybrid nanofluid leads to better thermal radiative performance compared to the ordinary nanofluid. Therefore, the implications of these findings are substantial, particularly in the fields of thermal engineering and renewable energy. By offering insights into the efficient utilization of solar energy in water pumping systems and the reduction of entropy generation, this research has the potential to drive innovations that enhance the sustainability and performance of such systems.","Obalalu, A.

A path towards China's energy justice: How does digital technology innovation bring about a just revolution?,"Although digital technology innovation (DTI) is crucial for facilitating the switch to green energy, it has also caused energy justice issues. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the impact of DTI on energy justice. This study innovatively calculates the DTI and energy justice indexes of 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2019 and explores the influence of DTI on energy justice with the system-generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM). We further discuss the mediating role of energy structure and green total factor productivity (GTFP), as well as the moderating role of R&D intensity. The main results show that: (1) DTI can significantly promote energy justice. (2) DTI indirectly enhances energy justice by upgrading the energy structure and increasing GTFP. In addition, R&D intensity is a positive mediator between DTI and energy justice. (3) Security, Sensor, and device network, and Cognition and meaning understanding technologies are the leading contributors to achieving energy justice. This study provides insights for policymakers to promote just energy transition in terms of DTI.","Yang, Senmiao;Wang, Jianda;Dong, Kangyin;Jiang, Qingzhe",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-11-01,University of International Business and Economics,Digital technology innovation ;  Energy justice ;  Energy structure ;  Green total factor productivity ;  R&D intensity
Organic integration of ideological and political education and entrepreneurship education based on artificial neural network,"Entrepreneurship is a systematic project, and it needs entrepreneurial knowledge, skills, psychology and many other basic qualities. Therefore, it is imperative to educate college students on entrepreneurship. IPE (Ideological and political education) courses offered by universities should adhere to the spirit of the Chinese dream and integrate with 2E (Entrepreneurship Education), which will not only provide more theoretical guidance for college entrepreneurs in practice but also promote their practical experience to theoretical innovation and promote their all-round development. Therefore, this research is based on ANN (artificial neural network) to study the organic integration of IPE and entrepreneurship education. According to the practice of carrying out quality education in our university, a set of index systems suitable for comprehensive quality evaluation of students in engineering colleges is established. Use BPNN (BP neural network) method to construct the test model, and IL (Input layer) is responsible for receiving external input information. Through the learning rules in HL (Hidden layer), this paper refers to the weight values of various quality indicators, transforms the input values, and adjusts the deviation of test results. OL (Output layer) is responsible for outputting calculation results, that is, evaluating students' comprehensive quality information. The results of BPNN show that the actual value and the expected value are within a reasonable range, and the maximum relative error is 1.607 %, which meets the accuracy requirements. The established evaluation index system of 2E is reasonable and effectively reflects students' innovation and entrepreneurship abilities.","Yongliang, Wang",Journal,Learning and Motivation,2023-11-01,Chengdu Normal University,Artificial neural network ;  BP neural network ;  Entrepreneurship education ;  Ideological and political education
Energy innovation and ecological footprint: Evidence from OECD countries during 1990–2018,"Recent developments in energy engineering and state-of-the art technologies to increase eco-friendly energy production are receiving increasing attention in scientific debate as engines of growth. Although the energy-growth-environment nexus has been extensively studied, the ecological implications of innovative technologies in energy production are yet to be adequately addressed to provide adhoc social changes and policy perspectives. To bridge these gaps, the present study investigates the relationship between energy innovation (EIN), renewable energy production (REP), non-renewable energy production (NREP), energy intensity (EI), research and development (R&D) expenditures, GDP, and ecological footprint (EF) in 21 OECD economies during the period 1990–2018. This study applies advanced, rigorous, and robust econometric methodologies. The empirical outcomes reveal that REP, EIN, and EI, mitigate EF, while NREP, GDP, and R&D somehow accelerate the ecological deficit. This study advances the empirically proven validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for OECD countries and provides valuable policy insights in terms of intensification of governmental budget spending on R&D, and boosting technological energy innovations and non-polluting energy projects. Of particular importance to trace a green energy growth is the development of comprehensive economic and energy policies with a specific focus on ecological wellbeing.","Shabir, Maria;Pazienza, Pasquale;De Lucia, Caterina",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2023-11-01,Università degli Studi di Foggia,Ecological footprint ;  Economic growth ;  Energy innovation ;  Energy intensity ;  OECD
The power of role models in a team: The impact of lead entrepreneur's digital leadership on digital entrepreneurial success,"Digital entrepreneurial success has gained attention because the development of digitalization has brought multiple opportunities for entrepreneurs along with many challenges. While prior research has primarily examined the determinants of success at the founder and organizational levels, the impact of venture groups has been neglected, resulting in a lack of exploration of the group effect. In this study, we apply social learning theory to investigate how lead entrepreneur's digital leadership influences digital entrepreneurial success. By analyzing data from 88 digital entrepreneurial teams, we found that lead entrepreneur's digital leadership is positively related to entrepreneurial team's digital entrepreneurial success. Likewise, lead entrepreneur's digital leadership positively correlates with digital entrepreneurial success through technology absorptive capacity and technological innovation capability. Moreover, we argue that leader group prototypicality not only strengthens the impact of lead entrepreneur's digital leadership on the entrepreneurial team's technology absorptive capacity but also amplifies its influence on the entrepreneurial team's technological innovation capability. Our results provide contributions to both the entrepreneurship and leadership literature.","Xia, Yuhuan;Liu, Xiyao;Wang, Xueling;Deng, Hui;Han, Changlin;Liu, Zhen;Tsai, Sang Bing",Journal,Information Processing and Management,2023-11-01,Shandong University;Qingdao University;Wuyi University;Beijing Forestry University,Digital entrepreneurial success ;  Entrepreneurial team's technological innovation capability ;  Entrepreneurial team's technology absorptive capacity ;  Lead entrepreneur's digital leadership ;  Social learning theory
Recent advances of thermosetting resin and its application prospect in oil and gas drilling and production engineering,"Thermosetting resin is a kind of polymer resin material that can occur crosslinking reaction under heating or radiation and solidify to form a network structure. The thermosetting resin exhibits exceptional temperature and pressure resistance, and mechanical properties. Thus, it finds wide-ranging applications in several fields such as coating, adhesive, electronic packaging, petrochemical, transportation, construction, and many more. Moreover, thermosetting resin can effectively address the problem of lost circulation in solid-liquid phase variable materials. It holds significant promise for application in the oil and gas drilling and production engineering. This work systematically reviews the synthetic modification method and curing theory based on the classification of thermosetting resins, elucidating their primary properties. Furthermore, this work provides an in-depth analysis of the research status of the application of thermosetting resin in the oil and gas drilling and production engineering. It explores the research focus and application prospects of thermosetting resins in the areas of drilling fluid plugging, filtrate reducer, and cement sand control. By combining the research status of drilling-related treatment agents and the property characteristics of different modified thermosetting resins, this work offers useful references to expand the research and application of thermosetting resins in oil and gas drilling and production engineering. In conclusion, this work aims to provide insightful research ideas for promoting the development of drilling fluid treatment agents in the direction of high performance and low cost. The broad application prospects of thermosetting resin in various fields will undoubtedly stimulate further research and innovation in this area.","Yang, Jingbin;Bai, Yingrui;Sun, Jinsheng;Lv, Kaihe;Lang, Youming",Journal,Geoenergy Science and Engineering,2023-11-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development,Cement sand control ;  Drilling fluid plugging ;  Filtrate loss reduction ;  Surface interface properties ;  Synthetic curing theory ;  Thermosetting resin
Green technology innovation under differentiated carbon constraints: The substitution effect of industrial relocation,"The relationship between the carbon intensity constraint policy (CICP) and green technology innovation (GTI) has been well documented in the literature. However, the allocation method of the carbon abatement target is often ignored. The allocation method plays a decisive role in the policy effect. After alleviating the possible endogenous problems through quasi natural experiment, we find that the CICP with the special allocation method promotes GTI in the western provinces but inhibits GTI in the eastern provinces. Especially, the positive impact in the western provinces presents an intensifying trend. To discuss the potential mechanism, we further construct a three-dimensional panel, which contains 1.84 million observations. Our macro and micro evidences reveal that manufacturing firms in the eastern provinces tend to move westward under carbon constraints rather than GTI. In other words, the industrial relocation has a substitution effect on GTI, which further explains why the CICP inhibits GTI in the eastern provinces. The above findings offer targeted policy reference for regulators and government departments concerned with the issues of carbon emission reduction and GTI.","Lin, Boqiang;Zhang, Qianxiang",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2023-11-01,Xiamen University;Innovation Laboratory for Sciences and Technologies of Energy Materials of Fujian Province (IKKEM),Carbon intensity constraint policy ;  Green technology innovation ;  Industrial relocation ;  Substitution effect
Technology integration in higher education and student privacy beyond learning environments—A comparison of the UK and US perspective,"Technology integration in higher education (HE) has brought immense innovation. While research is investigating the benefits of leveraging, through learning analytics, the data created by the greater presence of technology in HE, it is also analysing the privacy implications of vast universes of data now at the fingertips of HE administrators. This paper argues that student privacy challenges linked to technology integration occur not only within but also beyond learning environments, namely at the enterprise level. By analysing the UK and US legal frameworks surrounding how HE institutions respond to parents demanding disclosure of their adult children's personal data in the event of mental health crises, this paper offers an example of real and complex privacy issues, often overlooked by interdisciplinary inquiry, that exist in the ‘interstitial space’ between HE technology and privacy law. The purpose of conducting a comparative analysis was to demonstrate that countries with different privacy regimes are similarly ill-equipped to address certain student privacy issues at the HE enterprise level, leaving HEIs exposed to potential litigation/regulatory risks. The contribution of this work is to invite greater interdisciplinary awareness of, and inquiry into, student privacy beyond learning environments.","Giuffrida, Iria;Hall, Alex",Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2023-11-01,University of Hertfordshire;William & Mary,disclosure without consent ;  mental health crisis ;  student privacy ;  technology integration at enterprise level
Enhancing green technology innovation through enterprise environmental governance: A life cycle perspective with moderator analysis of dynamic innovation capability,"Consolidating the leadership of enterprises in Environmental Governance (EG) and enhancing their Green Technology Innovation (GTI) are vital for fostering global ecological civilization. Previous research has primarily focused on the non-linear relationship between EG and GTI but has overlooked the factors that contribute to varying GTI effects in response to EG constraints across different stages of a business's life cycle. Drawing on data from Chinese A-share listed enterprises, this study investigates the impact of EG on GTI by considering two typical forms of EG: cost-based and voluntary participation. Furthermore, it introduces the concept of dynamic innovation capability (DIC) based on the principles of open innovation paradigm. The findings reveal that, contrary to the positive influence observed during the growth and maturity stages, EG has no significant effect on GTI during the recession stage. One-way ANOVA results demonstrate that enterprises' DIC varies across different life cycle stages, with a declining trend observed during the maturity, growth, and recession stages. Moreover, the study finds that DIC, encompassing absorptive, operational, perceptual, and relational capabilities, positively moderates the impact of EG on GTI. These conclusions shed light on the differentiated effects of EG on enterprises' GTI at various life cycle stages.","Pan, Xianyou;Shen, Zhiyang;Song, Malin;Shu, Yalin",Journal,Energy Policy,2023-11-01,Adnan Kassar School of Business;Lille Économie Management ( LEM );Shanghai University of Electric Power;Anhui University,Dynamic innovation capability ;  Environmental governance ;  Green technology innovation ;  Life cycle ;  Moderating effect
Effect of student responsiveness to instructional innovation on student engagement in semi-synchronous online learning environments: The mediating role of personal technological innovativeness and perceived usefulness,"Almost all higher education institutions across the globe have adopted technology-mediated semi-synchronous learning and teaching methods. While emerging technologies pedagogically facilitate affordances and opportunities for semi-synchronous learning, limited attention has been given to the implementation of e-learning technology to enhance student engagement in such environments. In this study, a sequential mediation model examining how students' perceived personal technological innovativeness (PTI) and perceived usefulness (PU) mediate the effects of students’ perceived responsiveness to instructional innovation (RII) and promote student social, behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and reflective engagement in semi-synchronous e-learning environment is advanced and tested on students undertaking a business course at an Australian university. The study findings indicate that RII affects all the 5 student engagement dimensions, while PTI positively impacts emotional and behavioural engagement only. PTI and PU sequentially mediate the relationship between RII and student engagement. This study highlights the importance of student-based factors in implementing e-learning technology and has implications for educational innovation theory and practice in higher education.","Gunness, Aneeshta;Matanda, Margaret Jekanyika;Rajaguru, Rajesh",Journal,Computers and Education,2023-11-01,The University of Sydney Business School;Tasmanian School of Business and Economics;The Faculty of Business and Law,
Developing a model of technological innovation for export development in developing countries,"It is crucial for companies to develop a competitive advantage in today's competitive business environment. Technological innovation is one of the most effective ways for companies to achieve this advantage and enhance their competitiveness. Therefore, identifying the most important dimensions of technological innovation is key for managers and decision-makers in order to achieve organizational goals, which in fact, reveals its high importance. In this paper, we develop a model of how technological innovation impacts export development in developing countries. At present, the process of globalization, especially the development of exports, has a special place. In this paper, based on the rigorous literature review, eleven main dimensions of technological innovation were obtained. The relationships between system elements were determined using the Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) technique, and the final model with four levels was extracted. The factors in the last level are the most effective, and the factors in the first level are the most influential. These factors are considered the basis of the model. According to research findings, knowledge management has the most impact, and manufacturing capability, service Innovation, marketing, and learning process are the most impressionable. Finally, based on the Mick Mac technique, the factors are classified based on the degree of dependence and influence. Since this method is under the opinions of experts, the opinions of 28 industry experts and university professors have been used. We have contributed to the understanding of the complex relationships among different factors and variables through our research by providing a structured and systematic approach. Policymakers and other stakeholders can use our model to propose ways to promote economic growth and development through technological innovation and exports. We believe that our findings have important implications for the field of innovation and international business research.","Mokthtari Moughari, Mahdieh;Daim, Tugrul U.",Journal,Technology in Society,2023-11-01,Chaoyang University of Technology;Portland State University,Export ;  ISM ;  Knowledge management ;  MICMAC ;  Technological innovation

Cloud computing enabled business model innovation,"Cloud computing's primary layer of security is its widespread adoption by businesses due to its ability to provide easy, on-demand network access to a large pool of configurable processing resources. Pressure from developed-world governments to keep up with the latest IT trends makes it challenging for colleges around the world to adopt cloud computing in engineering education. Although cloud computing as a concept has become more popular in recent times and quite a few studies have been conducted, the adoption and application level is still very low, particularly in developing countries. This study provides a realistic framework for gauging the sustainability of a company model. While digitalization is widely acknowledged to be crucial, the study's results reveal that the perceived available options for business model innovation depend not only on the value proposition itself but also on the position in the value network. The primary goal of this research is to create a cloud computing service provider business model that is built on circular economy principles and can guarantee the sustainable usage of cloud computing resources.","Godavarthi, Bhavana;Narisetty, Nirmalajyothi;Gudikandhula, Kalpana;Muthukumaran, R.;Kapila, Dhiraj;Ramesh, J.

"The impact of stressors on the relationship between personality traits, knowledge collection behaviour and programmer creativity intention in software engineering","Context: Individual and contextual factors have a profound impact on an individual's creativity. In the first part of this research, we concluded that, for a programmer's creativity intention, individual factors including big 5 personality traits and knowledge collection behaviour play a key role. However, it is important to bring contextual factors into the model to provide a holistic understanding. Objectives: Hence, the objective of the present research is to expand the earlier work by (i) identifying the software engineering occupational stressors relevant to programmers, and (ii) examining their impact as moderators for the relationship between individual factors (i.e., big five personality traits and knowledge collection behaviour) and the creativity intention of the programmer. Methods: To analyse the moderating impact of 6 stressors, the survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 294 programmers working in software companies in Pakistan. The data were analysed using the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) – Partial Least Square (PLS) technique. Results: The findings revealed that in the presence of a moderate level of stress, the relationship between knowledge collection behaviour and creativity intention was strengthened. Furthermore, stressors interacted differently with different personality traits. An overarching statement could be that most of the stressors positively moderated the relationships between different personality traits and creativity intentions. However, contrary to the prior research, the majority of the stressors negatively affected the impact of the openness to experience trait on creativity intention. Conclusion: The research significantly contributes to the body of knowledge of behavioural software engineering. The findings of this research are novel and intriguing in many aspects and will benefit software organizations to increase innovation, by increasing programmers’ creativity through mitigating stress.

Gulhati Memorial Lecture has been organized by the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage in collaboration with the Gulhati Trust since 1981 in honour of the visionary water resources engineer Er. Niranjan Das Gulhati, the driving force behind the establishment of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage. In this paper it is stated that the lofty goal of innovation in irrigation and water and sustainability cannot be achieved through an engineering-only approach. The allied aspects of sustainable environmental management and societal behavioural change have to be taken into account as well to enable the global irrigation communities to embrace the reforms necessary to make a difference and underpin a prosperous and inclusive society for all. Examples are given how such an approach would be possible.","Maywald, Hon Karlene",Journal,Irrigation and Drainage,2023-11-01,,Gulhati Lecture ;  innovation and research ;  people approach
Model-based-systems-engineering for conceptual design: An integrative approach,"Conceptual-Design is an early development phase, where innovation and creativeness shape the future system/product. Model-Based-Conceptual-Design (MBCD) attempts to use best-practices of Model-Based-Systems-Engineering (MBSE) to gain the envisioned benefits of model connectivity. Using MBSE supporting tools can transform Conceptual-Design into a digital-engineered process but may impede creativity and innovation. Concurrently, the design domain offers specific methods and tools for innovative Conceptual-Design. In the current study, we explore an existing Conceptual-Design framework and offer MBSE interpretation and tools extensions needed for its digital implementation. Through such exploration we highlight MBCD specific insights and discuss modeling-innovation interrelations. The implementation was accomplished using a domain-specific enabling software package on top of a market-accepted UML/SysML platform, extending the language definitions, where appropriate. The framework guided extensions allow generation of innovative bottom-up alternatives, solution integration, and solutions’ comparison. The use of modeling is shown to offer clearer process definition, specific methods assistance, and alternative ranking—both manually and automatically. Consequently, MBCD is accomplished, which supports innovation, while being digitally connected to full-scale-development models and the organizational assets at large. Through integration into the orderly Systems-Engineering process, traceability is maintained, and repeated iterations are supported, where conceptual decisions may be revisited. Additionally, through the introduction of an assets’ catalog, cross-organizational knowledge sharing is accomplished. The paper presents samples of the extensions, using a simplified example of technology design for Future Firefighting. The value of incorporating Conceptual-Design specific methodology and tools is evaluated through feedback from multiple domain experts. Discussion and future research directions are offered.","Shoshany-Tavory, Sharon;Peleg, Eran;Zonnenshain, Avigdor;Yudilevitch, Gil",Journal,Systems Engineering,2023-11-01,Metaphor Vision Ltd.;Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,conceptual design ;  MBSE ;  SysML
An economic and technological analysis of hybrid photovoltaic/wind turbine/battery renewable energy system with the highest self-sustainability,"This research established the technoeconomic feasibility of an on-grid hybrid renewable energy system for delivering electricity to the deanery building of the Engineering College at the University of Diyala, Iraq. The most cost-effective system design was discovered by modeling and optimization, with an average daily load of 25.0 kWh and total cost and energy cost of & amp; dollar;5142 and & amp; dollar;0.05/kWh, respectively. In relation to the energy generated by conventional resources, the designed system is more cost-effective and has a lower carbon footprint of about 13,052 kg/year of CO2emissions avoided. According to the research, using a hybrid power system to electrify and decarbonize the electrical energy supply could be a reliable and economical way to do both at the same time. Innovation is in integrating the suggested hybrid system so that the use of electricity can effectively be decreased to meet the load. As a result, the system components are not oversized, which reduces system costs and reduces emissions. & amp; copy; 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Hassan, Qusay;Jaszczur, Marek;Abdulrahman, Imad Saeed;Salman, Hayder M.",Journal,Energy Harvesting and Systems,2023-11-01,Al-Farahidi University;Al-Turath University;University Of Diyala;AGH University of Krakow,hybrid energy systems ;  photovoltaic energy ;  renewable energy ;  self-sufficiency ;  wind turbine energy
Nationwide Analysis of Biomechanics of Motor Vehicle Collisions Involving Passenger Vehicle and Associated Outcomes: Towards Improving Vehicle Safety Standards and Regulations,"Background: Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) pose significant mortality and economic burden on the United States. Biomechanics research may guide future vehicle innovation. The objective of this study is to investigate the biomechanics of two-vehicle MVCs involving passenger vehicle (PV) to evaluate associated injury patterns and outcomes including mortality. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of cases from the Crash Injury Research Engineering Network database was performed to evaluate the biomechanics (angle of impact, seatbelt use, and airbag deployment) of two-vehicle MVCs involving at least one PV from 2005-2015. Results: Out of 629 MVCs evaluated, lateral collisions were most common (49.5%), followed by head-on (41.3%) and rear-end (9.2%) collisions. Thoracic injuries accounted for 30.1%, 31.4%, and 31.1% of injuries in lateral, head-on, and rear-end collisions, respectively, and were the most common body region injured for all collision types. Seatbelt use was associated with shorter ICU stay (10.9 vs 19.1 days, P =.036) and mortality (Cramer’s V =.224, P <.001), but a greater average number of injuries (10.2 injuries vs 8.6 injuries, P =.011). Conclusion: Passenger vehicle are commonly involved in MVCs nationwide and efforts are needed to prevent occupant injuries and fatalities. The incorporation of energy-absorbing material into common points of contact within the vehicle interior may decrease the severity of these injuries. Seatbelt use remains a protective factor against MVC-fatalities but is associated with collateral injuries and should be a focus of further innovation.","Concepcion, Jennifer;Newsome, Kevin;Alfaro, Sophie;Selvakumar, Sruthi;Sen-Crowe, Brendon;Vallejo, Kevin;Andrade, Ryan;Yeager, Matthew;Kornblith, Lucy;Bilski, Tracy;Elkbuli, Adel",Journal,American Surgeon,2023-11-01,School of Osteopathic Medicine in Arizona;Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine;University of San Francisco;Nova Southeastern University;Orlando Regional Medical Center;San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center,injury prevention ;  motor vehicle collisions ;  vehicle biomechanics ;  vehicle safety standards
Industry convergence and value innovation: a bibliometric analysis and systematic review,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to present a bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of industry convergence and value innovation to understand the current research status; second, to provide a coherent theoretical research framework for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a two-step analysis approach by combining bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review to explore the research topic of industry convergence and value innovation. Besides, two bibliometric tools, HistCite and VOSviewer, were applied to this study. Findings: This study found that Stefanie Bröring and Fredrik Hacklin are the top two most influential authors among all authors in the sample publications. Technological Forecasting and Social Change is one of the top-ranking journal that often publishes this topic of articles. Germany and the University of Munster are the most influential country and institutions, respectively. Besides, five core research themes were identified based on keywords co-occurrence map, theoretical lenses, factors promoting industry convergence, indicators of industry convergence, the impact of industry convergence and emerging research directions. Based on the above analysis, this paper constructed a theoretical research framework of industry convergence and value innovation. Research limitations/implications: This paper only draw data from one database – Web of Science – which cannot provide broad coverage of the research topic. Besides, the bibliometric method of this paper is based on high local citation score and high-frequency words, articles in the skirting subjects’ area may not be analyzed. Practical implications: With the rapid development of technology, such as nanotechnology, radio - frequency identification (RFID), etc., the iterative upgrading of products also comes. As a result, the boundary between industries is gradually blurred, and the phenomenon of industry convergence appears. Therefore, managerial decision-makers are facing challenges of how to respond to the convergence phenomena. From the firm level, firms are facing the problem of value innovation of the existing product, new product development and core competence improvement. Industries are facing the problem of transformation and upgrading. This paper provides certain theoretical insights for both firms and industries to guide the practice accordingly. Originality/value: This paper is the first to use a bibliometric method to examine the topic of industry convergence and value innovation. In addition, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of this topic and provides a comprehensive theoretical research framework for future study.","Chen, Ye;Shen, Lei;Zhang, Xi;Chen, Yutao",Journal,Kybernetes,2023-11-01,Donghua University,Bibliometric analysis ;  Industry convergence ;  Systematic review ;  Value innovation

Research on conceptual design of snow rescue equipment based on AHP-TRIZ,"In response to the pressing issue of insufficient rescue equipment in snowy environments, a functional requirement index system for intelligent snow rescue equipment was established to achieve a quantitative evaluation of design requirements for snow rescue equipment. The AHP-TRIZ theory was explored to provide a theoretical basis for the conceptual design of snow rescue equipment. Extensive research was conducted from the perspective of product functional requirements, which involved obtaining user requirement elements through literature research and survey methods. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was then employed to summarize the functional requirement indicator system for snow rescue equipment from three levels: objectives, criteria, and indicators. Utilizing the 1-9 scale method, the design requirements of snow rescue equipment were subjected to quantitative evaluation, and consistency testing was completed. Additionally, by integrating the Archishuler contradiction matrix theory from the Theory of invention problem solving (TRIZ), the study identified the parameters requiring improvement and corresponding deterioration. It further explored efficient solutions for 39 engineering parameters and 40 invention principles in TRIZ, resolving conflicts between multi-level design elements and achieving the optimal configuration. Thoroughly identifying the requirements for snow rescue equipment in terms of functionality, appearance, ergonomics and technology, etc., the study successfully accomplished the conceptual design of snow rescue equipment. In response to the challenges posed by harsh environments in snow-covered areas, the subjective judgment results were quantified and processed through the integrated AHP-TRIZ method. This approach not only provided methodological guidance for the design of snow rescue equipment but also enhanced the scientific and rational nature of the design.","Wei, Wei;Zhang, Ling Yu;Wang, Shun;Fang, Qian;Fan, Yu",Journal,Journal of Graphics,2023-10-31,Sichuan University of Science & Engineering;Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Process Equipment and Control Engineering,analytic hierarchy process ;  bionics design ;  contradiction matrix ;  innovation snow rescue ;  quantitative evaluation

Metaverse: The new era in medical field,"Metaverse technologies have recently become a reality and have gained the interest of scientific companies, the educational environment, and the medical industry. Given the prevalence of screen time, particularly among children and adolescents, meta versions should serve as a venue for health promotion. The goals of this study were to find publications that connected meta versions to prevention as well as medical treatment, engineering education with practical training, and simulation and the research environment, and to review recent literature. Rapid developments in automation and digitization have expedited the expansion of the healthcare industry and developed new models that open up new avenues for providing care at lower costs. An innovative digital technique called the metaverse has a huge potential in the healthcare industry that can help all stakeholders of medical facilities such as doctors, patients, and medical students. The metaverse is the connection of many supporting technologies, together with artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality, Internet of Things (IoT), medical devices, medical robots, among others., and it allows for the exploration of new possibilities for the delivery of good healthcare facilities and medical services. The mixture of these technologies offers patients individualized, intimate, and immersive care. In addition to this, it offers clever adaptive solutions that break down barriers between patients and healthcare providers. This review provides a clear understanding about the metaverse in the healthcare industry and day-to-day healthcare applications, with an emphasis on state-of-the-art, enabling technology. The importance of the metaverse in healthcare innovations, for example, spectacle frame selection in the field of ophthalmology, is easier in online applications, namely, Lenskart using the metaverse technology for spectacle frame selection.

CUBIC: A Versatile Cumate-Based Inducible CRISPRi System in Streptomyces,"Streptomyces, a genus of Gram-positive bacteria, is known as nature’s medicine maker, producing a plethora of natural products that have huge benefits for human health, agriculture, and biotechnology. To take full advantage of this treasure trove of bioactive molecules, better genetic tools are required for the genetic engineering and synthetic biology of Streptomyces. We therefore developed CUBIC, a novel CUmate-Based Inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system that allows highly efficient and inducible gene knockdown in Streptomyces. Its broad application is shown by the specific and nondisruptive knockdown of genes involved in growth, development and antibiotic production in various Streptomyces species. To facilitate hyper-efficient plasmid construction, we adapted the Golden Gate assembly to achieve 100% cloning efficiency of the protospacers. We expect that the versatile plug-and-play CUBIC system will create new opportunities for research and innovation in the field of Streptomyces.","Bai, Chaoxian;van Wezel, Gilles P.",Journal,ACS Synthetic Biology,2023-10-20,Institute of Biology Leiden,CRISPR interference ;  cumate inducible promoter ;  natural products ;  Streptomyces ;  synthetic biology
"Digital transformation, corporate social responsibility and green technology innovation- based on empirical evidence of listed companies in China","Green technology innovation is an inevitable requirement to promote the realization of double carbon goal and realize sustainable development. It is also a vital accelerator for the transformation and upgrading of economic structure to promote the high-quality development of national economy. This article empirically testifies the impact path of corporate digital transformation level on green technology innovation ability, from the perspective of green technology innovation, based on the A-shares of 2660 manufacturing companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen between 2015 and 2020 by using a fixed-effect zero-inflation negative binomial regression model. Digital transformation can enhance enterprises' green technology innovation capability, according to the results, and several robustness tests have confirmed this finding. By improving corporate social responsibility, corporate digital transformation enhances green technology innovation capability. When it comes to the heterogeneity of corporate digital transformation's promotion of green technology innovation, compared to large enterprises, SMEs have an obvious advantage. Non-heavy polluting industries are significantly higher than heavy polluting firms while heavy polluting firms are not able to innovate using green technologies as a result of enterprise digital transformation.","Zheng, Yuxiang;Zhang, Qin",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-10-20,Shanghai Maritime University,Corporate social responsibility ;  Digital transformation ;  Green technology innovation

Will Code Remain a Relevant User Interface for End-User Programming with Generative AI Models,"The research field of end-user programming has largely been concerned with helping non-experts learn to code sufficiently well in order to achieve their tasks. Generative AI stands to obviate this entirely by allowing users to generate code from naturalistic language prompts. In this essay, we explore the extent to which ""traditional""programming languages remain relevant for non-expert end-user programmers in a world with generative AI. We posit the ""generative shift hypothesis"": That generative AI will create qualitative and quantitative expansions in the traditional scope of end-user programming. We outline some reasons that traditional programming languages may still be relevant and useful for end-user programmers. We speculate whether each of these reasons might be fundamental and enduring, or whether they may disappear with further improvements and innovations in generative AI.

Nanobubble aeration enhanced wastewater treatment and bioenergy generation in constructed wetlands coupled with microbial fuel cells,"Artificial aeration is a widely used approach in wastewater treatment to enhance the removal of pollutants, however, traditional aeration techniques have been challenging due to the low oxygen transfer rate (OTR). Nanobubble aeration has emerged as a promising technology that utilise nano-scale bubbles to achieve higher OTRs owing to their large surface area and unique properties such as longevity and reactive oxygen species generation. This study, for the first time, investigated the feasibility of coupling nanobubble technology with constructed wetlands (CWs) for treating livestock wastewater. The results demonstrated that nanobubble-aerated CWs achieved significantly higher removal efficiencies of total organic carbon (TOC) and ammonia (NH4+-N), at 49 % and 65 %, respectively, compared to traditional aeration treatment (36 % and 48 %) and the control group (27 % and 22 %). The enhanced performance of the nanobubble-aerated CWs can be attributed to the nearly three times higher amount of nanobubbles (Ø < 1 μm) generated from the nanobubble pump (3.68 × 108 particles/mL) compared to the normal aeration pump. Moreover, the microbial fuel cells (MFCs) embedded in the nanobubble-aerated CWs harvested 5.5 times higher electricity energy (29 mW/m2) compared to the other groups. The results suggested that nanobubble technology has the potential to trigger the innovation of CWs by enhancing their capacity for water treatment and energy recovery. Further research needs are proposed to optimise the generation of nanobubbles, allowing them to be effectively coupled with different technologies for engineering implementation.","Lyu, Tao;Wu, Yuncheng;Zhang, Yang;Fan, Wei;Wu, Shubiao;Mortimer, Robert J.G.;Pan, Gang",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2023-10-15,York St John University;Aarhus Universitet;Northeast Normal University;Cranfield University;Ministry of Ecology and Environment;Ltd.,Environmental sustainability ;  Livestock wastewater treatment ;  Micro/nanobubble ;  Nature-based solutions ;  Nutrient removal ;  Treatment wetland
Nanomedicine innovations in spinal cord injury management: Bridging the gap,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) has devastating effects on a person's physical, social, and professional well-being. It is a life-altering neurological condition that significantly impacts individuals and their caregivers on a socioeconomic level. Recent advancements in medical therapy have greatly improved the diagnosis, stability, survival rates, and overall well-being of SCI patients. However, there are still limited options available for enhancing neurological outcomes in these patients. The complex pathophysiology of SCI, along with the numerous biochemical and physiological changes that occur in the damaged spinal cord, contribute to this gradual improvement. Currently, there are no therapies that offer the possibility of recovery for SCI, although several therapeutic approaches are being developed. However, these therapies are still in the early stages and have not yet demonstrated effectiveness in repairing the damaged fibers, which hinders cellular regeneration and the full restoration of motor and sensory functions. Considering the importance of nanotechnology and tissue engineering in treating neural tissue injuries, this review focuses on the latest advancements in nanotechnology for SCI therapy and tissue healing. It examines research articles from the PubMed database that specifically address SCI in the field of tissue engineering, with an emphasis on nanotechnology as a therapeutic approach. The review evaluates the biomaterials used for treating this condition and the techniques employed to create nanostructured biomaterials.","Rahmanian, Mohsen;Ghahremani, Amirali;Kesharwani, Prashant;Oroojalian, Fatemeh;Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Journal,Environmental Research,2023-10-15,Saveetha Dental College And Hospitals;North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences;Jamia Hamdard;Mashhad University of Medical Sciences,Biomaterials ;  Central nervous system ;  Eeurological disease ;  Nanotechnology ;  Spinal cord injury ;  Tissue engineering
"Transdisciplinary pragmatic melioration for the plastic life cycle: Why the social, natural, and technical sciences should prioritize reducing harm","Plastics underpin modern society but also threaten to choke it. Only 9 % of all plastic waste is recycled, usually with loss of quality (“downcycling”); the rest is landfilled or dumped (79 %) or incinerated (12 %). Put bluntly, the “plastic age” needs a “sustainable plastic culture.” Consequently, we urgently need to develop a global and transdisciplinary approach not only to fully recycle plastics but also to manage the harms across their life cycle. The past decade has witnessed an explosion in research on new technologies and interventions that purport to help solve the plastic waste challenge; however, this work has, in most cases, been carried forward within single disciplines (for example, researching novel chemical and bio-based technologies for plastic degradation, engineering processing equipment innovations, and mapping recycling behaviours). In particular, although there has been vast progress within individual scientific fields, such work does not address the complexities of various plastic types and waste management systems. Meanwhile, research on the social contexts (and constraints) of plastic use and disposal is rarely in conversation with the sciences to drive innovation. In short, research on plastics typically lacks a transdisciplinary perspective. In this review, we urge the adoption of a transdisciplinary approach that focuses on pragmatic melioration; such an approach combines the natural and technical sciences with the social sciences to focus on the mitigation of harms across the plastic life cycle. To illustrate our case, we review the status of plastic recycling from these three scientific perspectives. Based on this, we advocate 1) foundational studies to identify sources of harm and 2) global/local interventions aimed at those plastics and aspects of the plastic life cycle that cause maximal harm, both in terms of planetary welfare and social justice. We believe this approach to plastic stewardship can be a showcase for tackling other environmental challenges.","Pathak, Gauri S.;Hinge, Mogens;Otzen, Daniel E.",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2023-10-15,Aarhus Universitet,Chemical recycling ;  Enzymatic deconstruction ;  Harm reduction ;  Plastic life cycle
Revealing the impact of China's clean air policies on synergetic control of CO<inf>2</inf> and air pollutant emissions: Evidence from Chinese cities,"China is presently confronted with the intricate challenge of simultaneously mitigating air pollution and decelerating the pace of climate change. An integrated perspective to investigate the synergetic control of CO2 and air pollutant emissions is in an urgent need. Using data for 284 Chinese cities from 2009 to 2017, we introduced an indicator called coupling and coordination degree of CO2 and air pollutant emissions control (CCD) and found an upward and spatial agglomeration trend of CCD distribution during the research period. Then, this study posed a specific focus on the impact of China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP). The DID model revealed that implementation of the APPCAP resulted in a 4.0% increase in CCD for cities with special emission limits, attributed to industrial structural adjustments and the promotion of technology innovation. Furthermore, we also identified positive spillover effects of the APPCAP on neighboring control group cities situated within 350 km of the treatment group cities, providing an explanation for the spatial agglomeration trend observed in CCD distribution. These findings hold significant implications for the synergetic control in China and underscored the potential benefits of industrial structural adjustments and technology innovation in mitigating environmental pollution.","Huang, Zining;Jia, Haohao;Shi, Xiahong;Xie, Zhengyu;Cheng, Jinping",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2023-10-15,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Air pollutants ;  APPCAP ;  CO 2 ;  Difference-in-difference ;  Synergetic control
"Policy and efficiency evaluation on civil health, well-being, and economic growth in China by investigating waterborne disease","This research contributes to the literature on civil health, well-being, and economic growth in China by investigating waterborne disease. The results show that the country's civil health and well-being receive scant attention compared to its economic growth. A reduction in the proportion of the second industry does not negatively impact economic growth, but is one effective way to improve civil health and well-being. Conversely, a high sewage charge is not an efficient factor to improve civil health and well-being in China. The east region has the most prosperous economic development compared to central and west regions, but it should focus the most on its environmental sanitation construction versus the other two regions. The productivity improvements of economic growth, civil health, and well-being mainly come from the management innovation effect instead of the technology innovation effect. Lastly, research and development as well as technology licensing are effective at enhancing the technology innovation effect.","Chang, Ming Chung",Journal,Expert Systems with Applications,2023-10-15,Chihlee University of Technology,China ;  Efficiency ;  Productivity ;  Waterborne disease
Crop welfare and security to farmers,"Every ninth person in poor nations and rural regions suffers from malnutrition, which impacts 795 million people. All four areas of food security may benefit from technological advancements. It is possible to boost food supply via genetic engineering as well as soil fertility augmentation approaches and irrigation technology. It is possible to address food accessibility and nutritional value using science, technology, and innovation (STI) based climate solutions using precision agriculture and early warning systems, as well as post-harvest technology. Bio fortification and climate-smart solutions may also help alleviate food poverty. Artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and tissue engineering may threaten the future of agriculture. Research and development, human resources, infrastructure, and information flows are needed to take use of these technologies' promise to improve food security. Gender-sensitive techniques of technology creation and dissemination as well as regional and worldwide cooperation and agricultural innovation tech forecasts and evaluation all contribute to a favorable environment for agricultural innovation. All aspects of food security may be improved with the aid of science and technology. Some of the new and growing agricultural technology, with an emphasis on smallholder farmers, was illustrated via the use of real-world instances. It is only those who have the ability to modify and share these tools and processes to meet local food security concerns that can use these tools and processes.","Charanarur, Panem;Gundu, Srinivasa Rao;Vijaylaxmi, J.;Samanta, Debabrata",Book,Advanced Technologies for Smart Agriculture,2023-10-14,National Forensic Sciences University;PVKK Degree and PG College;Government Degree College-Sitaphalmandi,

Prioritizing actions and outcomes for community-based future manufacturing workforce development and education,"Rapid innovations in manufacturing process technology, information technology, and systems technology have led to simultaneous concerns about labor displacements and skills shortages. To address these concerns, the key challenges for educating and training the current and future workforce should be identified and the specific activities leading to the design of new manufacturing career pathways should be defined. Thus, the objective of this article is to define and prioritize the necessary activities and short- to long-term outcomes that will aid in developing high-skill career pathways that will positively impact children and families, students and teachers, and future workers. Expert perspectives from industry and academia have been analysed through two lenses: education (primary/secondary, technical, and university levels) and policy/innovation. The nominal group technique (NGT) is applied in this research to capture these perspectives, which enabled the generation of ideas followed by discussion and ranking by the experts. This approach encourages participation and avoids the associated drawbacks of typical group interactions. As a result, prioritized activities, short-term outcomes, and policy ideas to introduce children and families, students and teachers, and future workers to careers in advanced manufacturing are presented for each lens of focus. In addition, inputs from experts were captured to discuss desired medium- to long-term outcomes.

Eco-Friendly Building Material Innovation: Geopolymer Bricks from Repurposed Plastic Waste,"This study compares the ecological footprints of geopolymer and red clay brick prisms, two common building materials for long-lasting masonry structures. The study's goal is to shed light on the environmental performance of different brick kinds by a thorough review of sustainability indices such as embodied energy, CO2 emissions, water use, and trash creation. The results suggest that geopolymer bricks have better environmental features than red clay bricks, such as lower embodied energy, decreased CO2 emissions, lower water consumption, and less waste creation. These findings underline the promise of geopolymer bricks as an eco-friendlier masonry alternative that may improve green building performance. The report, however, stresses the need to think about more than only environmental damage. The sustainability and feasibility of utilising geopolymer and red clay bricks depend heavily on factors including durability, thermal performance, and cost-effectiveness. In order to make educated selections about brick selection, it is important to evaluate these variables. The results of this study provide the groundwork for more research on sustainable masonry materials and contribute to the development of environmentally aware building practises. Architectural and engineering professionals may encourage environmentally responsible building practises and help create a more sustainable and resilient built environment by taking this study's findings into account.","Ul Haq, Md Zia;Sood, Hemant;Kumar, Rajesh;Sharma, Vishal;Kumar, Anuj;Srinivas, T.;Gulati, Monica;Bindu, K.

Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide through Selective Oxygen Reduction: A Carbon Innovation from Active Site Engineering to Device Design,"Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a promising alternative to the energy-intensive anthraquinone method, while its success relies largely on the development of efficient electrocatalyst. Currently, carbon-based materials (CMs) are the most widely studied electrocatalysts for electrosynthesis of H2O2 via ORR due to their low cost, earth abundance, and tunable catalytic properties. To achieve a high 2e− ORR selectivity, great progress is made in promoting the performance of carbon-based electrocatalysts and unveiling their underlying catalytic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review in the field is presented by summarizing the recent advances in CMs for H2O2 production, focusing on the design, fabrication, and mechanism investigations over the catalytic active moieties, where an enhancement effect of defect engineering or heteroatom doping on H2O2 selectivity is discussed thoroughly. Particularly, the influence of functional groups on CMs for a 2e−-pathway is highlighted. Further, for commercial perspectives, the significance of reactor design for decentralized H2O2 production is emphasized, bridging the gap between intrinsic catalytic properties and apparent productivity in electrochemical devices. Finally, major challenges and opportunities for the practical electrosynthesis of H2O2 and future research directions are proposed.","Zhang, Qingran;Chen, Yinguang;Pan, Jian;Daiyan, Rahman;Lovell, Emma C.;Yun, Jimmy;Amal, Rose;Lu, Xunyu",Journal,Small,2023-10-04,Tongji University;UNSW Sydney;Hebei University of Science and Technology;Qingdao International Academician Park Research Institute,active site engineering ;  carbon-based electrocatalysts ;  hydrogen peroxide ;  oxygen reduction

Research Progress and Development Trends of Drag Reduction Inspired by Fish Skin,"Reducing energy consumption is consistently desirable, with the aim of avoiding aggravation of the global energy crisis. Creatures in nature have adapted to their surroundings as a result of biological evolution. Learning how nature creatures adapts to environmental challenges may help solve many challenges in engineering. Underwater drag reduction is a dominant functional strategy developed by the long-term evolution of high-speed swimming organisms such as fish, revealing the relationship between topography characteristics, material properties, and drag reduction functional mechanisms can provide a feasible reference scheme for solving the problem of high-friction resistance on high-moving surfaces. Based on this strategy, this review takes fish skin as a prototype, the unique structure characteristics of sharkskin and dolphin skin are briefly analyzed, before the topography characteristics and multilayered structure of tuna skin are revealed and summarized. The characterization results show that tuna skin has structural characteristics and mechanical properties that result from imbricated fish scales covered by a flexible epidermis layer and embedding in a flexible dermis layer. This structure could be one reason for tuna swimming faster than sharks and dolphins. As more topographical features of other fish skins have been discovered and characterized, some fish scales have been exhibited excellent drag reduction performance in varying conditions. The unique structure characteristics, material properties, and special function of fish skin can provide a useful source for scientific development, technological invention and creation, and engineering technological problems. Drag reduction surfaces inspired by these unique structures and material properties were fabricated using a variety of processing methods, and are summarized in this review. The drag reduction performance of different bionic surfaces differs due to various shapes which have been constructed on microscale or nanoscale surfaces, size dimensions, and material properties. Even so, the drag reduction mechanism of those bionic surfaces can be roughly divided into three categories. First, the drag reduction effect is brought about by the unique structure and its drag reduction mechanism is summarized as the structure effect. The unique structure has a direct influence on the characteristics of the near-wall flow field, such as the “water trapping” effect of the microcrescent array inspired by Ctenopharyngodon idelluse fish scales that can lower the velocity gradient and generate a fluid-lubrication film to reduce shear wall stress between solid and fluid interface. Second, the compliant mechanism is summarized in which the drag reduction effect is caused by a flexible or compliant surface. Typically, the compliant surface acts as a resilient energy-absorbing coating that can delay the boundary layer transitioning from laminar to turbulent flow. Finally, a composite mechanism type is proposed in which the drag reduction effect is brought by coupling of the flexible coating and the unique structure characteristics. The composite surface with unique structure coupling with functional coating not only has excellent drag reduction performance, but also has other useful functions such as antifouling and noise reduction. Those drag reduction mechanisms evolved in nature can provide new bionic drag reduction systems and provide inspiration for innovation to solve engineering problems. At the end of this review, the application of the bionic surfaces inspired by fish skin is briefly introduced. On this basis, the future development and application of bionic surface drag reduction technologies are prospected. Although has restriction development and application all sorts of factors, but with the continuous development of manufacturing technology and materials, infiltration and emergence of many scientific branches will become a trend in the field of bionic drag reduction. This review can serve as a foundation for an in-depth analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of fish as well as a new inspiration for drag reduction and antifouling.","Chen, Dengke;Cui, Xianxian;Su, Lin;Liu, Xiaolin;Zhang, Liwen;Chen, Huawei",Journal,Zhongguo Biaomian Gongcheng/China Surface Engineering,2023-10-01,Ludong University;Beihang University;CSSC Systems Engineering Research Institute,bionic fabricate ;  bionic surface ;  drag reduction ;  mechanism ;  topography characteristic
Study on horizontal completion with composite tubular string in coal reservoir with complex coal structure,"Aiming at the problems such as large deformation difference of coal structure, strong heterogeneity of physical properties, complex coal structure during horizontal drilling, single completion & stimulation technology and so on, a completion technology with composite tubular string for coalbed methane (CBM) horizontal well is proposed. Completion tools, inner operation tubing and outer completion string are designed. The outer completion string is composed of casing and screen pipe. The mechanics and hydraulics calculation model of dual tubular string are optimized. A field test of this completion technology had been accomplished in No. 15 coal seam in Yangquan, Shanxi Province, China. A dual tubular string of 659.5 m was run into the depth of 1591 m, and the horizonal well section in coal seam is divided into four sections by external casing packers (ECP). The tests of dual tubular string running, hydraulic circulation removing dual tubular string blocking and sticking, well washing, ECP expansion sealing and segmental completion in coal seam were accomplished. Based on the engineering data of this well, the force of dual tubular string was calculated by finite difference method, and the related hydraulic calculation was carried out. The results show that the inner tubing increases the lateral force of completion string, and the friction resistance on downhole tubular string increases by 5642.75 N. The pressure of completion tubular string is mainly affected by hy-draulic loss of inner tubing and nozzles. The recommended displacement of hydraulic circulation is 16~20 L/s to remove rock and cuttings and maintain wellbore stability during completion string running. The displacement is increased to 20~24 L/s to eliminate the damage of drilling fluid to shaft wall during well washing operation. The research and field test verified the feasibility and innovation of the completion technology with composite tubular string for horizontal well, which provides a reliable basis for horizontal well diversified and adaptive stimulation in coal reservoir with complicated structure.","Bi, Yansen;Gao, Deli;Xian, Baoan;Li, Guichuan",Journal,Meitan Kexue Jishu/Coal Science and Technology (Peking),2023-10-01,Henan Polytechnic University;China University of Petroleum-Beijing;Ltd.,coal reservoir ;  complex coal structure ;  composite tubular column completion ;  dual tubular column ;  horizontal well

Development of a Corneal and Eye Protection Strategy in Domestic Swine,"Large animal models are essential to research in facial paralysis, face transplant, craniofacial surgery, and ophthalmology. Pigs are a well-studied species with high similarity to human anatomy and physiology for these research areas. However, in contrast to cats and dogs protecting the cornea and eye is difficult in swine due to the inability to use an Elizabethan collar (E-collar) and the complexity of placing and maintaining a temporary tarsorrhaphy for corneal protection due to the strength of the pig levator muscle. This study presents an effective method to provide corneal and eye protection in the domestic swine for at least 50 d. Furthermore, protection of the eye and face is achieved through the innovative use of a modified ophthalmologic face shield. The findings from this study will advance large animal research in these fields, enabling innovation in surgery and tissue engineering in areas of both craniofacial and ophthalmologic research.","Suchyta, Marissa A.;Gow, Christopher K.;Lawrence, Josephine M.;Mardini, Samir",Journal,Comparative Medicine,2023-10-01,Mayo Clinic,

Spatio-temporal evolution and drivers of knowledge exchange at global academic conferences,"Knowledge exchange at international academic conferences is an important function emerging from the globalization of science and technology and the evolution of global innovation networks, and its spatio- temporal complexity has become an emerging theme in human economic geography. The spatio- temporal evolution pattern of knowledge exchange at global academic conferences from 2000 to 2019 and its affecting elements are depicted from spatio- temporal multiple scales by integrating big data mining, mathematical statistics, GIS spatial analysis, and spatial measurement methods. The research found that: Firstly, the knowledge exchange at global academic conferences follows the ""downturn- recovery- boom-decline"" mid-cycle pattern, and the inter-month variation forms a double-peak structure in June and September; the knowledge exchange fields are concentrated in the ""Pasteur Quadrant,"" and application- oriented basic research like computer science, electrical & electronic engineering, control science, materials science, and communication science becomes the core frontier in these fields. Secondly, the exchange of academic conferences globally takes the form of a polycentric structure with three hubs, numerous sub- centers, and clusters concentrating in North America, Western Europe, and East and Southeast Asia. This structure demonstrates a duality of path locking and path creation, adhering to the law of ""resource- economy"" oriented location selection. Thirdly, different levels of knowledge exchange at global academic conferences cities are developing, and the knowledge exchange fields are heavily concentrated in the three major disciplines of computer science, electrical & electronic engineering, and physics. These three disciplines converge with the global ""turn to applied science,"" and there is also significant heterogeneity in the type of ""the scale concentration and disciplinary dominance"" relationship in these cities. Finally, there are notable differences in the drivers of knowledge exchange at global academic conferences between cities in developed and developing countries, with the knowledge exchange at global academic conferences not only being closely related to its embeddedness but also being fueled by a combination of improved exchange environments, lower exchange costs, and increased academic prestige.","Mao, Weisheng;Liu, Chengliang;Li, Yuan;Wang, Tao",Journal,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,2023-10-01,East China Normal University,determinant factors ;  global cities ;  international academic conferences ;  knowledge exchange ;  Spatio-temporal evolution ;  temporary clusters

"Unlocking Sustainable Commuting: Exploring the Nexus of Macroeconomic Factors, Environmental Impact, and Daily Travel Patterns","This paper examines normality in time series econometrics for a sustainable energy transition. By analysing data from January 1997 to December 2021, this study integrates macroeconomic, environmental, and energy data to gain insights into the potential changes in daily commuting patterns among Slovenians. Various methods, including unit root tests such as the augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF), Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS), and Zivot–Andrews (Z-A), as well as other tests, are employed. Additionally, the vector autoregressive (VAR) model, Granger Causality and regression analysis determine the impact. This paper contributes to uncovering valuable information within data from macrovariables using macroeconometric techniques. It also provides insights that can support evidence-based decision-making for sustainable energy transition policies in Slovenia. The results of the normality tests indicate that most macro variables are integrated; there is a need for a careful analysis of integration levels and appropriate testing methods.

Promoting Collaborative Learning in Students Soon to Graduate through a Teaching–Learning Model,"For students to compete in the globalized world, it is essential to be proficient not only in knowledge but also in soft skills. Students should know how to work collaboratively towards a common goal; in this sense, it is recommended for educators to enhance collaborative learning competency, particularly in students in the final part of their studies. Important efforts have been made to study collaborative learning; however, those that focus on collaborative competencies in engineering students close to finishing their studies have not yet been explored. In this context, this research proposes a teaching–learning model named “Colabora” to foster collaborative competencies in students soon to graduate from an industrial engineering program. It includes the development of a progressive final project, the use of a digital platform, and specific assessment tools. An exploratory study was conducted in a private university in Mexico during a semester-long innovation management course. Results show that the students who applied “Colabora” obtained the most knowledge on the subject of innovation management and showed greater collaborative competence. This approach adds value for educators and researchers interested in fostering collaborative competencies useful for future professionals that work in teams pursuing common goals.","Rodriguez-Salvador, Marisela;Castillo-Valdez, Pedro F.",Journal,Education Sciences,2023-10-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,collaborative competency ;  collaborative learning ;  educational innovation ;  higher education ;  teaching–learning resource
"Exploring User Experience and Usability in a Metaverse Learning Environment for Students: A Usability Study of the Artificial Intelligence, Innovation, and Society (AIIS)","The metaverse, a rapidly evolving research area, is a virtual, interconnected universe that seamlessly integrates digital and physical realms, facilitating immersive experiences, social interaction, and economic activities across various fields, including computer science, business, and education. Despite its potential to transform current pedagogies and learning experiences through engaging, interactive, and fascinating educational techniques, research is limited in exploring its application, usability, and user experience, particularly for Thai undergraduate students in learning computer engineering courses. In response, we designed and developed an innovative metaverse-based learning system called the AIIS collaborative learning interface, tailored to European undergraduate students. While the original intent of AIIS was to cater to medical students, in this study, our objective was to assess its usability and applicability for computer science and engineering students, specifically focusing on the Asian demographic. After an initial pilot with European students in their local context, the research was extended to Thailand, where 21 Thai undergraduate students evaluated the platform’s usability. The observations from this study indicate that AIIS provides a dynamic, user-friendly learning environment. Nevertheless, the evaluation process unveiled some usability flaws that offer informative directions for future enhancements. Drawing from our observations, we formulated usability guidelines to guide designers and developers toward crafting more efficient metaverse systems, particularly those intended for educational use. Our results also underline the considerable promise that metaverse technologies hold for advancing higher education globally.","Pyae, Aung;Ravyse, Werner;Luimula, Mika;Pizarro-Lucas, Emiliana;Sanchez, Pedro L.;Dorado-Diaz, Ignacio P.;Thaw, Aung Khant",Journal,Electronics (Switzerland),2023-10-01,"Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Salamanca (IBSAL);Turun ammattikorkeakoulu;Chulalongkorn University;Universidad de Salamanca;King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi;Universidad de Salamanca, Facultad de Medicina",heuristics ;  human–computer interaction ;  learning ;  metaverse ;  system usability scale ;  usability ;  user experience ;  virtual reality
Research on Load Spectrum Reconstruction Method of Exhaust System Mounting Bracket of a Hybrid Tractor Based on MOPSO-Wavelet Decomposition Technique,"To overcome the limitations of the hybrid tractor bumping tests, which include extended cycle times, high costs, and impracticality for single-part reliability verification, this study focuses on the exhaust system mounting bracket of a hybrid tractor. A novel approach that combines multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and wavelet decomposition algorithms was employed to enhance the reconstruction of shock vibration signals. This approach aims to enable the efficient acquisition of input signals for subsequent shaker table testing. The methodology involves a systematic evaluation of the spectral correlation between the original signal and the reconstructed signal at the stent’s response position, along with signal compression time. These parameters collectively constitute the objective function. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is then deployed to explore a range of crucial parameters, including wavelet basic functions, the number of wavelet decomposition layers, and the selection of wavelet components. This exhaustive exploration identifies an optimized signal reconstruction method that accurately represents shock vibration loads. Upon rigorous screening based on our defined objectives, the optimal solution vector was determined, which includes the utilization of the dB10 wavelet basic function, employing a 12-layer wavelet decomposition, and selecting wavelet components a12 and d3~d11. This specific configuration enables the retention of 95% of the damage coefficients while significantly compressing the test time to just 46% of the original signal duration. The implications of our findings are substantial as the reconstructed signal obtained through our optimized approach can be readily applied to shaker excitation. This innovation results in a notable reduction in test cycle time and associated costs, making it particularly valuable for engineering applications, especially in tractor design and testing.","Sun, Liming;Liu, Mengnan;Wang, Zhipeng;Wang, Chuqiao;Luo, Fuqiang",Journal,Agriculture (Switzerland),2023-10-01,Jiangsu University;Ltd.;State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Agricultural Power Equipment,durability ;  hybrid tractor ;  multi-objective particle swarm optimization ;  shock response spectrum ;  wavelet decomposition

Prediction of Electrical Resistance with Conductive Sewing Patterns by Combining Artificial Neural Networks and Multiple Linear Regressions,"This study aims to estimate the impact of sewing thread patterns on changes in the resistance of conductive yarns coated with silver paste. Firstly, the structure of the conductive yarns was examined, and various variations in the length and angle of individual sewing stitches were observed and analyzed through experiments. The results revealed that as the length of an individual stitch decreased, the width of the conductive yarn increased. Additionally, variations in the stitch angle resulted in different resistance values in the conductive yarn. These findings provide essential information for optimizing sewing patterns and designing components. Secondly, the comparison between models using multiple linear regression analysis and sewing neural networks was included to show optimized resistance prediction. The multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the stitch length and angle were significant variables affecting the resistance of the conductive thread. The artificial neural network model results can be valuable for optimizing sewing patterns and controlling resistance in various applications that utilize conductive thread. In addition, understanding the resistance variation in conductive thread according to sewing patterns and using optimized models to enhance component performance provides opportunities for innovation and progress. This research is necessary for the textile industry and materials engineering fields and holds high potential for practical applications in industrial settings.","Jang, Jun Hyeok;Kim, Joo Yong",Journal,Polymers,2023-10-01,Soongsil University,artificial neural network ;  conductive yarn ;  multiple linear regression analysis ;  optimization design ;  wearable technology
Greening south Asia: Investing in sustainability and innovation to preserve natural resources and combat environmental pollution,"Over the past few years, South Asian economies have witnessed consistent growth. Despite the region's vast wealth in natural resources, the impacts of climate change are evident across its diverse climatic zones. The integration of Green Finance (GIFN), Environmentally Friendly Investments (EFI), and Green Technology Innovation (GTI) can significantly alter the trajectory for South Asian nations. These mechanisms not only support economic growth targets but also mitigate the escalating environmental pollution in the region. Consequently, this study was undertaken to assess the potential of NTR, GIFN, EFI, and GTI in addressing CO2 emissions within the South Asian economic framework. Utilizing the Method of Moments of Quantile Regression (MMQR) on the dataset revealed that NTR has a positive impact on CO2 emissions. Conversely, GIFN, EFI, and GTI demonstrated negative impacts on CO2 emissions. Based on these findings, there's a pressing need for robust governance and policy enforcement by regional institutions to enhance environmental well-being.","Song, Chenchen;Wu, Zhendong;Dong, Rebecca Kechen;Dinçer, Hasan",Journal,Resources Policy,2023-10-01,UTS Business School;İstanbul Medipol Üniversitesi;Wuhan University of Technology;Yangzhou University,Environmental friendly investments ;  Environmental pollution ;  Green finance ;  Green technology innovation ;  Natural resources ;  South Asia
Measuring the Benefits and Barriers of the Implementation of BIM in Sustainable Practice in the Construction Industry of Saudi Arabia,"The construction industry of Saudi Arabia has witnessed notable innovation in sustainable practices in the form of building information modeling (BIM). Previously, a few studies dealt with either the benefits and barriers of BIM or sustainability. However, there is a limitation in these studies in terms of finding out the benefits and barriers of BIM in sustainable construction projects, especially in the context of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the determinants that impact the adoption of BIM in the construction industry of Saudi Arabia. A thorough examination of the existing literature was conducted in order to identify the various factors that contribute to the benefits and barriers of BIM. The research employed a questionnaire survey of 152 building engineering professionals from Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire’s results emphasize the key factors that are essential for the implementation of sustainable BIM. Initially, barriers and benefits were prioritized according to the relative importance index (RII). In addition, the study utilized statistical methods to identify the top five barriers that were deemed most significant. The Cronbach alpha test confirmed the presence of a statistically significant level of consistency in the responses provided by stakeholders. Moreover, the Spearman correlation test demonstrated that there was no statistically significant variance among the groups in their responses. The results indicated that among the 28 benefit factors, “improving design efficiency (RII = 0.788)”, “encouraging the use of energy-efficient clean technology (RII = 0.786)”, and “promoting green building design, construction, and management” were the top three benefits from BIM implementation in sustainable construction projects. On the other hand, “recurring demand for increased resources, together with high costs (RII = 0.720)”, “absence of a well-defined method for exchanging operational management data (RII = 0.713)”, and “lack of skilled personnel (RII = 0.708)” were the top five barriers to the incorporation of BIMs in the sustainable construction industry of Saudi Arabia. This study can provide valuable guidance for policymakers in developing countries who seek to successfully complete sustainable construction projects by encouraging factors that drive BIM implementation and enhancing project performance through the utilization of the benefits of BIM.","Alghuried, Abdullah",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-10-01,University of Tabuk,barriers ;  benefits ;  BIM ;  construction industry ;  project ;  Saudi Arabia ;  sustainable practice
"University-industry collaboration as a driver of digital transformation: Types, benefits and enablers","University-Industry collaboration as a driver of digital transformation ultimately depends on the engagement and relationship between individual academics and industry practitioners as partners in a trust relationship.

Transforming food supply chains for sustainability,"Modern food supply chains—infused with scientific and engineering innovations—have made food increasingly more affordable and accessible. Yet there is growing concern about the long-term sustainability of our food system. Over time, the inputs (e.g., water, fertile soil, fossil fuels, and chemicals) and working resources (e.g., land and labor) required for industrial food production and its associated supply chain structure have become more scarce and hence more expensive. At the same time, the by-products of these farming and supply chain activities (e.g., farm runoff and greenhouse gas emissions) have often created negative externalities on the environment and human health. To improve the sustainability of food production, research from the life sciences recommends adoption of transformative farming methods that incorporate ecological principles in a sustainable approach to farming. Operationally, this approach leverages economies of scope. In order to maintain strategic alignment, changing food production methods should be complemented with appropriate changes in the rest of the supply chain, including consumption habits. We propose a research agenda informed by findings from the life sciences, which integrates approaches from supply chain management as well as food and agricultural economics, to align all food supply chain partners with sustainable food production.","Gómez, Miguel I.;Lee, Deishin",Journal,Journal of Supply Chain Management,2023-10-01,Ivey Business School;Cornell University,environment ;  food supply chains ;  social responsibility ;  sustainability

This article undertakes a systematic review of the recent advances that have been reported in assessment practice in chemical engineering education. The main trends that emerge are: a shift towards authentic assessment methods, an increase in emphasis on peer-assessment and other approaches for group-based assignments, and a greater use of digital tools for the delivery of authentic assessments and improvement of marking and feedback practice. The analysis also examines the diversity of assessment methods used across the different chemical engineering subjects and how these map against assessment frameworks reported in the wider pedagogical literature. The emerging strand of research on synoptic and interdisciplinary assessment is used to develop an assessment framework for producing chemical engineering graduates who are also socially responsible and competent global citizens.","Ravi, Manoj",Journal,Education for Chemical Engineers,2023-10-01,University of Leeds,Assessment ;  Authentic assessment ;  Digitalisation
Development of an Online Project-Based Learning Design Course for African First Year Students and Its Impact on Self-Efficacy Levels,"Contribution: Online learning during the pandemic led to reports of learning losses, with physical isolation as one contributing factor. Education on the African continent faced additional challenges due to weaker supply chains and connectivity. Here, it is shown that even if students participate in a project-based design course online, from their homes across Africa, it is nonetheless possible for this pedagogy to increase their self-efficacy to design and build. Background: A false narrative exists about innovation needing to be diffused into the continent instead of generated locally. Understanding the impact of a successful attempt at challenging this narrative can inform curricula broadly. Research Questions: 1) Can a project-based design course increase self-efficacy levels for African first-year students? 2) How do social support levels relate to their change in self-efficacy? 3) How do self-efficacy levels relate to their pursuit of extracurricular design activities afterward? Methodology: Assessment of online and in-person modalities of the Principles of Design course was carried out through surveys at three time points. T-tests and Hedge's g tests ascertained statistical significance and effect size of changes in self-efficacy over time. Use of a self-proposed scale with minimal items limited the analysis. Findings: Self-efficacy levels increased significantly during the course for all majors, modalities, and genders. They either stayed statistically similar or increased one to two years afterward. Moderate correlation was found between support levels and self-efficacy changes. Statistical significance was neither found there nor between self-efficacy at the end of the course and design activity levels afterward.","Beem, Heather R.;Ampomah, Charity;Takyi, Jeremiah;Adomdza, Gordon Kwesi",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Education,2023-10-01,Ashesi University,Africa ;  design ;  first-year students ;  Ghana ;  learning environment ;  online ;  project-based learning ;  self-efficacy

Exploring the impact of natural resource dependence on green technology innovation: New insights from China,"China's excessive reliance on natural resources has resulted in the dual challenges of sluggish economic growth and significant ecological damage. Addressing the resource curse and realizing sustainable economic development have emerged as paramount concerns in regional development. Exploring practical strategies to overcome these challenges and foster a more sustainable and resilient economic landscape is crucial. This study explores the impact of natural resource dependence (NRD) on green technology innovation (GTI) using Chinese provincial administrative regions data between 2011 and 2021. The finding demonstrates that natural resource dependence significantly impedes regional green technology innovation, especially in resource-based and central and western provinces. Furthermore, it investigates the effects of NRD on regional green innovation under different levels of government integrity and public environmental concern. The findings indicate that the inhibitory effect of NRD on regional green innovation is more pronounced with lower levels of government integrity. Conversely, public environmental concerns can partially alleviate the inhibitory effect of natural resource dependence on green technology innovation. Hence, promoting the development of new industries, actively constructing diversified economic structures, enhancing government integrity, and gradually improving the public participatory environmental regulatory system are essential measures to tackle the problem of resource dependency and promote the enhancement of regional green technology innovation.","Xu, Yang;Liu, Xia;Yang, Liu;Yang, Xiaodong;Yan, Hongchuan;Ran, Qiying",Journal,Resources Policy,2023-10-01,Nanjing University;Southwest University for Nationalities;Chongqing University;Xinjiang University;Shanghai Business School,Government integrity ;  Green technology innovation ;  Natural resource dependence ;  Public environmental concern
Environmental earth sciences: advancing geosphere<sup>plus</sup> knowledge for environmental problem solving,"Global society’s insatiable demand for natural resources since the industrial revolution has led to myriads of environmental consequences. Concerned citizens have called for a carbon–neutral and sustainable future. In light of this trend, the aims and scope of the Environmental Earth Sciences (EES) journal are being revisited and revised. Founded as the “Environmental Geology” journal, it is logical not only to uphold the geological tradition and strength of the EES, but also to expand outward to advance geosphereplus knowledge. This refers to a novel understanding of multi-faceted and anthropogenically altered interactions within the geosphere and along the geosphere–biosphere nexus. The geosphere consists of the lithosphere (solid Earth), atmosphere (gaseous envelope), hydrosphere (liquid water) and cryosphere (frozen water). Since the EES values observation-based science, it also recognizes the role of development of cutting-edge tools for data collection, analysis and modeling. Contributions documenting innovations in local environmental problem solving are also welcome, especially engineering solutions grounded in geosciences. To cultivate diverse and inclusive scholarly pursuits, new types of articles are introduced. In anticipation of the growing number of publications arising from this emerging academic discipline, the journal strives to develop a robust appetite for original research that shed light on the problems and offer science-based solutions in the Anthropocene.","Zheng, Yan;Kolditz, Olaf;Kolditz, Barbara;Ma, Yunjie",Journal,Environmental Earth Sciences,2023-10-01,Southern University of Science and Technology;Helmholtz Zentrum für Umweltforschung;EES Office Leipzig,Aims and scope ;  Article types ;  Environmental earth sciences (EES) ;  Geosphere plus ;  Journal strategy
Does the pilot emissions trading system in China promote innovation? Evidence based on green technology innovation in the energy sector,"The Chinese government promulgated a carbon emissions trading system (ETS) pilot in 2011 and gradually expanded its scope. Based on energy-related green patent applications in 283 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2018, this study investigates the impact of the ETS pilot on green technology innovation in the energy sector (GTIES). By employing a spatial difference in difference (SDID) model and multi-dimensional empirical tests, our results show, first, that the pilot policy has reduced GTIES to a certain extent, due to the higher environmental regulation compliance costs. Second, the ETS pilot has weakened the green technology innovation ability of both pollution intensive industries and non-pollution intensive industries, and its total effect on non-pollution intensive industries is about 1.85 times that on pollution intensive industries. Third, the development of GTIES in pilot regions has been restrained weakly, and the promoting impact on GTIES in the neighboring region is not significant. This study provides empirical evidence for the evaluation of the pilot policy at the city-industry-regional level, revealing enlightenment on industrial policy and the need for regional collaboration in the presence of spatial spillover effects.","Sun, Yanming;Shen, Simiao;Zhou, Chuanyu",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-10-01,East China Normal University;Renmin University of China;Shanghai Putuo Education Supervision & Safety Affairs Center,Emissions trading scheme (ETS) ;  Energy sector ;  Green technology innovation ;  Pilot policy ;  Spatial difference in difference test

Investing for a Greener Future: Asymmetric Nexus between Green Finance and Renewable Energy Technology Innovation,"Green finance (GF) and renewable energy (RE) technology innovation (RTI) play a pivotal role in paving the way toward a low-carbon economy. They hold immense potential to drive meaningful change and ensure a greener future for generations to come. In the present study, an asymmetric connection between GF and RTI is analyzed in the top 10 GF promoter economies. In the prior research, panel data approaches are utilized to achieve consistent results about the linkage between the variables. However, in this investigation, a novel “Quantile-on-Quantile” method is introduced that provides detailed, country-specific insights into time–series dependence. In the findings, a positive association between GF and RTI in most economies at specific data distribution segments is suggested. Moreover, it is highlighted in the data that the degree of asymmetries in the relationships between the variables varies among countries, underscoring the significance of policymakers keeping a close eye on changes in GF and RE technologies.","Teng, Chenmei;Wang, Bingying;Ali, Sajid;Nazar, Raima",Journal,Energy Technology,2023-10-01,The Women University Multan;Bahauddin Zakariya University;Zhongnan University of Economics and Law;Soochow University,asymmetric associations ;  green finances ;  quantile-on-quantile estimations
Confronting Barriers: An Efficacious Higher Education System Implementation in India,"Higher education prompting skill-based activities has been crucial to any country’s emergence in the global knowledge economy. However, with context to India’s higher education framework, it is well below the standard of the countries with which it is competing globally. India has no universities anywhere near the top 150 in QS international universities ranking. This deficiency prompts a considerable number of Indian students to pursue education abroad, resulting in a reduced talent pool for domestic innovation and economic growth. This manuscript aims to provide crucial insights into the obstacles termed “Barriers” and determinants of success termed “Critical Success Factors (CSFs)” that impact the effective functioning of the Indian higher education system (IHES). The research work has identified 19 barriers to the growth of IHES and 12 CSFs for the successful implementation of higher education in India. The grey Shannon-Entropy method has been utilised to compute the weightage of identified CSFs.

Exploring how new industrial paradigms affect the workforce: A literature review of Operator 4.0.,"The ongoing paradigm transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 is driving toward a new industrial vision rooted in addressing human and planetary needs rather than solely focusing on innovation for profit. One of the most significant shifts that defines Industry 5.0 is the change in focus from technology-driven progress to a genuinely human-centric approach. This means that the industrial sector should prioritize human needs and interests at the core of the production process. Instead of replacing workers on the shop floor, technologies should enhance their capabilities, leading to a safer and more fulfilling work environment. Consequently, the role of industrial operators is undergoing a substantial transformation. This subject has garnered increasing interest from both researchers and industries. However, there is a lack of comprehensive literature covering the concept of Operator 4.0. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review of the role of Operator 4.0 within the manufacturing context. Out of the 1333 papers retrieved from scientific literature databases, 130 scientific papers met the inclusion criteria and underwent detailed analysis. The study aims to provide an extensive overview of Operator 4.0, analyzing the occupational risks faced by workers and the proposed solutions to support them by leveraging the key enabling technologies of Industry 4.0. The paper places particular emphasis on human aspects, which are often overlooked although the successful implementation of technologies heavily relies on who uses them and how they are utilized. Finally, the paper discusses open issues and challenges and puts forth suggestions for future research directions.","Ciccarelli, Marianna;Papetti, Alessandra;Germani, Michele",Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2023-10-01,Università Politecnica delle Marche,Human Factors ;  Human-centric ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Key Enabling Technologies ;  Operator 4.0 ;  Systematic Literature Review
How do the designs of emission trading system affect the value of covered firms—A quasi-natural experiment based on China,"Under the effective cost constraint, the emission trading system (ETS) can put pressure on the covered firms to cut emissions through reasonable system designs. Under the ETS with different system designs, firms face different cost constraints. Therefore, how ETS designs affect the value of covered firms is important to evaluate the effectiveness of ETS. Based on the Chinese A-share listed firms from 2010 to 2019, this paper employs DID, Mediation-DID, and Moderated Mediation Methods to investigate the influence of system designs of seven pilot ETSs on the value of covered firms. The main findings are as follows. First, in general, the value of covered firms is improved by the implementation of pilot ETSs. Compared with free allowances, paid allowances have a stronger promotion effect on firm value, in which the technology innovation plays a positive mediation role. Second, from the perspective of free allowances, the benchmarking method can promote firm value more effectively than the historical method, through the paths of technology innovation and carbon information disclosure (CID). Third, the increase of carbon price level and its stability can promote firm value. Specifically, the carbon price level only promotes firm value through CID, while the carbon price stability promotes firm value through technology innovation and weakens firm value through CID. Moreover, for firms owned by the State or in high‑carbon industries, the value improvement effect of ETS is more significant.","Yu, Pei;Hao, Ruixue;Sun, Yongping",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-10-01,Hubei University Of Economics;Huazhong University of Science and Technology;Wuhan University of Technology,Carbon price ;  Effective cost constraint ;  Emission allowances ;  ETS designs ;  Firm value
Improving entrepreneurial skills and professional association of college students using big data analysis and IoT,"Modern cutting-edge technologies have changed the appearance of the world and are presently working diligently to turn this partially automated world into a fully autonomous one. The primary players in this quest are the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence. These technologies are game changers in almost all walks of life, including business, entertainment, healthcare, agriculture, education, etc. In the education sector, these technologies play their role to some extent, but there is still some room that needs to be filled in order to utilize the full potential of these technologies. For instance, there is very limited work in the literature that utilizes these technologies for developing college students’ innovative and entrepreneurial skills. Thus, the main goal of this research is to investigate how big data analysis and IoT might be used by the professional associations of college students to encourage their growth of innovative and entrepreneurial skills. In this study, we tackled this issue in two ways: first, we thoroughly examined how IoT can help college students’ professional associations for developing their innovative and entrepreneurial skills. More specifically, we used IoT to collect data on innovative and entrepreneurial skills from associations of college students. Secondly, we used a big data analytic algorithm, i.e., C4.5 decision tree, to calculate the knowledge acquisition rate for the professional associations of students’ training in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation. The results are carefully evaluated, and a thorough comparison is made with relevant work from the literature. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has a high degree of data classification accuracy and a high data throughput capacity as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed IoT and big data-enabled approach can significantly enhance college students’ professional practice and employment capabilities.","Ma, Xiao;Pan, Hongli",Journal,Soft Computing,2023-10-01,Beihua University,Big data analysis ;  C4.5 decision tree ;  Innovation and entrepreneurship ;  Internet of things ;  Professional associations

Advanced metal anodes and their interface design toward safe metal batteries: A comprehensive review,"Metal batteries have attracted significant interest due to their higher energy density compared to state-of-the-art metal-ion batteries. However, the combination of a metal anode and flammable organic electrolyte results in safety issues, which has motivated the exploration of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) and aqueous electrolytes (AEs). SSEs and AEs have been widely considered as 'enablers' of metal anodes for safe metal batteries (SMBs) with improved energy density. Nevertheless, detrimental interfacial side reactions and undesirable dendrite growth at the anode side have slowed the path to practical application. This review aims to combine fundamental science and engineering perspectives to seek rational design parameters for practical SMBs. Firstly, the kinetics and thermodynamics explaining interfacial side reactions and dendrite growth are reviewed. Then, current research hotspots relying on structural design, interface modification, and innovation of both SSEs and AEs for improving safety are discussed. Following that, advanced characterization techniques and theoretical analysis for the mechanisms of SMBs are highlighted. To pave the way for practical application, key parameters that affect the energy density of SMBs will be systematically analyzed and shine a light on the gap between fundamental research and practical application. Lastly, potential future directions and prospects in engineering SMBs are explored.","Luo, Yang;Yang, Xiaofei;Wang, Changhong;Fraser, Adam;Zhang, Hongzhang;Sun, Xueliang;Li, Xianfeng",Journal,Progress in Materials Science,2023-10-01,Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences;Western University,Anode design ;  Aqueous batteries ;  Failure mechanism ;  Interface engineering ;  Solid-state batteries
Impact of Micro-NPR bolt on the mining of deep-buried phosphate via the room-and-pillar method,"Large and complex goaf groups have formed as a consequence of mining activities in the Yichang Phosphate Mine. These goaf formations have given rise to recurring engineering challenges and disasters, including roof collapse and pillar damage, primarily attributed to excessive ground pressure. Owing to the working principle and mechanical properties of traditional PR bolts, the preload cannot be applied to the surrounding rock immediately after excavation, resulting in considerable roadway damage. To address the problem of large deformation control in deep mines, a damage mechanics model of a roof-and-pillars mine was established to analyse its deformation and damage characteristics. A physical model experiment was performed to analyse the damage state of the roof and pillars in a deep-buried phosphate mine with twin roadways using the room-and-pillar method. The objective was to examine the effectiveness of the PR and micro-NPR(negative Poisson's ratio) bolt support systems under real conditions. Experimental results indicated that the micro-NPR bolt effectively strengthened the roof and pillar, enhanced the strength and stiffness of the pillar, and prevented pillar extrusion and roof collapse. These findings bridge the gaps in the existing theoretical frameworks, technical research, and engineering applications of the micro-NPR support, promoting technological innovation in the phosphate mining industry. This study provides a reference for the state change and support research on the surrounding rock after the excavation of twin parallel tunnels under specific conditions.","Guo, Longji;Tao, Zhigang;He, Manchao;Coli, Massimo",Journal,Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology,2023-10-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Università degli Studi di Firenze",Deep phosphate mine ;  Micro-NPR ;  Physical model ;  Roof-and-pillars system ;  Twin roadways
PBL Intervention for Fostering Creativity in First-Year Engineering Students,"Contribution: This research presents a project-based learning (PBL) approach for fostering creativity in first-year students with differential characteristics in the course execution. The first course considered remote teaching during a pandemic period; the second one used 50% of the weeks with remote teaching and the rest with face-to-face interaction. Background: Fostering creativity has become a significant challenge for engineering education. This work focuses on harmonizing a creativity framework and a PBL approach (PBL + C) as an alternative to motivate creative thinking. Intended Outcomes: The PBL + C approach can improve first-year engineering students' creativity and innovation skills and learning outcomes. Application Design: In the intervention, the project execution considers the creative process and its phases. Likewise, it takes all elements of an aligned curriculum model, such as teaching and learning activities, types of problems, project progression, support resources, creative tools, learning environments, facilitation strategies, and student assessment and course evaluation. Regarding the last elements, researchers define an assessing protocol, which involves pre- and post-tests, participant observation, analysis of student portfolios for monitoring the work progress, and specific questionnaires on variables related to the curricular design. Findings: Evidence collected shows an increase in creativity factors, such as fluency and flexibility, which are critical aspects of the 'Person' element of the creative process. Likewise, the modality of the course (remote or in-person) influences the conditions for its development. For example, in the mixed course, researchers found that students had more interaction with each other, which is reflected in better elaborated solutions than in the remote teaching course.","Higuera-Martinez, Oscar I.;Fernandez-Samaca, Liliana;Alvarado-Fajardo, Andrea C.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Education,2023-10-01,Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia,Assessment ;  creative problem solving ;  creativity ;  engineering education ;  project-based learning (PBL)

"Unlocking the Emotional World of Visual Media: An Overview of the Science, Research, and Impact of Understanding Emotion","The emergence of artificial emotional intelligence technology is revolutionizing the fields of computers and robotics, allowing for a new level of communication and understanding of human behavior that was once thought impossible. While recent advancements in deep learning have transformed the field of computer vision, automated understanding of evoked or expressed emotions in visual media remains in its infancy. This foundering stems from the absence of a universally accepted definition of 'emotion,' coupled with the inherently subjective nature of emotions and their intricate nuances. In this article, we provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary overview of the field of emotion analysis in visual media, drawing on insights from psychology, engineering, and the arts. We begin by exploring the psychological foundations of emotion and the computational principles that underpin the understanding of emotions from images and videos. We then review the latest research and systems within the field, accentuating the most promising approaches. We also discuss the current technological challenges and limitations of emotion analysis, underscoring the necessity for continued investigation and innovation. We contend that this represents a 'Holy Grail' research problem in computing and delineate pivotal directions for future inquiry. Finally, we examine the ethical ramifications of emotion-understanding technologies and contemplate their potential societal impacts. Overall, this article endeavors to equip readers with a deeper understanding of the domain of emotion analysis in visual media and to inspire further research and development in this captivating and rapidly evolving field.","Wang, James Z.;Zhao, Sicheng;Wu, Chenyan;Adams, Reginald B.;Newman, Michelle G.;Shafir, Tal;Tsachor, Rachelle",Journal,Proceedings of the IEEE,2023-10-01,Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology;University of Illinois at Chicago;University of Haifa;Pennsylvania State University,Artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) ;  bodily expressed emotion understanding (BEEU) ;  deep learning ;  ethics ;  evoked emotion ;  expressed emotion ;  human behavior ;  intelligent robots ;  movement analysis ;  psychology
Students’ perceptions of their STEM learning environment,"Australia’s economic need for innovation has led to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education becoming an essential investment for the future. This study utilised a mixed-methods approach involving a pre-validated quantitative questionnaire together with qualitative semi-structured focus groups with students across four Year 5 classrooms. Students provided their perceptions of their STEM learning environment and their interactions with their teacher to identify factors influencing their engagement for pursuing these disciplines. The questionnaire comprised of scales from three different instruments: Classroom Emotional Climate, Test of Science Related Attitudes, and Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction. Several key factors were identified through student responses, including Student Freedom, Peer Collaboration, Problem Solving, Communication, Time, and Preferred Environments. 33 out of possible 40 correlations between scales were statistically significant, but eta2 values were considered low (0.12–0.37). Overall, the students expressed positive perceptions about their STEM learning environment, with Student Freedom, Peer Collaboration, Problem Solving, Communication and Time appearing to impact their perceptions of STEM education. Three focus groups with a total of 12 students identified suggestions for improving STEM learning environments. Implications from this research include the importance of considering student perceptions when measuring the quality of STEM learning environments, as well as how facets of these environments can impact student attitudes towards STEM.","Fairhurst, Nicole;Koul, Rekha;Sheffield, Rachel",Journal,Learning Environments Research,2023-10-01,Curtin University,Classroom emotional climate ;  Integrated STEM learning ;  STEM education ;  STEM learning environments ;  Student perceptions ;  Teacher–student interactions

Semiparallel Service Systems in CPSS: Theory and Application,"In this article, we study the design and innovation of smarter service systems considering the deep integration of real service systems and virtual service elements. Specifically, we consider the perspective of life-cycle service system design and innovation that must consider the 'social space' factors, such as stakeholders' behaviors, which increases the complexity of service cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs). We propose a new methodology framework, the semiparallel service system (SPSS) framework, following the CPSS architecture and artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) methodologies emerging in complex system modeling. We design two decomposition-then-aggregation loops to reduce the complexity of service systems innovation. In the first loop, we expand the Vee model of systems engineering to the N model to show how to develop an innovative service system step by step. In the second loop, the SPSS, in which the hybrid service system is parallel with the real service system, maintains the continuous innovations of the system. Following our framework, we can design prototypes, perform experiments, and run the hybrid service system. We use two cases, an Internet hospital platform design and a new service design in a customs bonded warehouse, to demonstrate the advantages and potential of our proposed methodology. Finally, we discuss the future research challenges and directions.","Wang, Ridong;Zhang, Yifan;Li, Lefei",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,2023-10-01,Tsinghua University,and parallel execution (ACP) approach ;  Artificial societies ;  computational experiments ;  customs bonded warehouse ;  cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) ;  Internet hospital ;  semiparallel service systems (SPSSs) ;  service innovation
Agriculture 4.0 as Enabler of Sustainable Agri-Food: A Proposed Taxonomy,"Global population growth, climate change, and food safety are some of the challenges that the agri-food sector is current facing. Addressing these in a sustainable way requires the adoption of sustainable-oriented innovations capable of developing new knowledge and reshaping production methods and business models. Digitalization and technological evolution in the agri-food sector, culminating within Agriculture 4.0 (A4.0), represent the latest revolution, as testified by the extant body of knowledge. The lack of a systematic model to map the body of knowledge in A4.0 and how it addresses the agri-food sustainability challenges represents the input of our review. We propose a systematic literature review to discover the research routes in A4.0, increasing the understanding of this paradigm as agri-food sustainability enabler. A taxonomy, composed of 566 terms grouped in seven categories representative of the extant research routes, is proposed: the names assumed by agri-food digitalization process, the main aims and issues of A4.0, the features of the agricultural sector, the parameters monitorable and calculable through A4.0, data, and technologies. It emerged that A4.0 absolve the role of enabler in sustainability agri-food providing to the company a set of data and technological sustainable oriented innovations able to solve, according to an interdisciplinary approach, environmental, social, and economic challenges. The findings identify research gaps and theoretical and practical implications for a wide range of stakeholders, such as engineering managers, agri-food companies, researchers, or companies involved in the web content analysis.

Research on the evolution path of high-quality innovative development of green housing under the background of “peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality”,"To focus on the demands for low-carbon development driven by green technology innovation, the improvement of the government guidance mechanism, and the standardization of the behavior of green housing market participants, this paper builds an evolutionary game model between real estate developers and consumers, verifies it through cases, and analyzes the effects of government guidance when the market participation mechanism fails. The research shows that under the market participation mechanism, the quantity of green technology innovation in real estate companies, the cost impact coefficient of carbon emission reduction, speculative benefits, and consumer benefits are the main factors affecting the equilibrium. To realize the high-quality innovative development of green housing, different government guidance measures should reach a certain threshold, among which incentive subsidy measures are more effective. In addition, the effect of the supervision and punishment of the government on regulating the behavior of green housing market participants is better than the supervision feedback from consumers. In the combination of punches, the incentive subsidy and the regulatory and feedback measures driven by the government and consumers are the most effective measures to promote the development of green housing.","Ning, Xin;Ye, Xiaobin;Wang, Wenjuan",Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2023-09-25,Dongbei University of Finance and Economics,evolutionary game ;  feedback driven by two parties ;  green housing ;  green technology innovation ;  market failure ;  supervision
Predicting rock brittleness indices from simple laboratory test results using some machine learning methods,"Brittleness as an important property of rock plays a crucial role both in the failure process of intact rock and rock mass response to excavation in engineering geological and geotechnical projects. Generally, rock brittleness indices are calculated from the mechanical properties of rocks such as uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength and modulus of elasticity. These properties are generally determined from complicated, expensive and time-consuming tests in laboratory. For this reason, in the present research, an attempt has been made to predict the rock brittleness indices from simple, inexpensive, and quick laboratory test results namely dry unit weight, porosity, slake-durability index, P-wave velocity, Schmidt rebound hardness, and point load strength index using multiple linear regression, exponential regression, support vector machine (SVM) with various kernels, generating fuzzy inference system, and regression tree ensemble (RTE) with boosting framework. So, this could be considered as an innovation for the present research. For this purpose, the number of 39 rock samples including five igneous, twenty-six sedimentary, and eight metamorphic were collected from different regions of Iran. Mineralogical, physical and mechanical properties as well as five well known rock brittleness indices (i.e., B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5) were measured for the selected rock samples before application of the above-mentioned machine learning techniques. The performance of the developed models was evaluated based on several statistical metrics such as mean square error, relative absolute error, root relative absolute error, determination coefficients, variance account for, mean absolute percentage error and standard deviation of the error. The comparison of the obtained results revealed that among the studied methods, SVM is the most suitable one for predicting B1, B2 and B5, while RTE predicts B3 and B4 better than other methods.","Fereidooni, Davood;Karimi, Zohre",Journal,Geomechanics and Engineering,2023-09-25,Damghan University,fuzzy inference ;  machine boosting regression trees ;  rock brittleness ;  rock sample ;  simple tests ;  support vector

Does the Carbon Trading Mechanism Effectively Promotes Emissions Reductions in Technology Path? - Evidence from 30 Chinese Provinces and Cities,"Science and technology innovation and the digital economy are important drivers of carbon emission control and quality improvement. After the introduction of carbon emissions trading pilot in China, the increment in carbon emissions in pilot provinces and cities has been decreased year by year. The extent to which effectiveness has been influenced by policy is worth exploring. Panel data was collected for 30 provincial administrative units in China from 2008 to 2019, considering the carbon emissions trading pilots carried out in seven provinces and cities as a quasi-natural experiment. The difference in difference method (DID) was used to investigate whether the implementation of the carbon emissions trading pilot policy could strengthen the effect of mechanism that technological innovation and digitization could promote carbon emission reduction and the policy spillover effects. The findings showed that: (1) The carbon emissions trading policy could enhance the effect of science and technology innovation and digital mechanism to reduce emissions, and human capital investment had a significant role. This result remained robust after parallel trend testing; (2) The carbon emissions trading policy had spatial spillover effects on the surrounding areas of the pilot project, and could promote the process of carbon reduction in the surrounding areas; (3) The policy effect in the eastern region was better than that in the western region, and the western region had more room to reduce emissions through technological innovation and digital development. China should continue to steadily promote the policy of carbon emission rights marketization. Regions with large differences in the level of technological innovation and digitization need to increase their policy implementation efforts to promote the flow of technological and digitization factors to reduce carbon emissions by point to point, while similar regions need to start from the intrinsic motivation of technological innovation.","Zhang, Xuefeng;Lv, Qingyang;Wang, Xing",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-09-22,North China University of Technology,Carbon Emissions Trading ;  Digital Economy ;  Science and Technology Innovation ;  SDID

Innovation Research on Construction Safety Management of Civil Engineering Based on Machine Learning,"The neural network based on the deep learning theory has a profound theoretical basis and broad application prospects in the field of bridge structure damage identification. The comparison and analysis are made from three aspects of input vector, finite element model and neural network, which provides reference for further research on neural network in bridge structure damage identification. Through analysis, it is found that the ability of neural network to extract relevant information can be effectively improved by selecting the finite element model or the original data obtained in the actual situation as far as possible for the input vector. When the stress of bridge structure is simple, neural network with shallow layers and simple network structure can be selected. When the stress of bridge structure is complex, the neural network model with strong complexity should be selected first.","Li, Daihong;Kang, Qian",Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2023-09-21,UNSW Sydney,Civil Engineering ;  Construction Safety Management ;  Machine Learning
Initiation and Development of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Nuclear Energy and Power System,"The supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) nuclear energy and power system uses S-CO2 as the working fluid to convert nuclear heat directly or indirectly into electricity or mechanical energy. S-CO2 is considered one of the most promising working fluids for applications in conventional and high-temperature scenarios. The unique properties of S-CO2, such as its non-phase-change behavior, high density, compressibility near the pseudo-critical region, low thermal cycle compression ratio, minimal thermal inertia equipment requirements, and suitability for direct cycle and power generation propulsion technologies, simplify the system, reduce volume, lower weight, improve maneuverability, reduce noise, and enhance thermal efficiency. The advantages of S-CO2 power conversion technology not only meet the development needs of the next generation of advanced energy conversion technology but also align with the future trends of nuclear power systems. Leading energy technology countries, including the United States, conducted extensive research on S-CO2 power conversion technology in areas such as fossil fuel power generation, nuclear energy, waste heat recovery, and solar thermal power. Some of these projects have already entered the engineering demonstration phase. In China, S-CO2 power conversion technology was included in the “14th Five-Year Plan” for scientific and technological innovation in the energy sector. Numerous universities and industrial sectors in China are actively conducting research and development in this field. The development of S-CO2 nuclear power system in three historical stages for nearly 60 years, including the concept creation, research restart, and collaborative innovation, was summarized in this paper. The research status of S-CO2 nuclear energy and power system in reactor design, material technology, thermohydraulics, heat exchangers, turbomachines, system operation, control, and security policies was also introduced. The technical challenges and key research directions faced by S-CO2 nuclear energy and power system in basic research and engineering were pointed out. Currently, energy superpowers represented by China and the United States have completed laboratory tests of S-CO2 power conversion systems, and are expected to move towards medium-scale engineering demonstration or even large-scale application in the next 5 to 10 years. S-CO2 nuclear energy and power system has the prerequisites for engineering development, and is expected to lead the transformation of advanced nuclear energy technologies. Nevertheless, numerous technical challenges are still existing in core design, materials, thermal-fluid mechanics, and safety analysis. Additionally, engineering efforts are required to tackle challenges related to high-efficiency heat exchangers, high-power high-speed electric motors, heavy-duty electromagnetic bearings, and turbine power generation systems. Simultaneously, coordinated efforts in both fundamental and applied research are essential to enhance the advanced nature and engineering feasibility of SCO2 nuclear energy and power systems.","Huang, Yanping;Liu, Minyun;Zhuo, Wenbin;Ye, Lü;Tang, Jia;Chen, Yaoxing;Liu, Ruilong;Liu, Xiuting;Tang, Yu;Zhao, Xuebin;Gong, Houjun;Zan, Yuanfeng",Journal,Yuanzineng Kexue Jishu/Atomic Energy Science and Technology,2023-09-20,Tsinghua University;Nuclear Power Institute of China,Brayton cycle ;  nuclear energy ;  nuclear reactor ;  power system ;  supercritical carbon dioxide
"Harnessing the power of polyol-based polyesters for biomedical innovations: synthesis, properties, and biodegradation","Polyesters based on polyols have emerged as promising biomaterials for various biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, and regenerative medicine, due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and versatile physicochemical properties. This review article provides an overview of the synthesis methods, performance, and biodegradation mechanisms of polyol-based polyesters, highlighting their potential for use in a wide range of biomedical applications. The synthesis techniques, such as simple polycondensation and enzymatic polymerization, allow for the fine-tuning of polyester structure and molecular weight, thereby enabling the tailoring of material properties to specific application requirements. The physicochemical properties of polyol-based polyesters, such as hydrophilicity, crystallinity, and mechanical properties, can be altered by incorporating different polyols. The article highlights the influence of various factors, such as molecular weight, crosslinking density, and degradation medium, on the biodegradation behavior of these materials, and the importance of understanding these factors for controlling degradation rates. Future research directions include the development of novel polyesters with improved properties, optimization of degradation rates, and exploration of advanced processing techniques for fabricating scaffolds and drug delivery systems. Overall, polyol-based polyesters hold significant potential in the field of biomedical applications, paving the way for groundbreaking advancements and innovative solutions that could revolutionize patient care and treatment outcomes.","Fakhri, Vafa;Su, Chia Hung;Tavakoli Dare, Masoud;Bazmi, Maryam;Jafari, Aliakbar;Pirouzfar, Vahid",Journal,Journal of Materials Chemistry B,2023-09-19,"Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch;Islamic Azad University, Central Tehran Branch;Ming Chi University of Technology;Amirkabir University of Technology",
"Towards a Typology of Interdisciplinarity in Cybersecurity: Trade, Choice, and Agnostic-Antagonist","Cybersecurity research increasingly involves non-engineering disciplines, such as psychology, social science and law [41]. In this paper, we argue that cybersecurity research is not only reshaped through new methods and concepts of these adjacent fields, but also through shared interdisciplinary practices. Existing literature on interdisciplinarity in cybersecurity is primarily concerned with defining ideal models that are based on ideals, rather than in empirical research of how interdisciplinarity is formed in practice. We offer an ethnographic analysis of interdisciplinary formats based on our four-year participation in the ongoing interdisciplinary cybersecurity PhD programme SecHuman at the Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany. The PhD programme brings together engineers, social scientists as well as humanities scholars. Drawing on methods and literature of ethnographic science and technology studies (STS), we attend to eight different interdisciplinary formats and analyse how they shape cybersecurity research: its logics of accountability, of innovation, and of ontology [3]. This leads to a typology of five modes of interdisciplinarity that can be found in the PhD programme: 1. choice, 2. subordinate-service, 3. integrative-synthetic, 4. trading, and 5. agonistic-antagonistic. Based on our empirical findings, we discuss how each mode shapes cybersecurity, and conclude with suggestions of how to craft interdisciplinary formats in the field.","Kocksch, Laura Anna;Sorensen, Estrid",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-09-18,Aalborg University;Ruhr-Universitat Bochum,Collaboration ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Practice Research ;  Science and Technology Studies ;  Usable Security
"Progress, key challenges and countermeasures of reservoir stimulation technology of PetroChina","In order to guarantee the policy of national energy resources security and accelerate domestic oil and gas production, confronting growing complex exploration objects, innovation and advance in reservoir stimulation are the most significant drivers for discovering resources and increasing reserves. By comprehensively reviewing the development history of reservoir stimulation and analyzing technical challenges for exploration target characteristics of PetroChina Company Limited (PetroChina), main progress of reservoir stimulation is systematically summarized, including the optimized design of fracture-controlled stimulation to maximize the release of reserves, the increasing operational capability of fracturing equipment, more robust downhole tools, lower cost of fracturing fluid and improved personalization, and the obvious trend of proppant to low-cost and small mesh size. The supporting role of reservoir stimulation for exploration discovery is clarified. A comprehensive analysis of the key problems faced by hydraulic fracturing is conducted in four aspects: i.e., primary elements of fracturing, fracturing design optimization, field operation quality, and technology evolution. Specifically, the countermeasures in four aspects are proposed: (1) igniting innovation of basic research to provide theoretical support for the progress of fracturing technology; (2) promoting the quality of five primary elements to support the high-quality development of reservoir stimulation technology; (3) promoting the precise technical scheme to provide guidance for more efficient exploration and development of oil and gas; (4) increasing the efficiency of technical management to create a new mode of efficient treatment of engineering management.","Lei, Qun;Weng, Dingwei;Cai, Bo;He, Chunming;Shi, Yang;Ma, Zeyuan",Journal,China Petroleum Exploration,2023-09-15,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;PetroChina Stimulation Department of National Energy Tight Oil and Gas R & D Center,engineering integration ;  fracture-controlled fracturing ;  geology ;  PetroChina ;  reservoir stimulation ;  shale gas ;  shale oil
"Environmental regulation, green innovation and high-quality development of enterprise: Evidence from China","Environmental regulation, as a safe line of defense for the ecological environment, is an important practical exploration to guide green innovation and to promote high-quality development of enterprise. This research examines the impact of environmental regulation on high-quality development of enterprise and the realization path based on the data of Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2010 to 2020. The fixed-effect model reveals a significant positive correlation between environmental regulation and high-quality development of enterprise. Moreover, the chain intermediation model is used to examine the realization path. Specifically, environmental regulation hinders enterprises' green management innovation and thus has a negative impact on high-quality development of enterprise, which is manifested as a masking effect. Environmental regulation has a positive impact on the high-quality development of enterprise through enhancing green technology innovation or the intermediation chain of ""promoting green technology innovation - driving green management innovation"". Heterogeneity analysis reveals that environmental regulation has a facilitating effect on the high-quality development of enterprises for non-state-owned enterprises, and enterprises within the carbon emission trading pilot areas. In addition, environmental regulation has the strongest promoting effect on high-quality development of enterprise in the mature stage, followed by the growth stage. The research provides actionable paths for the government to optimize the institutional system of ecological environment construction and accelerate the modernization process of environmental governance.","Luo, Gengyan;Guo, Jitao;Yang, Fangyi;Wang, Chuyi",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-09-15,Qilu University of Technology,Environmental regulation ;  Green management innovation ;  Green technology innovation ;  High-quality development of enterprise
"Engaging stakeholders in collaborative control of air pollution: A tripartite evolutionary game of enterprises, public and government","In the current context of air pollution control, inconsistent interest demands from various stakeholders hinder efficient cooperative governance. This study developed a tripartite evolutionary game model to examine the decision-making mechanism of enterprises, the public, and the governments involved in China's air pollution control process. Using theoretical and simulation analysis, the study identifies critical factors of stakeholders' strategies and propose possible evolution paths for achieving collaborative air pollution control. The results showed that collaborative governance among the three stakeholders is the optimal path for air pollution control in China, which evolves through four stages: government regulation, enterprises' pollution control, public participation, and government withdrawal. Currently, China is currently in a transitional period from public participation to government withdrawal and should focus on introducing subsidy policies to encourage green technology innovation among enterprises, strengthen environmental information disclosure, and establish and improve public participation mechanisms. In the future, China should prioritize the construction of public participation channels, incentivize green technology innovation, and focus on synergistic effect of carbon emission reduction among enterprises. This will help achieve the possible government withdrawal stage where joint governance of the public and enterprises can effectively control air pollution, allowing the government to shift focus to other important environmental issues such as carbon emission reduction.","Wang, Jiaming;Jia, Ling;He, Pan;Wang, Peng;Huang, Lei",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-09-15,Nanjing University;Cardiff University;Jiangsu University,Air pollution ;  Environmental regulation ;  Pollution control ;  Public participation ;  Tripartite evolutionary game
Towards functionalized lignin and its derivatives for high-value material applications,"In pursuit of low-carbon development, the production of diverse functional materials from renewable resources, especially lignocellulosic biomass, is of vital importance. Lignin is a major component of lignocellulose, and it is nature's only true high-volume aromatic polymer, which has the advantages of biodegradability, biocompatibility, and low acquisition cost. After modification by a variety of physicochemical strategies, it can be applied as an alternative to basic industrial materials, including polyurethanes, phenolic, and epoxy resins, which stands comparably to conventional synthetic polymers in terms of both performance and reduced cost. To further unlock the potential of lignin, an alluring opportunity is the exploitation of lignin for high-value materials, especially nanomaterials, that find extensive applications in energy and environment areas. This review provides a systematic summary and perspective of research that has been devoted to lignin transformation to high-value materials, ranging from industrially well-established engineering materials to the recently emerged nanomaterials that were used for energy and environment applications. Latest cutting-edge innovations on lignin modification, controlled depolymerization, and assembly during the last five years are summarized. Structure-function relationships of lignin materials in terms of their specific applications are analyzed. Furthermore, challenges and future opportunities for lignin conversion to high-value materials are also provided. We wish this review will stimulate further advances in lignin based high-value materials, and promote “waste” into “wealth”.","Yu, Xiaona;Yang, Bin;Zhu, Wanbin;Deng, Tiansheng;Pu, Yunqiao;Ragauskas, Arthur;Wang, Hongliang",Journal,Industrial Crops and Products,2023-09-15,"Tickle College of Engineering;Institute of Coal Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences;Oak Ridge National Laboratory;Washington State University Tri-Cities;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville;China Agricultural University",Chemical modifications ;  Functional materials ;  Lignin ;  Nanomaterials
Improving Recommender Systems Through the Automation of Design Decisions,"Recommender systems developers are constantly faced with difficult design decisions. Additionally, the number of options that a recommender systems developer has to consider continually grows over time with new innovations. The machine learning community is in a similar situation and has come together to tackle the problem. They invented concepts and tools to make machine learning development both easier and faster. These developments are categorized as automated machine learning (AutoML). As a result, the AutoML community formed and continuously innovates new approaches. Inspired by AutoML, the recommender systems community has recently understood the need for automation and sparsely introduced AutoRecSys. The goal of AutoRecSys is not to replace recommender systems developers but to improve performance through the automation of design decisions. With AutoRecSys, recommender systems engineers do not have to focus on easy but time-consuming tasks and are free to pursue difficult engineering tasks instead. Additionally, AutoRecSys enables easier access to recommender systems for beginners as it reduces the amount of knowledge required to get started with the development of recommender systems. AutoRecSys, like AutoML, is still early in its development and does not yet cover the whole development pipeline. Additionally, it is not yet clear, under which circumstances AutoML approaches can be transferred to recommender systems. Our research intends to close this gap by improving AutoRecSys both with regard to the transfer of AutoML and novel approaches. Furthermore, we focus specifically on the development of novel automation approaches for data processing and training. We note that the realization of AutoRecSys is going to be a community effort. Our part in this effort is to research AutoRecSys fundamentals, build practical tools for the community, raise awareness of the advantages of automation, and catalyze AutoRecSys development.","Wegmeth, Lukas",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, RecSys 2023",2023-09-14,Universität Siegen,algorithm selection ;  automation ;  automl ;  autorecsys ;  optimization ;  recommender systems
In situ characterization techniques and methodologies for high-temperature electrochemistry,"High-temperature electrochemistry (HTE) plays an important role in basic industries, including metallurgy and energy and future frontier technologies such as deep space exploration and carbon neutralization. At present, traditional research methods based on ex situ, macroscale characterization, and theory analogy with room-temperature electrochemistry cannot meet the demands of researchers. In situ characterization techniques can monitor real-time information, which can establish a full spatiotemporal, multidimensional, cross-scale methodology with the support of theoretical calculations, numerical simulations, and so on. It is hence of urgency to summarize and outlook the in situ characterization techniques and analytical methods of HTE. This review focuses on the in situ characterization techniques in HTE and points to a future direction in order to construct a methodology for HTE research. We therefore call on more researchers to enter the field of HTE in order to drive HTE engineering to realize low-carbon, high efficiency, refinement, and intelligence.","Yuan, Rui;Jiao, Handong;Zhu, Hongmin;Fang, Daining;Jiao, Shuqiang",Journal,Chem,2023-09-14,University of Science and Technology Beijing;Beijing Institute of Technology;Tohoku University,"high-temperature electrochemistry ;  in situ study ;  methodology ;  SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure"
Electrochemical Wastewater Refining: A Vision for Circular Chemical Manufacturing,"Wastewater is an underleveraged resource; it contains pollutants that can be transformed into valuable high-purity products. Innovations in chemistry and chemical engineering will play critical roles in valorizing wastewater to remediate environmental pollution, provide equitable access to chemical resources and services, and secure critical materials from diminishing feedstock availability. This perspective envisions electrochemical wastewater refining─the use of electrochemical processes to tune and recover specific products from wastewaters─as the necessary framework to accelerate wastewater-based electrochemistry to widespread practice. We define and prescribe a use-informed approach that simultaneously serves specific wastewater-pollutant-product triads and uncovers a mechanistic understanding generalizable to broad use cases. We use this approach to evaluate research needs in specific case studies of electrocatalysis, stoichiometric electrochemical conversions, and electrochemical separations. Finally, we provide rationale and guidance for intentionally expanding the electrochemical wastewater refining product portfolio. Wastewater refining will require a coordinated effort from multiple expertise areas to meet the urgent need of extracting maximal value from complex, variable, diverse, and abundant wastewater resources.","Miller, Dean M.;Abels, Kristen;Guo, Jinyu;Williams, Kindle S.;Liu, Matthew J.;Tarpeh, William A.",Journal,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2023-09-13,Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering;Stanford Engineering,

A new tissue-agnostic microfluidic device to model physiology and disease: the lattice platform,"To accurately phenocopy human biology in vitro, researchers have been reducing their dependence on standard, static two-dimensional (2D) cultures and instead are moving towards three-dimensional (3D) and/or multicellular culture techniques. While these culture innovations are becoming more commonplace, there is a growing body of research that illustrates the benefits and even necessity of recapitulating the dynamic flow of nutrients, gas, waste exchange and tissue interactions that occur in vivo. However, cost and engineering complexity are two main factors that hinder the adoption of these technologies and incorporation into standard laboratory workflows. We developed LATTICE, a plug-and-play microfluidic platform able to house up to eight large tissue or organ models that can be cultured individually or in an interconnected fashion. The functionality of the platform to model both healthy and diseased tissue states was demonstrated using 3D cultures of reproductive tissues including murine ovarian tissues and human fallopian tube explants (hFTE). When exogenously exposed to pathological doses of gonadotropins and androgens to mimic the endocrinology of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), subsequent ovarian follicle development, hormone production and ovulation copied key features of this endocrinopathy. Further, hFTE cilia beating decreased significantly only when experiencing continuous media exchanges. We were then able to endogenously recreate this phenotype on the platform by dynamically co-culturing the PCOS ovary and hFTE. LATTICE was designed to be customizable with flexibility in 3D culture formats and can serve as a powerful automated tool to enable the study of tissue and cellular dynamics in health and disease in all fields of research.","Campo, Hannes;Zha, Didi;Pattarawat, Pawat;Colina, Jose;Zhang, Delong;Murphy, Alina;Yoon, Julia;Russo, Angela;Rogers, Hunter B.;Lee, Hoi Chang;Zhang, Jiyang;Trotter, Katy;Wagner, Sarah;Ingram, Asia;Pavone, Mary Ellen;Dunne, Sara Fernandez;Boots, Christina E.;Urbanek, Margrit;Xiao, Shuo;Burdette, Joanna E.;Woodruff, Teresa K.;Kim, J.

Unwavering excellence: How to be a competent cardiovascular doctor in “panvascular medicine +”,"It is essential to create a sustainable and all-encompassing panvascular ecosystem that integrates medical care, industry-academia research, prevention, and management, necessitating the in-depth participation of every cardiovascular doctor on their journey of unwavering excellence. “From doctors, by researchers/engineers, for patients” is the foundation of sustainable development in the “panvascular medicine +” ecosystem. Medical education can make knowledge tangible and serve as a conduit for inheritance and innovation. Prevention covers intelligent decision-making, primary prevention, and the popularization of knowledge. Furthermore, management is a potent tool for promoting development through overall coordination with social governance.

Chloroplast gene expression: Recent advances and perspectives,"Chloroplasts evolved from an ancient cyanobacterial endosymbiont more than 1.5 billion years ago. During subsequent coevolution with the nuclear genome, the chloroplast genome has remained independent, albeit strongly reduced, with its own transcriptional machinery and distinct features, such as chloroplast-specific innovations in gene expression and complicated post-transcriptional processing. Light activates the expression of chloroplast genes via mechanisms that optimize photosynthesis, minimize photodamage, and prioritize energy investments. Over the past few years, studies have moved from describing phases of chloroplast gene expression to exploring the underlying mechanisms. In this review, we focus on recent advances and emerging principles that govern chloroplast gene expression in land plants. We discuss engineering of pentatricopeptide repeat proteins and its biotechnological effects on chloroplast RNA research; new techniques for characterizing the molecular mechanisms of chloroplast gene expression; and important aspects of chloroplast gene expression for improving crop yield and stress tolerance. We also discuss biological and mechanistic questions that remain to be answered in the future.","Zhang, Yi;Tian, Lin;Lu, Congming",Journal,Plant Communications,2023-09-11,Shandong Agricultural University,chloroplast ;  chloroplast gene expression ;  post-transcriptional processing ;  transcription ;  translation
Thermoresponsive hydrogel artificial muscles,"Thermoresponsive hydrogels (TRHs) are intelligent materials that, when wet, show volumetric shape deformation in response to temperature change. In contrast to other stimuli-responsive hydrogels with slow deformation behavior, TRHs provide rapid displacement or movement when a hydrothermal stimulus is applied, thus enabling their effective usage as soft polymeric actuators or artificial muscles. The capability of dynamic macrostructural shape changes in axial, radial, and angular directions allows TRH artificial muscles to be advantageous for various state-of-the-art applications, including soft robotics, medical devices, sensors, and smart textiles. Herein, we discuss early-stage innovations and further advances of TRH artificial muscles from both fundamental materials science and engineering perspectives. We highlight the end-to-end fabrication methods, relevant actuating mechanisms, and performances, with an emphasis on their design flexibility to meet current bioengineered actuator needs. Finally, we investigate the enduring challenges and anticipate future research strategies that will provide a practically feasible soft actuator solution.","Zhang, Xi;Aziz, Shazed;Salahuddin, Bidita;Zhu, Zhonghua",Journal,Matter,2023-09-06,The University of Queensland,artificial muscles ;  biomedical devices ;  soft actuators ;  soft robotics ;  thermoresponsive hydrogel

Clever Nanomaterials Fabrication Techniques Encounter Sustainable C1 Catalysis,"Conspectus C1 catalysis, which refers to the conversion of molecules with a single carbon atom, such as CO, CO2, and CH4, into clean fuels and basic building blocks for chemical industries, has built a bridge between carbon resource utilization and valuable chemical supply. With respect to the goal of carbon neutrality, C1 catalysis also plays an essential role owing to its integrated functions in the green catalytic process with fewer CO2 emissions and even direct high-value-added utilization of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4). However, the inert nature of the C-O or C-H bond in C1 molecules as well as uncontrollable C-C coupling render C1 catalysis challenging. The rational design of highly active catalytic materials (denoted as C1 catalysts) with strong capacities for C-O or C-H bond activation and C-C coupling by convenient nanomaterials fabrication methods to boost the catalytic performance of C1 molecule conversion, including targeted product selectivity and long-term stability, is the cornerstone of C1 catalysis. Notably, the familiar concepts in heterogeneous catalysis, such as tandem catalysis and confinement catalysis, are applicable for C1 catalysis and have been successfully used to design a C1 catalyst. Regarding the tandem catalysis concept that integrates multiple reactions in a single-pass via a bi- or multifunctional catalyst, it is promising to shed new light on the oriented conversion of C1 molecules, especially for C2+ hydrocarbon or oxygenate synthesis. The confinement effect is powerful for controlling the product distribution and enhancing activation efficiency of inert chemical bonds in C1 catalysis due to the unique reactants/intermediate adsorption and evolution behaviors on the confined catalytic interface with a special electronic environment. Moreover, metal-support interactions (MSIs), electronic properties of the active site, and catalytic engineering issues are also susceptible to the C1 molecule conversion performance. Therefore, under the guidance of basic and novel rules in heterogeneous catalysis, the innovation of catalytic materials with the aid of advanced catalytic materials fabrication techniques has always been a hot research topic in C1 catalysis. In this Account, we briefly describe the challenges in thermal-catalytic C1 molecule (mainly CO, CO2, and CH4) conversion. At the same time, the synergistic functioning of the physicochemical properties of the catalytic materials on the performance in C1 molecule conversion is highlighted. More importantly, we summarize our progress in rationally designing tailor-made C1 catalysts to enhance C1 molecule activation efficiency and targeted product selectivity via powerful nanomaterials fabrication techniques, such as traditional wet-chemistry strategies, the magnetron sputtering method, and 3D printing technology. Specifically, the ingenious capsule catalyst and ammonia pools in zeolites fabricated by a wet chemistry process possess an extraordinary effect on the transformation of CO, CO2, and CH4 molecules. Also, the sputtering method is reliable in modulating the electronic properties of metallic active sites for C1 molecule conversion, thereby tailoring the final product selectivity. Furthermore, we showcase the strong capability of metal 3D printing technology in fabricating a self-catalytic reactor, by which the functions of the reaction field and nanoscale active sites are well integrated. Finally, we predict the future research opportunities in highly efficient C1 catalyst design with the assistance of clever nanomaterials fabrication techniques.","Wang, Yang;Sun, Jian;Tsubaki, Noritatsu",Journal,Accounts of Chemical Research,2023-09-05,China University of Petroleum (East China);University of Toyama;Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences,

Serious Games and Experiential Learning: Options for Engineering Education,"This research delves into the use of simulation games as a learning tool in logistics education, with a focus on the Logistics Simulator and Production Game Simulator. Through an analysis of these two cases, relevant findings were uncovered. Firstly, simulation games can recreate concrete experiences, allowing students to engage with challenging problems in a practical manner. In addition, simulation games offer a platform for experimentation with diverse scenarios, enabling students to hone their decision-making skills in a safe environment. Furthermore, the degree of motivation and engagement exhibited by students was found to be positively correlated with their experience gained through simulators. However, while the results obtained from the simulator were associated with student motivation and engagement, the study did not yield conclusive evidence in terms of student learning outcomes. The findings underscore the significance of employing strategies that enhance student motivation and support deep learning, thereby enabling students to apply and transfer knowledge to new situations. Notably, simulation games have great potential in logistics education as they facilitate faster and more enjoyable comprehension of key decision-making factors. Nevertheless, limitations of this study include the small sample size in both cases, which restricts generalizability, and the lack of consideration for sociodemographic factors in the baseline survey. Future research should address these limitations for more reliable findings on the specific needs of students in game-based and experiential learning contexts.","Pacheco-Velázquez, Ernesto;Salinas-Navarro, David Ernesto;Ramírez-Montoya, María Soledad",Journal,International Journal of Serious Games,2023-09-04,Aston Business School;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Engineering Education ;  Experiential Learning ;  Higher Education ;  Serious Games
"Innovations, technologies, and management practices for sustainable rice production","One of the major barriers to improving the rice value chain in Asian countries is farmers' lack of knowledge and their limited access to good and scale-appropriate technologies and practices. This chapter reviews the main features, benefits, and potential barriers of technologies and practices developed and promoted under the CORIGAP project. These include One-Must-Do, Five-Reductions (1M5R); ecologically-based pest management; laser land leveling; mechanized crop establishment; and sustainable postharvest management practices. 1M5R (1M = certified Seed, 5R = reductions of seed rate, fertilizer, pesticides, water use, and postharvest losses) was introduced in Vietnam in 2004 and adopted on about 150,000 ha of rice production in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) of Vietnam. Ecologically based pest management is important for the sustainable production of rice. We provide an overview of CORIGAP research on eco-engineering for the management of insect pests and the continued development of ecologically-based rodent management. Laser land leveling and mechanized crop establishment help to significantly increase agronomic use efficiency. Applying LLL, combined with best management practices in rice production in Thailand (CROP), has improved farmers' net income, increased nitrogen use efficiency, and reduced pesticide usage. Best postharvest management practices play an important role in upgrading the rice value chain tailored to sustainability. The chapter also includes lessons learned from case studies conducted in Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand.","Nguyen-Van-Hung, ;Gummert, Martin;Flor, Rica Joy;Ouk, Akhara;Keo, Makarakpakphea;Hadi, Buyung;Tho, Kim Eang;Then, Rathmuny;Choun, Saban;Hieu, Pham Thi Minh;Sattler, Cornelia;Connor, Melanie;Sudarmaji, ;Htwe, Nyo Me;Sandro, Joseph M.;Balingbing, Carlito;Singleton, Grant Robert",Book,"Closing Rice Yield Gaps in Asia: Innovations, Scaling, and Policies for Environmentally Sustainable Lowland Rice Production",2023-09-02,Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional;Julius Kühn-Institut - Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants;Royal University of Agriculture Cambodia;International Rice Research Institute;Northern Arizona University;Macquarie University;Natural Resources Institute;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries;International Rice Research Institute;Forestry and Fisheries;International Rice Research Institute;International Rice Research Institute,1Must Do ;  5Reductions (1M5R) ;  Contract farming ;  Harvest and postharvest management ;  Mechanization ;  Pest management
Green supply chain with technological innovation and partner selection decision,"Green technology is the key to improving the competitiveness of green supply chain, and it also has an important impact on the decision-making of green supply chain members to choose partners. Based on the two important factors that were green technology innovation and technology sharing, the non-cooperative-cooperative biform game model was used to analyze the green technology innovation and the partner selection of a two-level green supply chain composed of one supplier and three manufacturers. In the cooperative game stage, the clique solution was used to allocate the benefits to the members of the green supply chain. In the non-cooperative game stage, the optimal decision of green technology sharing or innovation among the members of the green supply chain was obtained, and a pure strategy Nash equilibrium was got. The research results showed that: without considering the green technology innovation of the manufacturers, the supplier preferred to choose predominant manufacturers as the partner; further, the supplier would choose technology sharing only when the cost of sharing was low. On the other hand, when considering the green technology innovation of the manufacturers, predominant manufacturers still had greater advantages, while relatively weak manufacturers could only be selected as the partner when the benefits of green technology innovation are higher than those of predominant manufacturers. The conclusions promoted to show the internal mechanism of green supply chain partner selection, and had certain theoretical and practical significance for the management practice of green supply chain.","Duan, Lian;Yuan, Liuyang",Journal,"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong/Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, CIMS",2023-09-01,Wuhan University of Science and Technology,biform game ;  clique solution ;  green supply chain ;  green technology innovation

Model-based trade-off curves to support the set-based concurrent engineering of highly innovative projects,"The literature acknowledges the advantages of Set-Based Concurrent Engineering (SBCE), but there is a lack of models for its adoption and documented cases of its implementation, mostly on products with consolidated technology, which raises the possibility of expanding SBCE for highly innovative products. These projects often have extensive resource limitations, leading to computational tools and mathematical modelling as fundamental sources of information. This paper proposes a method for model-based Trade-off Curves (ToC) generation to support SBCE. We adopted it to develop a magnetic air conditioner. The use of model-based ToC enabled the narrowing of the design space and monitoring of the design parameters and performance metrics and enabled SBCE adoption in the design process. The main contributions of this research are presenting the state-of-the-art in ToC generation and application, proposing the model, and demonstrating SBCE in highly innovative projects, while its importance lies in the opportunity to further disseminate SBCE to different development environments.","Silvestre De Oliveira, Mayara;Fidelis Peixer, Guilherme;Forcellini, Fernando Antônio;Riso Barbosa, Jader;Lozano Cadena, Jaime Andrés",Journal,Concurrent Engineering Research and Applications,2023-09-01,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,computational simulation ;  innovation ;  lean product development ;  machine learning ;  mathematical modelling ;  set based concurrent engineering ;  trade-off curves

Wafer-scale epitaxy of transition-metal dichalcogenides with continuous single-crystallinity and engineered defect density,"Research on electronic channel materials has traditionally focused on bulk and nanocrystals, nanowires, and nanotubes. However, the recent surge of interest in two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has emerged as a game-changer in this field. The atomically thin structure of 2D TMDs offers unique electronic and optical properties, which have been shown to have significant potential in various applications, such as optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and spintronics. Epitaxy growth of single-crystal 2D TMDs on oxide or metallic substrates has opened up new opportunities for direct integration into existing manufacturing pathways. In this article, we discuss recent advances in achieving continuous single-crystallinity of 2D TMDs on oxide and metallic substrates by controlling the nucleation and growth rate of crystalline domains. We also review strategies for the controlled introduction of defects through postgrowth processing and substrate engineering. Finally, we highlight emerging strategies, new opportunities, and remaining challenges for bridging the gap between lab innovations and commercialization. The ability to grow high-quality 2D TMDs on scalable and industry-compatible substrates represents a significant breakthrough in the field of electronic materials and has the potential to revolutionize the semiconductor industry. Despite the remaining challenges, the future of 2D TMDs looks promising. Their integration into existing manufacturing pathways could open up new avenues for advanced electronic devices with improved performance and reduced power consumption.

Land-Use Assessment and Trend Simulation from a Resilient Urban Perspective: A Case Study of Changsha City,"As the challenges of globalization and climate change intensify, the importance of urban resilience in city planning is becoming increasingly evident. To adapt to this trend, innovations and improvements are essential in traditional urban land-use patterns to better fulfill the requirements of resilient urban development. In this context, this study constructs an urban resilience evaluation index system from four perspectives: social resilience, engineering resilience, ecological resilience, and security resilience to evaluate the urban resilience of Changsha City. A thorough assessment of the resilience mechanisms in Changsha’s urban layout was conducted, employing the SD-FLUS model. A resilient urban scenario is also established to restrict the conversion of high-resilience land into other land types and to predict urban land-use structures under a resilience-oriented directive. The findings indicate that areas with high ecological and safety resilience in Changsha are primarily located in the western Weishan mountain system, along with eastern mountain systems like Jiuling, Lianyun, and Mufu, forming the “green veins”. The central areas are characterized by “blue veins”, mainly represented by rivers such as the Xiangjiang, Weishui, Longwanggang, Jinjiang, Liuyang, and Laodao. Within the central urban area, high-resilience regions are primarily distributed along a framework consisting of “one ring (the city’s three-ring line), two mains (Xiangjiang and Liuyang rivers), one heart (urban green core), and six wedges”, specifying various green corridors. Under the resilience-oriented scenario, the model predicts that by 2025, the total built-up area in Changsha will be 1416.79 km². Areas with high social and engineering resilience are mainly concentrated in the central urban areas of Changsha, as well as Ningxiang and Liuyang, aligning closely with the objectives of Changsha’s latest round of national spatial planning. The built-up area layout should complement Changsha’s topography and water systems, expanding in a wedge-like manner. Overall, Changsha’s planning has successfully integrated social, engineering, ecological, and safety resilience, enhancing its adaptability and long-term sustainability.

The Evolutionary Characteristics and Interaction of Interdisciplinarity and Scientific Collaboration under the Convergence Paradigm: Analysis in the Field of Materials Genome Engineering,"Convergence has been proposed as a revolutionary innovation paradigm that advocates the integration of multidisciplinary knowledge through collaboration to solve complex real-world challenges. From a knowledge perspective, this study examined the evolutionary characteristics and interactions between interdisciplinarity and scientific collaboration in the context of the convergence paradigm using complex networks and bibliometric methods for publications (n = 35,227) in the materials genome engineering (MGE) field in China from 2000 to 2021. The findings are as follows: (1) Under the convergence paradigm, knowledge from five core disciplines forms the skeleton of the multidisciplinary knowledge system in the MGE field. The goal of interdisciplinarity gradually evolves from theoretical exploration to applied research, and the knowledge from various disciplines is increasingly integrated. (2) The development of the scientific collaboration network has gone through three phases: 2000–2009, 2005–2014, and 2015–2021, and its core-periphery structure has been gradually optimized. (3) The evolution of interdisciplinarity is nearly synchronized with the evolution of the scientific collaboration network. (4) The promotion of interdisciplinarity through collaboration is becoming increasingly evident. The proportion of interdisciplinary partnerships increased from 0.66 to 0.87, with the proportion of partnerships involving more than two disciplines increasing from 0.24 to 0.59. (5) Institutions from core and periphery disciplines have diverse partner selection preferences, and disciplinary characteristics related to knowledge similarity and complementarity are important factors influencing scientific collaboration behavior. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the convergence paradigm and provides insights for better incubating convergence research projects and advancing top-down innovation management in convergence fields.","Li, Jing;Yu, Qian",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-09-01,Wuhan University of Technology,co-evolve ;  convergence paradigm ;  interaction ;  interdisciplinary ;  materials genome engineering ;  scientific collaboration
The Safe Load-Bearing Capacity of Railway Tunnel Linings under High-Pressure and Water-Rich Conditions,"High water pressure has been identified as the direct cause of water seepage problems in tunnels. Consequently, it is imperative to ascertain the safety load-bearing limits of tunnel linings in high-pressure, water-rich strata. In this study, FLAC3D (V5.0) numerical simulation software was employed to establish seepage models of tunnels under high-pressure, water-rich conditions, taking an actual engineering project as a reference. The hydrostatic pressure on tunnel linings under various conditions, including different permeability coefficients of the surrounding rock, grouting rings, levels of the water table, and coordinates of lining positions, was computed. By extracting the results of these simulations, correlations between lining water pressure and various parameters were analyzed, and preliminary hydrostatic pressure calculation formulas were deduced. Through regression analysis using SPSS (19.0) software, a general calculation formula for lining water pressure was derived. Given similar surrounding rock conditions, it was revealed that railway tunnel lining types adhere to a universal standard. The calculation formula for lining water pressure, when integrated with lithostatic pressure in the seepage model, facilitates the computation of the maximum pressure head that the tunnel lining can withstand under different conditions. A tabulation summarizing safe water head heights under various conditions is also presented, which enables rapid consultation of the safe load-bearing range of tunnel lining under corresponding conditions. This study provides a new calculation method for the lining water pressure of a water-rich railway tunnel, filling the literature gap. The safe tunnel head query table provides a new research approach for the design of water-rich tunnels. The research method in this article is rare in the literature, and the research approach has obvious innovations. The findings of this study have the potential to provide a theoretical foundation and data reference for the structural design of tunnel linings and the remediation of related issues.","Ma, Yanna;Wang, Zhenyu;Wang, Dan",Journal,Buildings,2023-09-01,Hunan University of Finance and Economics,high-pressure ;  lining water pressure calculation formula ;  safe load-bearing capacity of lining ;  safe water head of tunnel lining ;  water-rich railway tunnels

The development，application，and future of LLM similar to ChatGPT,Generative artificial intelligence（AI）technology has achieved remarkable breakthroughs and advances in its intelligence level since the release of ChatGPT several months ago，especially in terms of its scope，automation，and intelligence. The rising popularity of generative AI attracts capital inflows and promotes the innovation of various fields. Moreover，governments worldwide pay considerable attention to generative AI and hold different attitudes toward it. The US government maintains a relatively relaxed attitude to stay ahead in the global technological arena，while European countries are conservative and are concerned about data privacy in large language models（LLMs）. The Chinese government attaches great importance to AI and LLMs but also emphasizes the regulatory issues. With the growing influence of ChatGPT and its competitors and the rapid development of generative AI technology，conducting a deep analysis of them becomes necessary. This paper first provides an in-depth analysis of the development，application，and prospects of generative AI. Various types of LLMs have emerged as a series of remarkable technological products that have demonstrated versatile capabilities across multiple domains，such as education，medicine，finance，law，programming，and paper writing. These models are usually fine-tuned on the basis of general LLMs，with the aim of endowing the large models with additional domain-specific knowledge and enhanced adaptability to a specific domain. LLMs（e. g. ，GPT-4）have achieved rapid improvements in the past few months in terms of professional knowledge，reasoning，coding，credibility，security，transferability，and multimodality. Then，the technical contribution of generative AI technology is briefly introduced from four aspects：1）we review the related work on LLMs，such as GPT-4，PaLM2，ERNIE Bot，and their construction pipeline，which involves the training of base and assistant models. The base models store a large amount of linguistic knowledge，while the assistant models acquire stronger comprehension and generation capabilities after a series of fine-tuning. 2）We outline a series of public LLMs based on LLaMA，a framework for building lightweight and memory-efficient LLMs，including Alpaca，Vicuna，Koala，and Baize，as well as the key technologies for building LLMs with low memory and computation requirements，consisting of low-rank adaptation，Self-instruct，and automatic prompt engineer. 3）We summarize three types of existing mainstream image–text multimodal techniques：training additional adaptation layers to align visual modules and language models，multimodal instruction fine-tuning，and LLM serving as the center of understanding. 4）We introduce three types of LLM evaluation benchmarks based on different implementation methods，namely，manual evaluation，automatic evaluation，and LLM evaluation. Parameter optimization and fine-tuning dataset construction are crucial for the popularization and innovation of generative AI products because they can significantly reduce the training cost and computational resource consumption of LLMs while enhancing the diversity and generalization ability of LLMs. Multimodal capability is the future trend of generative AI because multimodal models have the ability to integrate information from multiple perceptual dimensions，which is consistent with human cognition. Evaluation benchmarks are the key methods to compare and constrain the models of generative AI，given that they can efficiently measure and optimize the performance and generalization ability of LLMs and reveal their strengths and limitations. In conclusion，improving parameter optimization，high-quality dataset construction，multimodal，and other technologies and establishing a unified，comprehensive，and convenient evaluation benchmark will be the key to achieving further development in generative AI. Furthermore，the current challenges and possible future directions of the related technologies are discussed in this paper. Existing generative AI products have considerable creativity，understanding，and intelligence and have shown broad application prospects in various fields，such as empowering content creation，innovating interactive experience，creating“digital life，”serving as smart home and family assistants，and realizing autonomous driving and intelligent car interaction. However，LLMs still exhibit some limitations，such as lack of high-quality training data，susceptibility to hallucinations，output factual errors，uninterpretability，high training and deployment costs，and security and privacy issues. Therefore，the potential research directions can be divided into three aspects：1）the data aspect focuses on the input and output of LLMs，including the construction of general tuning instruction datasets and domain-specific knowledge datasets. 2）The technical aspect improves the internal structure and function of LLMs，including the training，multimodality，principle innovation，and structure pruning of LLMs. 3）The application aspect enhances the practical effect and application value of LLMs，including security enhancement，evaluation system development，and LLM application engineering implementation. The advancement of generative AI has provided remarkable benefits for economic development. However，it also entails new opportunities and challenges for various stakeholders，especially the industry and the general public. On the one hand，the industry needs to foster a large pool of researchers who can conduct systematic and cutting-edge research on generative AI technologies，which are constantly improving and innovating. On the other hand，the general public needs to acquire and apply the skills of prompt engineering，which can enable them to utilize existing LLMs effectively and efficiently.,"Yan, Hao;Liu, Yuliang;Jin, Lianwen;Bai, Xiang",Journal,Journal of Image and Graphics,2023-09-01,Huazhong University of Science and Technology;South China University of Technology,artificial intelligence（AI） ;  ChatGPT ;  large language model （LLM） ;  multi-modality ;  natural language processing
Leveraging large language models to monitor climate technology innovation,"To achieve net-zero emissions, public policy needs to foster rapid innovation of climate technologies. However, there is a scarcity of comprehensive and up-to-date evidence to guide policymaking by monitoring climate innovation systems. This is notable, especially at the center of the innovation process, where nascent inventions transition into profitable and scalable market solutions. Here, we discuss the potential of large language models (LLMs) to monitor climate technology innovation. By analyzing large pools of unstructured text data sources, such as company reports and social media, LLMs can automate information retrieval processes and thereby improve existing monitoring in terms of cost-effectiveness, timeliness, and comprehensiveness. In this perspective, we show how LLMs can play a crucial role in informing innovation policy for the energy transition by highlighting promising use cases and prevailing challenges for research and policy.","Toetzke, Malte;Probst, Benedict;Feuerriegel, Stefan",Journal,Environmental Research Letters,2023-09-01,"Munich Center for Machine Learning;Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance;ETH Zürich",climate technologies ;  innovation ;  large language models ;  machine learning
Artificial Intelligence and Carbon Emissions in Manufacturing Firms: The Moderating Role of Green Innovation,"Carbon emissions have gained worldwide attention in the industrial era. As a key carbon-emitting industry, achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the manufacturing sector is vital to mitigating the negative effects of climate change and achieving sustainable development. The rise of intelligent technologies has driven industrial structural transformations that may help achieve carbon reduction. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is an important part of digitalization, providing new technological tools and directions for the low carbon development of enterprises. This study selects Chinese A-share listed companies in the manufacturing industry from 2012 to 2021 as the research objects and uses a fixed-effects regression model to study the relationship between AI and carbon emissions. This study clarifies the significance of enterprise AI technology applications in realizing carbon emissions reduction and explores the regulatory mechanism from the perspective of the innovation effect. The results show that the application of enterprise AI technology positively impacts carbon emissions reduction. Simultaneously, green technological innovation, green management innovation, and green product innovation play moderating roles; in other words, enterprise green innovation strengthens the effect of AI on carbon emissions reduction. This study clarifies the necessity of intelligent manufacturing and enriches theories related to AI technology and carbon emissions.","Chen, Yixuan;Jin, Shanyue",Journal,Processes,2023-09-01,Gachon University,artificial intelligence ;  carbon emissions ;  green management innovation ;  green product innovation ;  green technology innovation
3D Filaments Based on Polyhydroxy Butyrate—Micronized Bacterial Cellulose for Tissue Engineering Applications,"In this work, scaffolds based on poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and micronized bacterial cellulose (BC) were produced through 3D printing. Filaments for the printing were obtained by varying the percentage of micronized BC (0.25, 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00%) inserted in relation to the PHB matrix. Despite the varying concentrations of BC, the biocomposite filaments predominantly contained PHB functional groups, as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) demonstrated. Thermogravimetric analyses (i.e., TG and DTG) of the filaments showed that the peak temperature (Tpeak) of PHB degradation decreased as the concentration of BC increased, with the lowest being 248 °C, referring to the biocomposite filament PHB/2.0% BC, which has the highest concentration of BC. Although there was a variation in the thermal behavior of the filaments, it was not significant enough to make printing impossible, considering that the PHB melting temperature was 170 °C. Biological assays indicated the non-cytotoxicity of scaffolds and the provision of cell anchorage sites. The results obtained in this research open up new paths for the application of this innovation in tissue engineering.","Celestino, Matheus F.;Lima, Lais R.;Fontes, Marina;Batista, Igor T.S.;Mulinari, Daniella R.;Dametto, Alessandra;Rattes, Raphael A.;Amaral, André C.;Assunção, Rosana M.N.;Ribeiro, Clovis A.;Castro, Guillermo R.;Barud, Hernane S.",Journal,Journal of Functional Biomaterials,2023-09-01,"Universidade Federal de Uberlândia;Universidade de São Paulo;Centro Universitario de Araraquara;Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho"";Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro;Universidade Federal do ABC;Biosmart Nanotechnology Ltda",3D printing ;  micronized bacterial cellulose ;  poly(hydroxybutyrate) ;  scaffolds ;  tissue engineering
Edible and Medicinal Macrofungi,"Macrofungi are well known as mushrooms, which belong mostly to Basidiomycota with a few from Ascomycota, and up to now, around 40,000 species have been described. In people’s lives, macrofungi are closely related to our economic activities, especially for food and medicine. “One meat, one vegetable and one mushroom” has become a healthy and fashionable dietary structure, and the global edible mushroom production and cultivating area are steadily rising. On the other hand, a large number of mushroom species and new active components have been found, and have become one of the driving forces of innovation of drugs and health products, especially with the development of biochemistry, enzyme engineering, and genetic engineering. Thus, macrofungi in food, medicine, and other aspects have shown a broad prospect. In this Special Issue, research on new species and related molecular phylogenies, mechanisms of hyphae polar growing and basidiocarp formation, biochemistry of edible and medical mushrooms, and some important scientific questions related to the edible mushroom industry are presented, which also reflect the hot areas of common concern on edible and medicinal fungi.","Zhao, Rui Lin",Journal,Journal of Fungi,2023-09-01,Institute of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences,biochemistry ;  cultivation ;  mushroom ;  phylogeny ;  physiology
Synergy Management of a Complex Industrial Production System from the Perspective of Flow Structure,"Modern industry has become very complex and requires an equally complex engineering technology system, which includes resource utilization, energy conversion, product research and development, technological innovation, environmental protection and industrial ecology, and other aspects of the system. Continued development of large-scale, streamlined, and continuous processes is critical; however, there are also problems such as data redundancy, overcapacity, redundant construction, and waste of resources. Based on the system synergy theory, this paper introduces the system analysis method from the perspective of flow structure, with the purpose of solving the management defects of complex industrial production systems. First, we analyze the complex industrial production system as a collaborative structure of three subsystems: material flow, energy flow, and information flow. The following concepts are clarified: “material flow is the main body, energy flow is attached to and drives material flow, material flow and energy flow generate information flow, and information flow reversely drives material flow and energy flow”. Secondly, the collaborative evolution process of the complex industrial production system is divided into three periods, which are the generation period, the stalemate period, and the maturity period, and a synergy degree evaluation model is established, which considers the Theil index and subsystem gray correlation method, and extends the dynamic differential equation model of three-stage collaborative evolution. Subsequently, we used MATLAB numerical simulation to demonstrate that the collaborative evolution of production systems is related to four aspects. They are the self-organizing ability of the system, the dominant role of order parameters, the competition and cooperation between order parameters, and whether mutations can become order parameters. At the same time, it was also found that it is basically independent of other factors, such as attenuation inertia. Then, the self-organizing map network (SOM) algorithm was used for the rapid identification of mutation data. Finally, we use the empirical research of SG enterprises to show that their production level and management system are advanced, but they were in a non-cooperative state from 2014 to 2021. In 2022, they had the basic conditions and trends to enter the synergistic generation period, and a synergistic management model is required. At the end of the article, we give a collaborative management method for complex industrial enterprises with a good management foundation. These include the management mechanism based on flow structure collaboration and the management path based on collaborative evolution. Of course, the management countermeasures given in this study are also applicable to other complex process-based industrial enterprises.","Song, Jiekun;He, Zeguo;Jiang, Lina;Liu, Zhicheng;Leng, Xueli",Journal,Systems,2023-09-01,China University of Petroleum (East China),collaborative management ;  flow structure ;  industrial production system ;  synergy theory ;  system dynamics

"Analysing the current status, hotspots, and future trends of technology management: Using the WoS and scopus database","This study presents a comprehensive overview of the development process and the latest trends in technology management (TM), laying a robust foundation for further advancements in this domain. To achieve this, we analysed 1944 TM articles from the Web of Science database and 2642 articles from Scopus, spanning the last 20 years. Employing methodologies that involve scientific knowledge graphs and bibliometrics, we analysed diverse aspects such as changes in the annual publication of articles; geographical distribution among countries, institutions, disciplines, and authors; keyword co-occurrence and clusters; and timezone view. Our findings reveal a significant surge in TM's growth in recent years, showcasing its highly promising potential. The USA is the frontrunner in contributing to TM research, followed by China and the UK. TM research is relatively concentrated in the UK, while it appears more dispersed in China. The University of Cambridge had the highest volume of research, and the disciplines of Business, Management, Engineering, and Computer Science occupied the top spots. As TM evolves, a possible challenge could be the emergence of new authoritative authors. Second, TM's vibrant landscape is characterised by hotspots such as innovation, technology strategy, technology acquisition, technology application, technology standards, and sustainable development. Among these, information and medical technologies stand out as the most frequently referenced technologies. Third, the trends in TM are as follows: innovation is subdivided into technological innovation and open innovation, bibliometric analysis and patent analysis have become pivotal methods for knowledge management, the scope of TM has expanded from internal organisational processes to encompass external aspects, and TM is gradually evolving into a mature science, with its focus transitioning from macro to micro and becoming more profound and detailed. Last, Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence, big data, and the IoT represent the latest frontier technologies in the realm of TM.","Yubo, Shi;Ramayah, T.;Hongmei, Luo;Yifan, Zhang;Wenhui, Wang",Journal,Heliyon,2023-09-01,"Guizhou University of Commerce;Azman Hashim International Business School;Fakultas Ekonomi dan Bisnis, Universitas Indonesia;Chandigarh University;Sunway University;Daffodil International University;Universiti Malaysia Sarawak;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Universiti Sains Malaysia",Bibliometric ;  CiteSpace ;  Innovation ;  Scientific knowledge graph ;  Technological innovation ;  Technology management
Reflective and Cooperative Learning for Understanding Sustainability through an Eco-Innovation Strategy in Rural Travel and Hospitality: A STEAM Case Study,"Eco-innovation denotes developing green practices using environmentally friendly innovative approaches or technologies. Although eco-innovation has been broadly applied in different industries, such as low-carbon production and manufacturing, how to implement such innovation in education for sustainable development (ESD) has rarely been studied. Therefore, this research considered a reflective and cooperative learning approach to science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) education. A case study examined Wanluan Township of Pingtung County in southern Taiwan. Four departments’ students and lecturers at Meiho University were involved in situated learning. Hospitality management students played farm owners who engaged in organic agriculture to produce food and beverages. These agricultural products were farm-to-table, cooked, and served to customers in a natural dining setting through the students’ teamwork. Tourism, sports and leisure management, and food science and nutrition students played tourists in a self-guided travel context, who engaged in acts such as visiting buildings to understand heritage while observing that the houses were still in use as dwellings. This encouraged reflection on the importance of cultural preservation. The results showed that eco-innovation can represent a sustainable marketing strategy for improving the local community economy and can be implemented in a practical situation in STEAM. The ESD goal for 2030—societal transformation—is to foster students’ responsible behavior and attitudes in a personally authentic manner, thereby fostering sustainable learning and understanding.","Hung, Chin Lien;Yu, Tien Fu;Lin, Yun Hui;Lin, Yi Chien;Chen, Yi Hsuan;Lo, Wei Shuo",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-09-01,Meiho University,environment protection ;  environmental psychology ;  reflexive process ;  responsible behavior ;  rural community ;  rural tourism ;  sustainability learning ;  sustainable development education ;  sustainable tourism and hospitality ;  travel experience
Product Styling Cognition Based on Kansei Engineering Theory and Implicit Measurement,"Effective product styling designs must increasingly address users’ emotional requirements. This study introduces a product styling design method combining electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking for multimodal measurement based on the Kansei engineering theory. The feasibility of determining a target image using a similarity calculation model is verified. An experimental paradigm based on implicit measures is presented for product styling cognition research. This paradigm involves determining the target image, sample selection, target image matching experiments, and product styling cognition experiments. Based on the combined EEG and eye-tracking measurements, insights into product-form cognition are deduced to provide a scientific basis for product-form innovation design. Notably, variations in event-related potential during user cognition of product styling are more evident in the product-styling perception phase than in the evaluation phase. In the styling perception phase, samples with “high match” with the target image elicit more pronounced EEG responses than those with “low match”. These findings demonstrate the viability of understanding product-form cognition through multimodal implicit measurements, addressing issues such as the pronounced subjectivity inherent in traditional methods. Furthermore, this approach provides a pioneering technique for Kansei engineering research and offers a methodology for multimodal implicit measurements of product innovation design.","Zhang, Qinwei;Liu, Zhifeng;Yang, Bangqi;Wang, Caixia",Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2023-09-01,North Minzu University;Guizhou University;Hefei University of Technology,electroencephalogram ;  emotional design ;  event-related potential ;  eye tracking ;  implicit measurement ;  industrial design ;  Kansei engineering ;  styling design
Biosorption of Pb(II) Using Natural and Treated Ardisia compressa K. Leaves: Simulation Framework Extended through the Application of Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm,"This study explored the effects of solution pH, biosorbent dose, contact time, and temperature on the Pb(II) biosorption process of natural and chemically treated leaves of A. compressa K. (Raw-AC and AC-OH, respectively). The results show that the surface characteristics of Raw-AC changed following alkali treatment. FT-IR analysis showed the presence of various functional groups on the surface of the biosorbent, which were binding sites for the Pb(II) biosorption. The nonlinear pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to be the best fitted to the experimental kinetic data. Adsorption equilibrium data at pH = 2–6, biosorbents dose from 5 to 20 mg/L, and temperature from 300.15 to 333.15 K were adjusted to the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm models. The results show that the adsorption capacity was enhanced with the increase in the solution pH and diminished with the increase in the temperature and biosorbent dose. It was also found that AC-OH is more effective than Raw-AC in removing Pb(II) from aqueous solutions. This was also confirmed using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms, where it was demonstrated that the improvement was around 57.7%. The nonlinear Langmuir isotherm model was the best fitted, and the maximum adsorption capacities of Raw-AC and AC-OH were 96 mg/g and 170 mg/g, respectively. The removal efficiency of Pb(II) was maintained approximately after three adsorption and desorption cycles using 0.5 M HCl as an eluent. This research delved into the impact of solution pH, biosorbent characteristics, and operational parameters on Pb(II) biosorption, offering valuable insights for engineering education by illustrating the practical application of fundamental chemical and kinetic principles to enhance the design and optimization of sustainable water treatment systems.","Vázquez-Sánchez, Alma Y.;Lima, Eder C.;Abatal, Mohamed;Tariq, Rasikh;Santiago, Arlette A.;Alfonso, Ismeli;Aguilar, Claudia;Vazquez-Olmos, América R.",Journal,Molecules,2023-09-01,UNAM Campus Morelia;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul;Instituto de Investigaciones en Materiales;Universidad Autónoma del Carmen;Universidad Tecnológica de Xicotepec de Juárez,Ardisia compressaK ;  artificial neural network ;  biosorption ;  educational Innovation ;  heavy metals
Studying financial aspect of green credit and regional heterogeneity on technology innovation in China,"This study examines the impact of green credit on digital technology innovation in China, focusing on the influence of financialization and regional heterogeneity. Existing research primarily explores factors like government subsidies, economic growth, and environmental regulations, and there is a lack of critical analysis on the influence of green credit on digital technology innovations. To examine the internal mechanisms linking green credit to digital technology innovation, this study uses panel data from 271 Chinese prefecture-level cities from 2000 to 2020. Our findings suggest that the availability of green credit and the level of financialization have a significant positive effect on technology innovation, particularly in regions with higher economic development. However, we also find that the impact of green credit and financialization on technology innovation varies across different regions of China. Study findings reveal that green credit bolsters both the quantity and quality of digital technology innovation, emerging as a significant driver for green innovations in China. This conclusion holds even after endogeneity tests. The heterogeneous analysis highlights that various aspects of green credit, such as coverage scope, usage intensity, and digitization level, can enhance digital technology innovations. Western cities demonstrate the most considerable positive effects, followed by central cities, while the weakest impact occurs in eastern cities. Green credit primarily promotes digital technology innovation indirectly by alleviating financing constraints. These empirical findings provide valuable policy insights for fostering a harmonious relationship between China’s urban green credit facilities and green financial growth, thereby addressing the funding limitations green credit enterprises face.","Wu, Ke;Wang, Xinxiu",Journal,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2023-09-01,Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics;Sanjiang University,China ;  Financial management ;  Green credit ;  Green financing ;  Green technology
Operational and engineering experiences of gas injection to JET for TT and DT operational campaigns,"Following the first deuterium-tritium experiment (DTE1) at UKAEA, modifications were investigated to the Joint European Torus’ (JET) gas introduction (GI) systems to increase the gas feed capabilities of the JET facility to better support future campaigns. The GI systems comprise the GI and gas distribution system in the Active Gas Handling System (AGHS), and neutral beam injection and the tritium injection modules on the torus. During DTE1 about 100 g of tritium was supplied from AGHS to JET users. During the second deuterium-tritium experiment (DTE2) and the tritium-tritium experiment (TT) just over 373 g and 630 g of tritium respectively was supplied to JET users for the campaigns. The tritium and deuterium gas supply systems of the fuel cycle can be underestimated as having fewer technical or scientific challenges based on the mechanical simplicity of equipment that they consist of. However, operational experience has shown these systems have the potential to bottleneck a campaign programme. This publication outlines the upgrade requirements foreseen, following DTE1, for operations in the DTE2 and TT campaigns, how these changes impacted the gas supply operations, and where limitations were encountered. The areas discussed include—challenges of upgrading and maintaining equipment designed for a short operating life; the impact of having differences between user requirements and gas supply capabilities; the logistics of gas supply involving multiple control room locations; communication routes between gas supply systems and teams; and safely controlling and tracking tritium gas movements. The latest JET tritium campaigns highlighted a number of challenges for future facilities looking to operate in both batch and continuous gas injection operational modes. The recommendations from this publication intend to provide a starting point for how to address these challenges and optimise gas supply in support of future fusion programmes.

How does research and development (R&D) strategy shift by adopting imaginary future generations? – Insights from future design practice in a water engineering company,"Conducting deliberation experiments involving the employees of a water engineering company, this study examined the effects that the adoption of “imaginary future generations (IFGs),” an innovative approach to overcome intergenerational conflict by generating futurability, had on the design of a vision for business strategy in 2050 and a policy for a research and development (R&D) strategy. Analysis was conducted using text mining of speech data recordings of participants’ discussions. Data from questionnaire surveys administrated to all participants were also analyzed to examine possible changes in their perceptions about criteria for designing R&D strategies. The results of the text mining revealed that by adopting IFGs, the speculative state of future society and business development as of 2050 and R&D strategies were changed from when envisioning from the perspective of current generations. The results of the questionnaire survey showed that items of criteria for designing R&D strategies, such as “client needs,” “differentiation from industry competitors,” “cost,” and “business models,” which had been emphasized when examined from the current generations’ perspective as important indicators, decreased in importance by adopting IFGs. We conclude that the adoption of IFGs could shift R&D strategy and induce new directions of technological innovations from the viewpoint of futurability.","Hara, Keishiro;Kuroda, Masashi;Nomaguchi, Yutaka",Journal,Futures,2023-09-01,Tokoha University;Osaka University,Futurability ;  Imaginary future generations ;  Industrial sector ;  Research and development (R&D) ;  Technological innovation
Consumers' affective needs matter: Open innovation through mining luxury hotels' online reviews,"Extant research on hotel open innovation rarely explores innovative ideas from customer-generated online reviews and pays little attention to consumers' affective needs. To bridge these gaps, this study aims to identify service innovation opportunities by mining online reviews from the perspective of customers' affective needs. Specifically, we adopt Kansei Engineering, an effective tool for extracting users' affective needs, to develop the research framework. The opportunity algorithm is also introduced to quantify the innovation opportunity levels of different service attributes. By analyzing 317,518 online reviews of luxury hotels crawled from Ctrip.com, we find that the service attributes with high innovation opportunity levels include Cleanliness, Facility, and Room attributes; the findings further reveal which innovative initiatives may trigger consumers' positive emotions, e.g., providing automated robot services, offering fragrant scents and ergonomic pillows/beds in hotel rooms, etc. This work advances hospitality open innovation research, and practical implications and methodological contributions are also discussed.","Wu, Jie;Yang, Tong;Zhou, Zhiwei;Zhao, Narisa",Journal,International Journal of Hospitality Management,2023-09-01,Dalian University of Technology,Affective needs ;  Innovation opportunity level ;  Kansei Engineering ;  Online hotel reviews ;  Open innovation
Genomic materials design: CALculation of PHAse Dynamics,"The CALPHAD system of fundamental phase-level databases, now known as the Materials Genome, has enabled a mature technology of computational materials design and qualification that has already met the acceleration goals of the national Materials Genome Initiative. As first commercialized by QuesTek Innovations, the methodology combines efficient genomic-level parametric design of new material composition and process specifications with multidisciplinary simulation-based forecasting of manufacturing variation, integrating efficient uncertainty management. Recent projects demonstrated under the multi-institutional CHiMaD Design Center notably include novel alloys designed specifically for additive manufacturing. With the proven success of the CALPHAD-based Materials Genome technology, current university research emphasizes new methodologies for affordable accelerated expansion of more accurate CALPHAD databases. Rapid adoption of these new capabilities by US apex corporations has compressed the materials design and development cycle to under 2 years, enabling a new “materials concurrency” integrated into a new level of concurrent engineering supporting an unprecedented level of manufacturing innovation.","Olson, G.

Can enterprise green technology innovation performance achieve “corner overtaking” by using artificial intelligence?—Evidence from Chinese manufacturing enterprises,"To examine the impact of the application of artificial intelligence on the green technology innovation performance of enterprises, a multi-period difference-in-differences model was constructed. Panel data of Chinese listed manufacturing companies over the period of 2014–2020 were used. According to Stimulus-Organism-Response theory, the impact of artificial intelligence on the green technology innovation performance of enterprises is not direct. The mediating effects of basic knowledge coupling, complementary knowledge coupling, and extended knowledge coupling are verified through empirical tests. The results show that artificial intelligence significantly positively impacts the innovation performance of enterprises in relation to the development of green technology and its decomposition variables (efficiency and progress of green technology). The mediation effect indicates that artificial intelligence mainly promotes the green technology innovation performance of enterprises by affecting their knowledge coupling.","Tian, Hongna;Zhao, Liyan;Yunfang, Li;Wang, Wei",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2023-09-01,Harbin University of Science and Technology,Artificial intelligence ;  Green technology innovation performance ;  Knowledge coupling ;  Multiple difference-in-difference ;  Stimulus-Organism-Response theory
Digital transformation and low-carbon technology innovation in manufacturing firms: The mediating role of dynamic capabilities,"Green challenges such as global warming call for deeper low-carbon technology changes in manufacturing firms, and digital transformation (DT) may play a major role. Most existing studies have investigated the impact of DT as a whole on green technology innovation but lack a dynamic mechanism analysis from a process perspective. Therefore, this article proposes a theoretical framework for multistage DT to drive low-carbon technology innovation (LCTI) in manufacturing firms, which is closely linked to three dynamic capabilities (DCs). Based on the panel data of A-share manufacturing firms in China from 2011 to 2019, this article finds the following. First, DT effectively promotes LCTI, and this effect is a “leverage effect” superimposed on existing innovation. Second, the theoretical mechanism shows that the data analysis, data operation, and data empowerment stages of DT enhance the absorptive capacity, innovation capacity, and adaptive capacity of enterprises, respectively, which in turn promote LCTI. Empirical tests support the mediating effects of the first two capabilities; however, adaptive capacity is validated to be effective only for low-tech firms due to the limited increase in strategic flexibility of high-tech firms by marginal DT enhancement. Third, the heterogeneity analysis shows that the promotion effect of DT on LCTI is stronger for carbon reduction and decarbonization technologies, more significant for low-emission firms, and stronger for firms in the cohort network. These conclusions add new microevidence of the environmental benefits of the digital economy and provide new explanations for opening the “black box” of DT and LCTI based on a process perspective. At the same time, this work can help manufacturing firms in developing countries follow the low-carbon transformation path by independent innovation and, moreover, reduce the originally enormous amounts of energy consumption and carbon emissions of these countries and contribute to the response to global warming and the energy crisis.","Yang, Gangqiang;Nie, Yiming;Li, Honggui;Wang, Haisen",Journal,International Journal of Production Economics,2023-09-01,Wuhan University,Digital transformation ;  Dynamic capabilities ;  Low-carbon technology innovation ;  Manufacturing firms
Diffusion of technology and renewable energy in the G10 countries: A panel threshold analysis,"The paper analyzes the threshold effect of technology innovation on renewable energy in the G10 countries through the panel threshold method. The outcome shows that technology innovation has a low impact on renewable energy when technology innovation is below the threshold value. However, technology innovation has a strong positive effect on renewable energy when the threshold value is above because of the expansion of spending on energy and technology. Moreover, digitalization makes renewable integration possible, analytic and artificial intelligence improve production. The findings explore that carbon emission has a negative impact on renewable energy. However, knowledge stocks, imported oil prices, economic growth, and electricity consumption positively affect renewable energy. The countries must develop more cost-effective, mature, and accessible renewable energy technology. Also, the focus should be on implementation instead of investing in existing infrastructure. A political commitment to phase out nuclear power and fossil fuels can improve the underwhelming performance.","Li, Yi Ming;Khan, Khalid;Farooque, Aitazaz A.;Murshed, Muntasir",Journal,Energy Strategy Reviews,2023-09-01,North South University;Daffodil International University;University of Prince Edward Island;Zhejiang Normal University;HengXing University,Energy transition ;  Imported energy price ;  Knowledge stock ;  Panel threshold ;  Renewable energy ;  Technology innovation
A modern-day research model for large academic institutions: A fellow-based solution,"Introduction: In the aftermath of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 becoming pass/fail, research has become a more important component of residency applications. Time is a finite resource, and clinicians, both academic and private practice, struggle to balance research within their schedules. We aim to provide a model to produce impactful research efficiently. Methods: We describe our experience in developing a modern-day research model that was developed to create a robust research program at our institution. A grassroots initiative of researchers, including academicians, a burn fellow, residents, and students, has become a research model that large academic institutions should leverage for efficiency and productivity. Results: What began as one attending, one fellow, four medical students, and one burn center grew in several months to include over 170 students, a student organization, five fellows from varying specialties, seven residents, and 22 faculty members in 15 disciplines. In addition, our collaboration includes interdisciplinary research involving other institutional departments such as mathematics, medical education, biostatistics, industrial engineering, and computer engineering. Tenably, we have over 150 projects in the works, 22 publications, 47 podium presentations, 47 poster presentations, and over 150 approved IRB proposals, along with four grants— all in 16 months. Discussion: As we move into the era of the ungraded medical student, the importance of research experience and productivity is rising. Academic institutions that adapt to this change in the medical education landscape have the opportunity to increase innovation and their institution's contributions to academic medicine while producing well-rounded graduates with skills vital to efficacious patient care. Conclusion: This research model allows for interdisciplinary collaboration and efficient research productivity in large academic institutions. We aim to inspire other institutions to consider implementing a similar research model and continue to contribute to the innovation and advancement of medicine.","Pang, Alan;Zeitouni, Jad;Zeitouni, Ferris;Kesey, Jennifer;Griswold, John",Journal,Surgery in Practice and Science,2023-09-01,TTUHSC School of Medicine;Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at Lubbock,Interprofessional collaboration ;  Medical education ;  Research engagement
Empowering students'engineering thinking: An empirical study of integrating engineering into science class at junior secondary schools,"Background, the context, and purpose of the study: With the prosperity of STEM education, engineering thinking has emerged as a crucial component of engineering education. However, current STEM educational practices do not totally promote engineering thinking among students at junior secondary schools. This paper presents a study that investigates the effects of teaching innovation, specifically the Engineering Integrated Science (EIS) curriculum, which integrates engineering design into science classes. The study aims to explore the impact of this curriculum on the development of junior secondary school students' engineering thinking skills, including systems thinking, critical thinking, and creative thinking. Results, the main findings: This study employed a quasi-experimental design with 286 junior secondary school students, split equally between experimental and control groups, to investigate the impact of integrating engineering design into science classes on students' engineering thinking. Mixed methods, including pre-posttests and interviews, were used to collect data and evaluate the effectiveness of the EIS curriculum, while also exploring influential factors such as academic achievement levels and gender. The results revealed that the EIS curriculum brought about significant differences in engineering thinking between the experimental group and the control group; the experimental group performed better in the development of systems thinking, critical thinking and creative thinking. Further findings suggested students’ achievement levels and gender difference affected their performance in engineering thinking, for example, students with low achievement levels were comparatively weak at creative thinking; male and female students demonstrated similar levels of engineering thinking, with males showing better performance in creative thinking. Conclusions, brief summary, and potential implications: This study employed mixed research methods to analyze and compare the development of students' engineering thinking before and after the implementation of a self-developed EIS curriculum. Overall, the results showed that the implementation of the EIS curriculum could improve students’ engineering thinking significantly, and expose the impact of this curriculum on students’ systems thinking, critical thinking, and creative thinking. The findings will contribute to the research of thinking skills in engineering-oriented STEM education and inform the design and implementation of engineering-oriented STEM education.","Zhan, Xiaohong;Sun, Daner;Song, Rui;Yang, Yuqin;Zhan, Ying",Journal,Thinking Skills and Creativity,2023-09-01,East China Normal University;The Education University of Hong Kong;Central China Normal University;Shanghai High School,Engineering integrated science (EIS) ;  Engineering thinking ;  Junior secondary schools ;  STEM education
Unleashing the impact of ecological civilization pilot policies on green technology innovation: Evidence from a novel SC-DID model,"Green technology innovation (GTI) is the main force behind green development and is crucial to developing countries' economic growth. Strengthening green technology innovation has become an inevitable choice for the development of global society. However, formal environmental regulations often require high implementation costs. Therefore, informal environmental regulations, such as ecological civilization pilots (ECP), have received widespread attention. Previous research methods have difficulty accurately identifying the impact of ecological civilization pilots on green technology innovation, while the new synthetic control difference-in-differences model (SC-DID) method can effectively fill this methodological gap. Based on the SC-DID and using green patent data, we empirically tested the impact of the ECP on GTI in the pilot provinces. We found that ECP significantly promotes GTI in the pilot provinces, and the findings were still robust after the placebo test. ECP promotes both ‘strategic’ and ‘substantive’ innovation in green technology. In particular, the number of green utility model patents (GUP) in the pilot provinces increased by 38.1% on average following the implementation of the ECP, whereas the number of green invention patents (GIP) only increased by 23.1%. Further, we also made a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the policy cost and the benefits brought by GTI. Six years after implementing ECP, the net benefit was about 16.78 billion yuan. This paper uses a relatively novel and robust research method, SC-DID, to enrich the research on the policy effects of ECP. The research findings from our study conducted in China can provide a reference for developing countries, supporting their green and economic development.","Bai, Dongbei;Hu, Jin;Irfan, Muhammad;Hu, Mingjun",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-09-01,Anhui University of Finance and Economics;Guizhou University of Finance and Economics;Ilma University;Beijing Technology and Business University;Wenzhou University,Ecological civilization ;  Green technology innovation ;  Strategic innovation ;  Substantive innovation ;  Synthetic control difference-in-differences
A refractory engineering program for the 21 <sup>st</sup> century,"The Federation for International Refractory Research and Education (FIRE) has been conceptualized twenty years ago. At the time, its purpose was to maintain the training of graduated engineers to enroll and to adapt to the new business plans in the refractory industry. It was the blooming of the Information Age, of the knowledge workers. This paper is about the need to adjust to a new era, knowing that the benefit of education prime value is its long-term value. To have an outer and an inner vision about innovation, the first part of the paper is concerned about how do we learn and how our brain rules. In the second part we try to anticipate the customers’ needs trying to surf with them on the Ecology wave, including the Environment, Energy, Economy, and Ethics other waves. Accepting that this is already brewing at an accelerated rate, the conclusion is that FIRE and the other educators need to continue mimicking the CDIO (Conceive Design Implement Operate) approach which has inspired us for the last 20 years, for another 20 years, to adjust to the Conceptual Age in order to educate the creators and the empathizers who will direct the flow, in the refractory industry.","Rigaud, Michel;Poirier, Jacques;Huger, Marc;Tonnesen, Thorsten;Pandolfelli, Victor",Journal,Open Ceramics,2023-09-01,Polytechnique Montréal;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Universidade Federal de São Carlos;Université de Limoges;CEMHTI,
Carbon emission reduction analysis for cloud computing industry: Can carbon emissions trading and technology innovation help?,"The emerging cloud computing industry (CCI) has become an important source of carbon emissions; therefore, choosing an appropriate carbon emission reduction strategy is of key importance. Based on two important alternative carbon reduction strategies, namely carbon emissions trading (CET) and emission reduction technological innovation (ERTI), in this paper, a scenario-based simulation model of carbon emission reduction strategies is established for the CCI of China. Based on different derivative scenarios of CET and ERTI strategies, 22 carbon reduction strategy scenarios are designed and subjected to simulation analysis. Then, a slacks-based model that considers undesirable output is constructed and used to evaluate the comprehensive effect of proposed carbon reduction strategy scenarios. Based on the evaluation results of the strategy scenarios, a tolerant CET strategy scenario with a high free quota ratio and a low carbon trading price has the potential to reverse the increasing trend of carbon emissions. This tolerant strategy scenario can also achieve a more efficient carbon emission reduction result for the CCI in the long run. In terms of technology innovation, the strong promotion of installed zero‑carbon capacity and negative emission technology applications can effectively promote the reduction of carbon emissions. The results of this analysis show that the carbon emission reduction strategy with tolerant CET and strong ERTI will contribute to the healthy development of the CCI.","Yu, Xianyu;Hu, Yuezhi;Zhou, Dequn;Wang, Qunwei;Sang, Xiuzhi;Huang, Kai",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-09-01,DeGroote School of Business;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Carbon emission reduction strategy ;  Cloud computing industry ;  SBM-undesirable model ;  System dynamics
How can China's medical manufacturing listed firms improve their technological innovation efficiency? An analysis based on a three-stage DEA model and corporate governance configurations,"China's medical manufacturing industry is in a critical stage of transition to independent innovation. The government should create a business environment that is conducive to the development of the industry, and firms need to accurately identify obstacles to their innovation governance. However, the relationship between corporate governance (CG) and innovation efficiency remains unclear. Based on the CG configuration research framework, this study analyzes, using a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and panel data fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the relationship between the internal governance and technological innovation efficiency (TIE) of China's medical manufacturing listed firms (CMMLFs) with the consideration of the impact of environmental parameters on innovation performance. The results show that (1) government support and medical spending among environmental factors create innovation input redundancy, and education investment and industrial competition promote innovation efficiency; and (2) the high TIE of firms is the outcome of multiple internal mechanisms, and there are five possible paths conducive to improving TIE and two mainstream, stable configurations for high technical efficiency. Our study systematically analyzes the external and internal organizational factors as two situational factors for CG and provides a reference for decision-making to further promote the efficient innovation of medical manufacturing firms.","Qiu, Liping;Yu, Rongjian;Hu, Feng;Zhou, Haiyan;Hu, Hao",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2023-09-01,Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology (NEUST);North Minzu University;Shanghai University of International Business and Economics;Shanghai University;Zhejiang Gongshang University,Configuration analysis ;  Internal corporate governance ;  Medical manufacturing listed firms ;  Panel data fsQCA ;  Technological innovation efficiency ;  Three-stage DEA model
Policies for enhancing patent quality: Evidence from renewable energy technology in China,"Understanding the policy effectiveness in renewable energy technology innovation is essential to advancing the global energy transition. This paper constructs a patent quality index for renewable energy technology, which contributes to a better expression of technology innovation by incorporating time change factors. In order to study the effectiveness of government policies for enhancing technology patent quality in renewable energy, we first categorize policies according to the regulation intensity and technological characteristics, and use a sys-GMM model to assess the policy effectiveness. We further focus on heterogeneous effects of different policies on diverse technologies and region. The analysis shows that the economic incentive policies and guiding demonstrative policies better improve the quality of patent, but the effects vary across different energy technology types and regions. This paper suggests local government to prudently use the high regulatory strategies, and the design of policy mix should consider the effect of policies, technical and regional heterogeneity.","Wang, Xue;Fan, Li Wei;Zhang, Hongyan",Journal,Energy Policy,2023-09-01,China University of Petroleum (East China),Patent quality ;  Policy instrument ;  Renewable energy ;  Technology innovation

Frozen core experimental study on oil-water distribution characteristics at different stages of water flooding in low permeability oil reservoirs,"The distribution pattern of oil and water in different stages of low permeability reservoirs is one of the main research topics in oilfield development. This paper takes low-permeability and tight oil reservoirs as the research object, systematically carries out experimental research on water flooding efficiency, and carries out theoretical comparative analysis. The innovations of this paper mainly include three aspect: (a) the experimental study of water drive efficiency under the conditions of different water drive stages is carried out, and the dynamic evolution characteristics of remaining oil distribution is analyzed. (b) The comparative analysis of water drive efficiency under different combination conditions of “permeability and crude oil physical properties” is studied. (c) The dynamic evolution mechanism of the coupling of “bound water - semi-bound water - free water” is explored by using the frozen core method. Results show that: (a) At the original oil bearing stage of the core in F Oilfield, the free microscale residual oil is the majority, followed by the bound and semi-bound residual oil. (b) Water flooding mainly develops the free residual oil. The remaining oil in clusters decreased from 22.35% to 2.21%. The residual oil in the form of inter-particle adsorption decreased from 28.56% to 2.53%. (c) It is difficult to develop bound and semi-bound residual oil in water drive.

Positive or negative? R&D subsidies and green technology innovation: Evidence from China's renewable energy industry,"Existing studies have separately discussed the significance of R&D subsidies (RDS) and green technology innovation (GTI) in the renewable energy (RE) industry. However, there is limited research exploring the relationship between them, underestimating the actual incentive effect of RDS on GTI in the RE industry. Using data from 160 listed RE companies in China from 2011 to 2020, this study aims to investigate the direct influence of RDS on GTI in the RE industry and uncover the underlying theoretical mechanisms. Our results reveal an inverted U-shaped association between RDS and GTI of RE companies, indicating an optimal value for the promotion effect of RDS on GTI. Furthermore, we find that RDS can indirectly influence the performance of GTI of RE companies by affecting the intensity of their R&D investments. The results of heterogeneity analysis show that the influence of RDS on GTI in the RE industry varies depending on factors, such as company lifecycles, ownerships, scales, and geographical characteristics. The empirical results of this study have significant implications for optimizing existing subsidy mechanisms to foster the development of GTI in China's RE industry.","Lin, Boqiang;Xie, Yongjing",Journal,Renewable Energy,2023-09-01,Xiamen University;Innovation Laboratory for Sciences and Technologies of Energy Materials of Fujian Province (IKKEM),Green technology innovation ;  Inverted U-Shaped ;  R&D subsidies ;  Renewable energy

"A comprehensive review of the production, beneficial properties, and applications of kefiran, the kefir grain exopolysaccharide","The natural starter for kefir production is kefir grains, which house many yeast and bacterial species in a polysaccharide matrix, called kefiran. Kefiran has many beneficial properties, including therapeutic and rheological, that make it a valuable biopolymer with widespread industrial applications, including food packaging, food stabilizing, tissue engineering, and drug or probiotic delivery. The biological performance of kefiran has yet to be completely recognized and exploited. Various production challenges, including cost inefficiency and inhibition by acid production during fermentation, have prevented large-scale, commercial production kefiran. Here, we review the production, biological properties, and applications of the kefiran exopolysaccharide, focusing mainly on its application for the food industry. We identify the knowledge gaps in the literature, indicating a need for further exploration on the applications of kefiran.

"Epigenetic therapeutics in dental pulp treatment: Hopes, challenges and concerns for the development of next-generation biomaterials","This opinion-led review paper highlights the need for novel translational research in vital-pulp-treatment (VPT), but also discusses the challenges in translating evidence to clinics. Traditional dentistry is expensive, invasive and relies on an outmoded mechanical understanding of dental disease, rather than employing a biological perspective that harnesses cell activity and the regenerative-capacity. Recent research has focussed on developing minimally-invasive biologically-based ‘fillings’ that preserve the dental pulp; research that is shifting the paradigm from expensive high-technology dentistry, with high failure rates, to smart restorations targeted at biological processes. Current VPTs promote repair by recruiting odontoblast-like cells in a material-dependent process. Therefore, exciting opportunities exist for development of next-generation biomaterials targeted at regenerative processes in the dentin-pulp complex. This article analyses recent research using pharmacological-inhibitors to therapeutically-target histone-deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes in dental-pulp-cells (DPCs) that stimulate pro-regenerative effects with limited loss of viability. Consequently, HDAC-inhibitors have the potential to enhance biomaterial-driven tissue responses at low concentration by influencing the cellular processes with minimal side-effects, providing an opportunity to develop a topically-placed, inexpensive bio-inductive pulp-capping material. Despite positive results, clinical translation of these innovations requires enterprise to counteract regulatory obstacles, dental-industry priorities and to develop strong academic/industry partnerships. The aim of this opinion-led review paper is to discuss the potential role of therapeutically-targeting epigenetic modifications as part of a topical VPT strategy in the treatment of the damaged dental pulp, while considering the next steps, material considerations, challenges and future for the clinical development of epigenetic therapeutics or other ‘smart’ restorations in VPT.","Duncan, Henry F.;Kobayashi, Yoshifumi;Kearney, Michaela;Shimizu, Emi",Journal,Bioactive Materials,2023-09-01,Dublin Dental University Hospital;Rutgers School of Dental Medicine,Epigenetics ;  Histone deacetylase inhibitors ;  Pulp capping ;  Regenerative endodontics ;  Vital pulp treatment
Does green technology innovation contribute to energy efficiency improvement: Empirical evidence from Chinese cities,"To achieve carbon neutrality, energy efficiency improvement is an essential step. This paper measures the Malmquist energy productivity index (MEPI) to model the dynamics of total factor energy productivity utilizing the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) method. We found evidence that city-level total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) has been greatly improved in China. However, there are significant regional differences among different cities. Then, this paper empirically examines the heterogeneous impacts of green technology innovation (GTI) on energy efficiency, and takes environmental regulation into consideration. The results show that GTI contributes to improving energy efficiency in cities with higher environmental regulations. Further, green innovation mainly improves the total factor energy productivity through technological progress instead of the catch-up effect.","Lu, Chunhao;Zhao, Panting;Lin, Xiqiao",Journal,Energy Reports,2023-09-01,Xiamen University;Guangxi Power Grid Corporation,Energy efficiency ;  Environmental regulation ;  Green technology innovation ;  Partially linear functional-coefficient model

FEM education in undergraduate studies: Industry-informed research,"Recent mechanical engineering graduates are expected to utilize Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in structural and machine design activities. However, after decades of implementation in engineering schools, the Finite Element Method (FEM) still challenges instructors and course designers. To align learning outcomes with industrial requirements, this article analyzes the opinions of Mexican industrial and academic experts about four important aspects of FEM education. The results suggest that specialists agree on the importance of including a mixture of theoretical and applied topics in the syllabus but prefer practical skills over fundamental concepts. Besides learning from defeaturing to postprocessing a model, engineering students must know how to plan, verify, and validate their finite element studies. Experts expect early design engineers to be proficient with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and have relevant mathematical and programming skills. Instead of using specialized software, students' first exposure to FEM may be based on FEA tools embedded in CAD systems. Also, academic and industrial respondents request the incorporation of modal, thermal and nonlinear analysis procedures in the course timetable. Finally, the statistical analysis shows that the two types of respondents share one common vision about the importance of the aspects under study. The findings from this work are useful for the design of FEM-related coursework and can be used to guide course instructors about the right balance of theory and practice, overall course contents, and the selection of the software utilized for the practical part of the program.","Perez-Santiago, Rogelio;Campos, Esmeralda",Journal,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2023-09-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  FEM education ;  Finite Element Method ;  higher education ;  industry-informed education research

A modular plasmid toolkit applied in marine bacteria reveals functional insights during bacteria-stimulated metamorphosis,"A conspicuous roadblock to studying marine bacteria for fundamental research and biotechnology is a lack of modular synthetic biology tools for their genetic manipulation. Here, we applied, and generated new parts for, a modular plasmid toolkit to study marine bacteria in the context of symbioses and host-microbe interactions. To demonstrate the utility of this plasmid system, we genetically manipulated the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea, which stimulates the metamorphosis of the model tubeworm, Hydroides elegans. Using these tools, we quantified constitutive and native promoter expression, developed reporter strains that enable the imaging of host-bacteria interactions, and used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to knock down a secondary metabolite and a host-associated gene. We demonstrate the broader utility of this modular system for testing the genetic tractability of marine bacteria that are known to be associated with diverse host-microbe symbioses. These efforts resulted in the successful conjugation of 12 marine strains from the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria classes. Altogether, the present study demonstrates how synthetic biology strategies enable the investigation of marine microbes and marine host-microbe symbioses with potential implications for environmental restoration and biotechnology. IMPORTANCE Marine Proteobacteria are attractive targets for genetic engineering due to their ability to produce a diversity of bioactive metabolites and their involvement in host-microbe symbioses. Modular cloning toolkits have become a standard for engineering model microbes, such as Escherichia coli, because they enable innumerable mix-and-match DNA assembly and engineering options. However, such modular tools have not yet been applied to most marine bacterial species. In this work, we adapt a modular plasmid toolkit for use in a set of 12 marine bacteria from the Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria classes. We demonstrate the utility of this genetic toolkit by engineering a marine Pseudoalteromonas bacterium to study their association with its host animal Hydroides elegans. This work provides a proof of concept that modular genetic tools can be applied to diverse marine bacteria to address basic science questions and for biotechnology innovations.","Alker, Amanda T.;Farrell, Morgan V.;Aspiras, Alpher E.;Dunbar, Tiffany L.;Fedoriouk, Andriy;Jones, Jeffrey E.;Mikhail, Sama R.;Salcedo, Gabriella Y.;Moore, Bradley S.;Shikuma, Nicholas J.",Journal,mBio,2023-08-31,Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine;SDSU College of Sciences,CRISPRi ;  golden gate ;  Hydroides ;  marine ;  metamorphosis ;  modular ;  symbiosis ;  tubeworm ;  violacein

The Effect of a Virtual Reality Resource on the Engagement and Learning Experience of First-year Engineering Students,"In a world full of innovative teaching methods and ever advancing technology, conventional education models and systems are no longer as effective as they were in the past. Providing first-year engineering students with high quality learning activities that demand the full use of their senses has become primordial in preparing them for the challenges of the future. To achieve this goal, Tec de Monterrey has implemented its new education model which focuses on four main pillars: challenge-based learning (CBL), flexibility in when and where the learning experience takes place, inspiring faculty, and memorable student experience. In this study, a pilot for an immersive experience which focuses on these previous aspects of the education model is presented along with the results obtained. This study explores the effect of the use of Virtual Reality (VR) resources on the learning process and engagement of first-year engineering students. This work follows a mixed-methods approach, involving both qualitative and quantitative information of the analyzed population. The first stage of the study involved a pilot test with a group of students that used a VR headset to immerse themselves in the ""Tec Time Travellers""experience. In this experience, the participants were challenged with a time traveling mission by famous engineer and scientist Nikola Tesla to research and recover vital pieces of information from three different time eras of the university: the past, the present, and the future. At the end of each segment and to clear the mission, the participants responded to a question regarding the topics covered. Answering correctly allowed them to advance to the next time era, and failure to do so trapped them in time. After using the VR resource, students responded to a perception survey. The results showed that the use of VR technology has a positive effect in the learning experience and students' engagement when compared with traditional methods. Motivation, enjoyment, curiosity, and intuitiveness were some of the behaviors developed during the activity. Best practices, lessons learned and improvements were identified to be implemented in the final version of the VR resource for the full class of freshmen at our campuses nationwide.","Mojica-Irigoyen, Mauricio;Figueroa-Cavazos, J.

AI-driven innovative design of chemicals in practice and perspective,"It has long been a grand goal for researchers and industry professionals in the chemical engineering community to revolutionize the paradigm of chemical product development and shorten the time from product discovery to application. However, chemical product design is a complex process involving multiple components, scales, and physical fields. It is difficult for existing experimental research models to reveal the relevant physical and chemical mechanisms in depth and efficiently. Therefore, it is necessary to use multi-scale computer simulation technology to predict the properties of chemical products by coupling multi-scale simulation methods starting from the chemical structure at the micro-molecular level. Along with the increasing computing power, “artificial intelligence (AI) -driven” approaches are becoming a significant promise in the pursuit of this objective, where AI is being organically integrated with established multi-scale simulation techniques for efficient and high-fidelity modeling framework with potential for transformative impact on chemical design. For instance, machine learning models trained on high-fidelity multi-scale simulation data can accelerate the prediction of chemical structure-property relationship by orders of magnitude. However, the chemical industry, particularly, the development of new chemical products, presents many unique challenges. The crude application of AI to existing problems and data to construct some predictive models can hardly break the existing bottlenecks fundamentally. Hence, it is imperative to consider how we can integrate AI techniques more effectively and comprehensively with innovative chemical product design. We envision this can be achieved through, e.g., using AI to optimize existing physics-based simulation techniques and efficiently explore hundreds of millions of design parameters to find the best design solutions. Here we discuss the recent development of AI-driven chemical innovation design from three aspects: multi-scale simulation, material design framework, and scientific software development, with an emphasis on the important role of AI technology in achieving the innovation pathway of chemical products. At last, we present our perspective on the current efforts to embrace AI techniques in the engineering of novel chemical product, with the goal of providing a strong foundation to support the advancement of domestic chemical industry.","Wu, Zhenghao;Zhou, Tianhang;Lan, Xingying;Xu, Chunming",Journal,Huagong Jinzhan/Chemical Industry and Engineering Progress,2023-08-15,Robert R.

The interrelationship between barriers impeding the adoption of off-site construction in developing countries: The case of Chile,"Off-site construction (OSC) has been recognized for its capacity to transform the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry from a labour-intensive to a modernized and sustainable industry. OSC is growing in developed countries; however, in developing countries, there are deep barriers that do not allow for significant changes in favour of OSC adoption. To understand and overcome these challenges, many studies have identified numerous OSC barriers but mostly consider them isolated. This approach has been shown to be ineffective because several barriers interact simultaneously, and many of them are not easily visible. Therefore, this research develops a systemic approach to understanding the interrelationship of OSC barriers, doing so in the context of the AEC industry of Chile. Based on a multidimensional analysis, the current methodology consisted of (i) an extensive literature review and several discussions with experts to determine the main OSC barriers and their dimensions, (ii) impact measurement and prioritization of OSC barriers, (iii) qualitative and quantitative correlation using statistical tools, and (iv) network analysis. The research identified ten dimensions containing 74 OSC barriers. These dimensions address the areas related to cultural aspects, quality, market, finance, design and development, innovation and technology, people's skills, policies and regulations, documentation and communication, and logistics. The results suggest that the main OSC barriers are the poor leading role of the government in promoting OSC, lack of early integration of the value chain, lack of collaborative work among stakeholders, and conservatism of the AEC industry. Furthermore, the research results show that this approach rigorously identifies the interrelationship among OSC barriers, demonstrating the systemic behaviour of OSC barriers in which they enhance their impact by interacting with each other even with barriers outside their own dimensions.","ortega, Jesús;Mesa, Harrison A.;Alarcón, Luis F.",Journal,Journal of Building Engineering,2023-08-15,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,Barriers ;  Correlation network analysis ;  Critical factors ;  Developing countries ;  Off-site construction ;  Risk factor
Identifying the risk factors and their interactions of human–robot collaboration implementation during engineering project construction: evidence from China,"Purpose: Human–robot collaboration (HRC) is an emerging research field for the construction industry along with construction robot adoption, but its implementation remains limited in construction sites. This paper aims to identify critical risk factors and their interactions of HRC implementation during engineering project construction. Design/methodology/approach: Literature research, expert interviews, a questionnaire survey and a social network analysis (SNA) method were used. First, literature research and expert interviews were employed to identify risk factors of HRC implementation and preliminarily understand factor interactions. Second, a questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the degree of interactions between risk factors. Third, based on the data collected from the questionnaire survey, SNA metrics were used to find critical risk factors and critical interactions. Findings: The critical risk factors consist of robot technology reliability, robot-perceived level, conflict between designers and users of construction robots, organisational culture, organisational strength, project cost requirements, changeability of project construction, project quality requirements and project safety requirements. The interactions between risk factors are strong and complex. Robot technology risk factors were relatively fundamental risk factors, and project risk factors had a direct influence on the risk of HRC implementation. The implementation cost of HRC was not identified as a critical risk factor. Individual risk factors could be mitigated by improving technical and organisational factors. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the body of knowledge in the field of both HRC behaviours and its risk management in construction project management. Identifying the critical risk factors and their interactions of HRC implementation in the construction industry and introducing social network theory to the research on critical risk factors are the innovations of this paper. The findings and proposed suggestions could help construction professionals to better understand the HRC risk factors and to manage the risk of HRC implementation more effectively.","Chen, Zhen;Zhao, Yaqi;Zhou, Xia;Hao, Shengyue;Li, Jin",Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2023-08-15,Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture;Tongji University;Beijing Jiaotong University,Construction robot ;  Construction sites ;  Human–robot collaboration ;  Risk factors ;  Social network analysis
Research on the nexus between the digital economy and carbon emissions -Evidence at China's province level,"China is currently entering the era of the digital economy. Further development of the digital economy may provide a new dynamic mechanism to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. Therefore, the digital economy activities in the process of reducing carbon emissions need to be urgently discussed. Using a panel dataset covering 30 Chinese provinces from 2013 to 2020, a two-way fixed effect model was employed to analyze the impact of the digital economy on carbon emissions. The results indicated that, during the study period, regional differences in the level of digital economy development were large. In addition, the spatial pattern showed a decrease from east to west. The development of the digital economy significantly reduced the intensity of carbon emissions. This conclusion that was supported by robustness tests and endogenous analysis. Moreover, this effect exhibited heterogeneity with respect to energy consumption, sub-indicators of the digital economy, and policy support. Additionally, government support positively moderated the relationship between the digital economy and carbon emissions. This moderating effect also showed heterogeneity. Most importantly, the relationship between the digital economy and carbon emissions was transmitted through different dimensions of science and technology innovation. These findings provide a further scientific basis for developing the digital economy and promoting green development, which is beneficial for achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality.","Chen, Li;Lu, Yuanquan;Meng, Yuan;Zhao, Wanying",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-08-10,Chongqing University;Chongqing Normal University,Carbon emissions ;  China ;  Digital economy ;  Government support ;  Science and technology innovation
Individual entrepreneurial orientation: comparison of business and STEM students,"Purpose: The present study has been designed with the aim to determine whether there are differences in individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) between students, doing their major in business studies and the ones whose areas of study are science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical research methods comprise the review of secondary sources to build a sound theoretical framework for the research activities. The empirical research method is a survey in Latvia and Poland applying non-parametric inferential statistical methods as well as linear regression analysis to investigate which factors and components contribute to EO orientation development among different groups of students, and, thus, verify the research hypotheses. Findings: The yielded research results demonstrate that there are significant differences between business and STEM students when they analyze their IEO. It turned out that STEM students obtain significantly lower scores for risk-taking and innovation but higher for proactiveness. Additionally, it was detected that the chosen field of study affects students’ perception of educational support, thus, influencing their innovation, proactiveness, and risk propensity characteristics. Research limitations/implications: In this research, the authors focused on exploring IEO among business and STEM students in Latvia and Poland, hence the findings cannot be one-to-one applied to other countries. Practical implications: The topicality of the theme is determined by the fact that changes in external environment require higher educational institutions (HEIs) in Latvia and Poland to foster their entrepreneurial ecosystems and re-master study programs both for business and STEM students as well as conduct projects that include students, academic staff, and business representatives – the transformation is necessary to create positive attitude towards entrepreneurship among the students and help them to consider entrepreneurial career path later. Originality/value: Factors and components which contribute to IEO development among different groups of students are under-researched in the Baltic countries, experiencing systemic transformation. The authors believe that universities can use the analysis of their students’ IEO to allocate their resources in a better way, adjust curricula to the real needs of students and facilitate entrepreneurship.","Nikitina, Tatjana;Licznerska, Magdalena;Ozoliņa-Ozola, Iveta;Lapina, Inga",Journal,Education and Training,2023-08-09,Riga Technical University;Gdańsk University of Technology,Business education ;  Higher educational institution (HEI) ;  Individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) ;  Perceived educational support ;  STEM

Data-centric AI: Techniques and Future Perspectives,"The role of data in AI has been significantly magnified by the emerging concept of data-centric AI. In contrast to the traditional model-centric paradigm, which focuses on developing more effective models given fixed datasets, data-centric AI emphasizes the systematic engineering of data in building AI systems. However, as a new concept, many critical aspects of data-centric AI remain ambiguous, such as its definitions, associated tasks, algorithms, challenges, and benchmarks. This tutorial aims to review and discuss this emerging field, with a particular focus on the three general data-centric AI goals: training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance. The objective of this tutorial is threefold: (1) to formally categorize the field of data-centric AI using a goal-driven taxonomy and discuss the needs and challenges of each goal, (2) to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art techniques, and (3) to discuss the future perspectives and open research directions to inspire further innovations in this field.","Zha, Daochen;Lai, Kwei Herng;Yang, Fan;Zou, Na;Gao, Huiji;Hu, Xia",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2023-08-06,"Airbnb, Inc.;Wake Forest University;Texas A&M University;Rice University",ai ;  data-centric ai
Modern Certification Systems for Green Construction,"In this research we provide the analysis of the contemporary certification systems for green construction on the example of the buildings of the Skolkovo Innovation Center. A person throughout his life conducts active efforts aimed at transforming the environment. This leads to the formation of an ecological footprint, or carbon footprint. According to the results of the study, it turned out that the certification of industrial and civil construction facilities in accordance with green standards means the search for engineering solutions that can increase the competitiveness of the project, reduce costs during its implementation and maintenance, reduce the ""footprint"" of human presence and improve the quality of people's lives. In addition, green standards are an effective tool not only in the design, but also in the operation of a building, because of the possibility of evaluating an object at various stages of its life cycle - from creation to improvement or demolition. Existing systems carry out certification at different stages of construction. The categories, by which real estate is assessed, vary depending on the system, but their essence remains unchanged. The improvement and popularization of national green standards effectively stimulates the market of building materials and technologies and in the foreseeable future may significantly affect the housing and communal services.","Kudinova, Yana;Shushunova, Natalia",Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2023-08-02,Moscow State University of Civil Engineering,

"IMPACT OF FDI ON INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE UPGRADING UNDER GREEN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION IN JIANGSU, CHINA","Industrial structure upgrading plays an important role in improving economic development efficiency. Tak-ing Jiangsu as the study subject, the paper selects panel data from 2005 to 2018 and performs dynamic panel models and threshold models to analyze the influence mechanism of foreign direct investment (FDI) and green technology innovation on industrial structure upgrading (including rationalization and advancement). The results show that FDI acts negatively on industrial structure upgrading, exhibiting U-shaped relationship with advancement, in contrast, green technology innovation shows a positive contribution to upgrading. In addition, rationalization is limited by fixed assets growing but in-creases with rising education levels. An increase in fixed assets and education both have a positive effect on advancement. Further, FDI plays a facilitating role in advancement considering the positive moderating effect of green technology inno-vation. Therefore, the study provides a theoretical reference for the development path of foreign investment and industrial structure upgrade breakthrough in Jiangsu.","Wang, Shijin;Zhou, Huiying;Tian, Keqin",Journal,Journal of Environmental Engineering and Landscape Management,2023-08-02,Imperial College Business School;Jiangsu Normal University,dynamic panel models ;  FDI ;  green technology innovation ;  industrial structure upgrading ;  panel threshold model

"Can We Get an Intervention, Please? The Utility of Teaming Interventions on Engineering Design Student Psychological Safety","Research on psychological safety has been growing in recent years due to its role in promoting creativity and innovation since teams with high levels of psychological safety feel safe to express ideas and opinions. However, there is limited evidence in how to facilitate or build it within teams, particularly in an educational context. This paper was developed to respond to this research void by identifying the impact of teaming interventions aimed at improving psychological safety in engineering design student teams. Specifically, we studied two cohorts of students in a cornerstone design class (N = 411 students), one who received a series of video interventions and introduced role playing (intervention) and one who did not (control). These role assignments - referred to as the lenses of psychologically safety - were created to promote key leadership attributes that have been shown to be crucial in facilitating psychologically safe teams. To compare the utility of the intervention, psychological safety was gathered at five key time points of a multi-week design project. The results identified three key findings. First, the interventions were successful in increasing psychological safety in engineering teams. In addition, the results indicated the utility of the lenses of psychological safety throughout the design process. Finally, the results identified that groups who used these lenses had higher perceptions of psychological safety in their teams. Overall, these results indicated that psychological safety can be improved in engineering education through the intervention methods described within.","Scarpinella, Samantha;Cole, Courtney;Ritter, Sarah;Mohammad, Susan;Jablokow, Kathryn;Miller, Scarlett",Journal,Journal of Mechanical Design,2023-08-01,Penn State College of Engineering;Pennsylvania State University,collaborative design ;  design courses and curricula ;  design education ;  design methodology ;  design teams ;  design theory ;  design theory and methodology

Microcosmic mechanism of viscosity-reducing foam system in ultra-deep heavy oil and its field application,"Ultra-deep extra-heavy oil reservoirs are characterized by poor thermal oil recovery and low waterflood efficiency, of which the efficient economic development can only he achieved by technological innovation. Therefore, a study of physical and molecular simulation was conducted on the development mechanism of viscosity-reducing foam system, and the field practice was carried out in ultra-deep extra-heavy oil reservoir. Lukeqin oilfield. The research results show that the preferred benzene sulfonate anion active agent (HY-3J)can form not only a relatively stable foam system, but also oil in water emulsion to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil in high salinity formation water. The results of foam microscopic seepage experiment indicate that foam can exert a microscopic force on heavy oil by virtue of the viscoelasticity of liquid films, and this force can be used for efficient emulsion and viscosity reduction of heavy oil. The core displacement experiment suggests that the waterflood recovery rate of ultra-deep heavy oil is only 12. 7%. However, the viscosity-reducing foam system can significantly reduce water cut and improve oil production rate, in which case the viscosity-reducing foam flooding recovery can be improved by 17. 4%. The molecular simulation results turn out that a π-π interaction occurs between the benzene ring structure of benzene sulfonate anion active agent and the aromatic ring on asphaltene. which enhances the van der Waals interaction energy between active agent and asphaltene, thus helping to depolymerize the net structure formed by heavy oil asphaltene and reduce the viscosity of heavy oil. In Lukeqin oilfield, eight well-time viscosity-reducing foam huff and puff experiments have been implemented, and all achieved obvious water precipitation reduction and oil increase, indicating that the viscosity-reducing foam system can effectively improve the development effect of ultra-deep extra-heavy oil.","Lu, Teng;Li, Zhaomin;Gu, Zihan;Mu, Jinfeng;Ding, Guo;Wang, Yiping;Du, Huajun",Journal,Shiyou Xuebao/Acta Petrolei Sinica,2023-08-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);Sinopec;Tuha Oilfield Company;Ltd.,emulsion viscosity reduction ;  foam ;  heavy oil reservoir ;  molecular simulation ;  ultra-deep layer

Maximizing the performance of protein-based fluorescent biosensors,"Fluorescent protein (FP)-based biosensors are genetically encoded tools that enable the imaging of biological processes in the context of cells, tissues, or live animals. Though widely used in biological research, practically all existing biosensors are far from ideal in terms of their performance, properties, and applicability for multiplexed imaging. These limitations have inspired researchers to explore an increasing number of innovative and creative ways to improve and maximize biosensor performance. Such strategies include new molecular biology methods to develop promising biosensor prototypes, high throughput microfluidics-based directed evolution screening strategies, and improved ways to perform multiplexed imaging. Yet another approach is to effectively replace components of biosensors with self-labeling proteins, such as HaloTag, that enable the biocompatible incorporation of synthetic fluorophores or other ligands in cells or tissues. This mini-review will summarize and highlight recent innovations and strategies for enhancing the performance of FP-based biosensors for multiplexed imaging to advance the frontiers of research.","Chai, Fu;Cheng, Dazhou;Nasu, Yusuke;Terai, Takuya;Campbell, Robert E.",Journal,Biochemical Society Transactions,2023-08-01,University of Alberta;The University of Tokyo;Japan Science and Technology Agency,
Research Progress on Displacement Mechanism of Supercritical CO<inf>2</inf> in Low-Permeability Heavy Oil Reservoir and Improvement Mechanism of Displacement Agents,"With the continuous growth of global energy demand and the late stage of conventional oilfield exploitation, the demand for developing and utilizing low-permeability heavy oil reservoirs is becoming increasingly urgent. However, the exploitation of low-permeability heavy oil reservoirs faces many challenges due to their high viscosity, low permeability, and complex geological conditions. To overcome these challenges, researchers have gradually introduced SC-CO2 as an oil displacement agent in the exploitation of heavy oil reservoirs. However, the oil displacement mechanism of SC-CO2 in low-permeability heavy oil reservoirs and its improvement mechanism are still not completely understood. The article provides a detailed study and understanding of the oil displacement mechanism of SC-CO2, which involves the expansion of heavy oil volume through SC-CO2 dissolution. This mechanism reduces the capillary resistance and flow resistance during the oil flow process. The permeation of CO2 disrupts the internal structure and arrangement of heavy oil, reducing its viscosity. CO2 extracts both light and heavy components from the heavy oil, reducing the residual oil saturation. In addition, the mechanism of improving the effect of oil displacement agents such as nanoparticles, polymers, and surfactants on SC-CO2 displacement was also explored. By further exploring the mechanisms and improvement mechanisms of SC-CO2 displacement for heavy oil, it can guide the selection and optimization of oil displacement agents. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism can also provide a theoretical basis for engineering practice and technical innovation. While the research on CO2 flooding is analyzed and evaluated, the obstacles and challenges that still exist at this stage are indicated, and future research work on CO2 in low-permeability heavy oil reservoirs is proposed.","Sun, Yuanxiu;Zhang, Weijie;Tian, Jinlong;Meng, Yanzhao;Zhang, Liping",Journal,Molecules,2023-08-01,PetroChina Company Limited;Baikouquan Oil Production Plant of Petrochina Xinjiang Oilfield Branch;Liaoning Petrochemical University,extraction ;  heavy oil ;  nanoparticles ;  polymer ;  SC-CO 2 ;  surfactants ;  swelling ;  viscosity
Method for Product-Integrated Innovation Based on Biological Inspiration,"Existing research on integrated innovation primarily focuses on the integration of product functions or technologies in the engineering field, with limited exploration of cross-domain integration of biological knowledge. Various organisms exhibit various advantageous biological characteristics, and the multi-biological knowledge embedded within these characteristics can inspire designers to implement product integrated innovation. Biologically Inspired Design (BID) is a method that seeks inspiration from nature to achieve innovation in the engineering field. However, existing BID processes mainly apply the features of a single biological prototype. Against this background, this paper emphasizes how to achieve cross-domain integrated innovation through multi-biological knowledge. First, a method for generating integrated innovation ideas is proposed, achieved through obtaining biological prototypes and analyzing biological performance. Second, by obtaining the principal solution through the three mapping methods of biological effects, behaviors, and structures, a method for building the conceptual structure of integrated innovation is proposed. Finally, in conjunction with the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ), a product-integrated innovation design process model based on biological inspiration is constructed.

Hybrid Photovoltaic Thermal Systems: Present and Future Feasibilities for Industrial and Building Applications,"The growing demands of modern life, industrialization, and technological progress have significantly increased energy requirements. However, this heightened need for energy has raised concerns about its impact on the environment and the rising costs associated with it. Therefore, the engineering sector is actively seeking sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions. Among the promising innovations in solving the problem is the photovoltaic thermal system (PVT), which aims to capture electrical and thermal energy from solar radiation. Despite its potential, the application of PVT systems is currently limited due to the unpredictable nature of solar energy and the absence of efficient thermal energy storage capabilities. To address these challenges, researchers have explored the use of phase change materials and nano-improved phase change materials (NEPCMs) to optimize energy extraction from solar systems. By incorporating these materials, the PVT system can maximize energy utilization. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the potential applications of PVT techniques in both industrial and building settings. It also offers a detailed assessment of their commercial and environmental aspects. The research findings highlight several advantages of PVT systems, including reduced electricity consumption, efficient utilization of cooling and heating loads during off-peak periods, improved temperature stability, and enhanced thermal comfort. Furthermore, the integration of NEPCMs in PVT systems has demonstrated superior thermal performance, enabling 8.3% more heat energy storage during charging and 25.1% more heat energy release during discharging. Additionally, the implementation of solar-assisted combined heating and power systems showed the potential to prevent the emission of 911 tons of CO2 per year compared to conventional PV systems. These systems offer a promising pathway towards mitigating environmental impacts while meeting energy demands. Overall, this review article serves as a valuable resource for fellow researchers by providing detailed insights into the viability of PVT systems for various applications in the industrial and building sectors.","Samykano, Mahendran",Journal,Buildings,2023-08-01,Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah,buildings ;  hybrid photovoltaic thermal systems ;  phase change materials ;  thermal energy storage
Mechatronics: A Study on Its Scientific Constitution and Association with Innovative Products,"Mechatronics as a science is a synergic combination of mechanical engineering, electronic control, and software design in product development and manufacturing processes. To understand how the field of knowledge that incorporates mechatronics in innovative products, given that it is not in itself a basic engineering discipline but an integration of fields of knowledge, has advanced, it was developed a bibliometric and qualitative study through systematic review with an analytical framework for the establishment of variables to subsidize the construction of the selected theoretical body. The results and conclusions of the sampled publications show that mechatronics performs one of the principal roles in innovation due to the multidisciplinary integration that the scope of innovation in product engineering is propitiating. The study classified five global scenarios: practical approaches aimed at product development, research that studies curricula and education in engineering, studies involving components of a mechatronic system, use of artificial intelligence, and methodologies for designing mechatronic systems. In addition to underscoring that the use of the term innovation associated with mechatronics in a large proportion of the publications extrapolates the operational level, characterizing an attribution to the term that is always associated with the applications, ramifications, and perspectives that the respective product, design, robot, or system could offer to the market or future research. Similarly, it was found that the results of many publications associate the term innovation with a return on investments or operational costs and emphasize the advantages of using the technology for commercial ends.","Cintra Faria, Ana Carolina;Barbalho, Sanderson César Macêdo",Journal,Applied System Innovation,2023-08-01,Universidade de Brasília,analysis framework ;  bibliometric analysis ;  innovation ;  mechatronic system ;  mechatronics ;  systematic review
Development of Wind Energy in EU Countries as an Alternative Resource to Fossil Fuels in the Years 2016–2022,"The aim of this article is to present solutions related to wind energy in EU countries as an alternative to fossil fuels. This article is based on secondary information and statistical data regarding the development of wind power engineering in EU countries for the years 2016–2022. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze of the relations between the development of wind energy in European Union countries and GPD (gross domestic product) per capita and selected factors. The following hypotheses were formulated: H1—There is a statistically significant correlation between GDP per capita and the use of wind energy in European Union countries. H2—There is a relationship between the length of the coastline and the use of wind energy in European Union countries. H3—There is a statistically significant correlation between the attitude to uncertainty of the inhabitants of a given country and the use of wind energy in said country. The presented research results support all these hypotheses. The results of the research regarding H2 are as follows: in the case of northern European countries (Ireland and Finland) and the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the development of wind power engineering in the study period was faster than could be inferred from the length of the coastline in these countries. Regarding hypothesis H1, it was concluded on the basis of the analysis that the involvement of countries in the development of wind power engineering is correlated with their wealth. The novelty of this paper emerges from its innovative approach to analyzing wind power engineering, its incorporation of cultural factors, its quantitative assessment of correlations, and its actionable policy recommendations. These elements collectively contribute to a comprehensive and impactful study that advances our understanding of wind energy adoption in the European Union.","Wolniak, Radosław;Skotnicka-Zasadzień, Bożena",Journal,Resources,2023-08-01,Silesian University of Technology,energy transformation ;  EU countries ;  innovation ;  wind energy ;  wind resources
Bacteriophage Therapy to Control Bovine Mastitis: A Review,"Bovine mastitis is a polymicrobial disease characterised by inflammation of the udders of dairy and beef cattle. The infection has huge implications to health and welfare of animals, impacting milk and beef production and costing up to EUR 32 billion annually to the dairy industry, globally. Bacterial communities associated with the disease include representative species from Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Actinomyces, Aerococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella and Proteus. Conventional treatment relies on antibiotics, but antimicrobial resistance, declining antibiotic innovations and biofilm production negatively impact therapeutic efficacy. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses which effectively target and lyse bacteria with extreme specificity and can be a valuable supplement or replacement to antibiotics for bovine mastitis. In this review, we provide an overview of the etiology of bovine mastitis, the advantages of phage therapy over chemical antibiotics for the strains and research work conducted in the area in various model systems to support phage deployment in the dairy industry. We emphasise work on phage isolation procedures from samples obtained from mastitic and non-mastitic sources, characterisation and efficacy testing of single and multiple phages as standalone treatments or adjuncts to probiotics in various in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo bovine mastitis infection models. Furthermore, we highlight the areas where improvements can be made with focus on phage cocktail optimisation, formulation, and genetic engineering to improve delivery, stability, efficacy, and safety in cattle. Phage therapy is becoming more attractive in clinical medicine and agriculture and thus, could mitigate the impending catastrophe of antimicrobial resistance in the dairy sector.","Nale, Janet Y.;McEwan, Neil R.",Journal,Antibiotics,2023-08-01,Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC),Actinomyces ;  Aerococcus ;  Enterococcus ;  Escherichia ;  Klebsiella ;  Proteus ;  Staphylococcus ;  Streptococcus
Augmented Reality: Current and New Trends in Education,"The educational landscape is an environment prone to change due to the volatile and ever-changing nature of the digital society in which we all live. Although the world moves at different speeds and any generalization is bound to have some exceptions, there is evidence from research conducted in different places and contexts that educational methods are becoming increasingly digitized and driven by technological innovation. Among the technological trends fueled in many cases by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to stay at home but online, augmented reality solutions received an additional boost as a valid and versatile educational technology worth exploring and eventually integrating into several teaching methods already in use. Although the technology still faces problems related to affordability, accessibility, and the technical skills required of users, some ongoing projects have already provided evidence that using augmented reality solutions as teaching and learning tools can improve teacher and student learning outcomes by increasing engagement and interactivity. The same issues arose when personal computers, tablets, and smartphones were first discussed as valuable tools for education and have now found their way into most classrooms. This paper reviews some of the key concepts related to augmented reality, as well as some current trends, benefits, and concerns related to its integration into educational contexts in areas such as life sciences, engineering, and health. The work conducted and presented in this paper provides an interesting insight into a technology that has given rise to global phenomena such as Pokémon Go, and continues to improve in terms of portability, usability, and overall user experience. Throughout the paper and in the conclusion section, we discuss the relevance of using the best features of augmented reality and how they can contribute to positive educational outcomes.","Kamińska, Dorota;Zwoliński, Grzegorz;Laska-Leśniewicz, Anna;Raposo, Rui;Vairinhos, Mário;Pereira, Elisabeth;Urem, Frane;Ljubić Hinić, Martina;Haamer, Rain Eric;Anbarjafari, Gholamreza",Journal,Electronics (Switzerland),2023-08-01,Tartu Ülikool;Universidade de Aveiro;Yıldız Teknik Üniversitesi;Lodz University of Technology;PwC Advisory;Polytechnic of Šibenik,augmented reality ;  EdTech ;  education ;  survey
Analysis of financial challenges faced by graduate students in Canada,"Graduate students are vital to the creation of research and innovation in Canada. The National Graduate Student Finance Survey was launched in 2021 by the Ottawa Science Policy Network to investigate the financial realities of Canadian graduate students. Closing in April 2022, the survey received 1305 responses from graduate students representing various geographical locations, years of study, fields of education, and demographic backgrounds. The results capture a snapshot into graduate student finances, including an in-depth analysis of stipends, scholarships, debt, tuition, and living expenses. In its entirety, we found that the majority of graduate students are facing serious financial concerns. This is largely due to stagnant funding for students both from federal and provincial granting agencies and from within their institutions. This reality is even worse for international students, members of historically underrepresented communities, and those with dependents, all of whom experience additional challenges that impact their financial security. Based on our findings, we propose several recommenda-tions to the Tri-Council agencies (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Social Science and Humanities Research Council, and Canadian Institute for Health Research) and academic institutions to strengthen graduate student finances and help sustain the future of research in Canada.","Laframboise, Sarah Jane;Bailey, Thomas;Dang, Anh Thu;Rose, Mercedes;Zhou, Zier;Berg, Matthew D.;Holland, Stephen;Abdul, Sami Aftab;O’connor, Kaela;El-Sahli, Sara;Boucher, Dominique M.;Fairman, Garrett;Deng, Jacky;Shaw, Katherine;Noblett, Nathaniel;D’addario, Alexa;Empey, Madelaine;Sinclair, Keaton",Journal,Biochemistry and Cell Biology,2023-08-01,University of Ottawa;Canadian Society of Molecular Biosciences,Canadian Research ;  Funding ;  Graduate Students ;  Scholarships ;  Stipends ;  Tri-Council
Patterns of technological capability development in Iran's steel industry: An analysis based on windows of opportunity for technological learning,"The concept of windows of opportunity is more focused on innovation development. Nevertheless, for accumulating capabilities and reduce gap with the advanced world, latecomers should use these windows of opportunity and technological learning strategies simultaneously. Based on this concept, Iran's steel can achieve innovation in some processes and there for, reviewing the experience of this industry can have lessons learned for other mineral industries as well. Using the mixed method (Case study and Multicriteria decision-making model), this research has tried to investigate and explain the opportunities for technological learning in institutional, demand, and technology dimensions. The Results showed that the government uses planning, investment, financing mechanisms, public procurement, and empowerment policies that open windows of opportunity to firms for learning technology and enhancing innovation capabilities. On the other hand, enhancing absorptive capacity through learning by doing, emergence and development of technical-engineering companies, suppliers of equipment and parts abilities, and Innovation through R&D efforts, buying technology licenses, join manufacturing the equipment with MNCs and suppliers were the most import of windows for technological learning. Result of the DEMATEL technique, not only describe the interrelationship between all windows of opportunity, but also it shows that smart and open relationship with the world which affects by sanctions is the most influential factor for technological learning.","Attarpour, Mohammad Reza;Elyasi, Mahdi;Mohammadi, Akbar",Journal,Resources Policy,2023-08-01,Allameh Tabataba'i University;Institute for Trade Studies and Research,Steel industry ;  Technological learning ;  Windows of opportunity
"The Role of Buildings in Rural Areas: Trends, Challenges, and Innovations for Sustainable Development","Rural buildings represent the functional relationship between rural communities and agricultural land. Therefore, research on rural buildings has practical repercussions on environmental and socio-economic sustainability. Comprehensive state-of-the-art research on rural buildings may address research activities. We present a systematic review of the scientific research between 2000 and 2022 based on the PRISMA protocol. Five main topics were identified. The results showed that the primary research focus was production (25.1%) and environmental management issues (23.2%). However, construction and efficiency are rapidly taking centre stage (20.6%). Regarding sustainability (20.8%), life cycle assessment, green buildings, recycling and global warming should be the future research focus. Energy efficiency will benefit from studies on thermal energy. More research on engineering and technologies (10.3%), specifically remote and automatic detection and transport in rural areas, will increase cost efficiency. The results may help improve the global efficiency of rural buildings in a modern farming system.","Cogato, Alessia;Cei, Leonardo;Marinello, Francesco;Pezzuolo, Andrea",Journal,Agronomy,2023-08-01,Università degli Studi di Padova,farm building ;  rural development ;  smart technologies ;  sustainable construction
Design for Additive Manufacturing: Recent Innovations and Future Directions,"Design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) provides a necessary framework for using novel additive manufacturing (AM) technologies for engineering innovations. Recent AM advances include shaping nickel-based superalloys for lightweight aerospace applications, reducing environmental impacts with large-scale concrete printing, and personalizing food and medical devices for improved health. Although many new capabilities are enabled by AM, design advances are necessary to ensure the technology reaches its full potential. Here, DfAM research is reviewed in the context of Fabrication, Generation, and Assessment phases that bridge the gap between AM capabilities and design innovations. Materials, processes, and constraints are considered during fabrication steps to understand AM capabilities for building systems with specified properties and functions. Design generation steps include conceptualization, configuration, and optimization to drive the creation of high-performance AM designs. Assessment steps are necessary for validating, testing, and modeling systems for future iterations and improvements. These phases provide context for discussing innovations in aerospace, automotives, construction, food, medicine, and robotics while highlighting future opportunities for design services, bio-inspired design, fabrication robots, and machine learning. Overall, DfAM has positively impacted diverse engineering applications, and further research has great potential for driving new developments in design innovation.","Egan, Paul F.",Journal,Designs,2023-08-01,Edward E.

National-Standards- and Deep-Learning-Oriented Raster and Vector Benchmark Dataset (RVBD) for Land-Use/Land-Cover Mapping in the Yangtze River Basin,"A high-quality remote sensing interpretation dataset has become crucial for driving an intelligent model, i.e., deep learning (DL), to produce land-use/land-cover (LULC) products. The existing remote sensing datasets face the following issues: the current studies (1) lack object-oriented fine-grained information; (2) they cannot meet national standards; (3) they lack field surveys for labeling samples; and (4) they cannot serve for geographic engineering application directly. To address these gaps, the national-standards- and DL-oriented raster and vector benchmark dataset (RVBD) is the first to be established to map LULC for conducting soil water erosion assessment (SWEA). RVBD has the following significant innovation and contributions: (1) it is the first second-level object- and DL-oriented dataset with raster and vector data for LULC mapping; (2) its classification system conforms to the national industry standards of the Ministry of Water Resources of the People’s Republic of China; (3) it has high-quality LULC interpretation accuracy assisted by field surveys rather than indoor visual interpretation; and (4) it could be applied to serve for SWEA. Our dataset is constructed as follows: (1) spatio-temporal-spectrum information is utilized to perform automatic vectorization and label LULC attributes conforming to the national standards; and (2) several remarkable DL networks (DenseNet161, HorNet, EfficientNetB7, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer) are chosen as the baselines to train our dataset, and five evaluation metrics are chosen to perform quantitative evaluation. Experimental results verify the reliability and effectiveness of RVBD. Each chosen network achieves a minimum overall accuracy of 0.81 and a minimum Kappa of 0.80, and Vision Transformer achieves the best classification performance with overall accuracy of 0.87 and Kappa of 0.86. It indicates that RVBD is a significant benchmark, which could lay a foundation for intelligent interpretation of relevant geographic research about SWEA in the Yangtze River Basin and promote artificial intelligence technology to enrich geographical theories and methods.","Zhang, Pengfei;Wu, Yijin;Li, Chang;Li, Renhua;Yao, He;Zhang, Yong;Zhang, Genlin;Li, Dehua",Journal,Remote Sensing,2023-08-01,Changjiang Water Resources Commission;Central China Normal University,deep learning ;  land-use/land-cover mapping ;  object-oriented image classification ;  remote sensing dataset ;  soil water erosion assessment
The impact of natural resources on technology innovation from cross-country panel data: A comparative analysis and policy-level insights,"The study aims to examine the direct impact of natural resources on technology innovation by considering the critical role of five dimensions of technology innovation (ICT development, R&D activity, skills, industry activity and access to finance). For this purpose, the common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG) estimator is applied to estimate cross-country panel data encompassing 102 countries from 2008 to 2018. Under the global sample, the empirical evidence strongly supports that natural resources hinder ICT development and R&D activity but have a positive impact on industry activity and access to finance, which shows a traceable path of the resource blessing. In addition, for overall technology innovation, ICT development, R&D and industry activity, the resource curse is effectively transformed into a resource blessing in high-income countries, which benefits from the high level of manufacturing, modern services and industrial structure. When considering the chronological evolution, natural resources show a negative effect on overall technology innovation in the first period and a positive effect in the second period in low-income countries. On this basis, challenges and initiatives in three phases are proposed to better achieve resource blessing, including resource regulation, human resource reserve, international trade adjustment, industrial structure transformation and financial investment optimization. Lastly, policy-level insights on the different dimensions of technology innovation are proposed to provide guidance and valuable reference for policymakers.","Xiao, Anran;Xu, Zeshui;Qin, Yong;Lv, Shengnan;Skare, Marinko",Journal,Resources Policy,2023-08-01,Juraj Dobrila University of Pula;Business School of Sichuan University;Akademia Ekonomiczno-Humanistyczna w Warszawie,AMG estimator ;  CCEMG estimator ;  Natural capital ;  Resource curse ;  Technology innovation
Smart and innovative nanotechnology applications for water purification,"The most critical challenge of the twenty-first century is to provide sufficient clean, cheap water for all. This is made worse by population increase, climate change, and declining water quality. Technology innovation, such as nanotechnology, is essential for enabling integrated water management to increase treatment effectiveness and expand water supplies using unconventional water sources. Nanotechnology can improve access to clean, safe drinking water by providing innovative nanomaterials for treating surface water, groundwater, and wastewater contaminated by hazardous metal ions, inorganic and organic solutes, and microorganisms. As a result, the development of nanotechnology provided ground-breaking solutions to issues in engineering, physics, chemistry, and others. The products and processes developed because of advancements in nanotechnology currently employed in wastewater treatment include nanoadsorbents, nano zero valent iron, nanobiocides, nanofiltration, magnetic nanoparticles, and hybrid technology provides for catalytic wet air oxidation in addition to nanoparticles. Considering the essential need to examine and handle the developing hazardous wastes with lower costs, less energy, and more efficiency, this review shines a light on the current advancements in nanotechnology.

Does green technology innovation contribute to logistics companies’ market value? The effects of stakeholder engagement and public attention,"Although logistics companies are encouraged to carry out green technology innovation (GTI) to mitigate their carbon footprint and negative environmental impact, the performance effect of GTI still needs more conclusive evidence. Building on the resource-based view and stakeholder theory, we investigate the impact of logistics companies’ GTI on their market value and further explore the moderating effects of stakeholder engagement and public attention. We use panel data from 53 publicly listed Chinese logistics companies between 2011 and 2021 to test our hypothesized model. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between GTI and market value. Interestingly, supply chain partner engagement steepens the inverted U-shaped GTI–market value linkage, whereas scientific institution engagement flattens this curvilinear linkage. In addition, public attention weakens this inverted U-shaped GTI–market value relationship. Our study extends the logistics literature by untangling the curvilinear GTI–market value relationship and the distinct moderating effects of stakeholder engagement and public attention on this relationship. It also provides managerial advice for managers in the Chinese logistics industry.","Shou, Yongyi;Wu, Chang;Shao, Jinan;Hu, Wenjin;Lai, Kee hung",Journal,Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2023-08-01,"Nottingham University Business School China;School of Management, Zhejiang University;ETH Zürich;Hangzhou Dianzi University;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University",Green technology innovation ;  Logistics company ;  Market value ;  Public attention ;  Stakeholder engagement
Marine Ranching Engineering Collaborative Innovation from the Perspective of Ecological Environment,"As a resource development model with both economic and ecological functions, the environmental friendliness of marine ranching products meets the environmental needs of consumers. However, the lack of technological innovation ability limits the development of marine ranching. Therefore, this research builds a marine ranching collaborative innovation system with multi-agent participation. Evolutionary game theory is used to analyze strategic choices of all parties and the conditions of system equilibrium, and numerical simulation is used to analyze the effect of relevant factors. This paper integrates the benefits from the improvement of environmental friendliness into the payoff matrix, and explains the significance of collaborative innovation to the development of marine ranching from the perspective of ecological environment. The results showed: the participation willingness of marine ranching enterprises is positively related to open innovation subject, while the participation willingness of the other two parties is negatively related to the government; The incentive effect of collaboration is negatively correlated with the government’s will, positively correlated with the other two parties; The incentive effect of government subsidies positively affects the willingness of the three parties to participate. Finally, suggestions are provided for each participant to maintain the strategic choice of marine ranching collaborative innovation system.","Wan, Xiaole;Zhang, Guixian;Li, Qianqian",Journal,Journal of Ocean University of China,2023-08-01,Ocean University of China,collaborative innovation ;  ecological environment ;  evolutionary game ;  marine ranching engineering ;  numerical simulations
Management of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after trastuzumab deruxtecan failure,"The current treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC) has been greatly impacted in the past decade by the introduction of antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), which represent a relatively novel therapeutic class with the peculiar ability to deliver otherwise overtly toxic chemotherapeutics to tumor sites by exploiting the specificities of monoclonal antibodies. Indeed, drug engineering refinements in ADC design, such as through the introduction of cleavable linkers and hydrophobic payloads, resulted in improved patient outcomes in recent years. Two different ADCs, namely trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), have already entered clinical practice for the treatment of HER2-positive ABC. In this scenario, T-DXd has shown to portend better survival outcomes compared to T-DM1, while leaving a large unsought area of unmet medical need upon T-DXd failure. Treatment decision and benefit of cancer drugs following T-DXd still represent an area of clinical controversy, where a preclinical investigation and clinical development should be prioritized. As the pace of innovation is currently accelerating, and with novel ADC formulations advancing in early-phase clinical trials, the whole BC field is changing at an unprecedented rate, with potential broadenings of therapeutic indications. In this review, we present the clinical landscape of HER2-positive advanced BC and discuss our vision on how to tackle T-DXd resistance, providing a perspective on the priority areas of the cancer research in this setting.","Antonarelli, G.;Corti, C.;Tarantino, P.;Salimbeni, B.

Recent advancements on designing transition metal-based carbon-supported single atom catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis: Miles to go for sustainable Zn-air batteries,"Metal-air batteries, especially, rechargeable zinc–air batteries (ZABs) have recently rejuvenated extensive research attention as a promising sustainable energy technology, owing to its environment friendliness, low manufacturing cost, and high theoretical specific energy density. However, the real-time application of ZABs is yet to be achieved and it is mainly hindered due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen-involved reactions. The two fundamental electrode reactions, specifically, oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction reinforce discharging and charging processes of ZABs. Therefore, uninterrupted research endeavours in developing novel design strategies is the crucial step to realize effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, which will rapid-up further progress of ZABs for commercialization. Recently, single atom catalysts (SACs) supported on various carbon scaffolds with maximized atom-utilization efficiency, unique metal coordination environments, abundant anchoring sites with exceptional tunability, ordered porosity, and selectivity have emerged as potential candidates for motivating oxygen electrocatalysis. Significant advances have been accomplished in designing SACs with commendable oxygen electrocatalytic activity, still great challenges need to be surmounted in order to make them viable for electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. In this review, we have provided an overview of synthesis strategies, oxygen electrocatalytic performances, and identification of carbon-supported SACs. We have critically examined the role of coordination environment, engineering of isolated reactive centers, tailoring of the metal active centers, and modulation of the configuration of carbon substrates on the oxygen electrocatalytic activity. Finally, we concluded by highlighting the existing challenges and future research directions for further innovation of carbon-supported SACs for ZAB applications.","Das, Srijib;Kundu, Aniruddha;Kuila, Tapas;Murmu, Naresh Chandra",Journal,Energy Storage Materials,2023-08-01,Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR);Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute India,Coordination environment ;  Oxygen electrocatalysis ;  Single atom catalysts ;  Synthesis strategies ;  Zn-air battery
Land use/land cover of petroleum activities in the framework of sustainable development,"Soil is an important resource for the development of life and the quality of natural ecosystems. Oil exploitation requires the implementation of complementary infrastructure such as access to highways, water, and energy supplies. These engineering projects can alter the dynamics of natural ecosystems. This study analyses the relationship between land use and land cover (LULC) and oil activity through bibliometric tools and a literature review of the applications of sustainable development strategies. The methodology includes 1) compilation of information from the LULC associated with the oil industry. 2) Data processing and analyses. 3) Interpretation of results within the sustainable development framework. The results indicate that bioenergy studies, climate change, sustainability, and environmental impact assessment tools are trending in this area. The literature review showed that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG9), Climate Action (SDG13), Life Below Water (SDG14), and Life on Land (SDG15) are related directly to various topics of study.

Incentivizing green technology innovation to confront sustainable development,"Sustainable development relies to some extent on the ability of key industries to transition towards production based on green technologies. The shift to green technology can occur through incremental innovation or disruptive innovation. Moreover, market forces will not usually promote a shift to green products without government intervention. We assume a market where incumbents and new entrants, characterized as low and high-cost producers, respectively, manufacture a product. They receive subsidies from the government for choosing a type of green technology innovation, which, in turn, affects their production costs. Two types of incentives are considered: subsidizing technology innovation or the product itself. The theoretical model and numerical simulations developed herein indicate that both types of firms choose incremental innovation when subsidizing the product. However, when subsidizing green innovation, new entrants are the first to choose disruptive innovation. Interestingly, incumbents will follow only if the subsidy is high enough. Our results suggest that new entrants, disadvantaged by their higher costs, use the subsidy to catch up with incumbents. Therefore, they embrace disruptive innovation to potentially change the market's structure in their favor. We discuss the policy implications of these results for advancing sustainable development.","Song, Yang;Zhang, Zhiyuan;Sahut, Jean Michel;Rubin, Ofir",Journal,Technovation,2023-08-01,Ben-Gurion University of the Negev;Jilin University;IDRAC Business School,Disruptive innovation ;  Evolutionary game ;  Government subsidy ;  Sustainable development
Leading the challenges of implementing new technologies in organizations,"Organizations in general and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular acquire new technology innovation (NTI) to bolster their competitiveness, but they often find that the outcomes of efforts to effectively implement them are disappointing. This raises the question—how organizations can improve the NTI process and particularly how senior leaders influence it. By employing a qualitative methodology—sourcing and analyzing data derived from 28 in-depth interviews with internal and external sources (CEOs, implementation managers, and professional technology integrators)—we delineate the ways whereby organizations and their leaders can facilitate the NTI process. Our research reveals the main hurdles of the NTI process in SMEs and the role of senior leadership in harnessing the employees to engage in a complex and challenging process, creating conditions to overcome technology-related and non-technology-related hurdles to more fully realize the potential of the acquired new technology. In so doing, we contribute to the literature of technology management and innovation by enhancing our understanding about the leadership influences on the NTI process.","Haber, Liat;Carmeli, Abraham",Journal,Technology in Society,2023-08-01,Tel Aviv University,Change management ;  Innovation ;  Leadership ;  New technology implementation ;  Technology management ;  Work conditions
Ionic Liquid Based Treatment – A Potential Strategy to Modify Bacterial Cellulose,"The constant need for advanced materials led by modern research continues the exploitation of old remedies and innovation to find new solutions. The use of ionic liquids (ILs) as solvents has revolutionized modern chemical research. The non-toxic green technology has inspired new paradigms in chemical reactions and synthesis. Developing nontoxic materials for industrial and biomedical applications has endorsed the use of ILs in synthesis and fabrication. In terms of biomedical materials, the exploration for novel technologies to deal with chronic and nonhealing injuries desires degradable materials. One of the vastly used biomaterials is cellulose, which is nondegradable on its own unless digested by special enzymes produced by bacteria in nature. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a naturally occurring more refined and purified form of cellulose which again is nondegradable on its own. Looking for technologies that can modify the BC in situ or ex situ is a challenge. This review is bound to give insight into the current scientific research being conducted to render BC degradable for biomedical applications. The data has been collected through Clarivate analysis, Google search, PubMed Central Identifier (PMCID), and Research Gate.

Value of dual-credit policy: Evidence from green technology innovation efficiency,"The dual-credit policy (DCP), introduced by the Chinese government in 2017, aims to establish a market-based mechanism for fostering the coordinated development of energy-efficient and new energy vehicles in the automobile industry through a credit trading system. This policy plays a significant role in promoting green technology innovation, thereby contributing to the low-carbon transformation of the transportation sector in line with the dual-carbon target. However, challenges related to policy design and substantial variations among automakers during the implementation process have cast uncertainty on the effectiveness of the DCP. To address this issue, this study examines the impact and mechanisms of the DCP on the green technology innovation efficiency (GTIE) of automakers by utilizing a sample of 18 Chinese A-share listed automakers from 2012 to 2020. The analysis employs a combination of the propensity score matching (PSM) and difference-in-differences (DID) approaches. The empirical findings indicate that the introduction of the DCP significantly improves the GTIE of automakers. However, the intensity of this effect diminishes over time. The promotion of GTIE is primarily achieved by alleviating automakers’ financial constraints and increasing their management fund inputs. Furthermore, this effect is strengthened by customer concentration and supply chain concentration. Additionally, the study identifies certain enterprise characteristics that generate heterogeneity in the effects of the DCP, including enterprise ownership, region, and executive education background. The results reveal that the DCP has a more pronounced impact on private automakers, those located in eastern regions, and those with lower levels of executive education.","He, Haonan;Li, Shiqiang;Wang, Shanyong;Zhang, Chaojia;Ma, Fei",Journal,Transport Policy,2023-08-01,Chang'an University;University of Science and Technology of China,Dual-carbon target ;  Dual-credit policy ;  Green technology innovation efficiency ;  PSM-DID
Exploring the effects of energy quota trading policy on carbon emission efficiency: Quasi-experimental evidence from China,"Deepening the reform of energy market allocation is an endogenous motivation that strongly supports carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. China launched a pilot policy of energy quota trading (EQT) in 2016, yet little literature examines its effect on carbon emission reduction. To fill this gap, based on a quasi-natural experimental design with causal inference, this paper employs a difference-in-differences approach to explore the effect of the pilot EQT policy on carbon emission efficiency, as well as the spatial spillover effect, and its influential mechanisms. Results show that the EQT policy can contribute significantly to the improvement of carbon emission efficiency with a dynamic effect of about 3 years. The policy is more likely to promote carbon emission efficiency in northern cities than in southern cities. Also, the positive effect of the EQT policy on carbon emission efficiency is larger and more significant in cities with richer resource endowments than in other cities. It is important that the EQT policy promotes carbon efficiency by stimulating green technology innovation, mitigating energy misallocation and optimizing transportation networks. Moreover, this policy exhibits spatial spillover effect on emission reductions for neighboring areas, and synergetic pollution reduction effect for other air pollutants. This paper expands a theoretical framework for the relationship between EQT and carbon emission reduction. Our evidence highlights the essential role played by EQT in facilitating the low-carbon economy development and carbon neutrality.","Du, Minzhe;Wu, Fenger;Ye, Danfeng;Zhao, Yating;Liao, Liping",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-08-01,Guangdong University of Finance & Economics;South China Normal University,Carbon emission efficiency ;  Energy misallocation ;  Energy quota trading policy ;  Green technology innovation ;  Transportation networks
Do pilot zones for green finance reform and innovation promote energy savings? Evidence from China,"The establishment of pilot zones for green finance reform and innovation (PZGFRI) is an important green financial policy in China and a crucial means to achieve the objective of energy conservation and emissions reduction. This paper uses panel data of 45 prefecture-level cities in Chinese provinces where pilot zones are located from 2004 to 2019 to study the impacts of the PZGFRI on urban energy savings, by constructing Difference-in-Differences models. The results show that the PZGFRI significantly reduce industrial energy consumption but has no effect on residential energy consumption. The PZGFRI achieve energy savings by promoting green technology innovation, and this effect could be weakened by the fiscal extractive capacity of local government. There is regional heterogeneity in the energy-saving effects of the PZGFRI, and there is also heterogeneity in whether the pilot cities are “Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Demonstration Cities”. There are long-term dynamic and spatial spillover effects of the PZGFRI on urban energy savings. These findings not only have practical significance for strengthening energy savings through the green financial policy in China, but also give some important references for other developing countries.","Zhang, Zhenhua;Wang, Jing;Feng, Chao;Chen, Xi",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-08-01,Lanzhou University;Chongqing University,Difference-in-differences model ;  Energy savings ;  Fiscal extractive capacity ;  Green finance ;  Green technology innovation
Predicting and analyzing technology convergence for exploring technological opportunities in the smart health industry,"Technology convergence (TC) represents a prevailing innovation pattern in various industries, as it enables the integration of two or more existing technologies to create new hybrid technologies or even a new technological domain, transforming the way firms compete with each other. The advent of smart health can be attributed to the convergence of various technologies, including wireless communication, embedded systems, artificial intelligence (AI), medical technologies, and information security. It is essential for smart health firms to systematically comprehend TC patterns and anticipate emerging convergent technologies at an early stage to leverage potential technological opportunities. This paper proposes a machine learning methodology that integrates network analysis to predict and analyze changing TC patterns from patent data related to smart health. A machine learning-based link prediction method is developed to forecast convergent technologies from a comprehensive set of link prediction measures. Network centrality analysis is then used to understand and evaluate the convergent patterns in the predicted technological knowledge interaction network and identify critical convergent technologies that may play significant roles in the future. The research not only demonstrates that convergent innovation is a continually growing trend in the smart health industry but also identifies several important emerging convergent patterns.","Wang, Juite;Lee, Jheng Jie",Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023-08-01,National Chung Hsing University,Link Prediction ;  Machine Learning ;  Smart Health ;  Technological Opportunity Analysis ;  Technology Convergence

Engineering versatile Au-based catalysts for solar-to-fuel conversion,"Gold (Au) nanostructures (NSs) have been widely employed as cocatalysts to improve the photoactivity of semiconductor materials, while a systematic summary of the engineering approaches of Au NSs to maximize the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency is still lacking. In this review, the recently developed strategies for elevating the overall photocatalytic performance of Au-based catalysts and the deep physical chemistry mechanisms are highlighted. Firstly, the synthetic approaches of Au NSs are summarized, followed by an elaboration on their multiple functions in improving photoactivity. Afterward, modification strategies of Au NSs used to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of Au-semiconductor composites, including controlling the Au NSs morphology, size, crystal phase, defect engineering, alloying with different metals, modulating interfacial interaction, and introducing an external field, are summarized and discussed independently. Additionally, advanced characterization techniques that can provide insights into the charge dynamics of the photocatalysts are introduced. Finally, we share our opinion on the challenges and outline potentially promising opportunities and directions for efficient Au-based photocatalysis research moving forward.

Assessing the Effect of Particle Size Distribution on Permeability of Silty-Sandy Soils,"The hydraulic conductivity is an important parameter in geotechnical studies. This parameter is required for analyzing, predicting, or modeling water flow, contamination movement and chemical transport in porous media of engineering constructions. Particle size distribution, is one of the most important factors affecting soil permeability. The main aim of the present research is assessing the effect of particle size distribution on the permeability coefficient of silty-sandy soils. For this purpose, three sandy soils and one silty soil from different regions of northern Iran have been selected and non-disturbed and disturbed samples have been provided from them. In the laboratory, the sandy soils were mixed with 10, 20, 30, and 40% of the silty soil, which is can be considered as an innovation for this research, and the physical properties were determined for all samples. To evaluate the permeability coefficient of the samples, first the suitable laboratory specimens were reconstructed with a relative density of 0.55 and then tested by a falling head permeameter apparatus. The obtained results indicated that the evaluated permeability coefficient is completely related to the particle size distribution indices of the soils, so that it increases linearly with increasing some indices namely D10, and D30 as well as decreases with increasing the other indices namely D50, D60, coefficient of uniformity (Cu), and Coefficient of curvature (Cc) as power functions. These found from six regression models developed between the parameters. The values of five calculated statistical indices were revealed that the developed models have high performance degree.

Effect of loading-induced damage on chloride ingress behavior of recycled aggregate concrete: A comprehensive review,"The recycling technology of construction and demolition wastes is an inevitable choice towards the sustainable development of the construction industry, aiming at addressing the problems of raw materials shortage and waste disposal. The utilization of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) in new concrete production has been identified as an effective way to reasonable application of natural resources replacement and environmental preservation. In service, external mechanical loading can easily cause the initiation and interconnectivity of microcracks inside concrete, specifically the complex multiple interface structures of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) due to the old adhered mortar at the surface of RCAs, which can remarkably accelerate the process of water penetration and aggressive ions penetration into concrete. Thus, knowledge of mass transport properties in the loading-induced damaged RAC contributes to the durability evaluation of RAC and its extensive application in the practical engineering. This paper reviews the previous findings on the mechanical loading effects on the chloride transport properties of RAC. The effects of loading-induced damage on microstructure evolution of RAC as well as the damage characteristics were discussed. The research progress on the chloride ingress behavior of RAC subjected to mechanical loading was highlighted from the viewpoint of testing method, loading devices and numerical calculation, and the modified effects on the transport properties were further analyzed. On this basis, the future research on the durability-related properties of RAC would be finally proposed, which is helpful to further perfect theoretical development and technological innovation of RAC durability in the aggressive environment.","Bao, Jiuwen;Wang, Yunwei;Zhang, Hongrui;Li, Shuguo;Zhang, Peng;Qin, Ling;Song, Qiang",Journal,Cement and Concrete Composites,2023-08-01,Qingdao University of Technology,Chloride transport ;  Load-induced damage ;  Mechanical loading ;  Recycled aggregate concrete
Effects of sleep disturbance on dyspnoea and impaired lung function following hospital admission due to COVID-19 in the UK: a prospective multicentre cohort study,"Background: Sleep disturbance is common following hospital admission both for COVID-19 and other causes. The clinical associations of this for recovery after hospital admission are poorly understood despite sleep disturbance contributing to morbidity in other scenarios. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and nature of sleep disturbance after discharge following hospital admission for COVID-19 and to assess whether this was associated with dyspnoea. Methods: CircCOVID was a prospective multicentre cohort substudy designed to investigate the effects of circadian disruption and sleep disturbance on recovery after COVID-19 in a cohort of participants aged 18 years or older, admitted to hospital for COVID-19 in the UK, and discharged between March, 2020, and October, 2021. Participants were recruited from the Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID). Follow-up data were collected at two timepoints: an early time point 2–7 months after hospital discharge and a later time point 10–14 months after hospital discharge. Sleep quality was assessed subjectively using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and a numerical rating scale. Sleep quality was also assessed with an accelerometer worn on the wrist (actigraphy) for 14 days. Participants were also clinically phenotyped, including assessment of symptoms (ie, anxiety [Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale questionnaire], muscle function [SARC-F questionnaire], dyspnoea [Dyspnoea-12 questionnaire] and measurement of lung function), at the early timepoint after discharge. Actigraphy results were also compared to a matched UK Biobank cohort (non-hospitalised individuals and recently hospitalised individuals). Multivariable linear regression was used to define associations of sleep disturbance with the primary outcome of breathlessness and the other clinical symptoms. PHOSP-COVID is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107). Findings: 2320 of 2468 participants in the PHOSP-COVID study attended an early timepoint research visit a median of 5 months (IQR 4–6) following discharge from 83 hospitals in the UK. Data for sleep quality were assessed by subjective measures (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and the numerical rating scale) for 638 participants at the early time point. Sleep quality was also assessed using device-based measures (actigraphy) a median of 7 months (IQR 5–8 months) after discharge from hospital for 729 participants. After discharge from hospital, the majority (396 [62%] of 638) of participants who had been admitted to hospital for COVID-19 reported poor sleep quality in response to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. A comparable proportion (338 [53%] of 638) of participants felt their sleep quality had deteriorated following discharge after COVID-19 admission, as assessed by the numerical rating scale. Device-based measurements were compared to an age-matched, sex-matched, BMI-matched, and time from discharge-matched UK Biobank cohort who had recently been admitted to hospital. Compared to the recently hospitalised matched UK Biobank cohort, participants in our study slept on average 65 min (95% CI 59 to 71) longer, had a lower sleep regularity index (–19%; 95% CI –20 to –16), and a lower sleep efficiency (3·83 percentage points; 95% CI 3·40 to 4·26). Similar results were obtained when comparisons were made with the non-hospitalised UK Biobank cohort. Overall sleep quality (unadjusted effect estimate 3·94; 95% CI 2·78 to 5·10), deterioration in sleep quality following hospital admission (3·00; 1·82 to 4·28), and sleep regularity (4·38; 2·10 to 6·65) were associated with higher dyspnoea scores. Poor sleep quality, deterioration in sleep quality, and sleep regularity were also associated with impaired lung function, as assessed by forced vital capacity. Depending on the sleep metric, anxiety mediated 18–39% of the effect of sleep disturbance on dyspnoea, while muscle weakness mediated 27–41% of this effect. Interpretation: Sleep disturbance following hospital admission for COVID-19 is associated with dyspnoea, anxiety, and muscle weakness. Due to the association with multiple symptoms, targeting sleep disturbance might be beneficial in treating the post-COVID-19 condition.

How does the energy-consuming rights trading policy affect China's carbon emission intensity?,"Developing a low-carbon economy requires reducing not only CO2 emissions but also the emission intensity. Analyzing carbon emission intensity can provide a better understanding of emission reduction efficiency and the resulting economic outcomes. Moreover, energy use adjustment is essential to achieve carbon reduction. By improving energy efficiency and structure, China's Energy-Consuming Rights Trading (ECRT) policy may reduce CO2 emission intensity. Further, it may motivate businesses to invest in new technologies and increase productivity to obtain economic dividends. We adopt the difference-in-differences (DID) method to explore the effect of the ECRT strategy on carbon emission intensity. The study demonstrates that the policy dramatically reduces the intensity of regional carbon emissions. Carbon intensity can be reduced in two ways: decreasing the scale of CO2 emissions and increasing economic profits. Further, the ECRT strategy may have a large positive impact on regional green technology innovation and produce the Porter effect. We also find regional heterogeneity in the effects of the ECRT policy. Our study not only enriches knowledge on the effects of the ECRT policy but also may aid relevant departments to enhance the ECRT system further.","Wang, Kaike;Su, Xuewei;Wang, Shuhong",Journal,Energy,2023-08-01,Shandong University of Finance and Economics,Carbon emission intensity ;  DID ;  Energy-consuming rights trading policy ;  Green technology innovation
StartCards — A method for early-stage software startups,"Context: Software startups are important drivers of economy on a global scale, and have become associated with innovation and high growth. However, the overwhelming majority of startups ends in failure. Many of these startup failures ultimately stem from software engineering issues, and requirements engineering (RE) ones in particular. Despite the emphasis placed on the importance of RE activities in the startup context, many startups continue to develop software without a clear market or customer, having never had meaningful contact with their would-be customer. Objective: We develop a method aimed at early-stage startups that is intended to help startups through the initial stages of the startup process: StartCards. The method emphasizes the importance of idea and product validation activities in particular in order to tackle anti-patterns related to (a lack of) RE in startups. This method is based on existing literature, both grey and academic literature. Method: StartCards was developed using the Canonical Action Research (CAR) approach, over the course of 4 AR cycles. During the AR process, the method was used by 44 student startup teams in a practical course setting. Data from the use of the method was collected through self-reporting in the form of modified learning diaries, mentoring meetings with the startup teams, and a qualitative survey. Results: We consider the current version of StartCards useful for early-stage startups based on the data we have collected. The method can also be used as a pedagogical tool in startup education. Conclusions: The paper presents the first published version of the method. While work on the method continues, the method is deemed ready for use.","Kemell, Kai Kristian;Nguyen-Duc, Anh;Suoranta, Mari;Abrahamsson, Pekka",Journal,Information and Software Technology,2023-08-01,Jyväskylä University School of Business and Economics;University of South-Eastern Norway;Tampere University;Helsingin Yliopisto,Action research ;  Requirements engineering ;  Software engineering method ;  Software startups ;  Validation
Can artificial intelligence and robotic nurses replace operating room nurses? The quasi-experimental research,"Operating room nurses, who have an important place in the professional healthcare team, should be able to use technology effectively and adapt to innovations. This study is expected to shed light on how effective the development of robotic technologies and artificial intelligence and their integration into operating room nursing will be in fulfilling the requirements of contemporary nursing philosophy. This study was designed as a single group pre- and post-test quasi-experimental study. The quasi-experimental (pretest–posttest) research design was utilized to conduct the study in a Training and Research Hospital in Western Turkey. The nurses (n = 35) working in the operating room of the aforementioned hospital were included in the study. In this study, we aimed to determine whether operating room nurses experienced anxiety due to the use of artificial intelligence and robotic nurses, and the effectiveness of the training given to them in order to raise their awareness. The following three tools were used for data collection: The Nurses’ Descriptive Characteristics Form, Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Questionnaire, and Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale. Data extraction and analysis were performed in a narrative and tabular way. According to this study, the training given to the operating room nurses significantly increased their knowledge levels about artificial intelligence and robotic nurses, and increased their artificial intelligence- and robotic nurse-related anxiety significantly (p < 0.05). The participating operating room nurses experienced limitations regarding current information, training programs and learning opportunities on robotic surgery. We recommend that the operating room nurses should be provided with trainings on artificial intelligence technologies and robotic nurses, and that they should be enabled to use these information technologies regarding future technologies actively.","Ergin, Eda;Karaarslan, Duygu;Şahan, Seda;Bingöl, Ümran",Journal,Journal of Robotic Surgery,2023-08-01,Izmir Bakircay University;Manisa Celâl Bayar Üniversitesi,Artificial intelligence ;  Operating room nurses ;  Operating rooms ;  Robotic nurses
Fostering an Innovation Culture in the Education Sector: A Scoping Review and Bibliometric Analysis of Hackathon Research,"Despite originating in the tech industry, hackathons have now been adopted in a variety of domains. However, little is known about the status of hackathon literature within educational research. As the number of studies grows, it is essential to develop an understanding of the current state and identify prevalent topics and trends shaping the literature.

Collectively, the dataset amassed 1,312 citations with an average of 6.69 citations per document. The most prevalent subject areas were computer science, social sciences, engineering, medicine, and business. Word frequency analysis showed that “innovation” was the most occurring word, which represents the fundamental objective of hackathon events. The most influential work was the analysis of hackathons as an informal learning platform. Engineering education was the most trending topic while healthcare is an emerging research cluster. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the hackathon literature and its research landscape in an educational setting.","Garcia, Manuel B.",Journal,Innovative Higher Education,2023-08-01,FEU Institute of Technology;University of the Philippines Diliman,Bibliometric analysis ;  Education ;  Experiential learning ;  Hackathon ;  Innovation ;  Scoping review
"Energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, exergoenvironmental, and transient analysis of a gas-fired power plant-driven proposed system with combined Rankine cycle: thermoelectric for power production under different weather conditions","The present study proposes a system that can reduce environmental pollution emissions while simultaneously improving production capacity. The current research innovation is the use of the thermoelectric generator system and the organic Rankine cycle in conjunction with a gas turbine based on the Brayton cycle. The thermodynamic engineering equation solver software is utilized in this study to model the investigated system and acquire the system analysis results. The efficiency of the gas turbine, the competency criterion of a thermoelectric generator, compressor pressure ratio, inlet temperature to the organic turbine, and inlet temperature to gas turbine are the most relevant and practical parameters in this study. In addition, the system's exergy study revealed that the most exergy was destroyed in the combustion chamber, evaporator, gas turbine, and thermoelectric. Also, the economic analysis of the system showed that the increased cost of the system is related to the Brayton cycle unit and the steam cycle unit, respectively. Finally, a comparative case study was conducted for four cities: Abadan, Esfahan, Mashhad, and Shiraz, to evaluate the total production capacity of the system. The system performance results were evaluated with the changes in annual ambient temperature. The results showed that the system works best in the cooler climate of Mashhad.","Assareh, Ehsanolah;Hoseinzadeh, Siamak;Ghersi, Djamal Eddine;Farhadi, Ehsan;Keykhah, Sajjad;Lee, Moonyong",Journal,Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,2023-08-01,"Université des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene;Sapienza Università di Roma;Islamic Azad University, Dezful Branch;Yeungnam University",Different climate ;  Exergy ;  Gas turbine ;  Power plant ;  Thermoelectric
Is an Imitation Strategy an Enabler or a Hindrance for Exploitative or Exploratory Innovation?—The Moderating Effect of Embeddedness in Knowledge Networks,"The present open innovation environment provides firms with considerable opportunities to imitate and learn from one another and makes them deeply embedded in knowledge networks, where the structural position has a great influence on firms’ R&D activities. However, the relationship between imitation and innovation, as two primary R&D approaches that firms follow in technological development, remains inconclusive. To address the inconsistent arguments concerning the appropriate role of imitation, this article explores the effects of imitation and its interaction with embeddedness in knowledge networks on two types of technological innovation: exploitative and exploratory innovations. Empirical analyses based on patent data from 175 Chinese biopharmaceutical firms from 2008 to 2018 show a prominent promoting effect of imitation on exploitative and exploratory innovation. However, the positive effects of technological imitation strategies on two types of innovation will be weakened as firms are increasingly central in the knowledge network, whereas occupying many structural holes has the opposite effect. These results offer new theoretical and practical implications to the technological imitation and innovation research domains.","Lu, Chen;Liu, Zhiying;Liao, Suqin;Xu, Yi;Fu, Lihua",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-08-01,Zhejiang University of Technology;University of Science and Technology of China;Hefei University of Technology,Centrality ;  exploitative innovation ;  exploratory innovation ;  imitation ;  structural hole
Application of Nano Technology in Civil Engineering and Future Trends: A Review,"Nanotechnology is a branch of science that works with particles smaller than 100 nanometers in diameter. Nanotechnology has traditionally been concerned with advancements in a variety of domains, including microbiology, medical, electrical, chemical, and materials sciences. The material behaviour of every structure is primarily determined by structural components, with subsequent performance being influenced by the mechanical behaviour of its materials, which operate on a micro and nanoscale. At the nanoscale, commonly used materials can also have significantly different characteristics - changes in colour, strength, elasticity, resistivity ,durability and other qualities can be affected. The capacityto modify materials at the nano structural level ensures that the innovation of material conduct and performance predicted to increase primarily mechanical performance,volume change characteristics, durability, and sustainability is delivered. Using nanotechnology to enhance conventional concrete creates a new, smart, eco- and environment-friendly construction material for green structures.

GIS-Based Approach for Geotechnical Mapping: A Review,"Traditional methods for geotechnical mapping cannot efficiently provide the needed information because these analysis are commonly costly, time consuming and limited in retrieving the temporal and spatial variability. A Geographic Information systems System (GIS) is a contemporary method for managing digital data, representing real places, analyzing, mapping, and creating data, among other things. Different methods and criteria have been developed and applied via many researchers to map the geotechnical proprieties. The primary scope of this study is to determine an overall methods used for mapping the geotechnical properties. A published study that bridges the gap between information and innovation, providing a greater understanding of the various domains and applications of GIS in geotechnical engineering, there are over 60 queries in our database. Between 1993 and 2022, research papers from diverse sources were collected. The data that was pertinent to the study was kept, while the remainder was discarded. The literature is anticipated to provide various data, methodologies, software, limitations, and application locations. Engineering properties data, foundation bearing capacity data, engineering soil data, standard penetration test data, groundwater, and other types of data with a place value may be used to get various outcomes. The scope of GIS in many sectors, as well as methods of application and analysis, were examined in this paper. GIS data can be collected and identified in a systematic way to help with any project, saving time, money, and effort while also increasing access to digital maps. This research will surely help researchers obtain a solid knowledge of GIS and bridge the gap in research for areas wherever GIS is used in a restricted or non-existent way in the technical sector.","Mamdooh, Alaa D.;Aljanabi, Khalid R.;Sayl, Khamis N.",Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2023-07-26,University of Anbar,Application of GIS ;  Digital Data ;  Soil Properties
Factors contributing to the successful development and use of mobile digital libraries: a systematic literature review,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on factors that contribute to the successful development and use of the mobile digital library (DL). This aim will be achieved by reviewing selected journal articles on mobile DLs' successful development and use. This paper argues that the concept of DLs is evolving because of the dynamic nature of knowledge and technological developments in the infosphere. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature search of journal article factors that contribute to the successful development and use of the mobile DL was accomplished by searching the following databases: Emerald insight, Science directory and Google Scholar. The systematic review was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. This study applied Rogers's (1965) Diffusion of innovation theory to unpack the attributes of innovation to unpack contextual factors shaping African conceptions of mobile libraries (m-libraries). The studies reviewed were published from 2016 to 2021. This paper is based on a systematic literature review. This paper uses publicly available literature on the theme of DLs concerning m-libraries. Among the search terms used for the study were: “digital libraries”, “Africa and digital libraries”, “electronic libraries”, “information communication technologies”, “access to information” and “mobile digital libraries”. Findings: Reviewed literature indicates that myriad factors can contribute positively or negatively to the successful development and use of the mobile DL. These factors include the degree of staff awareness and understanding of the potential of mobile technologies in enhancing the provision of library services, the availability of relevant digital content, library staff and users’ level of digital and information literacy competencies to navigate digital platforms, user friendliness of DL platforms, material and financial support to access m-libraries, power supply and access to internet connectivity. Practical implications: The results from this study will generate knowledge and insight into the factors that affect the development and optimal use of mobile DLs to enhance and widen access to scholarly databases irrespective of time and space. This study will make recommendations that will enable South African policymakers to make informed decisions relating to the factors affecting the development and usage of mobile DLs for enhanced learning, teaching and education. Originality/value: Given the growing number of scholarly publications on mobile DLs, this study seeks to discover how such technologies can help enhance learning, teaching and research in higher education. This study’s findings will provide a scientific basis for policymakers and researchers with evidence-based knowledge that raises the value of mobile DLs. It was discovered that if the identified factors are handled well, users can easily access tools, such as databases, electronic journals and online reference tools, and this could improve the quality of teaching and learning.","Khomo, Musawenkosi Phumelela;Naicker, Nalindren;Chisita, Collence Takaingenhamo;Rajkoomar, Mogiveny",Journal,Digital Library Perspectives,2023-07-26,Durban University of Technology,Access to information ;  Mobile digital libraries ;  Mobile digital library development ;  Mobile digital library usage factors ;  PRISMA ;  South Africa

The evolving policy network in sustainable transitions: The case of new energy vehicle niche in China,"Policy has been the driving force behind the rapid development of China's new energy vehicle (NEV) industry. However, the policy network that supports NEV development has been underexplored. This paper explores NEV as an innovative niche for sustainable transition and investigates the evolutionary mechanism of its policy network by combining insights from policy network, strategic niche management and technology innovation system (TIS) theories. Operationally, this paper adopted a social network analysis method to study the NEV policy network in various niche development stages consisting of 377 NEV policy documents formulated by government agencies between 2000 and 2021. Results show the NEV policy network evolves towards bigger, newer actors and is more heterogeneous in creating joint efforts in policymaking that promotes niche development and facilitates a transition to a market niche. Specifically, the policy network expands continually, and network density reaches the maximum of 0.635 at the end of the technological niche. Six agencies are identified as dominators in NEV policymaking.

Dynamic analysis of dual-market low-carbon supply chain: Considering government intervention and joint promotion,"The increasingly severe global environmental problems have urged most people to incorporate environmental protection into their daily lives. Therefore, low-carbon supply chain management has become crucial. This paper studies a dual-market low-carbon supply chain operation in urban and rural markets with one manufacturer and two retailers. Three scenarios are considered: no government intervention, government intervention and joint promotion under government intervention. By establishing and solving three differential game models, we give the dynamic technological innovation, advertising and store promotion strategies of the manufacturer and two retailers and show the impact of government intervention and joint promotion on emissions reduction and performance. The results show that: first, government intervention can increase technology innovation efforts and decrease advertising efforts, while joint store promotion under government intervention has a positive effect on manufacturer's advertising and technological innovation efforts; second, government intervention may increase the profits of the manufacturer, although it will undoubtedly reduce the profits of the retailers, while joint store promotion under government intervention can further improve the profits of the manufacturer and retailers; third, compared to the preferences of rural consumers, manufacturer's technological innovation strategy relies more on the price and promotion preferences of urban consumers. Moreover, the preference differences between the two types of consumers have a weak impact on the manufacturer's advertising strategy, while the price preference of rural consumers has a more significant impact on the advertising efforts of the manufacturer. Overall, the research results can provide valuable suggestions for the members of the low-carbon supply chain in the dual market to improve the economic and environmental performance of the low-carbon supply chain.","Huang, Xin",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-07-20,Hefei University of Technology,Carbon reduction technology innovation ;  Differential game ;  Emission reduction ;  Government intervention ;  Low-carbon supply chain
Setting the three-stage R&D shared portfolio methodology: an innovative approach to industry–university collaboration,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to start industry–university (I-U) collaboration through a stepped process aimed at building a portfolio of research and development (R&D) projects. Design/methodology/approach: It devises from an 18-month action-research program held between a multinational automotive manufacturer and the a top-ranked Brazilian university. Findings: The three-stage R&D shared portfolio methodology results from a combined application of quality function deployment-like correlation matrices and roadmapping. A first matrix tackles industry interests and correlates product performance dimensions and components to reveal broad research areas of interest. A second matrix correlates research areas and engineering competences, highlighting the types of the required know-how from the university standpoint. Thirdly, academic experts help to fill a roadmap-like layer with possible collaborative R&D deliverables over time. Research limitations/implications: Since the study lies on a single experience, extensions to other contexts should be made with care. However, the proposal offers robust rationale and a set of supporting tools to nurture new applications. Practical implications: Theoretical and methodological reflections help managers tackling the long-standing problem of setting a shared R&D agenda. Originality/value: Literature on I-U collaboration tends or to over-emphasize the role of technology transfer offices in promoting the partnerships or to seek implications for public policy. This research offers a valuable approach to build shared R&D project portfolio from a managerial viewpoint, filling an academic gap and offering guidance for managers in both sides.","Bagno, Raoni Barros;Freitas, Jonathan Simões",Journal,Revista de Gestao,2023-07-19,Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,Industry–university collaboration ;  Open innovation ;  Research and development
Rule capture of automated compliance checking of building requirements: a review,"In the architectural, engineering and construction industry, building design needs to be checked against regulations before it can be finalised and progress to the construction stage. The traditional manual compliance-checking process is error prone and time consuming. As a solution, automated compliance checking (ACC) was proposed. Rule capture is a crucial bottleneck of ACC. Despite many studies in this domain, no research has synthesised the themes and identified future research opportunities. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting a systematic literature review and identifying challenges facing this field. The findings revealed that the rule capture process had attracted interest in the past years, and more semi-automated and automated methods have been proposed. The current representation development process lacks a methodological backdrop. The existing representations cannot represent ‘unknowns’ and ‘side effects’, lack the ability to deal with ambiguous rules and are typically restricted by the rule engine and/or target data model. The understanding of rules, representations and the relationships between them is insufficient. Further research is required to address these issues.","Zhang, Zijing;Broyd, Tim;Ma, Ling",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Smart Infrastructure and Construction,2023-07-18,The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment,Building Information Modelling (BIM)/construction management/design/UN SDG 9: Industry ;  innovation and infrastructure
Unlocking supply chain product and process innovation through the development of supply chain learning capabilities under technological turbulence: Evidence from Egyptian SMEs,"Purpose: In light of the current challenges in the business environment, firms, particularly those involved in supply chains, must foster innovation. In this context, the current study employs the theory of dynamic organizational capabilities (DOCs) to track supply chain learning capabilities (SCLCs) and independently uncover their relationship to innovation at both the product and process levels. Similarly, the study intends to investigate the influence of technological turbulence (TT) on these relationships as a moderating variable. Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered using in-person interviews with 189 CEOs with some supply chain management proficiency from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the industrial zones of eastern Egypt. The study used a survey approach to collect data, and the SEM-PLS technique was utilized to analyze the data. Findings: Study findings revealed that SCLCs positively affect product and process innovation. In addition, TT positively moderates the relationship between SCLCs and product and process innovation, except for risk-taking capability. Further theoretical and practical implications are derived from the study findings. Originality/value: This research adds to the knowledge of the dynamic capabilities theory (DCT), which affects how firms interact with their external environment. Studying learning capabilities are employed as essential competencies to counterbalance high levels of TT in the external environment in terms of innovative performance and vice versa if firms do not attempt to strengthen their dynamic learning capabilities in supply chains. In addition, this study contributes to the literature by studying learning capabilities from the external perspective, where SCLCs are being developed as a new variable to improve innovation.","Abdelaziz, Mahmoud Abdelaziz Ahmed;Wu, Jiani;Yuan, Changwei;Ghonim, Mohamed Ahmed",Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2023-07-17,Faculty of Commerce;Chang'an University,Dynamic capability theory ;  Process innovation ;  Product innovation ;  SMEs ;  Supply chain learning capabilities ;  Technological turbulence

Whether the carbon emissions trading system improves energy efficiency – Empirical testing based on China's provincial panel data,"As China faces the challenge of achieving its “double carbon” goal, improving energy efficiency is imperative. Carbon trading system may have a significant impact on energy efficiency in China as a key environmental measure. However, few literatures discuss the role of carbon emission trading system from the perspective of energy efficiency. Using the difference-in-difference model to test whether the carbon trading systems can improve energy efficiency through a quasi-natural experiment. The results show that both static and dynamic effect analysis shows that carbon trading improves energy efficiency. The impact mechanism analysis shows that the system improves energy efficiency by adjusting the energy structure and promoting green technology innovation. Finally, the carbon trading system has a greater impact on improving energy efficiency in the field of high environmental law enforcement and environmental quality. There is some evidence that the “double carbon” goal can be achieved.","Song, Malin;Zheng, Huanyu;Shen, Zhiyang",Journal,Energy,2023-07-15,Anhui University of Finance and Economics;Beijing Institute of Technology,Carbon emissions trading ;  Difference-in-difference ;  Energy efficiency ;  Energy structure ;  Green technology innovation

Thematic analysis of tools for health innovators and organisation leaders to develop digital health solutions fit for climate change,"Objectives While ethicists have largely underscored the risks raised by digital health solutions that operate with or without artificial intelligence (AI), limited research has addressed the need to also mitigate their environmental footprint and equip health innovators as well as organisation leaders to meet responsibility requirements that go beyond clinical safety, efficacy and ethics. Drawing on the Responsible Innovation in Health framework, this qualitative study asks: (1) what are the practice-oriented tools available for innovators to develop environmentally sustainable digital solutions and (2) how are organisation leaders supposed to support them in this endeavour? Methods Focusing on a subset of 34 tools identified through a comprehensive scoping review (health sciences, computer sciences, engineering and social sciences), our qualitative thematic analysis identifies and illustrates how two responsibility principles - environmental sustainability and organisational responsibility - are meant to be put in practice. Results Guidance to make environmentally sustainable digital solutions is found in 11 tools whereas organisational responsibility is described in 33 tools. The former tools focus on reducing energy and materials consumption as well as pollution and waste production. The latter tools highlight executive roles for data risk management, data ethics and AI ethics. Only four tools translate environmental sustainability issues into tangible organisational responsibilities. Conclusions Recognising that key design and development decisions in the digital health industry are largely shaped by market considerations, this study indicates that significant work lies ahead for medical and organisation leaders to support the development of solutions fit for climate change.","Rivard, Lysanne;Lehoux, Pascale;Rocha De Oliveira, Robson;Alami, Hassane",Journal,BMJ Leader,2023-07-04,University of Montreal;University of Oxford Medical Sciences Division,management ;  medical leadership ;  sustainability
Development of STEM Learning Based on Riverbanks Local Wisdom,"Rivers are the heart of people's lives in various countries, including Indonesia. Various local wisdoms of riverbank communities are the cause of the formation of people's thinking patterns and attitudes in carrying out scientific, technological, mathematical, and engineering (STEM) innovations. However, riverbank local wisdom and STEM learning are often considered a challenge in itself, taught separately, and receive less attention from science teachers. The purpose of this paper is to develop STEM learning based on riverbank local wisdom as outlined in learning books. Therefore, this paper will report on the use of research and development designs to produce an appropriate STEM learning book based on riverbank local wisdom. The feasibility assessment involved five experts on local wisdom and STEM learning. Suggestions and inputs from experts are taken into consideration in the revision of this book. The results of the feasibility show that the developed book has met the aspects of design, format, material, language, and innovation. Thus, STEM learning books based on local riverside wisdom are feasible and can be continued in the implementation test in the classroom.","Putra, Aminuddin Prahatama;Suyidno, Suyidno;Utami, Nurul Hidayati;Fahmi, Fahmii;Prahani, Binar Kurnia",Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2023-07-03,Universitas Negeri Surabaya;Universitas Lambung Mangkurat,
"DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMISSIONING OF THE BOLDREWOOD TOWING TANK – A DECADE OF ENDEAVOUR","The process of design, build and eventual commissioning of the towing tank on the Boldrewood Innovation Campus is described. The design brief required a facility that would have a capability to test models at a commercial scale but that would be effective as teaching environment for the next generation of Naval Architects as well as providing a flexible space for future fundamental research. Each of these provided their own challenges but the eventual solution of a 138 m long, 3.5 m deep, 6 m wide facility has more than met the initial aspirations. Equipped with 12 independent 0.5 m wavemaking flaps at the West end, a passive beach at the East end, a deployable side beach along the South wall for post run wave absorption and a monocoque Aluminium alloy carriage, the Boldrewood towing tank has now been successfully operating for more than a year. The carriage position and speed are controlled by a twin winch arrangement using a laser positioning system and low embodied energy composite cables. The carriage can reach a maximum speed of 10 m/s with controllable acceleration rates and can have up to four constant speed phases per run. Initial commissioning results and comparisons with benchmark data for the KCS hull confirm the accuracy and repeatability of the facility. In particular, the position and speed of the carriage are known to a high level of precision. To date research and consultancy work has spanned the performance of high speed vessels, uncrewed underwater and surface vessels, wave energy and tidal current systems, floating platforms for wind turbines, performance sport work for sailing, kayaking, rowing and swimming, open water propeller tests as well as conventional displacement vessel testing for self-propulsion and resistance. All ship science and maritime engineering students use the facility as part of their taught modules in every year of their programme as well as for individual, MSc and group projects as appropriate. It has also made a strong impact on the many thousands of visitors a year to the campus for science and engineering open days.","Malas, B.;Creasey, L.;Buckland, D.;Turnock, S.

Fault Detection and Diagnosis Methods for Sensors Systems: a Scientific Literature Review,"Innovation technology in industrial devices allows enhancing process monitoring and control and have a significant impact on communication and interfacing systems within all production contexts, both in the process industries and in the manufacturing sector. Asset status and performances can be monitored by traditional sensors and intelligent devices, wired and wireless, able to collect data and processing them or make them available to specific processing algorithms. Reliability and maintenance researchers and practitioners are focusing on models, tools, and techniques for in field and real-time detection of process anomalies and equipment fault detection. Most analyses start from the assumption that sensors and monitoring systems guarantee reliability and operational availability and that they are always able to provide timely and correct data. Therefore, malfunctions of such devices could affect trust on data-driven analysis and related decision-making process on asset management and workers' safety. In recent years, different approaches were explored, aimed at recognizing failure mechanisms in industrial measuring devices and sensors systems, both using traditional methodologies or implementing intelligent algorithms, to accurately prevent and predict the anomalies and identify their nature and position before they generate malfunctioning or interruption of plant's operations. This paper proposes a systematic analysis of the scientific literature related to fault/failure detection and diagnosis in sensors and monitoring systems, to obtain an updated state-of-the-art and identify the most promising approaches and research challenges on this topic. A particular focus is dedicated to the usability of soft sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms, in data-driven models.","Trapani, Natalia;Longo, Leonardo",Conference Proceeding,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2023-07-01,Università degli Studi di Catania,Analysis of reliability and safety ;  Data-driven analysis ;  Fault detection and diagnosis ;  Maintenance engineering and management ;  Sensors anomaly
Opportunities and challenges of national water network construction under changing environment,"The national water network project is a major strategic deployment in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) and the Outline of the 2035 Vision Goals. However, under the influence of global changes, it is facing new opportunities and challenges. Based on the analysis of the background of climate, geography and economic and social development and the characteristics of unbalanced distribution of soil and water resources, this paper has completed three research works. It studies the relationship between supply and demand of water resources in the changing environment. Then it analyzes the planning and layout of the national water network and the effectiveness of the typical water network. Finally, some problems and countermeasures in the planning and construction of the national water network are discussed. Research shows that the impact of global change is more and more prominent. As the country enters the stage of high-quality development, people have higher requirements on the quality and guarantee of water supply. Moreover, the construction of national and regional water networks is an important measure to cope with the impact of environmental change and improve national water security. The construction of the national water network can significantly improve the guarantee of water supply and irrigation, flood control and drainage capacity, and enhance the quality of natural river and lake water environment, but it still has room for optimization and improvement. We need to coordinate regional ""water-soil-air-gas"" and ""man-land"" relations, strengthen scientific and technological innovation in the construction of the national water network, improve the comprehensive benefits of ecological environment and economic development of the project, and support the construction of national ecological civilization and high-quality development.","Xia, Jun;Chen, Jin;She, Dunxian;Luo, Wenguang",Journal,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,2023-07-01,Changjiang Water Resources Commission;Hubei Provincial Key Lab of Water System Science for Sponge City Construction;State Key Laboratory of Water Resources Engineering and Management,climate change ;  high-quality development ;  national water network ;  water resources pattern ;  water safety assurance
On the Nature and Utility of Crosscutting Concepts,"The crosscutting concepts (CCCs) are a collection of ideas that span the science and engineering disciplines. While various standards documents have identified similar sets of ideas in the past, calls for their explicit inclusion into science and engineering instruction began in earnest only about a decade ago. When these calls began, the research base on the teaching and learning of the CCCs was limited; in the intervening years, educators have debated whether and how the CCCs are useful for supporting science and engineering learners. In this article, we summarize a recent scholarship that has clarified the role of CCCs in supporting science and engineering learning. Then, we highlight two exemplary curricular units (one elementary and one secondary) that showcase CCC-informed instruction. Based upon these research and development efforts, we identify three core messages: (1) CCCs provide learners with a set of complementary lenses on phenomena, (2) CCCs are powerful tools for broadening access to science and engineering, and (3) practitioner innovations play an especially important role in the time-sensitive work of establishing a more robust research base for how CCCs can strengthen science and engineering teaching and learning.","Nordine, Jeffrey Carl;Lee, Okhee",Journal,Education Sciences,2023-07-01,NYU Steinhardt;University of Iowa,crosscutting concepts ;  curriculum development ;  Next Generation Science Standards ;  phenomenon-based instruction ;  three-dimensional science learning
Mesocurriculum modernization of a chemical engineering program: The case of a high-impact regional university in Colombia,"In Colombia there are few chemical engineering programs and those have been historically linked to the industrial development of the country, supporting the training needs for industrial development in several regions of economic importance. The southwestern Colombian region contributes with the largest industrial production in the country, and the chemical engineering program of Universidad del Valle has been the only one in the region for 78 years. The last curriculum reform took place 20 years ago and the accelerated technological change urged the adoption of deep changes in the curriculum structure. A student-centered constructivist approach was applied in the faculty-wide transformation in the mesocurriculum and microcurriculum levels, defining the so-called Sensitivities, Capacities and Competencies (SCCs) as the set of attitudes, skills and knowledge necessary for an integral performance of engineers. Those were considered from two standpoints: general and disciplinary formation. In the disciplinary level, the historic traditional pillars of chemical engineering were maintained, but taking advantage on the areas of academic research, development and innovation (R+D+I) expertise demanded by the industry around the university in addition to transversal priority areas for modern chemical engineering professionals. This contribution discussed the elements of the curriculum reform for modernizing the chemical engineering curriculum of a high-impact program in a stablished university with a regional vocation.","Gómez-Ríos, David;Ramírez-Malule, Howard;Marriaga-Cabrales, Nilson",Journal,Education for Chemical Engineers,2023-07-01,"Universidad del Valle, Cali",Constructivism ;  Curriculum ;  Disciplinary training ;  Mesocurriculum ;  Soft-skills
Sustainable development of community-supported STEM-learning ecosystems in rural areas of the United States,"The Rural Activation & Innovation Network (RAIN) project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) (DRL#: 161255) from 2017 through 2021.

Progress and prospect of hot dry rock exploration and development,"The exploitation and utilization of clean energy is a resource and environmental issue of common concern for global sustainable development. As a vital strategic and sustainable future energy, hot dry rock (HDR) has attracted more and more attention. In this paper some thoughts on the future research direction of HDR resources in China are provided based on a worldwide experience summary, hoping to provide a useful reference for the future exploration and engineering development of HDR. Since the concept of HDR was put forward in the 1970s, the number of worldwide HDR construction has been increasingly growing. Although a lot of theoretical and technical breakthroughs have been made, only a small fraction of projects still in operation due to the lack of sustained financial support, induced microearthquakes and other issues. At present, the global development of HDR is gradually entering a new stage of exploration, and the basic theories of HDR to tackle the key problems are strengthening around the world. Since 2012, the China Geological Survey has organized and implemented the nationwide terrestrial HDR resources survey, evaluation, exploration and development, and significant stage progress has been achieved. A series of fundamental maps have been compiled, such as terrestrial heat flow value, curie surface depth, distribution of acidic rock, and heat-controlling structure in China. The resource potential of terrestrial HDR in China has been preliminarily estimated and a sounding basis for the target site selection is provided. HDR exploration and evaluation have been carried out in typical areas of Qinghai, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi and Jiangsu provinces, and a breakthrough has been achieved in the Gonghe Basin of Qinghai. The first HDR resources exploration and production demonstration project in China was carried out in 2019, which made a series of meaningful outcomes in deep HDR exploration, high-temperature hard rock drilling, large-scale reservoir stimulation, reservoir connectivity and flow circulation, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power generation, etc. The large-scale reservoir stimulation was carried out in 2020, and the first power generation test was completed in 2021. In general, the global exploration and development of HDR has made great progress. Practice has proved that HDR resources are a promising green energy and are expected to become an inexhaustible energy support for the world in the future. However, there is still a large gap between the existing path of HDR development and utilization and the economics of its supporting technologies compared with commercial development expectations at present. Although the development of HDR resources in China has achieved a breakthrough from “0” to “1”, there is still a long way to go from the international level. In order to solve the problems of large-scale and economic development, it is still needed to promote disruptive technological innovation in high temperature hard rock drilling and completion, fine characterization of deep reservoirs, safe large-scale reservoir construction, efficient heat transfer and heat recovery and other aspects.","Wen, Dongguang;Zhang, Eryong;Wang, Guiling;Zhang, Linyou;Wang, Huang;Zhang, Senqi;Ye, Chengming;Wang, Wenshi;Jin, Xianpeng;Liu, Donglin;Jia, Xiaofeng;Li, Shengtao;Wu, Haidong;Lian, Sheng;Feng, Qingda",Journal,Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology,2023-07-01,Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences;China Geological Survey,exploration and development ;  hot dry rock ;  progress ;  prospects
Training system study on fire engineering professional education in college,"In order to break through the construction deficiencies of college fire engineering education system, the professional education curriculum system of fire engineering was put forward based on the outcome-oriented concept. Firstly, the reversal design was applied on the training plan, course content and method. The curriculum system focused on on four levels of fire protection standard, prevention, fire fighting and evaluation. Then, the innovation and entrepreneurship education of fire engineering was strengthened, and a fire engineering undergraduate full-course total tutorial system was established as the starting point of innovation. To stimulate the innovative thinking and ability of students, the whole chain innovation training system was proposed as the scientific research carrier. Finally, three core kernel modules of pre-disaster perception, fire engineering disaster relief and post-disaster treatment, were constructed. A professional laboratory centered on five typical fire fighting systems was established to present the real fire response and disaster relief scenarios, which undertook the function of fire engineering course experiment, design and part of internship. The results indicate that the training system of outcome-oriented fire engineering professional education clarifies the curriculum logic of professional education. Emphasis is placed on hierarchical and progressive cultivation and the exploration and guidance on the hot field of fire engineering. It clarifies the structural correlation of the professional laboratory system and its supporting role in the practical education. The training system can provide some reference for the talent cultivation of fire rescue team and the future development of fire engineering discipline.","Lu, Xinxiao;Wang, Haiyan;Wu, Bing;Chen, Bin",Journal,China Safety Science Journal,2023-07-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing",fire engineering ;  innovative entrepreneurship ;  practical education ;  professional education ;  training system

Numerical treatment of thermal nanofluid flow for energy enhancement over a porous stretching sheet impact of slip and buoyancy force,"The advancement of nanofluid innovation is a crucial area of research for physicists, mathematicians, manufacturers, and materials scientists. In engineering and industries, the fluid velocity caused by stretching sheets and nanofluids has a lot of applications such as refrigerators, chips, heat exchangers, hybrid mechanical motors, food development, and so on. The originality of the current study is the analysis of the thermal nanofluid in the existence of a porous matrix, and buoyancy force over the stretched sheet, so in limiting cases, the existing work is equated with the available effort, and excellent correspondence is originated. The governing equations in terms of PDEs are changed to the convection differential by utilizing the appropriate transformation and then solved by the ND-solved method along with bvph2. The thermal boundary layer thickness upsurges as the radiation and temperature factors are improved. It is observed that with the growing amount of volume fraction factor the velocity profile declines. When the velocity slip factors and permeability are enhanced the velocity profile augments. It is examined as the values of permeability factor, Biot number, and velocity slip factor are increased the inner temperature of the fluid improves. For the increasing values of θ_r, ϕ, and Nr, the temperature is increasing. In the future, the present model can be extended by using the hybrid nanofluid for the activation of thermal conductivity and heat enhancement analysis.","Zeeshan, ;Islam, Saeed;Hussain, Shah;Khan, Waris;Salah, Bashir",Journal,Science Progress,2023-07-01,Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan;Bacha Khan University;Hazara University Pakistan;Technische Universitat Graz;King Saud University,buoyancy force ;  nonlinear thermal radiation ;  Numerical solution ;  slip effect ;  stretchable porous surface

Vascular interventional surgery robot and its force feedback technology,"Vascular interventional surgery is a surgical method that uses instruments such as catheters and guide wires to enter the blood vessels through a minimally invasive skin puncture under visual image guidance and performs diagnosis and treatment on the lesion site. It has the advantages of small trauma, fast recovery, and few complications, and it has become the preferred treatment method for various diseases, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, due to the narrow and complex nature of blood vessels, manipulating catheters inside them becomes challenging, increasing the cognitive load on doctors, prolonging surgery time, and raising fatigue levels and surgical risks for operators and patients. On the other hand, vascular interventional surgery requires the high proficiency of doctors, and the number of doctors who can carry out many operations is limited. These greatly limit the broad application of vascular interventional surgery. Robot-assisted vascular interventional surgery has been expected to solve these problems for its accuracy, flexibility, and convenience. Realizing vascular interventional surgery's remoteization, intelligentization, and digitalization is essential. However, compared with other key technologies, such as image navigation and mechanical arm structure of vascular interventional surgery robots, force feedback technology still has a large gap. The lack of force feedback limits its application in complex and challenging, calcified, and chronic occlusive lesions. Therefore, this paper analyzes the fundamental problems, implementation methods, and technical requirements of force feedback technology for vascular interventional surgery robots and discusses the development direction of force feedback technology in combination with domestic and foreign research progress, providing theoretical reference and practical guidance for the research of force feedback technology for vascular interventional surgery robots. From the perspective of engineering design, the fundamental problems faced by force feedback technology are explained from two aspects: the problem of manual force perception and the problem of force compensation force loss, and the process of manual force perception, the range of perceived force, the causes of force loss and the method of force compensation are briefly described. Domestic and foreign research on force feedback technology for vascular interventional surgery robots is still in its infancy, mainly focusing on experimental verification and system development based on mechanical action, electrorheological fluid, and magnetorheological fluid. Although these methods can achieve a certain degree of force feedback effect, they also have some limitations and shortcomings: mechanical force feedback is difficult to overcome inertia; noise interference and large volume limit application scenarios; electrorheological fluid force feedback working voltage greatly exceeds human body safety threshold; magnetorheological fluid force feedback is accompanied by a large amount of heat and friction from the passive viscosity that interferes with accurate force presentation. Therefore, exploring more efficient, sensitive, stable, and suitable remote operation force feedback technology is necessary. In addition, ""local force feedback"" and ""perceptual substitution"" are two promising force feedback methods worth exploring. For the technical requirements of force feedback implementation, this paper analyzes in depth from sensor, force detection, and force feedback based on the force transmission process and elaborates on the latest research results at home and abroad. With the development of other interdisciplinary disciplines such as artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, wireless communication, materials science, and physics, more possibilities and innovations can be provided for force feedback technology for vascular interventional surgery robots.

Intelligent Automation Manufacturing for Betula Solid Timber Based on Machine Vision Detection and Optimization Grading System Applied to Building Materials,"Wood material is the foundation of wood structure architecture, and its production technology and equipment technology decide the development and upgrading of modern wood structure architecture. Aiming at the problems of low automation degree, low material utilization rate, low production efficiency and high labor costs in the process of traditional wood processing, we explore the integration and innovation of the traditional wood processing industry and modern industrial Internet information technology on the basis of studying the properties of Betula (Betula costata) solid wood materials, wood comprehensive utilization rate, wood structure component development and processing technology requirements, and form an intelligent, automatic and industrial production mode for building materials. Through technology and methods such as mechanical design, automation technology, machine vision, deep learning, optimization algorithm, electronic design automation, computer aided manufacturing, etc., the key technologies of intelligent automatic optimization of wood materials were studied, and intelligent automatic production lines of Betula species identification, log optimization sawing, solid timber longitudinal multiblade sawing, sawn timber quality detection and solid timber optimizing cross-cuts are built. Based on the machine vision method, features are extracted; a tree species, defect classification and recognition model database is established; an image processing algorithm with high recognition accuracy, as well as fast processing speed and high robustness are studied; non-destructive testing and classification methods of machine vision are optimized; key problems of online rapid classification, detection and optimization of sawing are solved and production quality and processing efficiency are improved. Finally, the timber defect detection accuracy and Betula timber yield are analyzed, and the comprehensive utilization value of optimized sawing timber is compared with the comprehensive utilization value of manually marking sawing timber. The processing cost and efficiency of Betula sawing timber with an intelligent automatic production line are calculated. The test results show that the average detection accuracy of timber defect type, size and location is 89.69%, 89.69%, 92.25% and 82.29%, respectively, and the detection stability is high. By adopting intelligent automatic detection, classification and optimization sawing production line of wood, the comprehensive utilization value of optimized sawing timber is 14.13% higher than that of manual marking sawing timber, and 16,089.29 m3 more building materials can be processed annually. In the process of intelligent automatic wood processing, the intelligent detection system is used to detect defects, improve production performance and production efficiency and reduce labor costs. Compared with the traditional wood processing process, the method studied in this paper is improved to optimize the production line processing performance and processing technology. The research and development of an intelligent automatic production system for solid wood can promote the application and development of an automatic industrial production mode for sawn timber for the wood structure construction industry, deepen the integration of artificial intelligence technology, Internet technology and the whole wood processing industry and lead the upgrading of building materials for wood structures to an intelligent manufacturing production mode.","Ji, Min;Zhang, Wei;Diao, Xingliang;Wang, Guofu;Miao, Hu",Journal,Forests,2023-07-01,Chinese Academy of Forestry,Betula(Betula costata)  solid timber ;  defect detection and grading ;  intelligent automated manufacturing ;  machine vision ;  optimized sawing production line ;  wood structure components

Towards a New Paradigm of Project Management: A Bibliometric Review,"The advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has triggered a digital transformation across several industries, including the project management (PM) profession. To achieve competitive advantages, construction industry employers must now utilise technology and data for strategy development, project execution, and delivery. This study reviews the concept of PM through research published on the Elsevier Scopus database from 2010 to date using a sequence of bibliometric analyses. Keywords such as “project management” AND “project management tools” AND “project management techniques” AND “construction industry” AND “built environment” were used for article extraction. VOSviewer, a text-mining tool, was used to analyse the bibliometric connection in PM research within the built environment discipline. Through the sequencing of cluster analysis, the findings revealed that research focus is placed on sustainable development (SD), construction safety (CS), engineering education (EE), project management stakeholders (PMS), risk management (RM), and building information modelling (BIM). More so, the current research focus in PM studies is tending towards knowledge management (KM) and construction innovation (CI). Based on a critical review of extant literature, very few studies have bibliometrically analysed and visualised PM studies. This study sets out to fill this gap by examining the key areas of concentration in published works on the PM concept from 2010 to date. Despite the valuable contribution of this study to the PM body of knowledge, generalisations of the results must be made cautiously due to the use of a single database, which in this case is Elsevier Scopus.","Aliu, John;Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel;Kineber, Ahmed Farouk;Ebekozien, Andrew;Aigbavboa, Clinton Ohis;Alaboud, Naif Sultan;Daoud, Ahmed Osama",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-07-01,"Faculty of Engineering;College of Engineering;Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University;Federal University of Technology, Akure;Canadian International College;Umm Al-Qura University;University of Johannesburg;Auchi Polytechnic",construction management ;  engineering education ;  fourth industrial revolution ;  project management ;  project management education
Carbon Peak Scenario Simulation of Manufacturing Carbon Emissions in Northeast China: Perspective of Structure Optimization,"The manufacturing industry is the pillar industry of China’s economy and a major carbon emitter, and its carbon emission reduction efforts directly determine whether the country’s carbon emission reduction target can be successfully met. In the context of the goals of the carbon peak and carbon neutrality policy, we examine the impact of manufacturing structure optimization on carbon emissions from 2003 to 2020 through a spatial econometric model, taking the old industrial centers in Northeast China as an example. We then apply a machine learning model to simulate manufacturing carbon emissions during the carbon peak stage and identify the optimal path for carbon emission reduction, which is important for promoting manufacturing carbon emission reduction in Northeast China. Since the goal of low-carbon economic development has gradually replaced the goal of maximizing economic efficiency in recent years, manufacturing structure optimization has come to focus on energy saving and emission reduction. Therefore, we define manufacturing structure optimization from the dual perspective of technology and energy consumption to broaden the existing research perspective. The results show the following: (1) The overall trend in manufacturing structure optimization in Northeast China is steadily improving, and the level of manufacturing structure optimization from the technology perspective is higher than that from the energy consumption perspective. (2) Manufacturing structure optimization and manufacturing carbon emissions in Northeast China both show a positive spatial correlation. Manufacturing structure optimization in Northeast China can effectively promote carbon emission reduction, and it also has a spatial spillover effect. (3) The carbon emission reduction effect of manufacturing structure optimization from the energy consumption perspective is better than that from the technology perspective, and the carbon emission reduction effect under the institutional innovation scenario is better than that under the baseline scenario and the technological innovation scenario. Focusing on manufacturing structure optimization from both technology and energy consumption perspectives, as well as continuously improving technological innovation and institutional innovation, can help to achieve manufacturing carbon emission reduction in Northeast China.","Xu, Caifen;Zhang, Yu;Yang, Yangmeina;Gao, Huiying",Journal,Energies,2023-07-01,Northeast Normal University,machine learning model ;  manufacturing carbon emissions ;  manufacturing structure optimization ;  Northeast China ;  scenario simulation ;  spatial econometric model

Duplicate Genes Contribute to Variability in Abiotic Stress Resistance in Allopolyploid Wheat,"Gene duplication is a universal biological phenomenon that drives genomic variation and diversity, plays a crucial role in plant evolution, and contributes to innovations in genetic engineering and crop development. Duplicated genes participate in the emergence of novel functionality, such as adaptability to new or more severe abiotic stress resistance. Future crop research will benefit from advanced, mechanistic understanding of the effects of gene duplication, especially in the development and deployment of high-performance, stress-resistant, elite wheat lines. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of gene duplication in wheat, including the principle of gene duplication and its effects on gene function, the diversity of duplicated genes, and how they have functionally diverged. Then, we discuss how duplicated genes contribute to abiotic stress response and the mechanisms of duplication. Finally, we have a future prospects section that discusses the direction of future efforts in the short term regarding the elucidation of replication and retention mechanisms of repetitive genes related to abiotic stress response in wheat, excellent gene function research, and practical applications.","Du, Linying;Ma, Zhenbing;Mao, Hude",Journal,Plants,2023-07-01,Northwest A&F University,abiotic stress ;  evolution ;  functional divergence ;  gene duplication ;  wheat
Development of the Engineering Design Process (EDP) on the Ability to Design Prototypes to Increase Natural Disaster Mitigation for Elementary Schools in Indonesia,"Education is the most essential part in every aspect of providing the quality of human resources. Thus, one of the learning innovations to improve quality, especially for children, is the engineering design process. The engineering design process (EDP) is a set of processes that engineers use to solve an issue. The purpose of this study is to find out the of EDP on design prototypes of the elementary school. The application of knowledge and capability through EDP were also able to develop critical and creative thinking skills so that they can solve problems, collaborate, and communicate. The method adopted in this research is case study. Seventeen elementary students from four different schools in three different cities in province Riau, Indonesia, are selected as participants. Data are collected through interviews and analyzed using a grounded approach. Finding of this study EDP became an ability that could involve students in the learning space and students were also challenged to work collaboratively in groups that were guided by researchers. From the designs made by students, the level of ability to design student prototypes was dominated by the level of the developing stage even to the level of the continuous stage. The findings indicated that the activities using EDP were able to help students to experience real learning and find components that can be used to compound a tool and solve real problems. The findings also indicate the need to reform curriculum for teacher training programs through EDP to include matters like design prototypes.","Putra, M.

"Profiling post-COVID-19 condition across different variants of SARS-CoV-2: a prospective longitudinal study in unvaccinated wild-type, unvaccinated alpha-variant, and vaccinated delta-variant populations","Background: Self-reported symptom studies rapidly increased understanding of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic and enabled monitoring of long-term effects of COVID-19 outside hospital settings. Post-COVID-19 condition presents as heterogeneous profiles, which need characterisation to enable personalised patient care. We aimed to describe post-COVID-19 condition profiles by viral variant and vaccination status. Methods: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from UK-based adults (aged 18–100 years) who regularly provided health reports via the Covid Symptom Study smartphone app between March 24, 2020, and Dec 8, 2021. We included participants who reported feeling physically normal for at least 30 days before testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 who subsequently developed long COVID (ie, symptoms lasting longer than 28 days from the date of the initial positive test). We separately defined post-COVID-19 condition as symptoms that persisted for at least 84 days after the initial positive test. We did unsupervised clustering analysis of time-series data to identify distinct symptom profiles for vaccinated and unvaccinated people with post-COVID-19 condition after infection with the wild-type, alpha (B.1.1.7), or delta (B.1.617.2 and AY.x) variants of SARS-CoV-2. Clusters were then characterised on the basis of symptom prevalence, duration, demography, and previous comorbidities. We also used an additional testing sample with additional data from the Covid Symptom Study Biobank (collected between October, 2020, and April, 2021) to investigate the effects of the identified symptom clusters of post-COVID-19 condition on the lives of affected people. Findings: We included 9804 people from the COVID Symptom Study with long COVID, 1513 (15%) of whom developed post-COVID-19 condition. Sample sizes were sufficient only for analyses of the unvaccinated wild-type, unvaccinated alpha variant, and vaccinated delta variant groups. We identified distinct profiles of symptoms for post-COVID-19 condition within and across variants: four endotypes were identified for infections due to the wild-type variant (in unvaccinated people), seven for the alpha variant (in unvaccinated people), and five for the delta variant (in vaccinated people). Across all variants, we identified a cardiorespiratory cluster of symptoms, a central neurological cluster, and a multi-organ systemic inflammatory cluster. These three main clusers were confirmed in a testing sample. Gastrointestinal symptoms clustered in no more than two specific phenotypes per viral variant. Interpretation: Our unsupervised analysis identified different profiles of post-COVID-19 condition, characterised by differing symptom combinations, durations, and functional outcomes. Our classification could be useful for understanding the distinct mechanisms of post-COVID-19 condition, as well as for identification of subgroups of individuals who might be at risk of prolonged debilitation.

Role of environmental regulation and renewable energy technology innovation in carbon neutrality: A sustainable investigation from China,"With global climate change posing a major threat to human society, many countries have elevated “carbon neutrality” to a national strategy and put forward a vision of a zero-carbon future. In this process, environmental regulation (ER) and renewable energy technology innovation (RET) are important factors that contribute to achieving the carbon neutrality goal. Thus, this study employs a spatial econometric technique model to investigate the direct and indirect effects of ER and RET on environmental sustainability from both theoretical and empirical dimensions based on panel data of 30 Chinese provinces during 1998–2020. The results show that ER is not conducive to the improvement of environmental quality in local and neighboring areas, but it is beneficial to the reduction of CO2 emissions when the level of economic development is greater than the critical threshold of 9.126, i.e., the “inverted U-shaped” curve relationship. On the contrary, RET has a beneficial impact on the environment, but when the economic development level is greater than the critical threshold of 8.790, the carbon reduction effect of RET is reduced. Thus, the significance and magnitude of the carbon reduction effect of ER and RET depend on the regional economic development level, and excessive RE will have a suppressive effect on RET. The paper assisted policy makers in designing a holistic policy to enhance environmental sustainability through ER and RET, especially in the Chinese region.","Hao, Yuanyuan;Li, Xiangdong;Murshed, Muntasir",Journal,Energy Strategy Reviews,2023-07-01,Jiangsu University of Technology;North South University;Daffodil International University,CO  emissions 2 ;  Environmental regulation ;  Renewable energy technology innovation ;  Spatial spillover effect ;  Threshold value
A multi-model framework to assess the role of R&D towards a decarbonized energy system,"Research and development (R&D) investments foster green innovation, which is key to decarbonize the energy system and attain long-term climate goals. In this paper, we link three integrated assessment models that possess a macroeconomic framework—WITCH, MERGE-ETL, and GEM-E3—with the bottom-up technology-rich energy system model TIAM-ECN, in order to quantitatively explore how investments in R&D can support deep decarbonization pathways. We take advantage of the endogenous technological learning feature of the first three models to derive R&D-induced capital cost reductions for strategic clusters of low-carbon technologies: solar energy, on- and offshore wind energy, carbon capture and storage, advanced fuels, and batteries for electric vehicles. We examine scenarios with different assumptions on CO2 mitigation and R&D policy. These assumptions are harmonized among our four models, and capital cost reductions driven by R&D are exogenously incorporated in TIAM-ECN, which enables a detailed assessment of the required energy transition. Our results show that the stringency of climate change mitigation policy remains the key factor influencing the diffusion of low-carbon technologies, while R&D can support mitigation goals and influence the contribution of different types of technologies. If implemented effectively and without worldwide barriers to knowledge spill-overs, R&D facilitates the deployment of mature technologies such as solar, wind, and electric vehicles, and enables lower overall energy system costs.","Nogueira, Larissa;Dalla Longa, Francesco;Reis, Lara Aleluia;Drouet, Laurent;Vrontisi, Zoi;Fragkiadakis, Kostas;Panos, Evangelos;van der Zwaan, Bob",Journal,Climatic Change,2023-07-01,"Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, Milan;Paul Scherrer Institut;Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek- TNO;Johns Hopkins University;Universiteit van Amsterdam;E3Modelling S.A.",Climate change mitigation ;  Decarbonization ;  Energy transition ;  IAM ;  R&D
Characterization of the Coffee Husk: A Potential Alternative for Sustainable Construction,"Agro-industrial wastes are a potential alternative for sustainable construction because they provide a renewable source, reducing raw materials consumption, emissions, and waste production. In the Colombian coffee sector, a big waste amount of husk is developed in its production, which is obtained from the pulping of coffee, being this husk an excellent source of cellulose and lignin, in a natural way. This experimental research aims to characterize the coffee husk as a potential alternative for sustainable construction in dividing walls. The methodology was developed in three steps, concerns from the obtention of the coffee husk in Ocaña Norte de Santander in Colombia to the physical and chemical characterization properties of this material considering the NTC-2441 Colombian Technical Standard. The results showed that the coffee husk presents a humidity of 13.3% with an average particle size of 611.93 μm. Also, the particle size of the coffee husk is related to the threshing process, where the by-product base coffee waste is obtained. In addition, the visualization of internal micro-cracks, carbon, and oxygen composition was possible with the presence of natural fibers using the Scanning Electron Microscopy technique. Finally, the coffee husk exposes in its chemical composition the presence of carbon and lignin, showing a structure with cracks of excellent resistance without the evidence of the samples fracture, which allows concluding that the coffee husk can be a potential and new alternative for sustainable construction for diving walls and another kind of applications in non-structural masonry in civil engineering, taking into account that in Colombia this bio-material has been little used in the mixture for obtaining products with good physical and mechanical performance.","Jaramillo, Haidee Yulady;Vasco-Echeverri, Oscar;Camperos, July Andrea Gómez",Journal,Civil Engineering and Architecture,2023-07-01,Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander;Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana,Agro-industrial ;  Coffee Husk ;  Eco-Bricks ;  Innovation ;  Sustainable Construction
"Assessing the state of biologically inspired design from three perspectives: academic, public, and practitioners","Biologically inspired design (BID) applies natural solutions to engineering challenges. Due to the widespread success of BID, we examine the following research question: how does the purpose of applying, the inspiration source, and the application of BID differ between academics, the public, and practitioners? Answering this question can help us design the tools used to support BID, provide an understanding of the current ‘state of BID’ and identify where BID solutions have not been widely utilized. Identifying gaps in utilization could prompt investigations into BID methods in new fields. To answer this research question, 660 BID samples were gathered equally from three data sources: Google Scholar, Google News, and the Asknature.org ‘Innovations’ database. The data were classified across seven dimensions and 68 subcategories. The conclusions of our research deliver insights into three areas. First, we identify trends in BID independent of source. For example, 72.5% of the biomimicry samples had the purpose of improving functionality and 87.6% of the samples impacted the usage phase of a product’s life cycle. Secondly, by examining the distribution of BID within each source, we identify areas for potential outreach or application. Finally, by contrasting BID results between three sources (academic, news, and practical case studies) we gain an understanding of the disparities between the three. This analysis provides BID researchers and practitioners with a useful insight into the present state of this field, with the goal of motivating future research and application.","Jastrzembski, M.

Macromolecules have been employed in medical filed in order to enhance, support, and substitute damaged tissues or any other biological function. In the past decade, the biomaterial field has developed considerably because of vast innovations in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, etc. Different types of biological macromolecules such as natural protein and polysaccharide etc. and synthetic molecules such as metal based, polymer based, and ceramic based etc. have been discussed. These materials can be modified by coatings, fibres, machine parts, films, foams, and fabrics for utilization in biomedical products and other environmental applications. At present, the biological macromolecules can used in different areas like medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, tissue engineering, and materials science. These materials have been used to promote the healing of human tissues, medical implants, bio-sensors and drug delivery, etc. These materials also considered as environmentally sustainable as they are prepared in association with renewable natural resources and living organisms in contrast to non-renewable resources (petrochemicals). In addition, enhanced compatibility, durability and circular economy of biological materials make them highly attractive and innovative for current research.The present review paper summarizes a brief about biological macromolecules, their classification, methods of synthesis, and their role in biomedicine, dyes and herbal products.","Thakur, Manita;Chandel, Manisha;Kumar, Ajay;Kumari, Sarita;Kumar, Pawan;Pathania, Deepak",Journal,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,2023-07-01,Maharaja Agrasen University;Central University of Jammu;Sardar Patel University;Himalayan Forest Research Institute;IEC University Baddi,Biological macromolecules ;  Biomedicine ;  Ceramic ;  Drug delivery ;  Herbal products
Transitioning additive manufacturing from rapid prototyping to high-volume production: A case study of complex final products,"This paper seeks answers to the question: what are the key factors that enable the scaling of additive manufacturing (AM) from rapid prototyping to high-volume production? Using a longitudinal case study, we collected primary and secondary data to trace the AM scaling journey of AeroCo, a highly innovative aerospace firm. Based on the case findings, we position AM as a whole system technology because it can print components for a wide range of subsystems in a complex final product. Scaling AM requires a significant realignment of existing, and often deeply entrenched, new technology, and product development processes. To achieve this alignment, AeroCo formed institutional alliances with the UK government and universities to establish university technology centers, which facilitated early stage ideation and “catapult” centers, which enabled high-volume testing in factory-like facilities. The case reveals how multiple functions needed to integrate, including research and development, product design, and future programs, to ensure that design changes cascaded from one subsystem to another, and that new technologies were linked to a future product to create a final product pull. These findings inform a managerial framework for additive manufacturing scaling that is generalizable to other digital technologies used in the design and production of complex final products, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, smart factories, and cyber physical production systems. Our framework contributes to innovation thought and practice by explaining how new product development processes and organizational structures change under the effect of digital technologies.","Roscoe, Samuel;Cousins, Paul D.;Handfield, Robert",Journal,Journal of Product Innovation Management,2023-07-01,Poole College of Management;University of Liverpool Management School;Thompson Rivers University,3D printing ;  additive manufacturing ;  complex final products ;  digital technologies ;  new technology scaling
Lessons Learned on Adopting Automated Compliance Checking in the AEC Industry: A Global Study,"Over the last decades, numerous automated compliance checking (ACC) systems have been developed. However, ACC is still not broadly used in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry today; little is known as to how ACC can be better accepted by the end users. This paper reports on a multicase study to learn valuable lessons from recent attempts to adopt ACC systems worldwide. Firstly, 18 semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 experts from eight countries, and supplementary data (e.g., documents, product information, and literature) related to each case were collected. Secondly, the interview and supplementary data were then coded to develop prominent themes. Thirdly, through a cross-case analysis, the 12 most determining variables that could influence the ACC adoption were identified. Three path models that explain the interrelationships between these variables and 10 propositions that can guide future ACC adoption were deduced. The results indicate that the government should play an important role to facilitate ACC adoption through funding, policies, and incentives. This study also provides valuable information to software vendors for delivering ACC systems that meet the needs of the industry, and for innovation managers in the industry to develop appropriate adoption plans for the ACC technology.","Zou, Yang;Guo, Brian H.W.;Papadonikolaki, Eleni;Dimyadi, Johannes;Hou, Lei",Journal,Journal of Management in Engineering,2023-07-01,The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment;University of Canterbury;RMIT University;The University of Auckland;CAS (Codify Asset Solutions Limited),Automated compliance checking (ACC) ;  Building information modeling (BIM) ;  Case study ;  Construction ;  Technology adoption
Growing human-scale scala tympani-like in vitro cell constructs,"Emerging materials and electrode technologies have potential to revolutionise development of higher resolution next-generation, bionic devices. However, barriers associated with the extended timescales, regulatory constraints, and opportunity costs of preclinical and clinical studies, can inhibit such innovation. Development of in vitro models that mimic human tissues would provide an enabling platform to overcome many of these barriers in the product development pathway. This research aimed to develop human-scale tissue engineered cochlea models for high throughput evaluation of cochlear implants on the bench. Novel mould-casting techniques and stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printing approaches to template hydrogels into spiral-shaped structures resembling the scala tympani were compared. While hydrogels are typically exploited to support 3D tissue-like structures, the challenge lies in developing irregular morphologies like the scala tympani, in which the cochlear electrodes are commonly implanted. This study successfully developed human-scale scala tympani-like hydrogel structures that support viable cell adhesion and can accommodate cochlear implants for future device testing.","Aregueta Robles, Ulises A.;Bartlett-Tomasetig, Florence;Poole-Warren, Laura A.",Journal,Biofabrication,2023-07-01,UNSW Sydney,3D printing ;  3D tissue engineering ;  cochlear implants ;  mould casting ;  scala tympani in vitro model
"Mapping the progress in natural fiber reinforced composites: Preparation, mechanical properties, and applications","Exploration of natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites (NFRPCs) in cutting-edge applications is due to phenomenal properties, such as lightweight, low-cost, and environmental aspects. NFs can effectively compete to the synthetic fibers in terms of mechanical, thermal and acoustic properties. As a result, the invention and innovation of natural fiber (NF) composites for commercial purposes has increased dramatically in recent years to meet the growing demand of the industrial sectors. Materials are the cornerstone of any manufacturing industry. NFRPCs are a good alternative to conventional materials because of their relatively high mechanical properties and lower production energy. NFs decrease the cost of the material by 5% while reducing the weight of the composite by 10% and the manufacturing energy by 80%. A lot of work has been done to enhance NFRPCs' mechanical properties to overcome their drawbacks, such as poor fiber-to-matrix adhesion, thermal stability, and moisture absorption. However, for better mechanical properties, it is crucial to understand the fibers' embedded manufacturing technique and the appropriate fiber weight percentage with appropriate matrix. This review article discusses composites made of NFs providing a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the field of NFRPCs, focusing on recent advancements in preparation techniques, improvements in mechanical properties such as tensile, flexural and impact strength of NFRPCs with various fiber types, fiber weight ratio, fiber-to-matrix ratio for appropriate engineering applications, and elucidating future research directions by analyzing trends and challenges in the field. The aim of this review article is to provide a deep evaluation of the progress made in the field of NFRPCs, with the ultimate goal of advancing knowledge and understanding of this field.","Dev, Barshan;Rahman, Ashikur;Alam, Rubel;Repon, Reazuddin;Nawab, Yasir",Journal,Polymer Composites,2023-07-01,National Textile University Faisalabad;Kaunas University of Technology;ZR Research Institute for Advanced Materials;BGMEA University of Fashion and Technology,applications ;  fibers extraction ;  mechanical properties ;  natural fiber ;  natural fiber reinforced polymer composite
Promotion of green financing: Role of renewable energy and energy transition in China,"This study examined the influence of green financing, renewable energy, and energy transition. Although the importance of natural resources has been discussed in the current literature, this study examines how China's environmental footprint has changed due to recent developments in green expenditure, natural resource rent (NRR) management, green technology innovation (GTI), and GDP growth. This was achieved using the NARDL method on data spanning 2000–2018. There is a need to examine how these factors affect the economic growth of underdeveloped nations. This research examines whether gross domestic product, green technological innovation, and economic policy uncertainty in China have contributed to resource curse theory. Natural resource rent stifled China's economic growth, as predicted by the resource curse theory and supported by empirical research. This is similar to how economic policy uncertainty stunted the green financing role of renewable energy and energy transition in China. Contrastingly, gross domestic product and green technology innovation help speed up financial growth while mitigating the impact of natural resources. Short- and long-term corporate plans and policies should be put in place based on the results, such as ensuring sufficient usage of natural resources, reallocating funding at regional governmental levels, and transitioning toward sustainable technology.","Sun, Gebing;Li, Guozhi;Dilanchiev, Azer;Kazimova, Asli",Journal,Renewable Energy,2023-07-01,International Black Sea University;Azerbaijan State University of Economics (UNEC);Wenzhou University;Xinjiang University,China ;  Green financing ;  Green technology innovation ;  Natural resource ;  Renewable energy
Additive manufacturing of hydroxyapatite-based composites for bioengineering applications,"Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a promising support structure for tissue engineering that has considerably gained a lot of interest in recent years due to its potential applications in the biomedical industry and biocompatibility characteristics to make easier proliferation and cellular growth tissue implants in patient. Different materials, notably heterogeneous biomaterials characterized as matrix material and strengthening materials have recently been suggested as materials that can be utilized to produce scaffolds with better bioactive features. Depending on the chemical resemblance of HA with inorganic cultural and biological mineralized structures, considerable innovations have been devoted to hydroxyapatite (HA)-reinforced materials, mainly focusing on bone tissue development. To produce artificial porous bone in structure is challenging with conventional processes. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a precise, reproductive, and accurate approach to fabricating complex and functional geometry of biomedical materials such as internal microporous structures in a layer-by-layer fashion from three-dimensional models. The present review identified the recent development of AM methods in producing HA-reinforced composite and biocomposites materials such as cellular components. It highlighted and reviewed different AM technologies used in the fabrication of HA and its composite materials and mechanical properties of HA scaffold produced by AM. The reviewed study present a comprehensive overview of the discussed technologies and suggestions for future perspectives to provide a comprehensive view of the techniques explored and complexities in this evolving field.","Ojo, Sammy A.;Abere, Dare Victor;Adejo, Helen Ojoma;Robert, Rosanna Ann;Oluwasegun, Kunle Michael",Journal,Bioprinting,2023-07-01,College of Engineering and Polymer Science;SUNY Polytechnic Institute;Flinders University;University of Manitoba,Additive manufacturing ;  Biomedical ;  Composites ;  Hydroxyapatite ;  Tissue engineering
Uncovering the role of renewable energy innovation in China's low carbon transition: Evidence from total-factor carbon productivity,"The rapid growth of Chinese renewable energy innovation has shown great potential to improve total-factor carbon productivity (TFCP), but it still lacks sufficient literature understanding of the detailed impact and mechanisms. This paper empirically tests the influence mechanism, effect characteristics, and causal configurations based on a sample of 30 provinces from 2006 to 2017. We reveal optimizing the energy structure is the crucial intermediate channel for renewable energy technology innovation improving the TFCP, but it is not the unique mechanism. Since renewable energy technology innovation could directly improve the efficiency of the full industrial chain of electricity, the remaining channel can be summarized as the power operating efficiency improvement. From the heterogeneous analysis, the technological innovations in wind and solar energy display relatively larger contributions to the growth of total-factor carbon productivity. The threshold effect analysis further indicates the larger the coal consumption, the larger probability for renewable energy innovation to play a role in improving TFCP. Eventually, we observed four causal configurations of renewable energy technology innovation to determine the TFCP. It suggests renewable energy innovation cannot affect TFCP independently and often acts with other factors, eventually explaining the actual levels of regional TFCP.","Su, Tong;Chen, Yufang;Lin, Boqiang",Journal,Environmental Impact Assessment Review,2023-07-01,Xiamen University;Bureau of Industry and information technology of Xiamen,Energy structure ;  Renewable energy ;  Technological innovation ;  Threshold effect ;  Total-factor carbon productivity

Thanks to the innovations that are inherent in this program, the design time can be reduced by more than 3 times, and the design error can also be reduced by complying with the design criteria. To secure the reliability of seismic design, which involves complex mathematical and engineering calculations, it is necessary to devise a way to systematically support the use of software admitted in academia.","Oh, Changsoo;Kim, Seoyoung;Kong, Hasung",Journal,Advances in Engineering Software,2023-07-01,Woosuk University,Firefighting seismic design ;  Floor-mounted ;  Pump systems ;  Seismic calculation ;  Seismic design software

Parameters are introduced to simulate the spillover effects and market structure. Our advanced analysis together with numerical experiments reveals that (i) as the market structure becomes more competitive, the firm's investments for abatement technology innovation under non-cooperative setting is more likely to be preferred to the investments for abatement technology innovation under cooperative setting; (ii) for a given emission tax, the firm's investments for abatement technology innovation increase with the increase of the spillovers, while the investments for abatement technology innovation decrease with the increase of the competition intensity; (iii) for a given emission tax, the optimal solution of the firm's investments for abatement technology innovation is stable for both non-cooperative and cooperative cases.","Li, Shoude;Wu, Changzhi",Journal,Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization,2023-07-01,Antai College of Economics and Management;Guangzhou University,abatement technology ;  Market structure ;  R&D investments
Research on chaos of product color image system driven by brand image,"Chaos means innovation in the field of design. Meanwhile, the product image system is not only a quantified ‘formula’ between product and psychological cognitive semantics, but also a nonlinear “system”. Therefore, the chaotic study of product color image system was carried out to grasp the users’ color sensibility demands in their complex and nonlinear perceptual cognitive processes accurately, which could help the developers to keep up with market trends and reduce the blindness of design. In this study, the Chaos Theory combine with the Kansei Engineering were applied to obtain the color brand image, collect the time series and analyze the chaos of product color image system. The results showed that product color image system has a chaotic characteristic. Furthermore, the chaotic phenomenon in the color image system of the available products was analyzed to show that the product color trends could be quantitatively predicted. At last, a product color image perception chaotic box was proposed to conceive based on the result of this study, which provides new ideas and theoretical support for the in-depth exploration of complex systems of color images. This is a new attempt to apply the Chaos Theory to the color image cognition process.","Zhang, Xinxin;Li, Yueying;Pei, Huining;Ding, Man",Journal,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2023-07-01,Hebei University of Technology,Brand image ;  chaos ;  Kansei engineering ;  Perceptual cognitive processes ;  Product color image system
Enhancing design thinking in engineering students with project-based learning,"Modern society requires increasing creative talents. As an educational concept, design thinking (DT) has been successfully applied in education to foster innovation. However, educational research on improving the engineering design ability of engineering students through the design process and practice is limited. Research has shown that project-based learning (PBL) is an effective engineering education method. This research integrates DT and PBL (DT–PBL) in teaching the course “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Basic Algorithm Training” and discusses the teaching method and implementation of DT–PBL in detail through an example of a comprehensive training project of software and hardware collaboration based on a convolutional neural network and Raspberry Pi. This study considers the impact of DT–PBL on engineering students in terms of learning motivation and creativity using the pretest and posttest mixed method. Data analysis of quantitative tests and qualitative interviews shows that (1) The experimental group is superior to the comparison group in terms of overall learning motivation. Through a comprehensive training project of software and hardware collaboration, students can reflect on the required professional knowledge and skills, and improve their DT, engineering application, and innovation abilities and (2) The experimental group was superior to the comparison group in terms of overall creativity (adventure, curiosity, imagination, and challenge). Students in the experimental group can think more quickly and put forth more creative ideas from the perspective of user needs.","Jiang, Cuiling;Pang, Yilin",Journal,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2023-07-01,East China University of Science and Technology,creativity and innovation ;  design thinking (DT) ;  engineering education ;  learning motivation ;  project-based learning (PBL)
Research on the influence mechanism of heterogeneous environmental regulation on the manufacturing equipment industry in Asia-Pacific countries,"High-end manufacturing equipment industry is an important symbol to measure the core competitiveness of a country's industry. With the strengthening of environmental regulation, the manufacturing equipment industry is facing multi-means environmental regulation. To study the impact of environmental regulation on the manufacturing equipment industry, we establish a joint equation model of multiple mediating variables, collect cross-country panel data of 19 APEC countries from 2009 to 2019, and empirically study the impact mechanism of environmental regulation on the international competitiveness of the manufacturing equipment industry. The empirical results show that environmental regulation can accelerate the transfer of the manufacturing equipment industry and promote green technology innovation to a certain extent. This affects the international competitiveness of the manufacturing equipment industry, and the impact is “U-shaped.” Finally, we put forward countermeasures and suggestions to improve the international competitiveness of the manufacturing equipment industry.

The Differentiated Impact of the Institutional Environment on Eco-Innovation and Green Manufacturing Strategies: A Comparative Analysis Between Emerging and Developed Countries,"This article argues that institutional environments have different impacts on the association between a strategic orientation to eco-innovation and green manufacturing (GM), depending on the countries' degree of development and type of market. A survey drew 172 responses from manufacturing firms from emerging countries (Brazil and India) and 130 responses from developed countries (Germany and the USA). The results showed that institutional regulatory pressures impact firms in emerging markets at a strategic level, putting pressure on an orientation aimed at eco-innovation. In contrast, consumer market pressures have an effect on developed markets at the execution level, directly impacting GM activities. The main contribution of this article demonstrates that different institutional environments consist of induction factors applied to the competitive strategy of innovation management (strategic orientation for eco-innovation) and engineering (GM). Our results reveal that institutional impulses generated by the dimensions of consumer pressure or by a market's regulatory framework may differ. In this sense, the patterns of institutional maturity and environmental maturity of the markets are equally important in inducing the development of eco-innovative and GM capabilities. The evidence provides insights for managers in both developed and emerging markets about the drivers of institutional environments in different contexts and about how management strategies aimed at eco-innovation and GM should be guided.","Lazarou Tarraco, Elisangela;Borini, Felipe Mendes;Bernardes, Roberto Carlos;Navarrete, Sabrina Della Santa",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-07-01,Universidade de São Paulo;Centro Universitario da Fundacao Educacional Inaciana Padre Saboia de Medeiros,Eco-innovation in emerging markets ;  green manufacturing (GM) capabilities ;  green manufacturing (GM) strategies ;  institutional environment
Why We Need Open Data in Computer Science Education Research,"Innovation and technology in computer science education is driven by research and practice. Both of these activities involve the gathering and analysis of data in order to develop new tools, methods including software, or strategies to solve recent challenges in the field. However, data as basis for any new solution is hardly shared, reused and recognized. This is due to the fact that the publication of research data encompasses a number of challenges for researchers, while benefits of publishing data remain low. As a result, further analyses of data as part of secondary research are uncommon in the computer science education community. Therefore, the authors of this position paper critically reflect on current practices related to the publication of research data in this community. Moreover, a path forward is outlined for future conferences, such as ITiCSE, to become increasingly FAIR, and open with regard to research data.","Kiesler, Natalie;Schiffner, Daniel",Conference Proceeding,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2023-06-29,Deutsches Institut für Internationale Pädagogische Forschung,computing education research ;  fair principles ;  open data ;  open science ;  secondary research
"Artificial intelligence in the digital chemical industry, its application and sustainability","The chemical manufacturing industries are at the forefront of innovation, exploring novel technologies through ""smart manufacturing"" and ""industrial modernization"" using computational approaches to cater to increasing market demands and stringent regulations. Digital design enables the manufacturers to understand and streamline the process development and production using process systems engineering tools. The present drive toward industrial automation advancements such as Industry 4.0, Pharma 4.0, and smart manufacturing also enables technological developments in research to percolate into industries to meet product quality, safety, and profitability challenges. It is envisaged that the promises of continuous manufacturing will be realized with the evolution of digitalization technologies in various stages of design, development, and implementation. Further, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based intelligent systems are gaining popularity in all engineering and science disciplines due to their ability to solve real-world challenges. In the chemicals field, digital transformation success necessitates a complete, holistic approach that considers the entire asset lifespan, from design to operations and maintenance. However, it has also led to far-reaching impacts on technology and the workforce worldwide.

Board 152: An Analysis of School District Adoption of K-12 Engineering Curriculum (Evaluation) (DEI),"Historically the STEM disciplines have not been inclusive. Workforce projections indicate that there is a growing need for STEM professionals and STEM degree programs are not keeping up with demand to meet labor force needs. Efforts to broaden interest in the STEM disciplines have been ongoing with considerable investment from government agencies and private sector organizations. However, participation in the STEM workforce still does not reflect population demographics. The research literature provides an evidence-base that early STEM experiences can impact K-12 students intention to enroll in STEM degree programs. Over the last two decades pre-college engineering programs and pathways have been developed to prepare K-12 students for engineering degree programs at the post-secondary level. A secondary goal of these pathways was to broaden interest in engineering professions and diversify the engineering pipeline. Pre-college programs that provide a positive STEM experience may increase the pipeline and diversity of students interested in pursuing STEM at the postsecondary level. The Project Lead the Way Program (PLTW) is one example of a pre-college engineering program implemented in all 50 states in the US in over 12,000 schools. This study examined adoption patterns of PLTW using the lens of Diffusion of Innovation Theory of engineering curriculum using a 12-year data set from Texas. Researchers across Texas. Factors that may influence adoption were examined including school size, expenditures, student demographics, and standardized test scores. Findings suggest that school size based on enrollment and socio-economic status have a significant impact on adoption of the PLTW engineering curriculum. It was also found that adopting districts enroll more students from underrepresented groups which may lead to broader participation in engineering.","Odell, Michael R.;Feng, Li;Thomas, Christopher;Stocks, Eric;Massey, Patrick",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Michigan State University;Texas State University;University of Texas at Tyler,"diffusion of innovation ;  engineering education ;  panel logit model (Poster, Work in Progress) ;  STEM education"
Learning from Machine Learning and Teaching with Machine Teaching: Using Lessons from Data Science to Enhance Collegiate Classrooms,"In the field of data science, advancements in the field of machine learning have led to programs developing high-level reasoning, intricate data understanding, and groundbreaking predictive models. Machine Learning (ML) research aims at making a program 'learn,' that is, develop models and techniques with known information to be able to handle future problems. Traditionally, this is done by increasing the quantity and quality of input data and training the learner in more effective ways to interpret that information. This has a direct parallel to the collegiate classroom, as instructors aim to inspire mastery over a topic to their students through a variety of methods (homework problems, examinations, projects, etc.) and teach them the corresponding skillsets from feedback on these assignments. Machine Teaching (MT) research, on the other hand, aims at making the teacher more productive by using their own cognitive models to improve the quality of the data holistically. Again, this has a corresponding counterpart to current teaching pedagogies; the instructor decides on the details of an assignment from their own knowledge and experience with the end goal of having students retain the information and apply it to future problems. This paper identifies how the various innovations, lessons, and conclusions discovered in the field of artificial intelligence can enhance the quality of a collegiate classroom experience and improve student performance.","Buccafusca, Lucas",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Johns Hopkins University,
The Nexus of Entrepreneurship and Innovation: A new approach to looking at the creative contributions of engineering graduates,"Engineers are called upon to possess strong analytical and communication skills, exhibit practical ingenuity, and be creative thinkers, all the while upholding high ethical standards. In more recent times they are also expected to be innovative and entrepreneurial. We see this in large companies working to incentivize their engineers to contribute to product innovation through, for example, involvement in makerspaces, hackathons, and design sprints. We see it in universities in their offering stand-alone courses on product innovation and entrepreneurship for their engineering students, integrating innovative and entrepreneurial ideas into existing technical courses, and creating a variety of extra-curricular activities to put those ideas into play. At the same time, the concepts of innovation and entrepreneurship are generally treated and explored as distinct areas of research; as such, distinct and separate measures of an individual's self-efficacy and associated behaviors have been developed. In this work we take a different tack, wanting to identify the nexus, or common ground, of Innovative and Entrepreneurial self-efficacies, and Innovative and Entrepreneurial behaviors. Thinking about common ground is a useful lens with which to look at the intentional or focused creativity of engineers, whether they are working in new or existing enterprises. First, we show the development of this intersectional/nexus concept (which we call Embracing New Ideas, ENI) in terms of measures of self-efficacy (ENI-SE; consisting of six items, with a Cronbach's Alpha of.85) and behavior (ENI-B; consisting of five items, with a Cronbach's Alpha of.80). Then based on Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), we model ENI-B (our dependent variable) as a function of ENI-SE and a variety of workplace and work-assignment features, as well as demographics. Our data for developing these new Self-Efficacy and Behavior Constructs, and creating a descriptive model comes from a sample of over 700 engineering alumni working in a variety of roles and job functions. Results from linear regression models show that over 55 percent of the variability in ENI-B is explained by a combination of self-efficacy and contextual or workplace factors. These results begin to establish a solid foundation for subsequent work that explores educational experiences that contribute to engineering students developing self-efficacy in Embracing New Ideas, and workplace settings that truly enable behaviors related to Embracing New Ideas.","Kempf, Felix;Elfiki, Nada;Mouallem, Aya;Chen, Helen L.;Toye, George;Lande, Micah;Hysi, Kei;Ge, Xiao;Sheppard, Sheri D.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,South Dakota School of Mines & Technology;Stanford University;King's College London;Swarthmore College,
Why STEM? The External Factors Influencing International STEM Postdoctoral Scholars' Career Decision,"This research paper explores the external factors that influence international STEM postdoctoral scholars to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Understanding these factors may be critical as the U.S. grapples with the need to broaden and diversify participation in the global STEM workforce. Duffy and Dik (2009) identified four key external factors that influence a person's career decision: (1) family expectations and needs, (2) life circumstances, (3) spiritual and religious reasons, and (4) social service motivations. Using an instrumental case study design (Stake, 1995), interviews with 20 international STEM postdoctoral scholars occurred to explore the external factors that influenced their STEM career decision deductively. Three themes emerged: (1) parents were highly encouraging, (2) a love of science was nurtured in school, and (3) they were eager to engage in and promote scientific innovation. These findings illustrate the ways in which family, schools, and community influence the STEM career trajectories of international postdoctoral scholars. This knowledge base can be valuable when seeking to recruit and retain them in the U.S. STEM workforce. The identified factors also could be particularly instructive to U.S. primary and secondary school teachers and administrators, as well as U.S. higher education faculty.","Mendez, Sylvia L.;Watson, Kathryn",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,
ICT-Mediated STEM for the Inclusive Education of Migrants and Refugees Children,"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) is an approach that integrates science and mathematics education through the development of scientific practices, technology, engineering design, and mathematical analysis. Although governments in North American and European countries have invested in promoting the study of STEM disciplines, educational programs for migrants have been offered for adults, and very few programs for children, which are invisible, downplaying the effects of migration on the educational process of children. Educational interventions are needed at early ages, focusing on the funds of knowledge from the children's informal learning during their migratory trajectories, such as the United States and Israel, as host countries that have historically reaped the benefits of immigration. Inclusive education requires ICTs to overcome the social, economic, and cultural barriers presented by migrant children. However, transnational education studies focus on the effects of migration on children's identity and academic success, but there is a gap in the literature on empirical studies on the role of ICT-mediated STEM education in migrant and refugee children. For this reason, a systematic literature review was developed in Web of Science, which aims to close the gap in the literature and show that STEM education develops skills that allow migrant families access to economic and social benefits and promote social innovation processes in destination countries. The search algorithm that linked STEM education research and its relationship with ICT, in conjunction with the target population of migrant and refugee children. This algorithm was refined for publications written in Spanish and English between 2000 and 2023 yielding 70445 publications. These publications were evaluated by 5 criteria: the prestige of the journal/publisher and author, consistency, thematic appropriateness, and relevance of the results. This resulted in 338 publications that were classified into contribution levels according to the score obtained in the evaluation criteria. Finally, 48 publications were selected for their high level of contribution to 8 major themes that were developed i) the disciplines of STEM education, ii) the delimited definition of STEM education, iii) the benefits of STEM education, iv) STEM learning for migrant and refugee children, v) Computational thinking at K-12 STEM education, vi) STEM education for innovation, vii) STEM integration cases, and viii) STEM in the inclusive learning spaces. It is concluded that ICT-mediated STEM promotes inclusive learning spaces in which diversity is valued and quality education for all is guaranteed. While it is demystified that migrants and refugees do not have electronic devices, children should be guaranteed full access to the ICT-mediated learning environment during their migrant journey. Finally, it is proposed to deepen the literature on the development of computational thinking skills in children, as it is considered the basis of STEM disciplines for the design of activities that integrate these disciplines and are adapted to the educational needs of migrant and refugee children.","Sánchez-Gómez, Juan Sebastián;Cajiao, María Catalina Ramirez;Herrera, Andrea",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,"Universidad El Bosque;Universidad De Los Andes, Merida",
A Multi-Method Analysis of Engineering Student Curiosity,"Curiosity, an ability vital to the process of invention and innovation, has also been correlated with a variety of desirable outcomes in education and is recognized as a desirable characteristic in engineering students and practicing engineers. Thus, developing and integrating a curriculum that instills and fosters curiosity in engineering students is essential. To assess student development of curiosity, a direct and an indirect assessment for curiosity were integrated into the curriculum for a first-year engineering honors program at a large midwestern university. The Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale (5DC), a 25-item instrument developed by Kashdan and colleagues, was implemented as the indirect assessment. The direct assessment for curiosity was developed by the research team and tasks students to brainstorm about a topic and then write 10 distinct questions about that topic. Both assessments were administered at two time points in the academic year. A subset of data of 54 students, randomized across course sections, was selected for analysis. For the indirect Likert-type survey data, means were computed for each of the five constructs per participant, and pre and post responses were compared using a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test based on data set normality. To evaluate the direct assessment data, the 10 questions generated by students were analyzed using a deductive coding approach which was guided by a codebook derived from the 5DC. Differences in the frequency of the question codes between pre and post implementations were tested using Pearson correlation tests. We found a significant increase (p<0.05) in student self-reported pre post scores for Social Curiosity and Thrill Seeking constructs over the first year. Despite those constructs increasing, students generated questions pertaining to Information Seeking and Stress Tolerance constructs most frequently in the direct pre and post assessment, with approximately 60% and 25% of questions coded into those categories, respectively. The frequency of codes was not different between the pre and post assessments. These findings suggest that further work is needed to understand discrepancies between how students perceive their curiosity personality and how they exercise that curiosity in an academic context. This paper explores the direct and indirect assessment data sets and discusses implications for our findings on pedagogical approaches to fostering curiosity in first-year engineering.","Ita, Meagan Eleanor;Singer, Amanda Marie;Kajfez, Rachel Louis",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,The Ohio State University;Arvinas,
Fostering Global Engineers through the Study of the Humanities: Assessment of the Course”Science and Religion in Japan” from a Racial Equity Perspective,"This was an exploratory study to examine the effectiveness of the Spring and Fall courses in the Academic Year (AY) 2022 of 'Science and Religion in Japan' from an engineering education perspective. Technological innovations are occurring through the fusion of science and engineering fields into new cutting-edge disciplines. Such a world requires engineers with broad knowledge, a global perspective, an appreciation of racial equity, and the capability of working in interdisciplinary teams. Therefore, it is worth discussing the effectiveness of including humanities components in engineering courses. 'Science and Religion in Japan' comprises students mainly from Europe, Asia, and South America. Thus, class discussion is conducted through a racial equity lens, as students participate in the conversation from diverse standpoints. This paper demonstrates insights about 1) how this 'Science and Religion in Japan' course promotes global competence and cross-cultural understanding, 2) the effectiveness of interdisciplinary approaches in higher education, as exemplified by the inclusion of humanities components in engineering courses, 3) the value of diverse perspectives in the study of history, and 4) the methodology used to assess this humanities course and the program evaluation results.","Yoshikubo, Hatsuko;Trovato, Gabriele;Ishizaki, Hiroyuki",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Shibaura Institute of Technology,Assessing Humanities Courses in the Research-Based Learning Program ;  Effectiveness of Interdisciplinary Approaches in Higher Education ;  Humanities in Engineering Education ;  MGUDS-S ;  Value of Diverse Perspectives in the Study of History
Board 199: A Move to Sustainability: Launching an Instructor Interface,"Sketch Mechanix, an NSF-IUSE funded research project, launched a new feature with the Fall 2022 semester: an instructor interface. Sketch Mechanix's development had previously focused upon converting to an html platform and then expanding problem types. The initial problem that was featured was truss analysis (method of joints). The second problem type was free body diagrams with point loads at any angle. The most recent sketch recognition feature was the addition of applied moments, using a curved arrow. For any of these problem types, Sketch Mechanix features sketch recognition and automatic feedback to students on their free body diagrams through an online homework platform. With this latest innovation, instructors adopting this novel homework system can now input their own problems, view student scores broken down by problem, and adjust assignment due dates. Prior to the launch of this interface, all of these features involved emailing the development team. For instance, the instructor previously had to email the desired problems, their solutions, and points awarded, as well as wait for the developer to email back student scores to be able to see how students were doing. While sketch recognition has long been the key draw to using Sketch Mechanix, the addition of the instructor interface will aid in the project's sustainability as it nears the end of the grant period. This paper and poster describe the instructor interface, including screen shots, share feedback from instructors who tested the interface in classes, and detail the future of the program.","Talley, Kimberly Grau;Rogers, Jeron Tyler;Keeper, Justin;Shryock, Kristi J.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Texas State University;Texas A&M University,
Transforming Engineering Education for Neurodiversity: Epistemic Communities as a Model for Change,"A growing body of literature suggests that neurodiverse learners, including students with autism, ADHD, and dyslexia, may possess strengths that are highly desirable within engineering disciplines, such as systems thinking, creativity, and 3D visualization skills. However, despite the potential of neurodiverse individuals to leverage these assets to contribute to innovative solutions to engineering problems, they remain highly underrepresented in engineering majors. With this in mind, a department-level initiative was established to radically transform the educational experiences of neurodiverse students by moving beyond academic accommodation of learning differences to empowering students to leverage their unique strengths in engineering. In undertaking this transformation, an epistemic communities model was adopted and implemented as infrastructure for change as part of a National Science Foundation Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (NSF:RED) grant within the context of a Civil and Environmental Engineering department at a large, research intensive (R1) institution. Epistemic communities unite members in a shared purpose through the establishment and transmission of shared values and practices, allowing stakeholders to build community from within and sustain lasting change. Through our epistemic community, we aim to make local change within the department, but we also hope to contribute to a broader paradigm shift that transforms how university faculty and staff understand and perceive neurodiversity, a key lever for enhancing the educational experiences of neurodiverse students. This conceptual paper presents an overview of these departmental transformation efforts, with a focus on the shared theory, code, and tools around which our epistemic community is constructed. First, we present a social ecology theoretical framework (theory) that challenges the deficit-based approach that has historically shaped neurodiverse learners' experiences by emphasizing learners' assets and their potential of a neurodiverse student body to contribute to innovation for the benefit of society. Second, we discuss the infusion of strengths-based language (code) related to neurodiversity and its role in contributing to a collective mind shift across the department. Third, we present a discussion of the practices, structures, and artefacts (tools), such as shared standards for course revision, that were established and co-created by community members to facilitate departmental change.","Chrysochoou, Maria;Zaghi, Arash Esmaili;Syharat, Connie Mosher",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Connecticut,
How to Make Engineering Programs Worse for Women: A Reverse Brainstorming Session with SWE Students,"Female engineering students have unique insights for improving engineering programs and yet they often do not feel empowered to suggest changes. This paper will describe the creation and execution of a pilot brainstorming workshop titled, “How to make engineering programs worse for women” which was developed as part of a master's level creativity and innovation class for a research practitioner. The pilot was run with a small cohort of eight female engineering students from the local chapter of the Society for Women Engineers (SWE) during engineering week in March 2022. The 2-hour workshop employed three proven creativity techniques including reverse brainstorming, a four-field matrix for evaluation, and enrichment tools for elaboration. The catchy title attracted a small outspoken group of participants that were able to create many negative ideas, a good exercise in divergent thinking. Negative ideas are often easier to come up with than solutions, as our analytical brains limit creative potential. The results of this workshop were two-fold. First, the participants were able to vent their current frustrations and they also were able to practice some creative thinking techniques that might be useful in their careers and personal life. Second, the workshop yielded quite a few implementable ideas ranging from short-term to long-term that are being used to improve the campus experience for female engineering students. To date, the researcher has been able to implement three ideas generated by the workshop participants including a new mid-term course survey, women-led makerspace programming, and registration support for parents. Additional ideas such as priority registration for women and gender pairing of academic advisors are in longer-term discussions. This paper will detail the workshop format and supplementing documents, as well as the ideas generated from the pilot workshop. The research practitioner hopes this brainstorming workshop can be used by other program managers to meaningfully engage with female engineering students, implement rapid change, and improve the learning environment for this underrepresented cohort of students.","Clavijo, Sandra Furnbach",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Stevens Institute of Technology,
Burnout: The Cost of Masking Neurodiversity in Graduate STEM Programs,"A growing body of literature suggests that neurodivergent individuals, such as those with autism, dyslexia, and ADHD possess unique abilities that may be assets in STEM fields. Despite the potential of neurodivergent students to leverage these abilities to contribute to innovation in their field, they face a multitude of barriers and difficulties as they navigate rigid educational environments. While there has been research on the strengths and challenges of neurodivergent STEM students at the undergraduate level, there is a lack of studies at the graduate level. This paper details findings from a qualitative study on the experiences of neurodivergent graduate students within their STEM programs. Findings from a series of 10 focus groups suggest that neurodivergent students face pressure to mask their neurodiversity-related traits and hide the challenges that they often face within their graduate program. Neurodivergent students often experience variations in attention, motivation, time management, and other elements of executive function; these variations may pose distinct challenges for neurodivergent students as they shoulder heavy workloads while attempting to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The findings from this study suggest that the additional pressure placed on neurodivergent graduate students to mask their experiences contributes to an unacknowledged cognitive and emotional load that may significantly impact their mental health in the form of anxiety and burnout. These findings have implications within the context of the advisor-advisee relationship, as variations in advising practices and communication styles may impact graduate students' perceived need to mask their neurodivergence. This paper aims to highlight the neurodivergent students' experiences with masking and the mental health challenges that neurodivergent students face as they navigate the demands of graduate-level STEM programs. It is anticipated that these findings may foster the adoption of inclusive advising practices for faculty advisors and program administrators and to enhance the educational experiences of neurodivergent students in graduate STEM programs.","Syharat, Connie Mosher;Hain, Alexandra;Zaghi, Arash Esmaili;Berdanier, Catherine G.P.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Connecticut;Pennsylvania State University,
An Innovative Laboratory Physics Course Using Specialized Software and Digital Media: Students' and Instructors' Perspectives,"At a private Latin American university in the southern hemisphere, efforts were made to move away from traditional physics lab teaching practice during a recent innovation in its academic program. As a result, a physics course was created to be held in the classroom rather than in the physics laboratory, using specialized software and digital media. The laboratory course allows students to collect and analyze data through PhET simulations or videos rather than in a traditional laboratory setting. The aim is to promote agency and participation in all students, make the experimentation process more agile and dynamic, enhance student engagement, and make the experimentation process more flexible. This study aims to examine student perceptions of their learning experience in a physics laboratory course taught using digital tools instead of traditional laboratory facilities. The central research question being addressed is: How do students perceive active learning in a physics laboratory course prepared using technology? The is a quantitative research study in which participated over 500 first-year engineering and science major students in a laboratory course. The students completed a pre-and-post survey before and after an 8-week intervention period. The survey collected their perceptions regarding an innovative teaching method used for the laboratory course. The pre-and-post comparison allows for contrasting student opinions in three main areas: type of instruction, teaching strategies, and student response to the instruction. The study presents some of the laboratory activities' outcomes and limitations. One specific activity, the capacitor discharge experiment, will be thoroughly discussed to compare the traditional physical setup with the technology-based version. Findings highlight the pros and cons of the teaching method used and reflect on what has been learned. It also suggests potential next steps for further improvement.","Pineida, Carlos;Dominguez, Angeles",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,active learning ;  educational innovation ;  educational technology ;  higher education ;  PhET ;  Physics laboratory course
Holistic Review of Multi-Site Combined REU/RET Program and the Long-Term Effects of Hybrid Mode of Instruction,"To increase the participation and graduation rates of post-secondary students from underrepresented and minority groups in the field of engineering, the Smart City Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) (SCR2) Mega-Site program was introduced in 2018. The SCR2 initiative, which has been successfully run for the past four years with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), involves a partnership of 14 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and one Institution serving Hispanic students (HSI). The leading university for this program is Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. Underperforming REU students are encouraged to participate in research opportunities through the SCR2 program, which has been shown to increase student retention and graduation rates. Participants in RET are chosen from the area's high schools and community colleges that feed into the consortium institutions. RET participants' involvement in practical engineering research projects enables them to inspire their students to choose engineering as a career. With an emphasis on smart and connected cities, the SCR2 program provides summer research experiences (eight weeks for students and six weeks for teachers). This paper presents our learnings and insights of the program for the past four years with evaluation findings. There have been 116 students and 44 teachers who have successfully participated. The research program was conducted on campus in 2019, but due to COVID-19, the program was conducted online in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, the program was redesigned to be hybrid, and six host sites participated. Despite the changes in the program, students' prowess was enhanced by their teamwork and engagement in the projects. The post-program survey raised concerns about females' participation in the program for four years. Even though the number of female participants decreased from 2019 to 2022, the participating females reported they were confident, satisfied, and gained knowledge by the end of the program. The assessment results, however, make it clear that additional focus is required on women's experiences in the program to increase their sense of belonging in the engineering sector. The SCR2 program's transition from an on-site to a hybrid serves as an example of how innovation in engineering education may address the problems and give insights into the tools and technologies needed for efficient cross-site communication, faculty advisor/mentor involvement, participant engagement, and making the most of the strong network connecting the participating schools.","Fathima, Hashmath;Nyarko, Kofi",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Morgan State University,
Indigenous Innovators: Creating Collaborative Student-Engineer Innovation Teams between Tribal Colleges and Research Institutions,"This paper explores the potential advantages and disadvantages of partnerships between state-sponsored universities and tribal universities. Over the years, collaboration between these two types of institutions has been nearly nonexistent. However, recent initiatives, such as the collaboration between a group of student biomedical-engineers, have begun to shed light on the potential benefits of such partnerships. Through interviews with the students and faculty involved in the research, the paper aims to extract generalized feelings and insights into the experience of cross-institutional collaboration. The findings reveal that tribal colleges are underutilized, and that cross-institutional relationships can be highly beneficial in terms of education and development. This paper concludes that cross-institutional collaboration should be more widely promoted as a means of enhancing the education and development of diverse communities.","Bittner, Nicholas M.;Kennedy, Rebecca;Parton, Elizabeth",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of North Dakota,
Creation of an Engineering Technology Program,"High-quality engineering and engineering technology education is essential to the continued and increasing success of our current and future technological society. Existing and emerging industries need both engineers and engineering technologists to design and develop future innovations. One large, mid-Atlantic, R1 institution recently created an engineering technology program within their existing engineering college to capitalize on the synergies provided by the college and the new program. While the College's seven departments are divided by “engineering field” and represent 13 distinct undergraduate majors, the B.S. Engineering Technology degree was intentionally designed to be general and provide flexibility through multiple interdisciplinary opportunities. The B.S. Engineering Technology degree consists of a manufacturing-focused engineering technology core plus two areas of emphasis, selected from a current list of five areas of emphasis. Students have significant flexibility within this general program to focus their education toward specific career goals. Because of the diverse opportunities provided by the five areas of emphasis, the program includes courses outside the engineering college. Specifically, courses from natural resources, design, business, and arts and sciences comprise significant portions of the areas of emphasis coursework. The goal of the program is to provide flexibility to match individual student goals while providing industry with well-prepared and equipped graduates who can “hit the ground running” upon hiring. This paper presents the process and outcomes of research related to the creation of this new engineering technology program. It presents the programmatic and curricular structure, the reasoning behind the unique structure, and the challenges of implementation and their (to-date) resolutions. The goal of this work is to inform and encourage other engineering educational institutions to consider this path and to be prepared for the process.","Hensel, Robin A.M.;Spayde, Emily",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,West Virginia University,
Making Meaning through Mentorship: A Student-Led Layered Peer Mentorship Program,"This Complete Evidence-Based Paper presents research about a layered peer mentorship program for undergraduate engineering students at a public urban research university and ways that students have made meaning from their mentorship experiences. This mentorship program began in Fall 2019 and has grown to include the following layers: (a) first-year students who receive mentorship, (b) sophomore- and junior-level students who serve as mentors (all of whom received mentorship during their first year), (c) junior- and senior-level students who serve as lead mentors who design the program for that academic year (including content, group meetings, service projects, meeting schedules, etc.), (d) a graduate student who mentors and supervises the lead mentors, and (e) a faculty member who oversees the overall program, provides general guidance, and advises all the students. We will describe ways in which the participating students have made meaning of their experience in the program, highlighting three key areas: (1) the web of relationships formed, which cohere into a community; (2) students' transitions from receiving mentorship as first-year students to mentoring others in their sophomore and junior years; and (3) the feedback and iteration process by which the program has continuously developed, which forefronts student voice and agency. The paper will provide specific examples in each of the three key areas described, with a special focus on students' own descriptions of the meaning they have made through their participation in the mentorship program. Recommendations will also be shared for those interested in implementing similar programs on their campuses. The mentorship program forms a complex web of relationships between and among students, and these relationships cohere into a felt community for students. These relationships are forged by various means in various contexts. First, each student who receives mentorship is a first-year student in the Engineering Learning Community (ELC). In the ELC, first-year students take a bundle of courses together, with specific sections of English composition, math, and a first-year design innovations course. Second, the students who receive mentorship are assigned peer mentors who are sophomore- and junior-level students who were previously in the ELC. Mentees and mentors meet regularly in both individual and group meetings, which affords both individual and group relationships to form. All these interplaying individual and group relationships form a rich, complex web which coheres into a community for students. Additionally, students also find meaning through their transition from mentee in their first year to mentor in their sophomore and junior years. This meaning is forged through personal growth, as well as through a reification of engineering identity when they are viewed as legitimate members of the community of engineering majors. When students become mentors, they transition into a position where first-year students look to them for advice, support, and encouragement. Mentors enact their identity as someone with experience who has valuable perspective to share. Mentors can feel more confident in their classes knowing that their status as an engineering major is respected and has been legitimated. Lastly, serving as a mentor is something students look forward to listing on their resume as a demonstration of teamwork and people skills which engineering employers so highly value. A third way students make meaning from the mentorship program is through the feedback and iteration process by which the program is continuously formed. At the end of each semester, students submit formal, anonymous, formative feedback on the program. The suggestions students make are implemented almost immediately, making this mentorship program responsive and adaptable. Students in the program know that their feedback is taken seriously, and that they have the power to create the mentorship program they find most helpful. Additionally, the lead mentors have nearly complete autonomy to organize, schedule, and run the program as they see fit. The upper layers of the program - the graduate student and the faculty member - provide support, advice, and resources, but the undergraduate students are the ones iterating and forming the program. Through these means, the program has evolved in several ways, including the introduction of group meetings and a semesterly service project, which were the direct implementations of student ideas. This focus on student voice and agency enables students to build self-efficacy and make meaning from their experiences with the mentorship program.","Cummings, Miriam Howland;Schupbach, William Taylor;Altman, Tom;Jacobson, Michael S.;Goodman, Katherine;Darbeheshti, Maryam",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Colorado Denver,
Board 200: A New Mentoring and Undergraduate Research Experience Model between REUs and RETs at the Stevens REU/RET Site Program on Sustainable Energy and Bioengineering,"The Stevens REU/RET Site project funded by NSF DMR program (Award #2050921) has completed its first two years and provided research and educational opportunities to both undergraduates and high school teachers. The program achieved its overarching goals with noticed improved mentoring, research experiences, and communication during the second year attributed in part to the in-person programming. The REU program aimed to create an experience that took students beyond the development of technical competence in science and engineering and provided an expertise particularly on research and innovation in various areas of energy and bioengineering. External evaluation, interviews and surveys of the REU and RET participants examined if the program goals were achieved. All teachers found the experience to be valuable and listed the people and the research environment as the two most impactful areas of the program.

Work in Progress: Engineering together - Applying remote collaborative technology to an in-person undergraduate engineering course,"This evidence-based Work in Progress research paper will explore how collaborative technology impacts student engagement with teams and programming activities in an introductory first-year engineering course. Introduction to engineering has been a historically difficult course for undergraduates as they are introduced to algorithmic thinking, design processes, and problem-solving methodologies. To assist students, a variety of approaches can be employed in the classroom; team-based capstone projects with end of course demonstrations, synchronous collaborative technology that supports teamwork and communication in and out of class, pair-programming, and visual-based programming languages. Each of these provides benefits to the students individually, but with COVID-19 forcing a shift to remote learning, collaborative technologies experienced an unprecedented development of innovations and tools. A return to in-person classes may incline educators to drop collaborative technologies for teaching, but remote control, screen share, and collaborative tools are still beneficial if using teamwork in the class. This paper investigates the following research question: to what degree is student engagement impacted by the usage of synchronous collaborative tools in a team-based, in-person undergraduate introductory engineering course? An experimental setup was implemented in three different sections of an introductory engineering course at a large, midwestern, R1 institution. All three sections had different instructors and a class size of around 50 students. One of the three sections implemented a technology that allowed students to connect to a teammate's computer and share control of keyboard/mouse, enabling real-time collaborative programming in a normally individual programming environment. The other two sections were control sections with no specific implementation differences. A survey instrument grounded in Burch et al.'s conceptual framework was developed and distributed at strategic times to measure students' engagement with their team and in-class programming tasks. Results presented include a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) that supports the factor structure of the student engagement survey and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure to compare the three sections and investigate significant differences between them through student grades. The results of this research have potential to provide direction for usage of remote collaborative technology for in-person, academic settings. Future implications of research include investigating the impact of similar technologies on student engagement and learning outcomes; contributing a validated instrument to measure students' engagement with their programming tasks and teams; and provide educators with potential methodologies to improve student engagement in team-based coursework.","Lynch, John William;Agarwal, Jutshi;Imbrie, P.

Experiential Learning for Interdisciplinary Education on Vestibular System Models,"The vestibular system (VS) allows humans to have a sense of balance and orientation. Within the VS, fluid displacement occurs within the ear canal, triggering nerve signals to be translated by the nervous system, allowing for the interpretation of the head's orientation. When there is a disturbance to this system, vestibular dysfunction occurs potentially causing vertigo and a loss of balance. It is estimated that 35 percent of adults 40 years or older in the United States have experienced vestibular dysfunction. The vestibular balance system poses a robust, unique topic for developing interdisciplinary education curricula as its function encapsulates many fundamental mechanical, chemical, biological, and physical phenomena that can be studied with engineering concepts and principles. In this work, we present a survey of models of the vestibular sensory system. Following which, selected models are presented in an experiential learning format for students to better understand the relationship and sensitivity of model parameters and external stimuli to physiological system behavior. By conducting simulations of these models, students can visualize outcomes, pose questions, and potentially identify areas of research interest. This paper is the outcome of an Innovations in Graduate Education project supported by the National Science Foundation. The authors are graduate students from three engineering majors from the University of Massachusetts Lowell and the University of the District of Columbia co-creating an educational module with faculty and experts on human balance. The developed module related to analyzing the vestibular balance system mechanics will be integrated into undergraduate courses across engineering departments in partnering institutions.","Nia, Masoumeh Farhadi;Callen, Grace E.;Aroskar, Gayatri;An, Justin;Chandra, Kavitha;Thompson, Charles;Wolkowicz, Kelilah;Denis, Max",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Massachusetts System;University of the District of Columbia,Co-creation ;  Experiential Learning ;  Simulation ;  Vestibular System
Designing Innovations Research Stream - A Design Research Program for First-Year Students,"Understanding how teams solve design problems can influence students' perspectives on designing innovative products and systems. Furthermore, education needs to be tailored to engage first-year students in undergraduate research opportunities which increases student retention and graduation rate among STEM majors. A new initiative at the University of Maryland, the First-Year Innovation & Research Experience Program (FIRE), provides authentic research experience to first-year students. This paper introduces a new program, the Designing Innovations Research Stream, that engages first-year students in design research. The goal is that students will learn about design by investigating how teams solve complex design problems and then apply this knowledge to a real-world situation. The Designing Innovations Research Stream consisted of two semesters and a 10-week summer research fellowship. In the first semester of Designing Innovations, students learned about the design process and the standard design tools used to solve design problems. In the second semester, they designed an experiment to observe and analyze design team activities. The success of the program is evaluated by (i) surveying the students who completed the program, and (ii) the published papers from students who work in the program. The survey assesses students' understanding after completing the program via four major categories: design process, research, communication, as well as teamwork. The results of 51 students over three years show that 84% of responses either strongly agree or agree that their comprehension of the four categories has improved. The results also indicate that the most important subject learned, according to the students, was research methods, design research, teamwork, and communication. Finally, three peer-reviewed papers primarily written by students presented at international conferences demonstrate the program was successful in producing publishable results.","Fazelpour, Mohammad;Landon, Benjamin;Herrmann, Jeffrey W.;Killion, Patrick J.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,"A.

Cultivate the Problem Exploration Skills for Biomedical Innovation,"The majority of engineering students perceive themselves merely as problem solvers and are less concerned about finding a problem. However, the lack of ability to find a valuable problem from the real world is one of the major causes of invention failure. Problem finding is absent in most engineering curricula, even in design courses because most problems are still provided by a client or instructor. To address the need for training the next-generation of innovators, we developed an undergraduate elective, Biomedical Innovation, in which Industrial Engineering students teamed with medical students to identify authentic problems of clinical significance and propose engineering solutions. This course, which asks students to analyze the mechanism and scope of a problem-a skill highly desired for its potential in innovation and entrepreneurship-fills a unique curricular gap. The survey of learning experiences showed statistically significant differences between pre- and post-course scores in self-efficacies, which suggests that students saw improvement in the ratings of their learning in five target areas: (A) background research skills, (B) critical thinking and ideation, (C) project management and teamwork, (D) technical communication skills, and (E) interest in medical engineering.","Tan, George;Halder, Sampa;LeFebvre, Luke",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Edward E.

Influence of Interdisciplinary Teaching System on Interdisciplinary Competence of Engineering Graduate Students: Analysis of Mediating Effects of Interdisciplinary Identity,"Background Interdisciplinary graduate education is not only an urgent need for scientific and technological innovation toward socioeconomic development but also aligns with the law of the growth of high-level innovative talents. It has now become an important trend in the reform of global graduate education. The transformation has stimulated some forms of interdisciplinary experiences, including critical thinking awareness, interdisciplinary team teaching, etc. However, little is known about the core characteristics that shape interdisciplinary competence and internal effect mechanisms. Purpose/Hypothesis This study seeks to explore how the interdisciplinary teaching system relates to the interdisciplinary competence of engineering graduates. We specifically examine the connections within the interdisciplinary teaching system, including comprehensive curriculum emphasis, student-centered instructional practices, and interdisciplinary competence. Also, we explore the internal effect mechanisms by introducing the theory of identity to discuss the mediating effects of interdisciplinary identity and try to figure out how students describe themselves and are positioned by others in the role of being an interdisciplinary learner. And we further explore the mediating effects of the three dimensions of interdisciplinary identity: interest, recognition, and performance. Design/Method This study uses a survey sample of 310 engineering graduate students in 3 High-level Research Universities in China. Using linear modeling, we investigate the relationships among interdisciplinary teaching system on graduates' interdisciplinary competence and explore the mediating effects of interdisciplinary identity. Results This study finds that: (1) Student-centered instructional practices, as well as comprehensive curriculum emphasis, have a significant role in promoting the interdisciplinarity of engineering graduate students. And Student-centered teaching methods have a more significant effect on improving students' interdisciplinary ability than comprehensive curriculum emphasis. (2) The recognition of interdisciplinary identity plays a partially mediating role between the interdisciplinary teaching system and interdisciplinary competence, and the performance dimension has the strongest mediating effect. (3) Student-centered instructional practices have a stronger impact than comprehensive curriculum emphasis on engineering students' interdisciplinary identity, especially on the interest dimension. Conclusions This study emphasizes the crucial role of interdisciplinary identity in linking external teaching with internal competence and seeks to identify effective and practical approaches for cultivating interdisciplinary identity. Based on the above, this paper suggests that, in the practice of interdisciplinary education reform, the design of student-centered teaching methods should be strengthened, and the construction of interdisciplinary identity of engineering graduate students should be continuously stimulated through interest stimulation, recognition support, and performance feedback. It is hoped that future studies can continue to explore how to develop domain-specific identity-based motivation measures for students.","Xu, Peiyun;Zhang, Wei;Zhang, Weijia",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Zhejiang University,
Measuring Team Effectiveness in Construction Projects: Team Members' Perceptions,"Team effectiveness is the ability of a team of people to work together efficiently to achieve a desired goal. An effective team works together to undertake responsibilities, maintain good social relations while promoting personal and professional development. Effective teams are able to enrich the strengths of each team member. Although there are different ways to measure team effectiveness, individual team members' perceptions can portray their direct experiences. Higher team effectiveness ratings from team members indicate enhanced team collaboration, stronger resilience when facing setbacks, and high levels of team performance. After reviewing and assessing team effectiveness literature from different industries, this study identified factors vital to measure construction teams' perceptions. A pilot team effectiveness survey was developed, and a pilot analysis was conducted to understand the overlaps between these factors. Professionals from 36 construction projects participated in the pilot study. The team effectiveness survey was refined using reliability analysis on the collected data, correlations among the specific factors, and the participants' feedback. The final survey is composed of 12 factors that measure team effectiveness as well as control questions that capture team members' general views of their team. These factors include Goal Alignment, Decision Making, Team Communication, Conflict Management, Professional Relationships, Humor, GRIT, Risk Management, Innovation, Trust, Collaboration and Diversity-Equity-Inclusion (DEI). Measuring team effectiveness and its outcomes in construction projects can substantially benefit designing effective professional team development training programs. In addition, the efficiency of design and construction project teams may also be strengthened throughout this process.","Kassa, Rebecca;Perrin, Monica;Ogundare, Tolulope Ibilola;Lines, Brian;Smithwick, Jake;Sullivan, Kenneth Timothy",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Kansas;The University of North Carolina at Charlotte;Arizona State University,
Creating a Nature-Inspired Entrepreneurially Minded Manufacturing Podcast to Bolster Technical Communication Skills,"Manufacturing-oriented engineering degree programs have traditionally emphasized strong scientific content but without a robust curriculum dedicated to communication across national, cultural, contextual and disciplinary boundaries. The interconnected economic environment of modern manufacturing requires graduates with the communication skills to thrive in an environment of entrepreneurially driven innovation and collaboration. The emphasis on socio-technical communication within the manufacturing-oriented engineering curriculum remains sparse. This calls for the need to develop innovative pedagogies that can help enhance the employability of students. In response to this need, an exploratory study was conducted at a satellite campus of a large, Midwestern research-focused university. The intervention included the implementation of an entrepreneurially minded and communication-focused project, developed by the instructor of an upper-level undergraduate manufacturing course. Post-completion of the project, a metacognitive reflection assignment was administered to the participants and subsequently, data was collected. Participant responses were qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis which led to the discovery of three themes: (1) identifying value in nature-inspired design, (2) confidence in communication and self-expression, and (3) benefitting from peer feedback. The study aims to supplement traditional teaching techniques with an entrepreneurial and multidisciplinary-minded project that helps students reinforce skills that are relevant for the globally connected world. The results indicate that the intervention successfully motivated students to develop their communication and collaboration skills. The findings of this study showcase the effectiveness of entrepreneurially minded and communication-focused projects that engineering instructors should consider integrating into mid-level discipline specific engineering coursework.","Lucas, Thomas;Kotla, Bhavana;Bosman, Lisa",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Purdue Polytechnic Institute;Purdue University,
Developing Habits of Mind through Family Engineering at Home,"Engineering in early education provides the foundation for the future of innovation. Reinforcing learning and engineering habits of mind (HoM) at an early age is crucial for expanding students' higher order thinking, potential for lifelong learning, and sense of agency in their learning experiences. HoM is defined as a set of learned or internalized dispositions that inform an individual's behaviors when confronted with challenges. This study addressed two research questions: (1) Which HoM were articulated by children as they reflected upon their participation in a home-based engineering program? (2) What patterns of the children's vocabulary align with the HoM framework? Observational methods were used to examine young children's reflections upon the process of completing low-stakes engineering projects in their home. The participants were 23 children ranging from kindergarten to eighth grade. After they engaged in the ill-structured engineering tasks with family members at home, children joined an online show-and-tell meeting to show their prototype to others while answering various questions about their processes, frustrations, and successes. Findings revealed “Resourcefulness,” “Adapting/Improving,” and “Systems Thinking” as the most common HoM expressed by children through the show-and-tell meetings. Additional analysis also highlighted how children's articulation of learning and engineering habits of mind were logical (i.e., analytical), confident (i.e., clout), and impersonal. Moreover, children's words were product-oriented, predominantly focusing on the materials and tools utilized to create their prototype. The significance of this study highlights how engaging in hands-on engineering projects in the home has the potential to develop children's dispositions and ways of thinking common to engineers.","Tan, Jubie;Simpson, Amber;Knox, Peter N.;Werfelli, Sawsan;Maltese, Adam",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Indiana University Bloomington;Binghamton University State University of New York;The University of Vermont,
Integrating Participatory Methods in the Study of Equity and Inclusion,"Researchers and practitioners across engineering programs have committed many resources (time, money, etc.) to understand the experiences of multiply marginalized and underrepresented (MMU) students in engineering. The methods used to capture these experiences vary: from deep, qualitative research with low numbers of participants to large-scale quantitative methods like sense-of-belonging or campus climate surveys. Critical and Black Feminist methodologies suggest that research in equity and inclusion that involve MMU students must carefully consider the impact of the research on the participant, taking care not to re-traumatize students through the experience of participation and honoring student experiences through ongoing participation and feedback loops. Equitable practices in the execution of engineering education research projects are essential to drive the positive change we envision making in the engineering culture. This paper presents a methodological innovation our research team used to study equity and inclusion in a way that was both generative for our research purposes and also responsive to the need to prevent harm. Drawing on Starr and Greisemer's theory of “boundary objects,” our semi-structured interviews and focus groups were anchored in iconographic depictions of the university, asking students to interact with the graphic through a traditional participatory urban planning method. These approaches shift the power relationships traditionally established in interview settings and allowed student participants to shape the direction of their interviews and storytelling. In this paper, we first describe the central ethical and justice challenges to soliciting and engaging BIPOC students in research about their experiences. After describing the goals of the study, we explain two key strategies that allowed us to address these challenges in our data collection: 1) Use of boundary objects to elicit participants narratives, and 2) the integration of participatory urban planning methods. We show sample data sets to explain the ways our methods provided opportunities to learn more from students, to gain a comprehensive understanding of student experiences across sites of work, and to protect students in meaningful ways.","Moore, Kristen;Sanchez-Pena, Matilde Luz;Chen, Qiuxing;McAlister, Anne M.;Burris, Courtney;Mowatt, Jada Vanessa",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences;University at Buffalo, The State University of New York;University of Virginia",
"Collaborations Beyond the Library: Bibliometric Analyses to Support Engineering Research, Innovation, and Diversity","A new library department was formed to focus on growing university research impact and delivering data-driven research intelligence. The department collaborates with multiple units across campus, including with the College of Engineering via the department's Engineering Collections and Research Analyst. All collaborations stem from the need for data-driven decisions for determining inter- and intra-institutional strengths and for discovering potential and existing research partnerships. This paper focuses on key collaborations with campus partners relevant to engineering research, innovation, and diversity efforts at Virginia Tech, providing processes and examples in each area. Examples include: an analysis of institutional degree data to determine competency related to the CHIPS and Science Act; prospective aerospace company collaborations; and research alignment analysis with HBCUs and other minority serving institutions. Each example covers tools, alternatives, and processes used to generate these analyses with end products presented to collaborators. Overall, the collaborations have been successful and are growing, which prompted the need for a new department, with wide support within the library and across campus.","Over, Sarah;Stovall, Connie",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,Academia-Industry Partnerships ;  Bibliometrics ;  Cross-Campus Collaborations ;  Innovation ;  Minority Serving Institutions
Innovation for Remote Teaching of Digital Logic Laboratory Courses,"This paper presents how the serious challenges in teaching laboratory courses during the COVID-19 pandemic and transition to an online mode of instruction were overcome by design of an innovative test-board that served as the needed infrastructure for teaching a “remote” or “personal” [1] laboratory course. This solution not only provided the students with equitable infrastructure for doing all the required projects and hands-on experiments remotely but also could be used as a learning opportunity to provide students with more insight into the setup, design, functionality, and purpose of lab equipment. While in typical academic years and in the normal (in-person) mode of operation, the sophomore students in this course learned to use the laboratory equipment for doing projects and lab experiments, in this remote course students additionally learned how these equipment are designed and built through building one - the test-board - as one of their first projects. This test board served as key component in making hands-on experiments of the course in a remote setting possible. The remote experiments, testing, and evaluations were done following a formal and methodic approach, instead of ad hoc practices. In general, this approach led to effective and efficient experiments, and also served as a model to think creatively and methodically for solving engineering problems and planning prototype development. Overall, the design and use of the test board proved instrumental in the successful remote delivery of our digital laboratory course such that all the previous in person course experiments were completed in the online course without any limitations and the course's educational outcomes were met. The assessment of the identified ABET performance indicators at the end of the semester were above the acceptable threshold and comparable with the in-person course. This experience demonstrates that through innovation, some of the engineering laboratory courses can be taught remotely without sacrificing any experiments.","Mansouri, Nazanin",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Portland,
Board 140: Work in Progress: Exploring Innovation Self-Efficacy in Neurodiverse Engineering Students,"It is critical to incorporate inclusive practices in the engineering curriculum which prepares neurodiverse students to achieve their full potential in the workforce. This work-in-progress paper seeks to capitalize on the unique strengths of marginalized neurodiverse engineering students. In this study, the innovation self-efficacy of engineering students who self-identify as neurodiverse is explored before and after a curricular intervention, which has been shown to have the potential to enhance innovation self-efficacy, in an environmental engineering target course. A previously validated Likert-type survey was used, which included the Very Brief Innovation Self-Efficacy scale, the Innovation Interests scale, and the Career Goals: Innovative Work scale. Among the 47 responses on the pre-survey, 13% of the students self-identified as neurodiverse and an additional 19% indicated that they were maybe neurodiverse. This included a much higher percentage of female than male students in the course (23% vs. 5% neurodiverse). There were no significant differences in the pre-survey or post-survey in the innovation self-efficacy and innovation interest among students who self-identified as neurodiverse, maybe neurodiverse, and not neurodiverse. Career goals based on the innovative work scale differed in the pre-survey among the three groups, being lowest among students who self-identified as maybe neurodiverse; there were no differences among the groups in the post-survey. It appeared that there were gains in the innovation self-efficacy between the pre and post-survey among the students who self-identified as neurodiverse and maybe neurodiverse but these differences were not statistically significant. A limitation of the study was the lack of ability to pair the data for individual students and a low number of neurodiverse students in the dataset. This preliminary work calls attention to the need to consider neurodiverse students in our instructional practices. In the future, we hope the research will expand our understanding of a neurodiverse-friendly curricular design in preparation for engineering students with autism spectrum disorder and other types of neurodiversity for the workforce, as well as assisting engineering educators in the adoption of practices that have the tendency to enhance innovation self-efficacy in neurodiverse students.","Bolhari, Azadeh;Bielefeldt, Angela R.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Colorado Boulder,
"A Measure of Engineering Instructors' Adaptability Based on Cognitive, Behavioral, and Emotional Dimensions","This Research paper considers an adaptability framework for providing insight into faculty development in the face of engineering being slow to adopt best practices in teaching. As traditional change models (e.g., Diffusion of Innovations) have not produced the results that are hoped for, a look through a lens of adaptability has the potential to help identify how to assist instructors implement and sustain a wide array of teaching practices and strategies (WATPS) during and after times of change. The purpose of this study was to quantify the variability of adaptability of engineering instructors at a United States R1 Midwest university using the Cognitive-Behavioral-Emotional adaptability model instrument. Females' Cognitive/Behavioral and Total Adaptability scores were found to be statistically higher than males. These differences had a medium or large effect size as indicated by Cohen's d. No statistically significant differences were found for academic position or rank. Differences found may be attributed to work culture; lack of differences may be attributed to individuals with a certain adaptability profile being drawn to a career in academia. Accounting for adaptability when considering the extent to which WATPS are used can enable more individualized support for instructors during periods of change.","Diefes-Dux, Heidi A.;Panther, Grace;Osen, Kayla",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Nebraska–Lincoln,
Diversity Index: A New Perspective on Engineering Capstone Projects,"Capstone courses in engineering usually lead to projects where student teams show their skills at providing engineering solutions for realistic problems, making use of the knowledge and training acquired through the entire college curriculum, and demonstrating student readiness to enter the job market or moving into research. These projects are often displayed at venues where judges from academia and industry conduct evaluations to assess those achievements. Grading rubrics are generally based on the engineering approach, ability to reach a solution, specific design content, innovation, team performance, and presentation and communication skills. It has become popular that these showcases turn into competitions, with prizes and recognitions awarded to selected projects. In this study, we took an additional perspective on these capstone courses and events by analyzing the composition of these teams in terms of diversity and the potential impact of this factor in the performance and results. We took the occasion of a large presentation of over 100 capstones projects by the Class of 2022 at the University of Pittsburgh, with the participation of more than 500 senior students, to assess the diversity of teams across the various departments of the School of Engineering. An additional population of almost 100 senior students from a department that does not participate in the event but offers a comparable capstone project was also included in the study. The evaluation of the projects was conducted by instructors and expert judges from industry and academia. Trends were examined between performance grades versus a diversity index, using metrics and characteristics previously reported. The diversity of the self-selected team members (most commonly 4-6), as measured by this diversity index, reveals a marked trend for teams to have a lower diversity index compared to their departmental, class, or course makeup, exposing some probable implicit biases on identity. Some other results show how diversity impacts team performance differently depending on the prevalent characteristic of the group. The analysis provided in this paper offers criteria and methodology applicable to institutions and situations to quantitatively assess diversity that can lead to practical guidelines and even policies.","Rodriguez, Joaquin;Dukes, April;Keith, John Andrew;Sanchez, David V.P.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Pittsburgh,
Why Research Involvement Makes an Engaging Learning Experience for Neurodiverse Students,"This presentation combines the findings of two closely-related Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs, one which ran from 2015-2019 and was specifically for engineering students with ADHD, and a second program, running from 2022-present, open to neurodiverse engineering students (specifically targeting ADHD, dyslexia and/or anxiety). These programs are inspired by research which links the above neurodiversities to increased creativity and innovation, as well as the ability to visualize complex systems. Both REU programs are inspired by the strengths-based approach to neurodiversity. This model builds an environment which plays to a neurodiverse student's strengths, rather than mitigating their challenges. This presentation will provide an overview of the sites and present three datasets: 1) the impact of the programs on the participants' confidence as engineering students, 2) how the programs impacted the participants' views of their neurodiversity, and 3) the profound effect exposure to academic research has on these non-traditional learners to understand engineering topics and expand their knowledge base. Consistently, these neurodiverse students reported gaining a deeper understanding of their subject matters after research, and at a significantly faster rate, than they could attain in the classroom. Our findings provide evidence of a pressing need for a paradigm shift within engineering education to not only accommodate neurodiverse students, but to help them realize their full potential. Doing so not only benefits the student, but allows society to benefit from their unique, non-conventional thinking and innovative ideas, which can push research forward at a faster pace. It is anticipated that sharing this data may lead to a shift within engineering education from a deficit- to strength-based view of neurodiversity. We hope to inspire others to develop similar programs that highlight the mutually-beneficial nature of the ecosystem we have developed through 10 weeks of summer research.","Hain, Alexandra;Zaghi, Arash Esmaili;Grey, Alexander T.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Connecticut;National Science Foundation,
Working Adult Students' Perceptions of Flipped Classroom Videos in an Undergraduate Physics Course,"The School of Engineering offers several degree programs across several formats, including one conducted online for working students. It is particularly important to these students to find a productive and efficient way to incorporate the theoretical content of their courses weekly. In turn, it is necessary for educational strategies to enable students to take advantage of such content in line with their capabilities and realities and, thus, help them to arrive fully prepared for hands-on learning activities in the digital classroom. The present study measures the perceptions of a group of such students on the effectiveness of flipped classroom videos designed to introduce theoretical content related to electricity and magnetism. It involves flipped classroom videos being made available, with restricted access, as part of an electricity and magnetism course in an evening undergraduate program for adult learners at a private Chilean university. The number of videos and the time students took to watch them were individually tracked through a learning management system. Subsequently, students completed a perception survey on this flipped classroom strategy and where they were asked to compare the approach to the traditional model of receiving face-to-face lectures before each class. A cross-variable analysis was then conducted to establish student perceptions precisely and accurately. This analysis yielded results on the suitability of the material generated and the applicability of flipped classroom videos in this context. Results show that using flipped classroom videos is a viable alternative for teaching physics content in an e-learning context with adult learners. The study concludes with several recommendations regarding possible improvements for future research.","Vergara, Rodrigo Alonso;Zavala, Genaro",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,Adult education ;  e-learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Flipped-classroom ;  Higher education ;  STEM education
Portable Laboratory for Electrical Engineering Education: The LAB-VEE Ecosystem Developed in Latin America and the Caribbean,"The need for options that allow the quality of education to be guaranteed even outside educational institutions has intensified in the last 3 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of engineering, several universities have initiated or increased efforts to mitigate the effects resulting from students taking electrical engineering classes from their homes without access to laboratories. Thanks to this, remote laboratories have been created that allow students to conduct experiments from their homes. Other universities have been working on the creation of portable laboratories that students can take home and conduct experiments as if they were in a traditional laboratory. In this article, we present in detail the process carried out by a group of researchers from a university in the Dominican Republic for the creation of a portable electrical engineering laboratory that incorporates many the necessary equipment for a laboratory of this type. The creation of this laboratory emerged as a Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) project that was financed in the period 2018-2021 by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology (MESCyT) in collaboration with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) with an approximate budget of US$103,000. The interest of the research team was to create equipment that would complement or replace most of the equipment used in an electricity laboratory and that would be low-cost. With the arrival of the pandemic, a redesign was carried out, becoming a portable laboratory that students can transport in their backpacks and at a lower cost than the existing options on the market. To date, it has received 2 injections of capital totaling more than US$28,000 from banking and governmental institutions, and recently the research team has been approved for more than US$200,000 to continue research and development in the field. The production cost is around US$250 and is expected to decrease further. To date, 3 professors, 10 students, and a company have participated in this project. A company called LAB-VEE Educational TechMaker has been created for commercialization and an LMS with didactic content. The LMS was implemented in 2021 by a school in the country, with more than 60 students taking classes, having access to only theoretical content. A study was conducted on this implementation to measure the level of learning of these students compared to others who studied in a traditional way, and recently a university in the country has implemented LAB-VEE to conduct a study that will allow them to know its impact on the academic performance of university students.","Then, Reymi;Larrondo-Petrie, Maria M.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Universidad Tecnológica de Santiago;Florida Atlantic University,
Human Balance Models for Engineering Education: An Innovative Graduate Co-Creation Project,"Balance problems affect more than eight million adults, and the percentage of balance problems increases with age. Globally, the population is aging, making balance problems a relevant topic of investigation. Balance impairments are the primary cause of falls, which result in debilitating injuries, especially for the elderly population. There is a significant opportunity for students in engineering and other disciplines to explore and contribute to research and education in this area. In this work, a group of graduate students from electrical, industrial, and mechanical engineering present research that will be mapped into an educational module on this topic. This module is co-created with faculty and domain experts. Sensors of various types are being investigated for monitoring gait and identifying the propensity for losing balance. A survey of the state of the art of sensor technology pertaining to balance is conducted. Models of human balance during quiet standing are investigated. An interactive simulation tool is developed to allow students to vary the model parameters and gain an intuitive understanding of the engineering principles involved. For engineering students, this offers many opportunities to better understand how topics they study in engineering courses relate to a significant societal problem. For students in courses such as statics, dynamics, and control systems, the concepts of change in the center of mass, the center of pressure, the inverted pendulum, and stability can be reinforced in relation to the balance dynamics problem. This paper describes the framework that will be used in an educational module that will improve undergraduate engineering concepts through balance dynamics experiments and simulations, and present interdisciplinary research problems to graduate students. This study contributes to an Innovations in Graduate Education National Science Foundation research project.","Smith, Alana;Aoki, Emi;Ghandi, Mahsa;Burek, Jasmina;Thompson, Charles;Chandra, Kavitha",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Francis College of Engineering,Co-creation ;  Graduate Education ;  Human Balance System ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Sensor ;  Simulation
"Divergence and Convergence in Engineering Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Management, and Policy","A little over half (28 of 54) of the divisions of ASEE focus on the intersections between STEM disciplines and different contexts of engineering education and practice. These 28 divisions emphasize three broad areas: (1) humanistic content and goals; (2) particular groups of students, faculty, practitioners, or other stakeholders; and (3) specific arenas of activity and organizational contexts. Four of these “Engineering and...” divisions include engineering leadership, entrepreneurship, management, and policy. The divisions share goals such as connecting the technical and non-technical dimensions of engineering and transforming engineering education so that it more effectively prepares graduates for workplace success. Previous research suggested that interest in “Engineering and …” permeates ASEE and is concentrated in but not limited to the division most closely associated with the topic. This paper describes a transferable method that combines quantitative and qualitative methods to identify areas of convergence using papers published in the Leadership Development (LEAD) and the Engineering Entrepreneurship and Innovation (ENT) as evidence. These areas of convergence are: (1) program design and effectiveness, (2) individual capabilities (including traits and thinking tools), (3) teams and groups, and (4) identity and culture. Program design and effectiveness dominate the discourse of both divisions, suggesting that the two groups face similar challenges. Areas of apparent divergence include more concern with mindsets and innovativeness in ENT and more emphasis on team skills and mentorship in LEAD. These findings present opportunities for collaboration that could benefit all “Engineering and …” divisions and help overcome the inertia that characterizes engineering education. The permeation of topics across ASEE and the convergence of themes across divisions also suggest that forming a new division might perpetuate disciplinary siloes, rather than support knowledge integration across the “Engineering and...” divisions.","Neeley, Kathryn A.;Foley, Rider W.;Li, Andrew;Jun, Rebecca",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of Virginia;California State University Channel Islands,
"Board 319: Inclusive, Asset-Based Instructional Strategies in Engineering Design: Empowering Faculty with Professional Development","To better support engineering students and to create an inclusive and welcoming educational context, it is necessary to reimagine instructional methods and approaches. In contrast to deficit educational models that focus on perceptions of what students lack, asset-based practices focus on how students' lived experiences can be used to enrich and strengthen their educational experiences. There is a need to support faculty in adopting existing techniques or developing new techniques in undergraduate courses, as most existing literature related to asset-based practices is focused on K-12 settings. Engineering design courses provide an ideal context for asset-based practices because the design process requires a diverse set of knowledge, experiences, and skills. Guided by self-determination theory, an understanding of implicit bias and stereotype threat, and the large existing body of research on asset-based pedagogy, we seek to support engineering student outcomes by empowering faculty with tools and strategies to incorporate asset-based practices in their courses. We are engaged in a three-year project focused on assessing the impact of asset-based practices in engineering design courses a large, public, land-grant, Hispanic-serving institution in the southwestern United States, funded by the NSF IUSE:EDU program. Here, we will summarize the design and results from our professional development for faculty, including theoretical frameworks and evidence guiding our work. We share content from our professional development, summarizing learning objectives, presentation content, and activities. Additionally, we present comments shared by instructors related to our professional development, including common barriers to implementing educational innovations in their courses. Our work will provide insights to practitioners interested in promoting inclusive classroom practices in engineering education and researchers who are translating research to practice, especially through professional development.","Budinoff, Hannah D.;Subbian, Vignesh;Shivers-McNair, Ann",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,The University of Arizona,asset based practices ;  Faculty professional development ;  inclusive pedagogy
Advances in Graduate Training in Integrative Bioinformatics for Investigating and Engineering Microbiomes (IBIEM),"Innovations by engineers and physical scientists working at the frontiers of microbiome engineering and discovery requires in-depth understanding of microbiome systems with parallel skills in bioinformatics and biostatistics. Despite the importance of integrating bioinformatics and biology into graduate student training in fields outside traditional biological sciences, academic institutions remain challenged with including these disciplines across departmental boundaries. Furthermore, it is critical for students in engineering, bioinformatics, and biostatistics to understand fundamentals behind the biological systems they model, and for biology students to gain competencies in applying bioinformatics and biostatistics to biological questions. To address these needs, we developed the Integrative Bioinformatics for Investigating and Engineering Microbiomes (IBIEM) graduate training partnership between Duke University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, which was funded by the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) program. IBIEM's goals include training interdisciplinary groups of students to: (a) transform conceptualization and develop skills for application of quantitative biology in microbiome areas; (b) perform cutting edge research requiring interdisciplinary team skills; and to (c) communicate their research across disciplinary barriers and to diverse audiences. The pedagogical framework adapted to foster trainee engagement is learner-centered teaching which emphasizes the importance of self-directed learning with parallel ongoing assessment to optimize student outcomes. Since IBIEM trainees' goals as well as entry-level knowledge and skills across disciplines varied greatly, program implementation was found to be challenging and required rigorous evaluation and refinements for effective training across disciplines and skill levels. A comprehensive program evaluation over five years found that the strongest learning and skills outcomes were linked to several “best practices”. Early provision of depth in fundamentals in R programming and reproducible research was found to be critical to “jump start” students without programming backgrounds. Addition of an overview of microbiome experimental design and analysis added important context as to how and where in the research process informatics fits into design progression and was highly motivating to students. Course modality was found to impact trainee outcomes with in-person classes that included hands-on practice and feedback showing greater improvements in training outcomes over hybrid, flipped and virtual course modalities. Furthermore, introduction of low, medium, and high level “challenges” along with in-person tutoring was found to be impactful in building a common foundation to span expertise levels and for engaging students across entry and advanced levels. Training impacts peaked during year four with cumulative implementation of revised strategies. Innovative training revisions and inclusion of critical elements was strongly linked to program satisfaction and ratings of advances in technical, professional and career skills as well as post-training carry over into trainees' own research and leadership in their labs and careers. Furthermore, this training collaboration and partnership provided the foundation and training model for the newly funded NSF Engineering Research Center for Precision Microbiome Engineering (PreMiEr) for work in the critical area of engineering the microbiome in built environments.","Kelly, Glenda T.;Granek, Joshua A.;Gunsch, Claudia K.;Graves, Joseph L.;Singleton, David",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University;Duke University,
Motivations and Barriers to Participation in Community Outreach and Engagement among Environmental and Water Resources Engineering Students,"Universities serve as a hub for the advancement of water science and engineering knowledge and innovations. Communities outside of academia hold equally valid expertise on water and environmental topics. However, there is a lack of avenues for knowledge exchange between academia and non-academic communities including homeowners, industry professionals, policy makers, and K-12 students and teachers. Many universities and research centers attempt to enhance knowledge sharing by organizing broader impact outreach events such as lab tours, demonstrations, hands-on activities, and public presentations. This work studies water-focused students who we define to be students from all disciplines (engineering, biology, sociology, geography, planning, etc.) that study water resources, quality, treatment, and management. Anecdotally, we have seen that of a pool of approximately 100 water-focused students, only the same small subset participates in every event while over 70% of those invited never volunteer. Therefore, there is a need to assess why we see this occurrence. This study aims to survey undergraduate and graduate student water scholars' motivations and barriers for participating in volunteer broader impact outreach events outside of their degree requirements. This study collected quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data were collected through Likert-scale type responses to motivating and hindering factors. Qualitative data were collected through written responses to questions on specific positive or negative student experiences and attitudes. Four main outreach trends emerged: 1) Students enjoy attending outreach events and find it helpful to themselves and to society; 2) Attending events leads students to want to participate in more; 3) Lack of time is by far the top hinderance; 4) Students are motivated by mentor support. Study findings suggest three possible steps to implementing a targeted strategy for broader impact student outreach that aligns with student desires at university research centers: 1) Choice of outreach events should emphasize the contribution to society; 2) Outreach recruitment should emphasize skills students will gain; 3) Faculty mentors should genuinely support their students' outreach endeavors including finding relevant outreach opportunities.","Donohue, Sydney;Mulchandani, Anjali",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,The University of New Mexico,
Work in Progress: Engineering Health Equity: Perspective and Pedagogy of Interdisciplinary Teaching and Learning and Impact on Learners' Social Identity,"This research explored the beliefs related to the health disparities, systems, and innovation of honors/engineering students enrolled in a course on Health Equity. This course aims to bring together undergraduate students across disciplines from engineering, public health, pharmacy, anthropology, sociology, and other social and basic sciences to learn from each other through co-designing solutions to address health disparities. The Global Learning Short Scale Plus (G.L.S2+) was used to assess students' beliefs related to global self awareness, cultural diversity, personal and social responsibility, understanding global systems, and applying knowledge to the contemporary global context. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed Personal and Social Responsibility was a predominant factor influencing students' beliefs. Numerous experiences were identified as drivers of involvement or action with an interest in the global systems' factors.","Serrano, Mayari I.;Rodriguez, Natalia M.;Guberman, Daniel;Linnes, Jacqueline Callihan",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Purdue University,
Classroom Climate Analysis of Flipped Structural Classrooms with Active Learning: A Case Study,"From passive instruction to highly collaborative active learning, students' success in the classroom varies based on a variety of factors. With different possible learning constructs, how the classroom environment, or climate, is structured can make a significant impact on student success. When developing or adopting new pedagogical approaches, both faculty and student perspectives need to be better understood. To help fill the gaps in active learning knowledge from a student perspective, this research looked at different active learning classroom environments by assessing them with the established College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI). The focus of this paper centers on a single instructor that has flipped then added active learning techniques across a steel design class and a computer modeling class. To see if, and to what extent, active learning impacts the classroom climate, data from before and after active learning were compared. As part of this, CUCEI compares climates based on seven psychosocial dimensions: personalization, involvement, student cohesiveness, satisfaction, task orientation, innovation, and individualization. This paper examines: 1) how climates change between traditional and active delivery, 2) does the quantity of active learning change the climate, and lastly, 3) is there a relationship between climate and student achievement. Results show that climate perspectives do not necessarily increase or could possibly decrease when active learning is deployed. While much of the data was inconclusive, due to small sample sizes and a lack of statistical evidence, there were several observed trends that provide rich insights for educators. First, the steel course had several unique instances compared to the modeling class. In steel design, four psychosocial dimensions can best predict grades while for computer modeling only two psychosocial dimensions predict grades. Additionally for steel design, the most important climate characteristics for success are: students enjoy going class; students know exactly what has to be done; and faculty letting students decide some of the success metrics. As for computer modeling, key climate factors include: the level of in class instructor real-time support and instructors giving ample opportunity for students to pursue their class interests.","Solnosky, Ryan L.;O'Halloran, Thomas Gonzalez",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Pennsylvania State University,Active Learning ;  Classroom Climate ;  Design ;  Modeling ;  Psychosocial ;  Student Achievement

Collaborative Research-Engineering Empathetic Engineers (E^3): Effects of the Humanities on Engineers' Critical Thinking and Empathy Skills,"Traditional disciplinary silos have separated engineering and the humanities, creating gaps in engineering students' skills. Technical knowledge and aptitude have long been a mainstay in engineering education, whereas critical thinking, empathy, and ethical reasoning have been key in the humanities. In an ever complex and interrelated world, society's grand challenges call for problem-solving that provides technical innovations while considering and understanding the people involved and affected by that innovation. A holistic outlook, combining engineering with the humanities may be an avenue to enrich the technical skills of engineering students while developing their empathetic skills. Based on this idea, a collaboration between Texas Tech University (TTU) and the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) has been made to analyze problem-solving assignments in interdisciplinary team-taught (ITT) courses and regular engineering courses. The ITT courses are called humanities-driven science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (HDSTEM) because they take the structure and form of a humanities course while introducing and discussing STEM problem-solving. Early-in- and late-in-semester surveys for empathy and critical thinking were given for all courses in this study. Further, discourse analysis of problem-solving assignments from HDSTEM and engineering courses was performed. A commonly used rubric for empathy was used in conjunction with this analysis to gauge and baseline students' empathetic dispositions. Results from surveys show no statistically significant difference in empathy or critical thinking levels among students in all treatments, which is understandable based on the limited number of surveys collected. Preliminary results from discourse analysis indicate improved empathetic dispositions are greater in problem-solving assignments in HDSTEM courses regardless of group (i.e., institution). Further, with the curricular treatment of HDSTEM, specifically asking students to empathize before their problem-solving assignment can improve the empathetic dispositions of students. This work is based on work from an NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) grant.","Carrell, John;Cruz, Joshua M.;Herbert, Andrew Mark;Laver, Michael Scott;Lazarus, Emily;Rivero, Iris V.;Nuñez, Erika;Tabassum, Nafisha",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Texas Tech University;Rochester Institute of Technology,Discourse Analysis ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Post-secondary Education ;  Team Teaching
Enhancing Student Engagement and Skillsets towards Transportation Careers Using Digital Badge Program: A Case Study,"Changing technologies and job market dynamics have led many jobs in the transportation industry to require a higher degree of technical skills, a more diverse base of disciplinary perspectives, and adaptability. Targeted training of students in these skills and support networks for student success have been found to be critical for students, particularly those from underrepresented minority (URM) groups, who face additional constraints due to various competing goals vying for their energy, time, and attention. The ASETTS (Advancing STEM Education Through Transportation Studies) program is a digital badge program created to prepare undergraduate students with a variety of skills needed to be successful in the transportation workforce. The program uses a stackable-units framework through which students can earn digital badges (i.e., micro-credentials) that are awarded in the form of certificates and is designed to incentivize student participation in transportation career development activities. This case study addresses the question whether digital badge programs are effective in addressing the stated needs of preparing undergraduate students for a highly versatile and multi-dimensional transportation workforce within the constraints of limited time and motivation for the involved students. Over the course of last year, the program has recruited 100+ students across an array of disciplines who have demonstrated engagement in activities for primarily three badges: Transportation Awareness and Engagement, Transportation Research, and Transportation Core Skills. The program has resulted in an increase in participation in various engagement, research, and experiential learning activities. Through qualitative and quantitative feedback, we observe that digital badges facilitate the engagement of students and help prepare them for relevant skills pertaining to life/career, innovation, technology, research, and core subject matter.","Pandey, Venktesh;McBride, Maranda;Park, Hyoshin",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University;University of North Carolina A&T,
Board 186: Work in- Progress: Scaling STEM-ID-Research Strategies to Inform Initial Scaling of Middle School Engineering Curricula,"This work-in-progress paper discusses STEM-ID (STEM-Innovation and Design), a three-year middle school Engineering and Technology course sequence. STEM-ID courses integrate foundational mathematics and science in an engineering context through challenges that introduce students to advanced manufacturing tools such as computer aided design (CAD) and 3D printing and incorporate engineering concepts such as pneumatics, aeronautics, and robotics. This paper will describe research strategies informing the initial scaling of the STEM-ID curricula following its iterative development over several years during a previous grant. Specifically, we will describe the data sources being utilized to inform refinement of curriculum materials and the project's professional development (PD) model. Funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Discovery Research K-12 (DRK-12) grant, the project seeks to scale the STEM-ID curricula in a large urban school district. Utilizing Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) as a guiding framework, the project strives for an iterative, collaborative design process that prioritizes practitioner involvement and the consideration of multiple stakeholders' perspectives. In the first year of the project, data collected from six teachers at five schools include surveys, observations, interviews, and focus groups. Drawing on this data, we will present illustrative examples and strategies the project has developed for collecting and synthesizing implementation data and teacher feedback to inform scaling efforts. The findings have practical implications that will help teachers and researchers in the engineering education community scale engineering curricula and teacher professional development models.","Porter, Dyanne Baptiste;Gale, Jessica D.;Alemdar, Meltem;Newton, Sunni Haag;Rehmat, Abeera P.;Capozzoli, Talia;Rosen, Jeffrey H.;Choi, Jasmine;Moore, Roxanne",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Georgia Institute of Technology;Georgia Tech Center for Education,
"Hybrid engineering: An auto-ethnographic story of hybrid curriculum development, learning, and teaching","This is an auto-ethnographic account of encounters with engineering students and engineers at a technical university who has tried to diversify engineering education and practice via the merge between engineering and social science, humanities and arts. In a recent decade, to cultivate future creative innovators/engineers with global competence, the incorporation of non-technical elements such as social sciences, humanities, arts and design into core engineering curricula has never been more emphasized in the Korean national context. In late 2000s, the South Korean government set priorities in science and technology policy to cultivate global leaders at the university level in the fields of information and communication technologies. The goal was clear to educate the undergraduate and graduate students to lead global markets in such fields rather than catching up with the latest technologies. The government funded two top-notches to establish an engineering program with expectation that convergent, student-oriented learning environment in engineering would generate global IT leaders. In the early 2010s, when a new engineering program opened, it received “doubts,” “skepticism,” or “envious ridicule” both from inside and outside of the university. However, about a decade later one can say that a paradigm shift has taken place and hybridity has become a new currency in engineering education to prepare for the era of highly intelligent and connected world. The paper presents a case study of how this sort of experimentally innovative community is formed through collaborative efforts between engineers, industry, the government, and others. As much as innovative forms of pedagogies are needed in engineering education, it has been rough and fiery processes to define, configure, refigure, and reformulate hybrid pedagogies among participating actors. Drawing on about a decade-long years of experience in hybrid forms of teaching and learning environment in an engineering department, the paper follows the trajectory of a contested epistemic and pragmatic space, where the topography of engineering practice and education must be reconfigured and remapped. Combining documentary analysis, participation, and in-depth dialogue with engineers, I provide inside and reflexive accounts of what aspects of engineering have been silenced and highlighted in the process of shaping hybrid pedagogies and engineering by reflecting on and assessing the nature of “hybridity,” “innovation,” and “design” in engineering education.","Ma, Eunjeong",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Pohang University of Science and Technology,
IBL: Learning by Failure,"Innovation-based learning (IBL) is a classroom structure that lets undergraduate students choose their own focus in projects while relating it to the core principles of the course. It takes a hands-on approach, allowing students to work on projects that have an impact on the world. Students track their effort and learning via tokens in an online learning management system (LMS). More importantly, it provides them the opportunity to fail, and learn from their failures. A major problem with the traditional class structure of today is that it relies heavily on the pass/fail aspect of the course, putting pressure on undergraduate students. Most students have not been previously exposed to the material before coming into a class, yet their final grade suffers if they make a mistake on assignments or tests. Whether they learned from their mistake or not is irrelevant because their grades have suffered irreversibly. With IBL's structure, students can make mistakes as they learn while still being able to succeed in the course. Instead of being punished for having a beginner's knowledge of the subject and making naive mistakes, undergraduate students are encouraged to begin from a place of curiosity and devise a 'moonshot goal' which will require them to study, form hypotheses, perform calculations, and create prototypes/experiments. Often, the hypotheses are disproven, the analyses reveal impracticality, and the prototypes fail to satisfy requirements. In short, they often fail. Understanding why failure occurred at each stage deepens students' understanding of the material and strengthens their ability to tackle complex problems in the future. This ability to fail, coupled with IBL's willingness to let students explore topics in which they are personally invested, grants students a unique agency in their learning. Under their IBL professor's support, undergraduate students can present their work at conferences when they would otherwise never be afforded the opportunity. IBL students can participate in applied research at a level usually reserved for graduate students. By being afforded the ability to take on large projects with complex problems, undergraduates under the IBL structure develop professional skills and have access to experiences well ahead of those entering the workforce through traditional educational models. This better prepares them for the challenges they'll come across in their careers, strengthening their knowledge after undergraduate programs. This paper will provide a first-person account of one undergraduate team's experience during their first semester in IBL. Students will reflect on their developing self-image as student engineers, not as engineering students. Students will share their initial project aspirations and the failures, pivots, and learning which occurred during the semester. Students' use of tokens to manage planned work and education achievements will be discussed. Students will state their achievements from this course and contrast traditional learning structures, such as high-stakes testing, active learning, and project-based learning, to IBL.","Heizelman, Isaac;House, Kiley;Matt, Mckenna",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,University of North Dakota,education ;  engineering ;  IBL ;  Innovation ;  learning ;  LMS
Needs Analysis and Requirements Delivery: Guiding the Development Approach with an Intuitive Framework,"The needs assessment and requirements engineering domains involve tasks that help us fully understand a project's motivation. The functions of this domain include exploring the problem or opportunity and recommending a possible solution and development approach to the problem. From a project perspective, this is a critical stage as we can understand the value a viable solution brings to the customer and identify an appropriate development approach. A business investing resources to develop a solution must be pragmatic about the product development approach. Our research paper presents a framework to aid decision-making within this context. It involves considering attributes such as delivery cadence, risk, degree of innovation, and requirements certainty. Knowledge of the impact of these attributes on project outcomes will help educate engineers to become successful entrepreneurs and product managers.","Kanabar, Vijay",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2023-06-25,Boston University Metropolitan College,development approach ;  needs analysis ;  requirements ;  trepreneurship

Engineering education in the rapidly changing world: Rethinking the vision for higher engineering education: Second revised edition,"When drafting the first issue of this document it sometimes felt like I was manoeuvring a small canoe through a highly viscous fluid of conservatism and complacency, with everybody bogged down by today's thinking, preparing next Tuesday's nine o'clock lecture, aiming for the best learning experience by optimising teaching and assessment. The issues of the day are about the ""how next week"", not about the ""what next year"", let alone the ""why in the next decade"". After publicising I was happy to discover that I had been somewhat mistaken in my impression. Many people in universities, industries and research institutes across the globe informed me they are with me in my canoe, or want to be. That they want to rethink higher engineering education and help initiate change to enhance the effectivity of engineering study programmes and professional training. Like me, they are concerned about as well as challenged by the technological revolution that will rock the foundations of engineering education in the coming decades. The first edition inspired many conversations about ""The Future Engineer"" at my home university and many partner universities and institutes abroad. The ""Free Spirits"" Think Tank of the 4TU.Centre of Engineering Education in the Netherlands, which investigates the rise of new engineering profiles in the coming 10 to 15 years and develops matching scenarios for campus education in 2030, has taken my vision as a source of inspiration. The numerous meetings and workshops I attended between engineering academics, industries and engineering consultancies in the Netherlands and abroad, and the conferences and panels of the global CDIO Initiative and the World Engineering Education Forum (WEEF) in Florence (2015) all discussed the subject of the engineer and industry of the future. They addressed the impact of the changing global economy, the fast pace of change, the Foreword to the Second Revised Edition limited shelf life of specialist knowledge, the university's role in innovation, the need for an interdisciplinary mind-set, the global interconnectedness, the rise of machine intelligence and the use of open standards. These are all aspects that shape the rapidly changing world in which we live and in which we educate tomorrow's engineers, who might be a different breed than the ones we have been educating over the past 50 years. These factors set the scene for the ""why"" and ""what"" of our future education.","Kamp, Aldert",Book,Engineering Education in the Rapidly Changing World: Rethinking the Vision for Higher Engineering Education: Second Revised Edition,2023-06-21,"Faculteit Luchtvaart- en Ruimtevaarttechniek, TU Delft",4tU centre of engineering education ;  Aerospace engineering ;  CDIO ;  Engineering education ;  Future of education

How does digital transformation drive green total factor productivity? Evidence from Chinese listed enterprises,"Digital transformation is a critical paradigm for advancing the in-depth integration of the digital economy and the real economy that can drive enterprises' green and low-carbon transformation. Previous research has primarily analyzed the relationship between digital transformation and green total factor productivity (GTFP) at the macro level; however, the impact of digital transformation on enterprises' GTFP as a force of economic growth and pollution management has been neglected. To fill this research gap, we explored the effects of digital transformation and associated micromechanisms on GTFP using a sample of Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2004 to 2020. Furthermore, we launched a conducted heterogeneity analyses of the research themes from enterprise, industry, and province perspectives. We elicit three notable findings. (1) Digital transformation enhances enterprise GTFP, a finding that holds after endogeneity and robustness tests, including difference-in-differences and instrumental variable methods. (2) At the enterprise level, the benefits of digital transformation are higher for lower-growth and state-owned enterprises. At the industry level, digital transformation in manufacturing, non-high-tech, and non-heavy polluting industries has a stronger GTFP improvement effect. At the provincial level, provinces with higher intensities of environmental regulation and intellectual property protection are more effective in improving GTFP through enterprises' digital transformation. (3) Structural optimization and green technology innovation effects are two critical paths through which digital transformation affects GTFP. This study confirms that enterprises’ implementation of digital transformation strategies can achieve the benefits of performance growth, energy saving, and emissions reduction at the micro level, providing relevant insights driving digital transformation more effectively and stimulating the “digital dividend.”","Wang, Jianlong;Liu, Yong;Wang, Weilong;Wu, Haitao",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-06-20,Beijing Institute of Technology;Sichuan University,Digital transformation ;  Enterprise green total factor productivity ;  Green technology innovation ;  Heterogeneity ;  Structural optimization
Designing Emerging Technology-Supported Learning Activities Based on the DT Approach for K–12 Users,"Design Thinking (DT) paired with Emerging Technologies (ET) holds exciting potential as a pedagogical innovation for creatively approaching STEAM subjects, especially Computer Science (CS). By leveraging these tools and techniques, educators can develop engaging and effective learning experiences that help foster 21st Century Skills, digital literacy in particular. To tackle the overall research statement, “How can we design DT-based K–12 learning activities for CS education that are supported by ET?”, a first Systematic Literature Review is conducted to gain a solid understanding of the current role of DT and ET in CS learning venues. Subsequently, Design-Based Research methodology with both qualitative and quantitative data gathering is proposed, along with the use of Learning Analytics and multi-modal data to trace knowledge experience and improve its personalization. The research process involves close collaboration with target users, K–12 students and teachers, as participants in the studies. A qualitative data collection effort involving semi-structured interviews with teachers is reported as a first step. On-site DT sessions engaging K–12 students, and teachers will follow. Such sessions employ a game-based approach to coding and encourage the building of educational activities. The resulting insights will be used to inform the further refinement of activities, based on the expectations and demands of stakeholders. The final aim of the PhD research is to deliver guidelines for developing ET-supported, future-proof solutions for CS learning activities. By leveraging these activities’ potential impact on interdisciplinary pedagogical reforms and 21st Century Skills knowledge, the research wants to promote innovation and advancement in the CCI field for young learners and their educators.","Possaghi, Isabella",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of IDC 2023 - 22nd Annual ACM Interaction Design and Children Conference: Rediscovering Childhood,2023-06-19,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Computer Science ;  Design Thinking ;  Education ;  Emerging Technologies ;  Learning
"Developing Machine Learning Agency Among Youth: Investigating Youth Critical Use, Examination, and Production of Machine Learning Applications","Young people are surrounded by machine learning (ML) devices and their lived experiences are increasingly shaped by the ML technologies that are ever-present in their lives. As innovations in machine learning technologies continue to shape society, it raises important implications for what young people learn, their career trajectories, and the required literacies they need to thrive in this changing occupational environment. Youth are particularly vulnerable to the impact of ML and very little has been done to empower them to critically engage in the discourse surrounding the next generation of technologies that have a marked potential to shape their lives for better or worse. My dissertation work seeks to develop youth autonomy and agency around ML by designing an intervention that supports youth critical use, examination, and production of ML applications in the context of promoting self-expression and social good. I will conduct a qualitative single case study research and collect multiple forms of data using interviews, story completions, digital artifacts, observations, and focus group discussions. These data sources will allow me to conduct an intensive analysis and investigation of how youth populations can be supported to develop the skills, practices and critical consciousness needed to effectively engage with machine learning technologies. Through my research, I also hope to advance the literature on how young people creatively collaborate with ML and use ML for self-expression.","Adisa, Ibrahim O.",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of IDC 2023 - 22nd Annual ACM Interaction Design and Children Conference: Rediscovering Childhood,2023-06-19,Clemson University,agency ;  computational thinking ;  machine learning ;  youth
From Robotics to Prosthetics: What Design and Engineering Can Do Better Together,"This paper discusses how the disciplines of Design and Engineering are jointly addressing disability and somehow affecting its very interpretation. The discussion focuses on high-tech prostheses, where robotic devices substitute human body parts. The application of robotic technologies to prosthetics has a relatively long history. Nevertheless, only in the last decade have we witnessed applications reach the market and become available for a large base of users who were offered prostheses with superior motor and sensory performance. The process of bringing ever more advanced technologies to fruition by prosthetic users is fully ongoing today, with some promising solutions coming from robotics (such as, e.g. AI techniques or soft robotics materials) to be transferred to human use. In this transfer process, technology alone is insufficient to warrant success, and the need for a close collaboration between the Engineering domain and the Design disciplines is apparent. We address this point with specific reference to a case study, i.e. the transformation of an innovative but by-now established technology in the industrial robotics field (the ""Pisa/IIT SoftHand"") into a prosthetic hand (the ""SoftHand Pro""). Besides obvious technical considerations about size, connections, control, and so on, which can be addressed with a thorough technical revision of the design, what makes the profound difference between the two devices is that, as a prosthesis, the SoftHand is intended as a human body part, and not as an external tool. To reach its ultimate goals, the hand should become a part of the human user, with his body and mind. The empirical approach and tools of Designers afford the possibility to enrich the re-design process, considering the final user at the centre of the process, in a sort of renewed humanistic approach. The paper reflects this multidisciplinary approach and is structured as follows: the first part describes a cultural framework for the use of high-technology upper limb prostheses. This culture is defined through two significant relations (Users & Society; Users & Device). Inputs come from desk research conducted in different fields, ranging from Social Psychology to Medicine and Rehabilitation area. In this scenario, it is possible to extract design insights applicable to the design brief. The introduction of a robotic prosthetic hand (SoftHand Pro) and a related, single-user case study follow. The aim here is also to illustrate a process where engineering innovations are facilitated by tools from the Design field in the attempt to make the whole process coherently centred on users. Involved are all aspects, from material technology to the covering and finishing of the prosthetic device. The resulting, final prototype of the SoftHand Pro is finally presented.","Fossati, Maria R.;Grioli, Giorgio;Catalano, Manuel G.;Bicchi, Antonio",Journal,ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction,2023-06-19,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia;Università di Pisa,Additional Key Words and PhrasesRobotics ;  design process ;  disability culture ;  prostheses ;  social perception ;  users' needs

Research progress in color construction of high-performance fibers and its products,"-Significance High-performance fibers are key materials for the development of national textile industry, which is related to the development of national economic and strategic security. For the purposes of aesthetic enhancement, functional flexibility, and feature identification, demands on color construction of high-performance fiber have become an important driving force for the development of the colorful society. The development of color construction technique ranges from the chemical coloration to structural coloration technology. Additionally, future high-performance fiber will be permeable for long-term multi-field development in the applications of advanced and sophisticated areas, which is indispensable part of social progress, and integrating color construction of high-performance fiber is an ideal way to realize highly flexible and adaptive. To clearly understand the development and applications of high-performance fibers, master the frontiers and development trends of dyeing methods, and break through the technical bottlenecks of the industry, this paper comprehensively reviewed the research progress in color construction of high-performance fibers and its products.Progress The technical innovation and research status in color construction of the representative aramid fiber, carbon fiber, polyimide fiber, and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene was focused. According to the structural characteristics, physical, and chemical properties of high-performance fibers, the aspects of fiber raw materials, molding processing, surface modification, and dyeing process are innovated, from which to implement color construction. Based on the development of chemical coloration methods including carrier dyeing, non-aqueous media solvents dyeing, dope dyeing, and structural coloration technology, maintaining the inherent high-performance characteristics is the building blocks of color construction process. The design of coloring method matching to the materials and structure effectively improves the dyeing property and dyeing fastness of high-performance fiber. However, significant limitation of promising coloring methods, which meets the social development concept, was demonstrated in industrial application.For the aramid fiber, based on the pre-regulation of the molecular structure, the low temperature carrier dyeing has been carried out for bright color and high color fastness. However, the removal of residual carrier, the safe reuse, and reduction of the influence on the mechanical properties should be further investigated. Due to the high crystallinity, high chemical inertness, and strong light absorption characteristics of carbon fiber, the structural color methods have been extensively used to construct colored carbon fibers, while the influence of interface properties to color fastness is an urgent problem to be solved. The golden color of the polyimide fiber will also affect the further color construction. Presently, the color construction methods of polyimide fiber mainly include carrier dyeing and surface modification dyeing. Carrier dyeing of ketone carriers is effective to the color construction, which can significantly improve the color fastness of polyimide fibers. According to the physical and chemical structural properties of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber, the modification of dyes is a preponderant method for achieving color diversity.Conclusion and Prospect High performance fiber refers to the chemical fiber with special physical and chemical structure, performance, and special function. As typical representative of high-performance fiber, carbon fiber, aramid fiber, polyimide fiber and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber are the four most widely used in aerospace, national defense science and technology, military engineering, construction industry, transportation, medical protection, civil industry, and electronic communications. However, the unicity of color limits its application to further expansion. Aiming at the problem of color construction, the methods including carrier dyeing, non-aqueous solvent dyeing, fiber surface modification dyeing, stock solution coloring, as well as physical structure color construction have been improved. Based on the current color construction technology, the attention of development tendency in the future will be attracted on promoting energy-saving, low-carbon, green and environmental protection dyeing, strengthening clean, and safe production. Meanwhile, theoretical fundamental research on the color construction of high-performance fibers is necessary to further investigate. Combining the macromolecular chain, chemical structure, molding process, surface physical, and chemical properties to achieve theoretical breakthrough in the color construction, theoretical innovation, and theoretical guidance for the preparation of colored high-performance fibers will be promoted. Additionally, to improve the dyeing depth and color fastness of fibers and reduce the structural damage in the color construction process of high-performance fibers, further attention should be paid to maintain the excellent structural stability.

Energy flexibility of building systems in future scenarios: optimization of the control strategy of a dynamic shading system and definition of a new energy flexibility metric,"The growing awareness of climate change is constantly moving the attention of designers and policymakers from typical and current scenarios to future layouts. This new approach introduces a degree of uncertainty that should be accounted in the building design process. The multitude of possible scenarios suggests considering dynamic system that can adapt themselves to unpredicted operating conditions. The aim of this study is to test a new approach and a new flexibility metric analysing the behaviour of a high-performance dynamic internal curtain in current and future scenarios. The first part of the paper focuses on the optimization of the dynamic system in the current scenario; this preliminary analysis represents the traditional design approach and is considered the baseline for all the comparisons. Hence, defining a matrix of likely scenarios, this paper explores the behaviour of three different selected control strategies – always off (i.e., no curtain), fixed control, optimized control – in the different scenarios considering possible variations of i) climate, ii) urban context, iii) internal loads, and iv) building use. The main outcomes of the research are, on the one hand, the comparisons of the control strategies and the benefits of the dynamic system and, on the other hand, the definition of a new metric that can properly describe the flexibility of the building systems with reference to the future scenarios analysed. This metric is based on six classes – which describe the statistical distribution of the energy consumptions of all the scenarios simulated in the matrix – and an index called Energy Flexibility Index (EFI) that quantifies the flexibility of the technology considered. The case study analysed highlights how implementing a dynamic shading system, considering the same building use, can increase the EFI of nearly 21% for non-optimized control strategy and up to 23% when optimized. While changing the building use in residential reduces these values respectively, to 6% and 7%.","Carlucci, F.;Negendahl, K.;Fiorito, F.",Journal,Energy and Buildings,2023-06-15,Politecnico di Bari;Technical University of Denmark,Adaptability ;  Architectural engineering ;  Climate change ;  Digital innovation ;  Dynamic shading ;  Energy efficiency ;  Flexibility ;  Future weather ;  Responsive envelopes ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainable design
A state-of-the-art review on high temperature resistance of lightweight aggregate high-strength concrete,"Lightweight aggregate high-strength concrete (LWA-HSC) exposed to high temperatures usually exhibits the poor resistance to the deterioration properties of materials, which would be bring about a serious threat to the safety of concrete structures after fire disaster or high temperature action. It is of great significance to explore the damage mechanism of LWA-HSC at elevated temperatures aiming at its popularization and application in the practical engineering. Based on the research status of LWA-HSC performance behavior at home and abroad, the damage evolution mechanisms of concrete at elevated temperatures were first summarized and introduced. The influence of some factors, including lightweight aggregate types and dosage, replacement ratio, heating rate, and cooling system, on the mechanical and durability-related properties of LWA-HSC after high temperatures was further discussed, and the strengthening mechanisms of the resistance to high temperature was elaborated and analyzed. On this basis, the future research on the performance behavior of LWA-HSC would be finally proposed, which is helpful to perfect theoretical development and technological innovation.","Bao, Jiuwen;Zheng, Rui;Sun, Yanqun;Zhang, Peng;Cui, Yifei;Xue, Shanbin;Song, Qiang",Journal,Journal of Building Engineering,2023-06-15,Qingdao University of Technology,Damage evolution ;  High temperature ;  Lightweight aggregate concrete ;  Mechanical properties

A Game Model Analysis of University Science and Technology Innovation Construction within Region: Taking Macao as an Example,"In the process of building an regional science and technology innovation center, the interests demands of any subsystems must be considered in the cooperation. Universities need to pay attention to the reciprocity with cross-border cooperative organizations, the role of the subject and active adaptability, continuous changes and equilibrium points during the process of innovation and evolution. Taking Macao as an example, this study divides the development process of universities participating the international science and technology innovation center into a period of role-driven, a period of growth and change, and a period of active sharing by construction of critical and flipped mass game model of mutualistic development. In the early stage of the construction of the international science and technology innovation center, universities as supporters, linkers and sharers in the regional innovation process, promoting regional innovation through role-playing as participants. Based on the ""innovation hub""and the enhanced version of the ""triple helix""theory, universities should shift from ""demand""to ""supply""to meet the industrial upgrading in the innovation system, give full play to their characteristics and advantages, actively build science and technology innovation platforms and innovation transformation bases, and support the development of regional international science and technology innovation center as ""Proactive sharers"".

Research on the application of finite element technology in teaching,"New technologies have brought about great innovations in teaching methods. This article studied the application of finite element technology (FET) in the teaching of Engineering Mechanics (EM) in vocational colleges, taking a difficult mechanics problem as a case study. A three-dimensional finite element model was built using Abaqus software. We obtained a large number of colorful stress nephogram through simulation, which were collated as teaching material for the EM course. Subsequently, we redesigned the teaching content and conducted teaching experiments. The results show that FET can effectively improve the teaching quality of the course. The visualised and digitised stress nephogram facilitate the understanding of abstract concepts. The students are significantly more motivated to learn. FET have been widely used in the fields of construction, aeronautics and automobiles, but there is a dearth of research in the field of teaching. Educators should explore more new technologies such as FET to improve teaching quality.","Feng, Zhixin;Wang, Shang",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-06-09,Beijing Polytechnic,Engineering mechanics ;  Finite element technology ;  Simulation ;  Teaching
A Maker Space During the Covid-19 Pandemic to Promote STEM in High School Students,"Nowadays, STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) is a highly recognized curriculum choice since it promotes innovation and leads to developing problem-solving skills, which are needed in everyday lives. However, a lack of interest in STEM subject matter has been observed in high school students. Seeking to impact positively on students' attitudes towards STEM, a maker space was implemented using e-textile materials. The research question that directed this implementation was: can a maker space increase students' motivation towards STEM? A total of 96 third-semester high school students participated in this maker space, which was conducted during the pandemic lockdown due to COVID-19. Skills to be developed, activities to be carried out, and objectives stated during the first stage had to be reconsidered and reconfigured since the lockdown was not anticipated during the initial implementation planning. Despite all these changes, the findings were very positive: students built a learning network with their classmates; but they did so mainly with members of their own families, which was unexpected. Although the participants reported having varied challenges while working on tasks, they indicated that they had fun and felt motivated, not only about getting good grades but also about learning something new. As a result, engagement in STEM activities was impacted positively. Finally, when students were asked whether they had developed disciplinary or formative skills, ninety percent indicated both. The aim of this paper is to address the benefits of maker spaces in promoting STEM.","Miranda Leal, Sandra",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-06-09,Tecnológico de Monterrey,e-textile ;  educational innovation ;  students' motivation ;  TEC21
Thinking beyond the Device: An Overview of Human-and Equity-Centered Approaches for Health Technology Design,"A shift in the traditional technocentric view of medical device design to a human-centered one is needed to bridge existing translational gaps and improve health equity. To ensure the successful and equitable adoption of health technology innovations, engineers must think beyond the device and the direct end user and must seek a more holistic understanding of broader stakeholder needs and the intended context of use early in a design process. The objectives of this review article are (a) to provide rationale for the need to incorporate meaningful stakeholder analysis and contextual investigation in health technology development and biomedical engineering pedagogy, (b) to review existing frameworks and human-and equity-centered approaches to stakeholder engagement and contextual investigation for improved adoption of innovative technologies, and (c) to present case studyexamples of medical device design that apply these approaches to bridge the gaps between biomedical engineers and the contexts for which they are designing.","Rodriguez, Natalia M.;Burleson, Grace;Linnes, Jacqueline C.;Sienko, Kathleen H.",Book Series,Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering,2023-06-08,"Department of Computer Science;College of Health and Human Sciences;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering",Community engagement ;  Contextual investigation ;  Equity-centered engineering ;  Health technologies ;  Human-centered design ;  Stakeholder engagement
"Engineering Innovations, Challenges, and Opportunities for Lignocellulosic Biorefineries: Leveraging Biobased Polymer Production","Alternative polymer feedstocks are highly desirable to address environmental, social, and security concerns associated with petrochemical-based materials. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has emerged as one critical feedstock in this regard because it is an abundant and ubiquitous renewable resource. LCB can be deconstructed to generate valuable fuels, chemicals, and small molecules/oligomers that are amenable to modification and polymerization. However, the diversity of LCB complicates the evaluation of biorefinery concepts in areas including process scale-up, production outputs, plant economics, and life-cycle management. We discuss aspects of current LCB biorefinery research with a focus on the major process stages, including feedstock selection, fractionation/deconstruction, and characterization, along with product purification, functionalization, and polymerization to manufacture valuable macromolecular materials. We highlight opportunities to valorize underutilized and complex feedstocks, leverage advanced characterization techniques to predict and manage biorefinery outputs, and increase the fraction of biomass converted into valuable products.","Shapiro, Alison J.;O'Dea, Robert M.;Li, Sonia C.;Ajah, Jamael C.;Bass, Garrett F.;Epps, Thomas H.",Journal,Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,2023-06-08,University of Delaware,biobased polymers ;  biorefinery ;  life-cycle management ;  lignocellulosic biomass ;  sustainability ;  valorization
Unleashing the Influence of High-Throughput Flow Process Optimization on Luminescent Behavior of Engineered ZnO Quantum Dots,"Engineered ZnO quantum dots (E-QDs) are sought-after nanostructures in healthcare and optoelectronic industries, necessitating a paradigm shift toward high-throughput continuous flow platforms, the crux to whose successful design and performance lies in comprehending the nucleation-growth kinetics, defect engineering, and reaction dynamics. This work investigates the synergistic interplay of enhanced hydrodynamics and heat-mass transfer in the helical coil reactor, fostering rapid nucleation-growth-driven E-QDs fabrication. We integrated computational fluid dynamic modeling, and comprehensive experimentation for producing E-QDs with record-high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (∼89% in the yellow-green spectrum) by carefully creating oxygen vacancies via a novel reproducible protocol. Dean vortices formed due to the helical geometry facilitated ultrafast mixing and accelerated reaction kinetics, yielding colloidally stable E-QDs in gram-scales [ζ = -39.7 mV, polydispersity index (PDI) ∼0.22] with a narrow particle size distribution (average particle size ∼4.5 nm). Contrastingly, the conventional batch route produced less stable E-QDs with ζ value of -15.3 mV, PDI ∼0.41, and diminished PLQY (∼40%) because of inadequate process control, batch-to-batch variability due to poor mixing, and heat transfer. The simple, economical, in-house-fabricated flow reactor manifested ∼90% increment in yield and reduced product cost. Thus, this research demonstrated the benefits of simulation-driven process engineering and reactor design in catalyzing QDs-based innovations.","Sarkar, Sayoni;Narayanan, Venkataramani;Srivastava, Rohit;Kulkarni, Ajit R.",Journal,Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,2023-06-07,Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,
Marginal Scale State Analysis of Cloud Computing Economy Based on a Class of First Order Differential Equations,"This paper studies the internal effects of cloud technology on the economic development of our country based on a primary differential equation.

The Advances of Tribology in Materials and Energy Conservation and Engineering Innovation,"Tribology has been significantly contributing to materials, energy conservation and engineering innovation. This paper elaborates the development of tribology considering in detail in energy factor, tribological role of efficiency in the society by introducing lubricants which reduces the effective friction while moving the mass which significantly improves overall efficiency of the process all though it was primitive. The objectives of the study of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) are working to expand energy conservation, particularly through tribology, by doing things like evaluating the realistic effects of tribological innovation on conserving energy and trying to promote advanced energy technologies, identifying fields the application's location of new or existing Knowledge of tribology is anticipated to result in significant direct or indirect benefits, and so on. The strategy focuses on fluid film and rolling element bearings, consistently sophisticated metal processing, wear and friction reduction, variable power transmission, sealing technologies, automobile engines, and energy technologies. Additionally, the potential savings for various areas are detailed, as is a summary demonstrating the advantages that may be obtained with cutting-edge industrial machinery and processes, and comparing the prospective cost savings with the benefits ratio of the many key program features. road transportation for increasing energy efficiency. It was regarded as the most appropriate and advantageous aspects of tribology at the time to increasing productivity. Since then, numerous studies have focused on the study of industry-based machine and method-specific materials. Also, continuous variable transmissions are now found in many automobiles to enhance vehicle efficiency. Some future challenges were also looked at to plan and see how they can be tackled. The implementation of next level materials in different aspects of technology can lead to growth in the efficiency, quality of engineering parts and machines. This paper is a summary of the improvement in high performance materials both inorganic and organic based. It involves thin hard coverings of their growing importance in tribological improvements for tribo- engineering implementations are looked at and studied. Results from research concerning ceramics and ceramic properties, polymers and polymer properties as well as hard coatings and show the friction and wear attributes and their potential implementation for tribo- engineering. Greasing and friction have a strong relationship with wear. The study of these three topics is essentially what tribology entails. It deals with moving, interacting surfaces in science and technology. To better regulate friction and wear, hard or soft film coating, alloying, and composite structures have all been enhanced. It is accomplished by enhancing the lubricity and wear life of materials and surfaces using novel, modified lubricants and ideas that have been put to the test in challenging tribological applications. The development of new generations of self-lubricating coats with multilayered architecture due to recent advances in thin film deposition methods treatments. The field of tribology is crucial to lowering the levels of emissions from various industries because it is being used to cut down on the amount of unnecessary energy used by mechanisms. Understanding the functions of friction and wear between two surfaces that come into contact has been the domain of tribology for many decades. They have applied this knowledge to make mechanisms more energy efficient by only using what is necessary to power them and reducing the amount of energy lost through wear and friction.","Adetunla, Adedotun;Afolalu, Sunday;Jen, Tien Chien;Ogundana, Ayodele",Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2023-06-05,Afe Babalola University;University of Johannesburg,
The development model of marine science and technology innovation under the background of regional integration in the Yangtze River Delta in the new era,"In the wave of regional integration of the Yangtze River Delta, there are many geographical and institutional problems and asymmetries in knowledge and cultural systems in the regions, resulting in less efficient development, which creates many uncontrollable factors for integration and hinders it. Based on the entropy value method - three stage DEA model, firstly, We first measured the comprehensive evaluation index of each region's development using the entropy method and assessed the marine economy of 11 regions in the Yangtze River Delta, we excluded some factors and random disturbances to calculate the innovation efficiency of marine science and technology (hereinafter referred to as IEMST) in China's Yangtze River Delta region from 2010 to 2020. The results indicate that the overall level of IEMST is low in the 11 regions and is strongly influenced by regional differences. IEMST scale efficiency is too low to limit the improvement of China's IEMST, we have to improve IEMST, through unified planning, adjustment, configuration of regional some factors, the establishment of a new model of IEMST development, further development of China's marine science and technology, for China to form an innovation-driven development of science and technology to promote the great power of the sea has a positive impact, to promote the implementation of the marine power strategy.","Huan, Hengfei;Qian, Ying",Journal,Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences,2023-06-03,Yancheng Teachers University,entropy method ;  marine science and technology innovation ;  regional integration ;  slack variables ;  three-stage DEA model

Innovation diversity in human societies,"Innovation must be considered in its dual nature. It designates practices which are multiple, ranging from consumption and marketing to techno-scientific processes, from industrial production to public policies. It also, and this will be the main object of analysis of this article, designates a set of analysis and, above all, discourses of promotion and justification. Those discourses can be categorized in three main orientations: linear technoscientific innovations; managerial and administrative innovations; social innovations. In the past half century, those discourses have become the common credo of a world focused on techno-scientific engineering, industrial economic development, and economic growth, and can be considered as a kind of global and ubiquitous ideology, spread all around the planet, particularly in urban behavior and within productive and managerial processes of contemporary organizations. This ideology and practices of innovation face a huge and almost insurmountable problem: it is powerless, at least, and surely more harmful, to resolve some of the main systemic challenges that are currently occurring (global warming, persistence of inequalities, etc.). This paper pledges to consider reinforcing regulation and public policies, but mainly proposes a bet on the relevance of humanist education and knowledge, i.e a radical transformation of higher education in order to develop new ways for new innovation.","Ruano-Borbalan, Jean Claude",Book,Innovation Ecosystems in the New Economic Era: Digital Revolution and Ecological Transition,2023-06-02,Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers,Doctrines of innovation ;  Ideology ;  Knowledge ;  Responsible innovation ;  Sustainable future ;  Universities and research

REASONS AND TRIGGERS USING RESEARCH RESULTS IN CORPORATE PRODUCT ENGINEERING,"In product engineering, the development of new innovations is a big challenge due to the high complexity of nowadays systems. Research results are a high-potential input for companies to still advance their technologies and solutions. However, using research as a source of new knowledge and technologies is a non-trivial process that can often be neglected by many companies. The goal of this investigation is to gain and provide an understanding of the specific triggers and reasons for corporate product engineers to use research results as input in their development process. Based on nine semi-structured interviews with experts from different engineering companies, we present a model that explains these reasons, triggers, and situations to use research results. We believe that our model will help to raise the awareness of corporate product engineers to the potential of using research results within their design activities. Furthermore, the outcome of this investigation provides a basis for further research to improve the usability and actual usage of research results in corporate product engineering.

Fiber laser from interdisciplinary perspective: review and prospect (invited),"Since the turn of the century, China has been a research hub for fiber lasers. The National University of Defense Technology's research into fiber lasers began during the ""11th Five-Year Plan"" period and has lasted approximately 15 years, yielding a number of peer-reviewed research outputs. The optical engineering field underpins the majority of fiber laser research at the institution. Optical engineering is one of the university's dominating fields, with good results in recent discipline review, providing a high-level scientific research platform and talent team for fiber laser research. On the other hand, fiber laser development benefits from the advantages of reasonably complete subject categories as well as helpful exploration and practice in interdisciplinary aspects. From an interdisciplinary standpoint, this paper sorts out several important breakthroughs in the interdiscipline of fiber laser and electronics, materials, control, intelligence, nano, and other disciplines in the university, and analyzes the opportunities faced by interdisciplinary scientific research and interdisciplinary construction from four perspectives: the evolution of scientific research paradigm, subject driving, application demand traction, and the inception of interdisciplinary scientific research and interdisciplinary construction. Significance & Progress The National University of Defense Technology's main fiber laser research is based on the discipline of optical engineering; Research in the fiber laser began during the ""11th Five-Year Plan"" period, has been about 15 years, and has achieved a series of peer-recognized research results. During the ""11th Five-Year Plan"" period, the university concentrated on scientific research in the fields of fiber laser coherent synthesis and supercontinuum fiber light source, and officially began related work in the fiber laser discipline, achieving research achievements represented by kilowatt fiber laser coherent synthesis system and high-power near-infrared supercontinuum light source. During the ""12th Five-Year Plan"" period, the university focused on high-power fiber lasers, gradually expanding its research into high-power fiber lasers, fiber passive devices, and so on, and achieved innovative results in cascade pumping high-power fiber lasers, special wavelength fiber lasers, high-brightness laser bunders, and high-power ultrafine lasers. Since the ""13th Five-Year Plan,"" the research focus has shifted to the development of laser fiber materials and software, as well as the development of laser full machines to form a complete chain. As a representative of the corporation, we have obtained independent intellectual property software, virtual simulation courses, various types of laser fiber, high power and high beam quality single frequency/narrow linewidth/broadband fiber laser, cascade pump/semiconductor direct pump high power and high beam quality fiber laser, high power visible light/near infrared/mid-infrared supercontinuum light source, thousand-beam laser phase control/high power fiber coherent synthesis system. This study examines the prospects for cross-disciplinary research and construction from four perspectives: the growth of scientific research paradigms, subject driving, application demand pulling, and science-education integration. The university's fiber laser approach has produced a number of notable research results, with input from other disciplines playing an essential role. The in-depth analysis, however, reveals that relevant research is primarily ""reference"" and ""inspiration"" between disciplines, such as the development of fiber simulation software mentioned in the introduction and ultra-long-term stable high-performance pulsed fiber laser, etc., which is more the result of personnel familiar with ""optical engineering,"" ""software engineering,"" and ""nanoscience"" working together to promote. In reality, there aren't many cross-disciplinary construction and cross-scientific research items. There are basically no examples like Logan Wright who have made significant contributions to various disciplines such as nonlinear fiber optics and artificial intelligence at the moment. The scientific foundation of relevant researchers must be strengthened further. However, with the rapid advancement of a new round of scientific and technological revolution, industrial change, and continuous innovation of education and teaching methods, it provides new opportunities for cross-scientific research and cross-disciplinary construction, as well as a broad space for the development of the fiber laser direction, and the fiber laser direction will continue to produce more innovative results. Conclusions and Prospects After approximately 15 years of development, the university's research of fiber laser has accomplished a number of significant outcomes that are strongly tied to the support of the optical engineering discipline and the deep cross-integration of other associated disciplines. The continuous human science and technology development in this century is continuous comprehensive development, from comprehensive to more comprehensive, and this integration tendency is reflected in scientific research, discipline construction, personnel training, and other aspects. Although the development of fiber laser has experienced many problems and challenges, the research of fiber laser will continue to create more novel outcomes with the continued advancement of interdisciplinary construction and cross-scientific research.","Zhou, Pu;Jiang, Min;Wu, Hanshuo;Deng, Yu;Chang, Hongxiang;Huang, Liangjin;Wu, Jian;Xu, Jiangming;Wang, Xiaolin;Leng, Jinyong",Journal,Hongwai yu Jiguang Gongcheng/Infrared and Laser Engineering,2023-06-01,National University of Defense Technology China,coherent synthesis ;  fiber laser ;  interdisciplinary ;  optical engineering ;  pulsed laser

"Theory, Technology and Practice of Unconventional Petroleum Geology","Forming the theory and technology of unconventional petroleum geology for driving the expansion of exploration and development from conventional to unconventional resources and exploring petroleum inside source kitchen is an inevitable trend in the global petroleum industry. With over 10 years of efforts, we have formed the theories of unconventional fine-grained sedimentology, unconventional reservoir geology, unconventional hydrocarbon accumulation geology, unconventional petroleum development geology, and orderly accumulation of conventional–unconventional petroleum, and developed the key technologies of unconventional petroleum experiment, exploration appraisal, development engineering, and conventional – unconventional petroleum exploration and development, depending upon the distinct geologic setting and petroleum industry conditions in China. These theories and technologies have basically comprised a system framework for unconventional petroleum geology. The evolution from the source control theory for conventional petroleum to the source-reservoir symbiosis system for unconventional petroleum leads to a profound understanding that a huge size of economic resources accumulate in source rock strata and extensive tight reservoir beds in the immediate vicinity. Innovations in the theory and technology of unconventional petroleum geology have guided the unconventional petroleum geology discipline development, research and development of key technologies, formulation of national standards, construction of state laboratories, and professional training, and promoted the economic exploration and development of unconventional resources such as tight oil and gas and shale oil and gas in China. By the end of 2022, unconventional oil and gas production exceeded 1×108 t oil equivalent, accounting for 28% of total oil and gas production in China. Specifically, unconventional gas contributed to 41% of total gas production, and unconventional oil contributed to 17% of total oil production. Oil and gas are non-renewable, but unconventional oil and gas revolution may prolong the life-span of petroleum industry. Through intensifying the innovations in theory, technology and management, and performing“three underground revolutions”(in-situ conversion of low-mature shale for oil and gas, in-situ conversion of oil-rich coal rock for oil and gas, and in-situ fracturing of brittle shale for oil and gas production), it is possible to coordinate the fossil energy and new energy resources in energy super basins represented by Ordos, and shape an integration of petroleum and new energy in energy super basins in China against the background of carbon neutrality. Unconventional oil and gas revolution is expected to sustain the petroleum industry for another 150 years or more and boost China’s Energy Independence.","Zou, Caineng;Yang, Zhi;Zhang, Guosheng;Zhu, Rukai;Tao, Shizhen;Yuan, Xuanjun;Hou, Lianhua;Dong, Dazhong;Guo, Qiulin;Song, Yan;Ran, Qiquan;Qiu, Zhen;Wu, Songtao;Ma, Feng;Bai, Bin;Wang, Lan;Xiong, Bo;Pan, Songqi;Liu, Hanlin;Wang, Xiaoni",Journal,Diqiu Kexue - Zhongguo Dizhi Daxue Xuebao/Earth Science - Journal of China University of Geosciences,2023-06-01,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development,artificial hydrocarbon reservoir ;  chemical transformation within source ;  coal rock revolution ;  continuous hydrocarbon accumulation ;  conventional-unconventional petroleum geology ;  exploring petroleum inside source kitchen ;  fine-grained sediment ;  microscale to nanoscale pore throat ;  oil and gas in source rock stratum ;  shale revolution ;  source rock oil and gas ;  super energy basin ;  unconventional petroleum geology
A Practical Data Quality Assessment Method for Raw Data in Vessel Operations,"With the current revolution in Shipping 4.0, a tremendous amount of data is accumulated during vessel operations. Data quality (DQ) is becoming more and more important for the further digitalization and effective decision-making in shipping industry. In this study, a practical DQ assessment method for raw data in vessel operations is proposed. In this method, specific data categories and data dimensions are developed based on engineering practice and existing literature. Concrete validation rules are then formed, which can be used to properly divide raw datasets. Afterwards, a scoring method is used for the assessment of the data quality. Three levels, namely good, warning and alarm, are adopted to reflect the final data quality. The root causes of bad data quality could be revealed once the internal dependency among rules has been built, which will facilitate the further improvement of DQ in practice. A case study based on the datasets from a Danish shipping company is conducted, where the DQ variation is monitored, assessed and compared. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective to help shipping industry improve the quality of raw data in practice. This innovation research can facilitate shipping industry to set a solid foundation at the early stage of their digitalization journeys.","Chen, Gang;Cai, Jie;Rytter, Niels Gorm Maly;Lützen, Marie",Journal,Journal of Marine Science and Application,2023-06-01,World Maritime University;Syddansk Universitet,Data quality ;  Noon reports ;  Shipping ;  Validation rules ;  Vessel operations
Developing Elementary School Teacher'sProfessional Competence in Composing Traditional Songs: An Action Research in Indonesia,"The prevalence of international music engineering is undermining the significance of traditional songs in character building for elementary school students in Indonesia. Consequently, it is necessary to restore the role and function of traditional songs in elementary school learning. One approach to achieving this is by creating new songs that resonate with today's context. However, not all elementary school teachers have the competence to compose songs, hence the need for training in this aspect of teacher professional competence so that they can develop and use music learning materials. The objective of this study is to enhance the creativity and innovation of elementary school teachers in composing traditional songs. Action research as the research design involved quantitative and qualitative approaches. The participants consisted of 15 elementary school teachers who were honorary teachers and civil servants. Quantitative data were collected through surveys, and qualitative data were collected through interviews and observations. The findings indicate that teachers can develop their ability to compose traditional songs and can use technology in the process. Therefore, it can be concluded that elementary school teachers can develop and innovate themselves in creating traditional songs and teaching materials that are tailored to their needs with structured and controlled training. This research needs to be followed up by evaluating teachers in conveying their songs to students and suggesting that teachers be given regular training by the government to increase competence in the field of music, because only a small number participated.","Julia, J.;Supriyadi, Tedi;Ali, Enjang Yusup;Agustian, Egi;Fadlilah, Afi",Journal,"International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research",2023-06-01,Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia,action research ;  composing songs ;  elementary school teacher ;  teacher's creativity ;  traditional song
Leveraging machine learning engineering to uncover insights into heterogeneous catalyst design for oxidative coupling of methane,"Machine learning (ML)-assisted catalyst investigations for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) are assessed using published datasets that include literature data reported by different research teams, along with systematic high-throughput screening (HTS) data. Support vector regression (SVR) is performed on the selected 2842 data points. The first SVR leads to eight catalysts with C2 yields higher than 15.0% under the current reaction conditions, but the second attempt with the updated dataset including the first validation results does not improve the prediction because of spatial shrinkage. The Bayesian optimization processes also start with datasets of 3335 data points, and are considered for three cycles using the updated dataset. Repeating the Bayesian processes certainly improves the C2 yields observed in the validation results, but the convergence of the elements presents another issue. Accordingly, data-driven catalyst investigations involve a different set of defect issues from the conventional style of catalyst investigations. The unveiling of issues in the highly active OCM catalyst investigation by ML engineering conducted for this study is intended to clarify future challenging subjects for ML-assisted research innovations. Actions to proactively discover the encounters with serendipity to broaden the scope of the material survey area using ML approaches and/or working with the researcher's intuition can increase the possibility of fortuitous discoveries and the achievement of desired outcomes.","Nishimura, Shun;Li, Xinyue;Ohyama, Junya;Takahashi, Keisuke",Journal,Catalysis Science and Technology,2023-06-01,Kumamoto University;Hokkaido University;Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,
An Interdisciplinary Approach and Advanced Techniques for Enhanced 3D-Printed Upper Limb Prosthetic Socket Design: A Literature Review,"This review investigates the opportunities and challenges of interdisciplinary research in upper limb prosthetic (ULP) socket design and manufacturing, which is crucial for improving the lives of individuals with limb loss. By integrating various disciplines, such as engineering, materials science, biomechanics, and health care, with emerging technologies such as 3D printing, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual reality (VR), interdisciplinary collaboration can foster innovative solutions tailored to users’ diverse needs.

(Un)Likely Connections between (Un)Likely Actors in the Art/NBS Co-Creation Process: Application of KREBS Cycle of Creativity to the Cyborg Garden Project,"NBS provides the technical basis for adaptation to climate change, and co-creation is the vehicle for the co-production of knowledge and innovation, both forming a strong binomial for the UE Green Infrastructures Strategy. Nonetheless, one of the main challenges for the implementation of effective co-creation strategies is the incorporation of knowledge from diverse social systems. Knowledge production has been approached through different methodological models, such as the quintuple helix innovation by Carayannis, or the diffuse/expert knowledge model by Manzini. These theoretical models are based on linear knowledge transfers, without sufficiently depicting alternative knowledge flows among (un)conventional actors. In view of these limitations, the research proposes a third strategy: the KREBS cycle of creativity defined by Oxman is a conceptual map capable of describing knowledge transfers across the four modalities of human creativity (i.e., science, engineering, design, and art). Providing sufficient “creative energy” in a co-creation process would guarantee the successful production of knowledge. Thus, the research seeks to illuminate different co-creation strategies to promote “creative energy” in the design of the Cyborg Garden (CG) in Madrid, giving a novel application to Oxman’s methodological framework based on the Carayannis’s and Manzini’s models.","Alméstar, Manuel;Romero-Muñoz, Sara;Mestre, Nieves;Fogué, Uriel;Gil, Eva;Masha, Amanda",Journal,Land,2023-06-01,"Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería de Montes, Forestal y del Medio Natural;Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Climate-KIC Holding B.V;Instituto Mutante de Narrativas Ambientales",art/science ;  co-creation ;  creativity ;  knowledge ;  KREBS cycle ;  NBS ;  QHIM
Gut-on-a-Chip Research for Drug Development: Implications of Chip Design on Preclinical Oral Bioavailability or Intestinal Disease Studies,"The gut plays a key role in drug absorption and metabolism of orally ingested drugs. Additionally, the characterization of intestinal disease processes is increasingly gaining more attention, as gut health is an important contributor to our overall health. The most recent innovation to study intestinal processes in vitro is the development of gut-on-a-chip (GOC) systems. Compared to conventional in vitro models, they offer more translational value, and many different GOC models have been presented over the past years. Herein, we reflect on the almost unlimited choices in designing and selecting a GOC for preclinical drug (or food) development research. Four components that largely influence the GOC design are highlighted, namely (1) the biological research questions, (2) chip fabrication and materials, (3) tissue engineering, and (4) the environmental and biochemical cues to add or measure in the GOC. Examples of GOC studies in the two major areas of preclinical intestinal research are presented: (1) intestinal absorption and metabolism to study the oral bioavailability of compounds, and (2) treatment-orientated research for intestinal diseases. The last section of this review presents an outlook on the limitations to overcome in order to accelerate preclinical GOC research.","Donkers, Joanne M.;van der Vaart, Jamie I.;van de Steeg, Evita",Journal,Biomimetics,2023-06-01,Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek- TNO;Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum,ADME ;  drug development ;  ex vivo ;  gut-on-a-chip ;  IBD ;  in vitro ;  intestine ;  microbiome ;  oral bioavailability ;  organ-on-a-chip
"A Systematic Review of Engineering Students in Intercultural Teamwork: Characteristics, Challenges, and Coping Strategies","In response to the challenges posed by globalization and internationalization, engineering education programs are increasingly focused on knowledge, technologies, and competence that meet global needs. Against this backdrop, higher engineering students are often encouraged to collaborate in teams with others from diverse, cultural, and disciplinary backgrounds, for the purpose of preparing them to accommodate change and innovation across international working contexts. Within a growing number of intercultural systematic and meta-analysis reviews in engineering education, little attention has been paid to intercultural team characteristics, and even less has been given to the challenges of intercultural teamwork and the relevant coping strategies. Using a systematic approach, this paper reviewed 77 journal articles to identify the intercultural team characteristics of engineering students based on team formats, level of collaboration, learning goals, evaluation methods, and learning gains. Through the process of intercultural collaboration, several challenges and corresponding coping strategies were reported at the individual, relational, and contextual levels. Recommendations for future practice for engineering educators and programs faculties, and future research directions for engineering educational researchers, are proposed in order to support engineering students’ intercultural team learning.","Jiang, Dan;Dahl, Bettina;Du, Xiangyun",Journal,Education Sciences,2023-06-01,Aalborg University,challenges of international teamwork ;  coping strategies for intercultural teamwork ;  engineering education ;  intercultural team collaboration ;  systematic review
Four critical engineering and technical problems in manufacturing measurement of traditional Chinese medicine,"Focusing on the development and quality improvement strategy of the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) industry, the scientific and technological innovation of the new engineering of TCM should be paid attention to solve the "" stuck neck"" dilemma. Under the background of the ecological and industrial revolution of the scientific and technological innovation system, the super-scale information interaction and multi-dimensional integration will inevitably lead to profound changes in the manufacturing mode of TCM. Manufacturing measurement of TCM is formed on the basis of the reliability engineering theory of process control of TCM production. It is the development extension of system theory and system science ideas and a cross-fertilization discipline that combines theory with practice and adheres to the "" four-oriented"" re-epistemology improvement of the TCM discipline. In response to the problems of complex raw material sources, coarse process technology, unclear material basis, and poor applicability of equipment and technology in the manufacture of TCM, the transformation research mode of "" aiming at the integration of pharmaceutical industry-developing intelligent production line-enabling industrial transformation "" has been developed. This paper proposed the four key engineering technical problems, i. e., the identification of critical quality attributes (CQA) in the manufacture of TCM, the quality by design (QbD) and product development of the manufacturing process of TCM, the quality transfer principle and multivariate process capability index of TCM manufacturing, and the development of measurement technology and equipment of the manufacturing measurement of TCM, to achieve the systematization of quality control indicators, real-time process control, digitalization of manufacturing process, transparency of quality transfer, and intelligent whole-process control. In this paper, the new concepts, new theories, and new technologies provide a reference for the industrialization of TCM.","Wu, Zhi Sheng;Qiao, Yan Jiang;Xiao, Wei;Wang, Qi",Journal,Zhongguo Zhongyao Zazhi,2023-06-01,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China;State Key Laboratory of New-tech for Chinese Medicine Pharmaceutical Process,critical quality attributes ;  manufacturing measurement of traditional Chinese medicine ;  quality by design ;  quality transfer ;  whole-process quality control
The role of intermediaries in nurturing innovation ecosystems: a case study of Singapore's manufacturing sector,"Hitherto marginalized in the extant innovation studies is the role of intermediaries in innovation ecosystems, which require greater coordination and orchestration between manifold organizations. We conduct qualitative research on the Precision Engineering Centre of Innovation to understand how this government-affiliated intermediary in Singapore takes the initiative in shaping an innovation ecosystem through which local/foreign precision engineering firms, government agencies, and multinational corporations harmoniously co-develop advanced manufacturing capabilities. By analyzing the qualitative data through the theoretical lenses of innovation ecosystem and intermediary, our findings reveal that intermediaries nurture ecosystems in four major steps: (1) developing the ecosystem vision, (2) forming the ecosystem community, (3) orchestrating the ecosystem resources, and (4) materializing the new value proposition. Based on this process model, the implications for innovation intermediary research, innovation ecosystem studies, and innovation policy are discussed. © 2022 The Author(s).

Engineering Vascular Bioreactor Systems to Closely Mimic Physiological Forces In Vitro,"In vitro models of the vasculature play an important role in biomedical discovery research, with diverse applications in vascular biology, drug discovery, and tissue engineering. These models aim to replicate the conditions of the human vasculature including physical geometry, employing appropriate vascular cells exposed to physiological forces. However, vessel biology is complex, with multiple relevant cell types, precise three-dimensional (3D) architectural arrangement, an array of biological cues and pressure, flow rate, and shear stress stimulation that are difficult to replicate outside of the body. Vessel bioreactors typically comprise core modules, common to most systems: a 3D tubular scaffold to support cells, media and nutrient exchange for cell viability, a pumping module, and sensor arrays for monitoring. In our comprehensive review of the literature, foundational elements such as maintenance of cell viability, nutrient exchange with flow, use of 3D scaffolds, and basic sensing capabilities are well established. However, most bioreactor systems fail to adequately replicate combinations of physiologically relevant stimuli - including pressure, shear stress, and flow rate - independently, as system input parameters. At the root of this deficiency is the field's reliance on simple pumping systems designed for other applications, making it necessary to add resistors and compliance chambers to even approach human vascular conditions. As vascular biology research rapidly progressed it became increasingly clear that combinations of physical forces strongly influence cell phenotype, gene expression, and in turn can be drivers of pathology. We highlight the need for renewed innovation in vascular bioreactor development with a focus on the importance of providing appropriate physiological forces in the same system. In vitro systems modeling aspects of the human vasculature are increasingly important in tissue engineering and biomedical research. Current systems maintain basic cell viability and facilitate nutrient exchange but poorly replicate physiological forces, reliant on simplistic pumping systems. Our review highlights the need to more accurately mimic arterial pressure, flow rate, and shear stress in the same system. Innovation in this area would improve in vitro modeling of the vasculature, significantly impacting tissue engineering and vascular biology in this area.","Mitchell, Timothy C.;Feng, Nicolas L.;Lam, Yuen Ting;Michael, Praveesuda L.;Santos, Miguel;Wise, Steven G.",Journal,Tissue Engineering - Part B: Reviews,2023-06-01,The University of Sydney;Faculty of Medicine and Health,bioreactor ;  cardiovascular ;  physiological forces ;  vascular biology
"Circular business model, technology innovation and performance: A strategic-based theoretical framework in the Indonesian energy transition","Along with the popularity of the environment, social and governance (ESG) concerns, the circular economy concept has gained tremendous attraction from the industries, policy makers and academicians. On a firm level, this is implemented through the so-called Circular Business Model (CBM), which is seen through various initiatives. This includes firms in the energy industry, who are transitioning from conventional to renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, despite of the importance and the omnipresence of the practice, there is still lack of empirical research within the CBM topic. In particular, empirical research combining the CBM and technological innovation topic within energy industry (as technology-intensive and high risk industry) in developing country such as Indonesia, is still lacking. To answer this gap, using literature review as research method, this paper has arrived into the following propositions as main result; (1) there is a positive relationship between firm's level of CBM and technology innovation adoption to firm's performance, where (2) the two antecedents that are positively impacting firm's level of CBM and technology innovation adoption are leader's innovativeness and perceived level of technology. For academicians, this research is expected to provide contribution to the energy transition literatures within CBM and technology innovation adoption topic. Propositions provided in this paper is expected to serve as valuable basis in conducting further empirical research. For practitioners, this research is expected to provide valuable insights to make improvements and/or innovations in terms of business model, technology adoption, and strategy. At last, this research is expected to support energy transition.","Sumarsono, Nareswari;Kasali, Rhenald;Ezni Balqiah, T.",Journal,Renewable Energy Focus,2023-06-01,Universitas Indonesia;Professor at FEB UI;Lecturer at FEB UI,CBM ;  Energy transition ;  Leader's innovativeness ;  Renewable energy ;  Technology innovation

Recent advances in photocatalytic removal of sulfonamide pollutants from waste water by semiconductor heterojunctions: a review,"The continuous proliferation of antibiotics in the environment has led to tremendous growth of multiresistant bacteria. This has increased the interest in sustainable solutions for their degradation and mineralization. Historically, the sulfonamide antibiotics have been employed for longest for treatment of bacterial and protozoan infections and are considered as the first systemically used antibiotics. These are poorly biodegradable which leads to bioaccumulation, biomagnification and increasing the antibiotic resistance of bacteria in marine ecosystems. The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have received highest attention for degradation of antibiotics owing to strong oxidation capability and mineralization capacity. Among photocatalysts, semiconductor heterojunctions as Z-scheme and S-scheme heterojunctions have been most effective owing to high charge carrier separation, better charge transfer and superior photo-redox potential. This review focuses on high performance photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of various sulfonamide antibiotics using heterojunction photocatalysts. The heterojunction properties, band structures and thermodynamic feasibilities of reactive oxygen species are also explained. The review also presents the degradation routes, intermediates and most probable reactions involved during their mineralization of sulfonamide antibiotics. Very few review reports on sulfonamide antibiotics removal have been summarized with more focus on biodegradation and adsorption only. However, this review presents in-depth discussion on relationship of photocatalytic heterojunctions and sulfonamides degradation mechanism and pathways. This review also critically analyzes the insights of heterojunctions band structure and band match transformation for achieving maximum and hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. The ecotoxicity or biotoxicity of degradation intermediates is also discussed in detail. Finally, future outlook viewpoints and proposed research directions to provide deep insights into improved mineralization and biotoxicity by innovations in designing of novel heterojunctions and reaction engineering are critically discussed.","Rana, S.;Kumar, A.;Dhiman, P.;Mola, G.

Towards green recovery: Natural resources utilization efficiency under the impact of environmental information disclosure,"Improving natural resources utilization efficiency (NRUE) is essential in order to realize green recovery and achieve sustainable development. This paper estimates NRUE based on the slacks-based measure (SBM) model and evaluates the impact of environmental information disclosure (EID) on NRUE using the data of 113 pilot cities from 2008 to 2018. Results are as follows: (1) EID has an inverted U-shaped impact on NRUE, thus achieving green recovery. This conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. (2) The inverted U-shaped impact is more effective in regions with high levels, respectively, of green finance development, government environmental attention and natural resources abundance. (3) The impact is through mechanisms of green technology innovation and industrial green transformation. (4) The impact still appears inverted U-shaped considering spatial effects. The findings simultaneously broaden and deepen the research fields in green recovery and NRUE, serving as a reference for policy adjustments and decisions.","Zhao, Xing;Guo, Yifan;Feng, Tianchu",Journal,Resources Policy,2023-06-01,Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University;Nanjing Normal University,Environmental information disclosure ;  Green recovery ;  Green technology innovation ;  Industrial green transformation ;  Natural resources utilization efficiency
Ionic Liquids and Deep-Eutectic Solvents in Extractive Metallurgy: Mismatch Between Academic Research and Industrial Applicability,"The past 10–20 years have seen numerous academic papers describing the benefits of ionic liquids (ILs) and deep-eutectic solvents (DESs) for leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning. The scientific community—including the authors of this opinion article—have frequently proclaimed these neoteric solvents as game-changers in extractive metallurgy. Despite this, there have been no commercial breakthroughs. In this paper we reflect on the reasons why ILs and DESs seem to have failed to impact on the metallurgical industry. These include: (1) issues with high viscosity; (2) limited chemical stability under the conditions of metallurgical processes; (3) difficulties with recycling and reuse; (4) a lack of demonstrated unit processes and flowsheets on the pilot scale; (5) insufficient material-property data available for engineering purposes; (6) the administrative burden of obtaining licenses and safety permits; (7) very high costs for large-scale operations; and (8) minimal added value compared to state-of-the-art hydrometallurgical processes. Our belief is that innovations in hydrometallurgy based on ILs or DESs are unlikely. Instead, we should be aiming for a deeper understanding of hydrometallurgical processes at the molecular level. This is because advances are more likely to derive from the refocused efforts of experienced IL/DES researchers investigating the speciation and chemical thermodynamics of hydrometallurgical solutions, which will then hasten the transition from linear to low-energy-input, circular hydrometallurgy.

Graphene oxide produced from spent coffee grounds in electrospun cellulose acetate scaffolds for tissue engineering applications,"Biomaterials are widely used in the field of tissue engineering as coatings, scaffolds, or injectables. Since these materials need to be compatible with the biological conditions of the human body, improving the sources and methods of production for biomaterials call for continuous innovation. In this study, fibers were electrospun from cellulose acetate (CA) polymer solution using graphene oxide (GO) as a filler, for bone tissue engineering applications. The GO was synthesized from spent coffee grounds, a carbonaceous source that is discarded abundantly. A non-energy-intensive methodology was used for the production. CA with 5 wt% of GO nanoparticles was dissolved in a dimethylacetamide and acetone solvent mixture to produce the polymer solution. The nanofibrous scaffolds were tested for their morphological and mechanical properties as well as their biocompatibility. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that electrospinning produced smooth nanofibers with very few beads. Fiber diameters decreased with the addition of GO nanoparticles. Mechanical testing showed that modified CA scaffolds exhibited an improved tensile strength of 115.75 kPa on average compared to the pristine ones. In addition, a cell culture study revealed that using graphene oxide as a modifier of the matrix is non-toxic and promoted cell growth. The oxygen-rich and hydrophilic nature of GO played a role in the biocompatibility of the produced fibers. In general, this study showed that agro-residual biomass can be used to produce and modify biomaterials. This aspect contributes to research on sustainable bio-composites and the effort in environmental conservation.","Challa, Adam Aberra;Saha, Nabanita;Szewczyk, Piotr K.;Karbowniczek, Joanna E.;Stachewicz, Urszula;Ngwabebhoh, Fahanwi Asabuwa;Saha, Petr",Journal,Materials Today Communications,2023-06-01,AGH University of Krakow;Tomas Bata University in Zlin,Biomass ;  Electrospinning ;  Graphene oxide ;  Nanofibrous scaffolds ;  Tissue engineering
Extensible and swellable hydrogel-forming microneedles for deep point-of-care sampling and drug deployment,"Microneedles are considered to be an effective, convenient, non-invasive, biosafety and compliant medical technology for vaccinations, biomarker testing, medical aesthetics and other related fields. Nonetheless, further clinical and commercial translation of regular microneedles is hampered by challenges in manufacturability, cost variability, insufficient comfort, contamination and so on. Recent innovations in functional biomaterials and chemical engineering technologies have been applied to develop extensible and swellable hydrogel-forming microneedles, achieving precise and controlled drug delivery and localized sampling from the target tissues. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest development of the extensible and swellable hydrogel-forming microneedles, including deep point-of-care testing, drug deployment, wound healing and mucoadhesion improvement. In addition, further analysis of the challenges and prospects for clinical application of current strategies is well presented.

The findings suggest: (1) the technological developments of BDIT may involve technological integration (i.e., integration of blockchain and internet of thing/building information modeling/edge computing) and knowledge framework; and (2) the technological applications of BDIT may involve information automation management and building information management. To further explore the trends of BDIT, some future evolutions (i.e., integration of blockchain and federated learning/digital twin/cloud-edge-end), application scenarios and challenges of BDIT were discussed.

From technology enablers to circular economy: Data-driven understanding of the overview of servitization and product–service systems in Industry 4.0,"Product-based companies worldwide attempt to integrate services into their offerings, embarking on “servitization” as a key strategy. These days, the acceleration of technological innovation (i.e., Industry 4.0) has triggered an emerging IT-driven business paradigm called digital servitization or smart product-service system (PSS) that embeds Industry 4.0 technologies. As a result of these developments, related literature has expanded across different disciplines in recent years. However, understanding and describing literature is not easy considering its volume and variety. Establishing common ground for central concepts is essential for science. Thus, to clarify important topics and research issues on servitization and PSSs in Industry 4.0, we carry out a comprehensive literature review by performing text mining of 419 journal articles. A machine learning approach is applied to learn and identify the specific topics, and the suggested key references are manually reviewed to develop a state-of-the-art overview. A total of 10 key research topics are identified, and the enabler–engineering–goal framework is developed.

In this context, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of GTI, ET, REN, TO and GDP on the EFP in Italy during the period 1994–2019. We employ a novel dynamic simulated ARDL (DYARDL) model to evaluate the short and long-run run connections among the above variables. Our study also utilizes the frequency domain causality (FDC) test to analyze the direction of causality. The results of the study clearly indicate the existence of a long-term cointegration among variables. Further, the results demonstrate that GTI, ET, and REN significantly enhance the quality of the environment by lowering the EFP. However, TO and GDP have a positive significant influence on EFP and degrades the environment. Finally, FDC test results also confirmed that GTI, ET, REN, TR, and GDP granger cause EFP. The results obtained suggest that government and policy makers should promote the investment in green innovation and renewable energy sectors to accomplish the ecological sustainability.","Javed, Aamir;Rapposelli, Agnese;Khan, Feroz;Javed, Asif",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2023-06-01,University of G. d'Annunzio Chieti and Pescara,Dynamic ARDL ;  Ecological footprint ;  Environmental taxes ;  Green technology innovation ;  Renewable energy consumption
"Top management team characteristics, technological innovation and firm's greenwashing: Evidence from China's heavy-polluting industries","Greenwashing has become an important strategy for firms to cope with the huge pressure brought by environmental sustainability and win environmental legitimacy. Based on the upper echelon theory and legitimacy theory, this study uses the grounded theory research method to develop the scale of firm's degree of greenwashing specialized with Chinese characteristics, and empirically tests the relationships among top management team (TMT) characteristics, technological innovation, and firm's greenwashing. The results show that TMT education level has a significantly negative effect on firm's greenwashing, while TMT functional background diversity has a significantly positive effect on firm's greenwashing. Technological innovation has a significantly negative impact on firm's greenwashing, and significantly moderates the relationships between TMT age and firm's greenwashing and between TMT functional background diversity and firm's greenwashing, respectively. Our findings provide references for managers and policy makers to understand the influence of TMT characteristics on firm's greenwashing as well as the effective weakening effect of technological innovation on firm's greenwashing.","Zhang, Wei;Qin, Chu;Zhang, Wenyao",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2023-06-01,Sichuan University;Qilu University of Technology,Firm's greenwashing ;  Legitimacy theory ;  Technological innovation ;  TMT characteristics ;  Upper echelon theory
Work curiosity and R&D professionals’ creative performance: Scientists vs. engineers,"Curiosity embodies individual motivation to explore the unknown to either seek the pleasant experience of cognitive stimulation or eliminating the unpleasant feelings of ignorance. Drawing upon the regulatory focus theory, this paper investigates how work curiosity affects professional employees' creativity for improvement and creativity for innovation through the intervening role of creative process engagement. We used structural equation modeling to test our hypothesized framework with a sample of 372 R&D personnel, in-house scientists, and middle managers of R&D divisions, together with archival patent data from knowledge-intensive industries. The findings reveal that work curiosity influences R&D professionals' creativity by regulating their creative process engagement. More interestingly, the results suggest that research type (engineering/technology development vs. scientific discoveries) moderates the mediating effects of creative process engagement in the curiosity-creativity nexus. We leverage insights from psychology research to explore the motivational mechanisms that awaken professional employees' willingness to engage in cognitive activities for creative ideation, which can yield innovative solutions and profitable ideas.","Chang, Yu Yu;Shih, Hui Yu;Lin, Bou‐Wen W.",Journal,Technovation,2023-06-01,National Tsing Hua University;National Cheng Kung University;National Taiwan University,Creative process engagement ;  Creativity for improvement ;  Creativity for innovation ;  Scientist-engineer dichotomy ;  Work curiosity
Influences of the ongoing digital transformation of the Chinese Economy on innovation of sustainable green technologies,"Green technology innovation (GI) is a key factor in reconciling environmental protection with sustainable economic development. Routinely, GI in private companies have been delayed due to suspicious of pitfalls investments, which result in low return rates. Nevertheless, the digital transformation of Nations' Economies (DE) might be sustainably sound in terms of natural resources demands and environmental pollution. Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Enterprises (ECEPEs) database was analyzed from 2011 to 2019 at the municipality level to measure the effect and influence of DE on GI in Chinese ECEPEs. The results suggest that DE has a significant positive influence on GI of ECEPEs. Moreover, the influencing mechanism statistical tests reveal that DE can promote GI of ECEPEs by improving internal controls and financing opportunities. Heterogeneous statistical analysis, however, indicates that the promotion of DE on GI might be constrained over the country. In general, DE can promote both high- and low-quality GI but preferably the latter.","Chen, Xiaohong;Zhou, Pu;Hu, Dongbin",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2023-06-01,Hunan University of Technology and Business;Central South University,Circular economy ;  Digital transformation ;  Green technology ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability
Recent advancement and applications of biochar technology as a multifunctional component towards sustainable environment,"Biochar is a rich carbon source formed through biomass's thermal decomposition. Biomass-derived biochar is gaining traction in a variety of industries to alleviate the most pressing environmental problems effectively. Biochar development utilizing biomass is generating tremendous attention as a low-cost amendment because of its multiple benefits for urban science, engineering, and the environment and its capability to trap carbon in the soil. Recently, there has been a shortage of specific data connecting biochar applications for environmental development and scientific research in climate change. This article analytically assesses reported studies and examines biochar's role in hydrogel-biochar composite technology, nanotechnology, hazardous pesticide detoxification, and as a nutrient source and a catalyst for various chemical reactions. Biochar's application in modern technological advancements and innovation has a discernible effect on renewable energy and activated carbon production. There is also a discussion of the scientific findings for biochar's capacity to improve agricultural physiology and alleviate salt plant growth and development and its function in promoting animal growth. In summary, biochar has a vast number of possible uses in environmental reduction, and the mechanism by which its performances should be further investigated. Thus, incorporating biochar into the environment appears to be a 'bonus' approach for urban science and engineering technology.","Amalina, Farah;Krishnan, Santhana;Zularisam, A.

Towards understanding the influence of personality and team behaviors on requirements engineering activities,"Requirements engineers play an important role in the development of software products and services. The nature of requirements engineering (RE) is multifaceted and influences the quality, success, or failure of software products. In gathering software requirements, engineers commonly work in a team, particularly when dealing with the customers or modeling the requirements, hence the team behavior may influence the RE activities. The investigation of requirements engineers’ personality and their team behavior associated with RE activities is still an open area in which research is still developing. This study aims to investigate the personality and team behavior of requirements engineers involved in RE activities using a systematic literature review approach. We included 64 primary studies that addressed the association between personality and team behavior of requirements engineers on the effectiveness of RE activities. The result shows that among personality dimensions, extraversion and conscientiousness were found to be the predominant personality traits that positively affect RE activities. Furthermore, team behavior of requirements engineers such as flexibility, collaboration, creativity, innovation, and norms were discovered as factors that influence the RE process, performance, and success. The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge and practice of RE by providing empirical evidence on the influence of requirements engineers’ personality and team behavior on the effectiveness of RE activities.","Salleh, Norsaremah;Ya’u, Badamasi Imam;Nordin, Azlin",Journal,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,2023-06-01,International Islamic University Malaysia;Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University,Personality ;  Requirements engineers ;  Systematic review ;  Team behavior
Decision Support for Flexible Manufacturing Systems: Application of the Cognitive Systems Engineering and Ecological Interface Design Approach,"We applied the cognitive systems engineering (CSE)/ecological interface design (EID) approach to the work domain of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). Work domain analyses (WDA) and activity analyses were conducted. Previous concerns regarding the suitability of CSE for FMS are addressed. Principles of EID (i.e., direct perception, direct manipulation, and visual momentum) were applied in designing an ecological interface for a flexible manufacturing system (EcoFlex). The critical links between the products of a WDA and the content of an ecological interface (a key innovation of EID) are made explicit. The evaluations of this interface were very positive across a wide variety of traditional and novel dependent variables (please see the companion manuscript). The overall success of this research program clearly demonstrates that the CSE/EID approach is capable of being applied to FMS. Contributions of this manuscript include both theoretical insights (defining properties of the FMS work domain, concrete examples of the principles of EID, critical links between CSE and EID, resolution of concerns about the overall framework) and practical applications (specific design solutions for FMS and similar work domains, and successful examples of the CSE/EID approach which can be studied and leveraged by students).","Bennett, Kevin B.;Edman, Christopher;Cravens, Dylan;Jackson, Natalie",Journal,Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making,2023-06-01,Wright State University,cognitive systems engineering ;  decision support ;  direct manipulation ;  direct perception ;  discrete manufacturing ;  distributed supervisory control systems ;  ecological interface design ;  flexible manufacturing systems ;  visual displays ;  visual momentum
The economics and policy of genome editing in crop improvement,"In this review article we analyze the economics of genome editing and its potential long-term effect on crop improvement and agriculture. We describe the emergence of genome editing as a novel platform for crop improvement, distinct from the existing platforms of plant breeding and genetic engineering. We review key technical characteristics of genome editing and describe how it enables faster trait development, lower research and development costs, and the development of novel traits not possible through previous crop improvement methods. Given these fundamental technical and economic advantages, we describe how genome editing can greatly increase the productivity and broaden the scope of crop improvement with potential outsized economic effects. We further discuss how the global regulatory policy environment, which is still emerging, can shape the ultimate path of genome editing innovation, its effect on crop improvement, and its overall socioeconomic benefits to society.","Kalaitzandonakes, Nicholas;Willig, Christopher;Zahringer, Kenneth",Journal,Plant Genome,2023-06-01,Oregon State University;University of Missouri,
Multi-functional engineered polypeptide-based drug delivery systems for improved cancer therapy,"With the rapid development of chemical engineering and biotechnology, polypeptide, as a promising candidate in the biomedical field, has been thoroughly investigated and extensively used as the drug delivery vehicle for diseases treatment, especially cancer, owing to the high biocompatibility, good biodegradability, versatile constructions, and diverse functions. Engineered polypeptide-based drug delivery system (so-called EPP-DDS) can deliver the cargos to the target site via a specific recognition effect, followed by overcoming the barriers like blood brain barrier (BBB) and releasing them by responding to the microenvironment cues, to improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the side-effect. Herein, it's of great importance to conclude and summarize the updates on EPP-DDS developed by chemical engineering methods. In this review, we first summarized the recent updates in the manufacturing of polypeptide and preparation of EPP-DDS based on green biochemical engineering and/or synthetic processes for cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), gene therapy, and combination therapy. Then, we surveyed the research progress of inflammation-mediated cancer treatment strategies based on EPP-DDS with high anti-inflammation activity. Finally, we concluded the discovery and green production process of engineered polypeptide, challenges, and perspectives of EPP-DDS. Overall, the EPP-DDS has great potential for cancer therapy in the clinic with improved therapeutic efficacy and reduced adverse effect, which needs the innovation of green biochemical engineering for customized design and production of polypeptides.","Li, Xiaobin;Liu, Junyu;Chen, Haihong;Chen, Yaxin;Wang, Yi;Zhang, Can Yang;Xing, Xin Hui",Journal,Green Chemical Engineering,2023-06-01,Shenzhen Bay Laboratory;Tsinghua University;MOE Key Laboratory for Industrial Biocatalysis,Biopharmaceutics ;  Cancer therapy ;  Drug delivery system ;  Green biochemical engineering ;  Polypeptide
"New plant engineering techniques, R&D investment and international trade","New plant engineering techniques (NPETs) may significantly improve both production and quality of foods. Some consumers and regulators around the world might be reluctant to accept such products and the global market penetration of these products may remain low. We develop a parsimonious economic model for R&D investment in food innovations to identify conditions under which NPET technology emerges in the context of international trade. The framework integrates consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the new food, the uncertainty of R&D processes, the associated regulatory cost of approval, and the competition between domestic and foreign products. With generic applicability, the model enables the quantitative analysis of new foods that could be introduced in markets and then traded across borders. We apply the framework to a hypothetical case of apples improved with NPETs. Simulation results suggest that import bans and high values of sunk cost can reduce R&D investment in NPETs to suboptimal levels.","Marette, Stéphan;Disdier, Anne Célia;Bodnar, Anastasia;Beghin, John",Journal,Journal of Agricultural Economics,2023-06-01,Paris-Saclay Applied Economics;Ecole d’Économie de Paris;United States Department of Agriculture;University of Nebraska–Lincoln,apple ;  food innovation ;  genome editing ;  new plant engineering techniques ;  trade ;  willingness to pay
Maturity Model for Innovation Project Management in Industrial Enterprises: A Case Study of the Aerospace Sector in Brazil,"Enterprises around the world face significant challenges in an increasingly competitive and global economy. Given this scenario companies' survival depends on their ability to stay ahead in their markets and innovation is considered a pressing need, the key resource for achieving sustainable competitive advantage. Innovations, product and technology development, are transformed into reality through projects and are affected by the management model and the practice adopted in order to be decisive and support the achievement of the organization's goals. In this way, this paper proposed a conceptual maturity model which was developed for innovation project management through qualitative approach, interviews; and then, through quantitative research involving 162 specialists and project managers who work with innovations from many sectors subsequently, the concept's applicability was evaluated in the real environment of aerospace enterprises in the Brazilian ecosystem.","Honorato, Cezar;De Melo, Francisco Cristóvão",Journal,Journal of Industrial Integration and Management,2023-06-01,Science and Technologies;Technological Institute of Aeronautics,aerospace ;  industry ;  Innovation projects ;  maturity model ;  readiness ;  technology
An Exploratory Study of Engineering Graduate Student Persistence: Self-Efficacy and Contextual Influences,"Women and U.S. racial/ethnic minority students are underrepresented in engineering graduate education and engineering practice. Demographic homogeneity in engineering research teams can negatively affect individuals, innovation, and research outcomes. Thus, it is important to explore factors that influence student intentions to complete engineering degrees, particularly for groups historically underrepresented in engineering. Social Cognitive Career Theory guided the development of new items to evaluate self-efficacy, feeling welcome and included, relationship with principal investigator, and research group environment. Results with 295 engineering graduate students found that female sex, engineering self-efficacy, and feeling welcome and included were independently positively associated with commitment to complete an engineering degree. Feeling welcome and included operated 30% through self-efficacy and 70% directly. The effects of female sex were unmediated by self-efficacy. Results suggest that proximal and distal contextual factors may operate independently from self-efficacy to influence retention in graduate engineering programs.","Fitzpatrick, Mary E.;Burrows, Stephanie G.;Yonker, James A.",Journal,Journal of Career Development,2023-06-01,UW-Madison College of Engineering;University of Wisconsin-Madison;University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,educational choice ;  engineering ;  graduate students ;  race/ethnicity ;  sex ;  social-cognitive career theory
Towards a model for determining patent revenue odds: An empirical study of technology transfer offices,"Technology transfer offices (TTO) were created with the mission of executing innovation policy and its technology transfer to industry. Most studies regarding TTO focus on the context of developed countries, so there is a lack of research on the subject in emerging economies, such as Brazil. In addition, the issue of how diverse the skills of the team of a given TTO should be for their best revenue performance is still little addressed. In this sense, the present study aims to identify which characteristics of the TTO, related to their human resources, influence obtaining revenue from the patents that constitute their portfolios. To achieve this objective, 272 TTO in Brazil were analysed with the help of the Logistic Regression technique, based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation. A remarkable conclusion that emerges from our results is that the universities to increase their revenue must invest in full-time employees (e.g., rather than in scholarship students, as tends to be the norm) and foster the inventions' communications, as well as to attract and retain employees with skills directly related to knowledge fields such as Law, Engineering, and Communication (quite surprisingly, Management and Economics graduates are not included). The combination of these factors can increase the probabilities or odds of a given TTO obtaining revenue. Thus, our results contribute to TTO human resource practices, especially those in structuring stages, such as those in Brazil and Latin American countries.","Leite, Rafael Angelo Santos;Walter, Cicero Eduardo;Reis, Igor Bezerra;de Sousa, Pedro Elias Figueredo;de Aragão, Iracema Machado;Au-Yong-Oliveira, Manuel",Journal,Expert Systems,2023-06-01,"GOVCOPP – Research Unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policies;Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Piauí – IFPI;Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science;Université Fédérale de Sergipe",human resource ;  intellectual property ;  revenue ;  technology transfer offices ;  university-industry technology transfer processes
"Environmental impact of fiscal decentralization, green technology innovation and institution’s efficiency in developed countries using advance panel modelling","The debate regarding mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions and fiscal decentralization has gained extreme attention, but only a little evidence supports this issue. Therefore, this study adopts fiscal decentralization, green technology innovation, and institutional efficiency that reduce environmental degradation and help to create a sustainable environment in seventeen developed countries. This study applies a novel Methods of Moment's Quantiles Regression (MMQR) which helps to deal with asymmetricity, structural change and non-normality. The overall results exhibit emissions mitigating effect of fiscal decentralization, green technology innovation and institutional efficiency. However, the emissions mitigating effects of fiscal decentralization is the lowest for lower quantiles and the highest for higher emissions quantiles. In contrast, emission reduction effect of green technology innovation and institutional efficiency is higher for lowest quantiles and lower for highest quantiles. These results confirm the asymmetric effect of fiscal decentralization, green technology innovation, and institutional efficiency on carbon emissions, and validating that their effect is not alike across all distribution, rather significantly varied at lower, medium, and higher quantiles. These results offer valuable suggestions to improve the environmental sustainability.","Wang, Feng;Rani, Tayyaba;Razzaq, Asif",Journal,Energy and Environment,2023-06-01,Ilma University;Xi'an Jiaotong University;Dalian University of Technology,Environmental sustainability ;  green innovation ;  MMQR ;  STIRPAT model
Developing a Framework for Mobile Learning Adoption and Sustainable Development,"Learning innovation for future education often includes digital approaches to enhance learning and to contribute to the development of twenty-first-century skills. There is evidence that mobile learning provides positive outcomes. However, there is a recognized lack of research in the field of frameworks and models that contributes to highlighting mobile learning rewards. This study aims to investigate the main characteristics of a strategic framework for the adaption and sustainable use of mobile learning. This study is based on a systematic review of 15 investigations published between 2009 and 2018. An adaptation of the strategic management framework by Jauch and Glueck (Business policy and strategic management, McGraw-Hill, London, 1988) was developed to show the results. The framework has a pedagogical foundation. Leaders, teachers, learners, families, and community members are identified as the key pillars upholding and maximizing mobile learning. The proposed framework is envisaged to serve as a guide for the educational community in implementing sustainable mobile learning.","Moya, Sofia;Camacho, Mar",Journal,"Technology, Knowledge and Learning",2023-06-01,Universitat Rovira i Virgili,Change management ;  Learning development ;  Learning processes ;  Learning technology ;  Technology usage
The Role of Supporting Factors on Patenting Activities in Emerging Entrepreneurial Universities,"Academic patenting has become an important part of the university-industry collaboration and technology transfer but few studies have investigated the institutional frameworks and organizational incentive and support structures in terms of patenting activity. This article, therefore, seeks to fill this gap by examining institutional and infrastructure supporting factors and the impact that they have on university patenting within an emerging economy higher education system, namely Turkey. The analyses use logit regression to test a set of hypotheses on a large-scale sample of Turkish universities. The findings highlight the positive role of supporting factors on a university's patenting performance, acting complementarily to the role of Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs). This article will be a guide for managers and practitioners to use supporting factors complementing the activities of TTOs in emerging economies in increasing patent applications.

Modernity and trends of development of automobile engineering,"Advantages of light-optical devices (LEDs) were investigated in the article. Based on the research, special attention is paid to the prospects of development of led headlights. Complicacy of car electrical equipment leads to increase of indicated efficiency and energy storage capacity and electric generators, yield increase, decrease of labor intensity maintenance operation and reconstruction. On the other hand, innovations in scientific-technological progress in electronic engineering sphere lead to rise in reluctances, so more than 30% of these reluctances account for electrical equipment. Analysis of current requirements to automobile components of lighting devices has been carried out. LEDs as automobile light sources are gaining rapid popularity. Currently, LEDs are widely used as internal light sources (instrument illumination, indicator lamps) and external ones (tail lights, additional brake lights, daytime running lights). Since 2007, white LEDs have been used as dipped- and main-beam sources. Light sources are characterized by such parameters as voltage, light power and luminous power. Derivative of these parameters is the luminous efficiency (luminous power per unit of light power), that acts as a kind of lamp' s performance and economy indicator.

The influence of dual credit policy on new energy vehicle technology innovation under demand forecast information asymmetry,"New energy vehicles (NEVs) have become an effective way to solve environmental pollution and energy shortages in transportation. Therefore, China has issued Regulations on Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle Credits for Passenger Vehicle Enterprises(dual credit policy), to promote the development of NEVs. This paper establishes a technological innovation decision-making model under the conditions of information asymmetry and information sharing. This model obtains the optimal solution for NEV technology innovation considering the market demand prediction of the manufacturer and supplier. Moreover, this paper provides the conditions for information sharing of demand forecasting for the manufacturer and supplier and designs the incentive mechanism for information sharing. The results show that the dual credit policy positively stimulates the technological innovation of NEVs, but information asymmetry negatively affects the dual credit policy's incentive effect. The supplier is always willing to share information; however, whether the manufacturer shares information depends on the supplier's technology innovation cost coefficient. In addition, implementing the dual credit policy enhances the manufacturer's and supplier's willingness to share information; the higher the credit coefficient of technological innovation and the credit price is, the stronger the manufacturer and supplier's willingness to share information.","Ma, Miaomiao;Meng, Weidong;Huang, Bo;Li, Yuyu",Journal,Energy,2023-05-15,Chongqing University;Chongqing Normal University,Demand forecast information ;  Dual credit policy ;  Information asymmetry ;  New energy vehicles ;  Technological innovation

Evaluation of green low-carbon innovation development efficiency: An improved two-stage non-cooperative DEA model,"Scientific evaluation for the efficiency of green low-carbon innovative development (GLID) has great significance for promoting sustainable development (SD). The connotation and composition of GLID were first analyzed, and GLID was regarded as a two-stage complex system, in which multi-input coexists with multi-output. Based on the existing methods, an improved two-stage non-cooperative data envelopment analysis (ITNDEA) is further proposed to measure GLID efficiency by taking 30 Chinese provinces in 2020 as cases, and the results are finally compared with that by two-stage data envelopment analysis (TDEA) and two-stage non-cooperative data envelopment analysis (TNDEA). The results show that: (1) ITNDEA effectively avoids the efficiency being overestimated or underestimated and can obtain a more objective and reasonable efficiency value than TDEA and TNDEA; (2) The main reason of the low GLID efficiency is the imbalance between green technology innovation and carbon emission; (3) Each policy goal has a good effect on efficiency improvement, but the effect of the same policy goal has regional difference; (4) All regions/countries can improve SD level through key breakthrough mode and gradual breakthrough mode. The results provide the government with a new idea and method to formulate SD policies.","Yang, Haidong;Zhang, Xiangle;Liu, Biyu;Huang, Yilin",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-05-10,Fuzhou University,Carbon emission ;  Efficiency evaluation ;  Green technology innovation ;  Sustainable development ;  Two-stage non-cooperative data envelopment analysis
How does environmental regulation affect real green technology innovation and strategic green technology innovation?,"Although green technology is the core competitiveness of sustainable development, it is still crucial to identify whether green technology innovation under environmental constraints is strategic or real. Based on the R&D motivation of innovation subjects, the technical complexity of patents and the value of patents, this paper divides green technology innovation into real green technology innovation (RGTI) and strategic green technology innovation (SGTI). Based on a sample of 284 Chinese cities from 2004 to 2019, this study uses the panel fixed-effects model to analyze the impact and internal mechanisms of environmental regulation (ER) on urban RGTI and SGTI. The results show that a “U-shaped” relationship between ER and SGTI (RGTI); however, SGTI seems more sensitive to real ER. Additionally, high fiscal subsidies and industrial agglomeration are conducive to helping the ER induce RGTI. While under the condition of high foreign direct investment, ER is more likely to induce SGTI. Finally, the impact of ER on SGTI and RGTI is affected by heterogeneous factors, such as geographical location, resource endowment, pollution, and industrial scale. This study provides a theoretical and policy basis for governments to optimize the intensity of ER to facilitate the formation of real green innovations.","Zhang, Ming;Yan, Taihua;Gao, Wen;Xie, Wancheng;Yu, Zhipeng",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2023-05-10,Chongqing University;University of International Business and Economics,Environmental regulation ;  Green technology innovation ;  Quantity and quality ;  Real innovation ;  Strategic innovation

Research on evaluation of development level of digital economy based on combination weighting method and improved VIKOR method,"The digital economy based on the new generation of information technology has increasingly become an important driving force for economic development, and it is of great practical significance to study the evaluation of the development level of the digital economy. On the basis of summarizing the connotation of the digital economy, the evaluation index system of digital economy development level is firstly constructed from four dimensions of digital infrastructure, digital industry, digital application level and digital innovation ability. Secondly, the combination weighting method of CRITIC-entropy method is used to weight the indicators. Thirdly, the evaluation model of digital economy development level based on grey correlation-VIKOR method is constructed, and the relevant data of 30 provinces in China in 2020 are taken as samples for empirical research. The results show that there is significant regional heterogeneity in the development level of digital economy in China. The development level of digital economy in eastern China is much higher than that in western China. The most important factor affecting the development level of China's digital economy is the development of software industry. At the same time, digital innovation ability is also an important index to distinguish the development level of digital economy. Finally, corresponding policy suggestions are put forward in response to the problems in the development of China's digital economy.","Liu, Sijia;Guo, Zixue",Journal,Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems,2023-05-04,Hebei University,combination weighting method ;  Digital economy ;  improved VIKOR method ;  regional economy
The 25-year disruptive path of InP/GaAsSb double heterojunction bipolar transistors,"The year 2022 marks two anniversaries of broadly different significance: the 75th anniversary of the transistor invention, and the 25th since I initiated work on InP/GaAsSb double heterojunction bipolar transistors (DHBTs). Having been asked to provide a personal account of my work with transistors, it is thus fitting that I focus InP/GaAsSb DHBTs. This contribution begins by recounting a student's rather improbable interest in semiconductors due to how the topic was (and continues) to be taught to engineering students. Once interest in heterojunction transistors developed, it proved difficult for me to enter the field. After unexpected career developments led me to return to academia at a young age, I sought an original research topic: I settled on an alternative way to make InP-based DHBTs that would in principle solve many problems encountered when the traditional GaInAs alloy is used as a base layer. The article next describes the phenomenal progress of InP/GaAsSb DHBTs over the last 25 years: from a laboratory oddity in 1997 to a commercial product by 2004; from an unknown heterojunction system to THz transistors and record-breaking mixed-mode integrated circuits by 2022. The importance of human factors and of the good fortune in research is addressed. In closing, I provide remarks on the general nature of the response to disruptive technological innovation.","Bolognesi, Colombo R.",Book,75th Anniversary of the Transistor,2023-05-03,ETH Zürich,Double heterojunction bipolar transistors (DHBTs) ;  GaAsSb ;  InP ;  Mixed-mode integrated circuits
Simulation of vertical load bearing capability of composite sandwich core geometry using AA3003 aluminum properties,"The design of the geometric structure of the core sandwich composite is one of the most valuable aspects in the development of structural engineering innovations in the composite material industry. The sandwich construction provides excellent structural efficiency, that is, with a high strength-to-weight ratio. This paper simulates the effect of the core geometry of a sandwich composite by comparing the mechanical response of hexagonal, triangular, square, and trapezoidal shapes using SAP 2000 software version 14.

"Light outcoupling strategies in oriented perovskite light-emitting-diodes: recent trends, opportunities, and challenges toward innovation","Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit outstanding photophysical properties, such as high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), high exciton binding energy, narrow emission spectrum, tailorable bandgap, and facile solution-processibility. MHPs have opened a scientific revitalization in the light-emitting diode (LED) technology. Tremendous research efforts have been carried out, such as balancing electron-hole injection, modulation of stoichiometric compositions, ligand engineering, and minimal non-radiative recombination that boosted the internal quantum efficiency near unity. However, the lower external quantum efficiency and operational stability of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) than organic LEDs make them limited to display and lighting applications. One of the main reasons is the trapped photons inside the devices, which reduces light outcoupling. This review includes a detailed analysis of existing challenges in managing light outcoupling of PeLEDs and discusses various strategies adopted for these challenges. Control of dipole orientations, refractive index matching, oriented quasi-two-dimensional structures, and thickness optimization are existing methodologies to address the improved light outcoupling in PeLEDs. We discuss a detailed prospect for high-performance PeLEDs for practical applications.","Saleem, Muhammad Imran;Choi, Rino;Lee, Jeong Hwan",Journal,Materials Chemistry Frontiers,2023-05-03,Inha University,

Performability of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Molecular Sequence data,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has appeared as a life-changing innovation in recent years transforming the conventional problem-solving strategies adopted so far. ML and DL-based approaches are making a monumental impact in the fields of life sciences and health care. The tremendous amount of biochemical data has set off leading-edge research in health care and Drug Discovery. Molecular Machine Learning has precisely adopted ML techniques to uncover new insights from biochemical data. Biochemical datasets essentially hold text-based sequential information about molecules in several forms. Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a highly efficient format for representing biochemical data that can be suitably utilized for countless relevant applications. This work presents the SMILES molecular representation in a nutshell and is centered on the major applications of ML and DL in health care especially in the drug discovery process using SMILES. This work utilizes a sequence-to-sequence architecture built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating small drug-like molecules using the benchmark datasets. The experimental results prove that the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based RNNs can be trained to encode the raw SMILES strings with nearly perfect accuracy and to generate similar molecular structures with minimal or no feature engineering. The gradient-based optimization strategy is applied to the network and found distinctly suited to assemble the most stable and proficient sequence model. RNNs can thus be employed in Drug Discovery activities like similarity-based virtual screening, lead compound finding, and hit-to-lead optimization.","Kotkondawar, Roshan R.;Sutar, Sanjay R.;Kiwelekar, Arvind W.;Wankhede, Hansaraj S.",Journal,International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems,2023-05-01,"G.H.

Theoretical and Technical Research Prospects for Intelligent Inspection and Safety Evaluation of Flood Discharge and Energy Dissipation Buildings in High Dam Hubs,"The high dam is an important strategic infrastructure that supports the efficient development of hydropower and the comprehensive utilization of water resources. It continuously and stably provides energy supply and flood control guarantees for economic and social development, generating huge social and economic benefits. There are numerous high dam hubs in the southwest region, including several large and super-large high dam hubs such as the Baihetan, Xiluodu, Jinping First-stage, and Dagangshan. Large unit power generation, large flow flood discharge, and high-speed water flow energy dissipation have become the norm, and the destruction of flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings has become a common key threat to dam safety in high dam hub projects. Regular inspection of the overflow surface damage of flood discharge and energy dissipation structures during the operation period of hydropower hubs has become an important means to grasp their working performance and evaluate the safety status of the structure. With the innovation and development of equipment technology and information technology, relying on underwater robots to carry out intelligent damage detection of hydraulic structures in high dam hubs has become a trend. However, due to the complex and harsh detection conditions such as sandy water bodies and underwater sediment deposition in southwestern rivers, the coupling mechanism between high-speed water flow and flow surface damage is still unclear, and there is a lack of theoretical and technical methods for damage detection and evaluation. The contradiction between the large inspection scope, low inspection efficiency, and poor environmental adaptability also needs to be solved, and the efficiency of damage perception and identification still needs to be improved. There are still many difficulties in efficient and precise inspection and scientific comprehensive evaluation. In response to the significant demand for structural safety during the operation of flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings in the high dam hub, it is necessary to focus on solving three key scientific problems: 1) Damage formation mechanism and evolution law under the coupling effect of high-speed water flow and flow surface; 2) Adaptive inspection theory and methods suitable for complex environments; 3) Mechanism analysis and data-driven fusion of structural safety risk analysis and evaluation theory. The four important research aspects that need to be paid attention to in proposing the intelligent inspection and safety evaluation theory and method for flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings in high dam hubs are as follows: 1) Evolution mechanism of coupled damage on the flow surface under the action of high-speed water flow; 2) Multi-information cognitive mechanism and adaptive inspection methods in complex environments; 3) Intelligent identification and quantification methods for damage characteristics of flood discharge and energy dissipation structures; 4) Structural security analysis and evaluation system for multiple information fusion. Through in-depth research on the theory and methods of intelligent inspection and safety evaluation, this study reveals the formation mechanism and evolution law of damage to the overflow surface of flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings in the southwest mountainous and canyon areas. It breaks through the autonomous intelligent inspection method of flood discharge outlets and water cushion pond structures with strong adaptability in complex environments, develops key technologies for intelligent classification and quantification of damage based on multi-dimensional perception information, and constructs a structural safety analysis and evaluation model that integrates multiple data of ""inspection monitoring simulation"". Taking the Dagangshan Hydropower Station on the Dadu River as a typical case, the application verification of intelligent inspection methods and evaluation models was carried out to support the safe operation, maintenance, and intelligent control of key flood discharge and energy dissipation buildings in the Dagangshan Hydropower Station on the Dadu River Basin. The aim is to provide theoretical and technical methods for the operation safety, damage prevention, and control of high dams. The research results have significant scientific value and guiding significance in ensuring the safety of power generation in cascade hydropower stations and improving the refined management level of hydropower operation and maintenance.","Chen, Yongcan;Wang, Haoran;Li, Yonglong;Liu, Zhigui;Tu, Yangju;Li, Li;Chen, Gang;Ma, Fangping;Xie, Hui",Journal,Gongcheng Kexue Yu Jishu/Advanced Engineering Sciences,2023-05-01,Tsinghua University;Southwest Petroleum University China;Southwest University of Science and Technology;Ltd.,engineering safety ;  flood fischarge and energy dissipation ;  high dams ;  hydraulic simulation ;  intelligent inspection

Estimation of Burden Conveying Limits of Square Footings Laying on Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil Foundations as a Technology Towards Green Buildings,"The purpose of this study is to investigate and quantify the load-carrying capacity of square footings supported by foundations made of geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS). A significant area of research in geotechnical engineering is the estimation of the burden-carrying limits of square feet laying on geosynthetic reinforced soil foundations as a green building technology. This research aims to investigate the load-carrying capacity of square footings supported by geosynthetic reinforced soil foundations, with a particular focus on how these foundations can be used in environmentally friendly building methods. Geosynthetic-supported soil establishments are implicitly reasonable holders. A square footing is set on geosynthetic reinforced soil in a loading frame and compressed. (Group 1: GRS system with 6 cm reinforcement spacing, N = 17; Group 2: GRS system with 4 cm reinforcement spacing). For test size estimation, the pre-test power and certainty spans were set at 80% and 95% separately. The GRS foundation system with 4 cm reinforcement spacing outperforms the GRS foundation system with 6 cm spacing in tests. Closer reinforcement spacing improves square footing bearing capacity. The results of this study will add to upgrading the comprehension of geosynthetic-supported establishment frameworks and their true capacity as an innovation for developing green structures. The discoveries will give significant bits of knowledge to specialists, planners, and development experts in planning feasible and harmless to the ecosystem structures while guaranteeing underlying respectability and security.","Srinadh, K.;Ramalakshmi, M.;Kandasamy, A.",Journal,SSRG International Journal of Civil Engineering,2023-05-01,Saveetha School of Engineering,Bearing capacity ;  Geosynthetics ;  Green building technology ;  GRS retaining walls ;  Loading frame ;  Square footing

Using Nanomaterials for SARS-CoV-2 Sensing via Electrochemical Techniques,"Advancing low-cost and user-friendly innovations to benefit public health is an important task of scientific and engineering research. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), electrochemical sensors are being developed for low-cost SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings. Nanostructures with sizes ranging from 10 nm to a few micrometers could deliver optimum electrochemical behavior (e.g., quick response, compact size, sensitivity and selectivity, and portability), providing an excellent alternative to the existing techniques. Therefore, nanostructures, such as metal, 1D, and 2D materials, have been successfully applied in in vitro and in vivo detection of a wide range of infectious diseases, particularly SARS-CoV-2. Electrochemical detection methods reduce the cost of electrodes, provide analytical ability to detect targets with a wide variety of nanomaterials, and are an essential strategy in biomarker sensing as they can rapidly, sensitively, and selectively detect SARS-CoV-2. The current studies in this area provide fundamental knowledge of electrochemical techniques for future applications.","Tieu, My Van;Le, Hien T.Ngoc;Cho, Sungbo",Journal,Micromachines,2023-05-01,Gachon University,biosensing platform ;  electrochemical detection ;  nanomaterials ;  SARS-CoV-2 ;  virus detection

"The Changing Environment in Postgraduate Education in Orthopedic Surgery and Neurosurgery and Its Impact on Technology-Driven Targeted Interventional and Surgical Pain Management: Perspectives from Europe, Latin America, Asia, and The United States","Personalized care models are dominating modern medicine. These models are rooted in teaching future physicians the skill set to keep up with innovation. In orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery, education is increasingly influenced by augmented reality, simulation, navigation, robotics, and in some cases, artificial intelligence. The postpandemic learning environment has also changed, emphasizing online learning and skill- and competency-based teaching models incorporating clinical and bench-top research. Attempts to improve work–life balance and minimize physician burnout have led to work-hour restrictions in postgraduate training programs. These restrictions have made it particularly challenging for orthopedic and neurosurgery residents to acquire the knowledge and skill set to meet the requirements for certification. The fast-paced flow of information and the rapid implementation of innovation require higher efficiencies in the modern postgraduate training environment. However, what is taught typically lags several years behind. Examples include minimally invasive tissue-sparing techniques through tubular small-bladed retractor systems, robotic and navigation, endoscopic, patient-specific implants made possible by advances in imaging technology and 3D printing, and regenerative strategies. Currently, the traditional roles of mentee and mentor are being redefined. The future orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons involved in personalized surgical pain management will need to be versed in several disciplines ranging from bioengineering, basic research, computer, social and health sciences, clinical study, trial design, public health policy development, and economic accountability. Solutions to the fast-paced innovation cycle in orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery include adaptive learning skills to seize opportunities for innovation with execution and implementation by facilitating translational research and clinical program development across traditional boundaries between clinical and nonclinical specialties. Preparing the future generation of surgeons to have the aptitude to keep up with the rapid technological advances is challenging for postgraduate residency programs and accreditation agencies. However, implementing clinical protocol change when the entrepreneur–investigator surgeon substantiates it with high-grade clinical evidence is at the heart of personalized surgical pain management.","Lewandrowski, Kai Uwe;Elfar, John C.;Li, Zong Ming;Burkhardt, Benedikt W.;Lorio, Morgan P.;Winkler, Peter A.;Oertel, Joachim M.;Telfeian, Albert E.;Dowling, Álvaro;Vargas, Roth A.A.;Ramina, Ricardo;Abraham, Ivo;Assefi, Marjan;Yang, Huilin;Zhang, Xifeng;Ramírez León, Jorge Felipe;Fiorelli, Rossano Kepler Alvim;Pereira, Mauricio G.;de Carvalho, Paulo Sérgio Teixeira;Defino, Helton;Moyano, Jaime;Lim, Kang Taek;Kim, Hyeun Sung;Montemurro, Nicola;Yeung, Anthony;Novellino, Pietro",Journal,Journal of Personalized Medicine,2023-05-01,The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University;Instituto Estadual de Diabetes e Endocrinologia Luiz Capriglione;Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana;Hospital Universitario Gaffree e Guinle;General Hospital of People's Liberation Army;Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin;Universidade de Brasília;University of Arizona College of Medicine – Tucson;The University of North Carolina at Greensboro;Department of Neurosurgery;The University of Arizona;Universidade de São Paulo;Neurological Institute of Curitiba;The Spine Committee of the Ecuadorian Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology (Comité de Columna de la Sociedad Ecuatoriana de Ortopedia y Traumatología);Advanced Orthopaedics;Foundation Hospital Centro Médico Campinas;Pain and Spine Minimally Invasive Surgery Service at Gaffre e Guinle University Hospital;Nanoori Gangnam Hospital;Good Doctor Teun Teun Hospital;Klinik für Neurochirurgie;Hirslanden Klinik;Desert Institute for Spine Care;Center for Advanced Spine Care of Southern Arizona;Fundación Universitaria Sanitas,artificial intelligence ;  augmented reality ;  navigation ;  neurosurgery ;  orthopedic surgery ;  postgraduate residence training ;  robotics ;  simulation ;  skill-based training ;  technology advances

The success of these efforts was measured by research-oriented indicators, the number of participants, and their surveyed opinions. The decisive inclusion of the Internet to facilitate the blended approach has accelerated the boost in human resources and research production. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet played a crucial role in the digital transformation of this research education initiative, leading to effective educative and collaborative experiences in the “New Normal”.","Delgado, Francisco",Journal,Future Internet,2023-05-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,blended learning ;  educational innovation ;  higher education ;  impact on research ;  internet-supported education ;  quantum information education ;  research education
Gene-editing technologies for developing climate resilient rice crops in sub-Saharan Africa: Political priorities and space for responsible innovation,"Over the last 2 decades, rice has become one of the most important staple crops for sub-Saharan Africa. Estimates show that average consumption of rice has tripled over the last 3 decades, from 9.2 million metric tons (Mt) in the early 1990s to 31.5 million Mt in 2018, with West and Central Africa accounting for nearly two-thirds of this share. The demand for rice, however, has placed an enormous economic burden on African countries, whereby they spent over USD 5.5 billion per year on rice imports over the past few years.To address this challenge, over 32 countries have established National Rice Development Strategies to increase local production and to achieve rice self-sufficiency. Several of these countries have shown policy interest to use modern biotechnological advancements, including gene editing, to ensure increases in rice productivity and reduce food imports, in the context of extreme climate vulnerability and acceleration of the effects of biotic and abiotic stresses. This review article examines the role of biotechnology in African countries' efforts to achieve rice self-sufficiency, particularly the potential for genome-editing technologies toward the genetic improvement of rice and to Africa's nascent research programs. This article notes that while gene editing offers important advances in crop breeding, like genetic engineering, it faces some persistent sociopolitical challenges and low societal acceptability. As such, international partnerships advancing genome editing in Africa's rice-subsectors development could benefit from adopting key principles from “responsible research and innovation” to help these projects achieve their potential, while bringing about more inclusive and reflexive processes that strive to anticipate the benefits and limits associated with new biotechnologies as they relate to local contexts. Such an approach could create the necessary political space to test and assess the benefits (and risks) related to adopting gene-editing technologies in Africa's rice sectors.","Shilomboleni, Helena;Ismail, Abdelbagi M.",Journal,Elementa,2023-05-01,University of Waterloo;CGIAR,Climate vulnerability ;  Crop improvement ;  Gene editing ;  Responsible research innovation ;  Rice ;  Sub-Saharan Africa
Research into the Spatiotemporal Characteristics and Influencing Factors of Technological Innovation in China’s Natural Gas Industry from the Perspective of Energy Transition,"Promoting technological innovation in the natural gas industry is a feasible means of achieving energy transition. Guided by the geographic innovation theory, this article carries out research on the scale, technical fields, capabilities, and influencing factors of technological innovation in the natural gas industry of 312 Chinese prefecture-level cities, making use of the cusp catastrophe model, the center of gravity and standard deviational ellipse, exploratory spatial data analysis, and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). The research shows the following: (1) Technological innovation in China’s natural gas industry has continuously expanded in terms of scale, with the number of participating cities increasing, showing a spatially uneven pattern of local agglomeration and national diffusion. (2) There have been significant innovation achievements in natural gas equipment and engineering, but natural gas utilization is lagging in comparison, with drilling, new materials, environmental protection, pipe network engineering, and digital services becoming frontier fields, and collaborative innovation with the thermoelectric, metalworking, automotive, and other related industries having been initially established. (3) The unevenness of technological innovation capabilities is obvious, with the core advantages of Beijing–Tianjin being continuously strengthened and Sichuan–Chongqing, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, Shandong Peninsula, and Liaodong Peninsula forming high-level technological innovation capability agglomerations. (4) The spatiotemporal pattern of technological innovation capability is the result of multiple factors, with northeastern cities mainly being affected by natural gas demands, northwestern cities being highly sensitive to capital strength, eastern cities mostly relying on urban development, and cities in North China mainly being bolstered by the strength of talent. (5) It is necessary to carry out further multi-agent and multi-scale future research on technological innovation in the natural gas industry and its relationship with the energy transition and to explore the interactivity of the influencing factors. This study may provide strategies for technological innovation in the natural gas industry from the perspective of the energy transition.","Liu, Shuguang;Wang, Jiayi;Long, Yin",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023-05-01,Ocean University of China;Sinopec,cities in China ;  energy transition ;  geographically and temporally weighted regression model (GTWR) ;  natural gas industry ;  spatiotemporal characteristics ;  technological innovation
"Development of Equipment for Ski Mountaineering, a New Olympic Event","Featured Application: This perspective paper describes the most current trends in the development of ski mountaineering equipment, along with the relevant regulations of the International Ski Mountaineering Federation. It also considers the limitations with respect to both the equipment now used and current regulations, providing guidelines designed to eliminate these deficiencies. This overview should assist coaches in the optimal selection of equipment for their athletes, designers in developing better products, and researchers who strive to incorporate the implications of scientific findings into both the engineering of equipment and athletic performance. Ski mountaineering, a new Olympic winter sport involving both climbing and descending snowy slopes, requires considerable physical and technical abilities, as well as highly specialized equipment. Herein, we briefly describe this equipment and its influence on performance and consider potential future advances. Skis, boots, and bindings must be light enough to facilitate climbing uphill (in which as much as 85% of the total racing time is spent) and, at the same time, provide stability and safety in often-challenging descents. A skier must be able to easily and rapidly attach and remove the adhesive skins under the skis that provide grip while skiing uphill. Poles and their baskets must be designed optimally to transfer propulsive force and help maintain balance. Despite the popularity of ski mountaineering, research on this sport is scarce, and we indicate a number of areas wherein improvements in equipment could potentially advance both performance and safety. Such advances must be based on a better understanding of the biomechanics of ski mountaineering, which could be obtained with novel sensor technology and can be best achieved via more extensive collaboration between researchers, skiers and their coaches, and manufacturers of ski mountaineering equipment.","Bortolan, Lorenzo;Pellegrini, Barbara;Verdel, Nina;Holmberg, Hans Christer;Supej, Matej",Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2023-05-01,Università degli Studi di Verona;Univerza v Ljubljani;The University of British Columbia;Luleå University of Technology,innovation ;  performance ;  poles ;  racing ;  ski touring ;  skiing ;  SkiMo ;  skins ;  skis
The Slippery Slopes of Climate Engineering Research,"Climate engineering research attracts Slippery Slope concerns – the idea that initial research will inevitably lead to inappropriate deployment. Some have dismissed it as an unrealistic, unproductive critique. However, extant climate engineering discussions of the Slippery Slope discuss an unorganised set of different causal mechanisms with little detail. These range from technological cost reduction, to the creation of special interest lobby groups, to normalisation across society and policymakers. Dismissing the Slippery Slope may be premature if its causal nature is unclear, especially given the potentially high impacts and controversy of global climate engineering deployment. Disaggregating and clarifying the Slippery Slope can reduce unnecessary ambiguity, promote productive debate, and highlight risks that require further attention. Drawing on previous Slippery Slope literature and mechanisms of change from range of disciplines, this paper creates a typology of Slippery Slopes for application to stratospheric aerosol injection and other emerging technologies. Initial research can lead to deployment by 1) sparking price-performance improvements and sunk cost biases, 2) contributing to normalisation and legitimisation, 3) altering power structures, 4) sparking hype, and 5) incrementally progressing development. These feedback loops may currently seem unlikely, but unforeseen dynamics could still trigger rapid development and implementation of stratospheric aerosol injection. Conversely, there is no guarantee one of these Slippery Slopes will occur. The point is that they could – the future is too uncertain to fully dismiss non-linear change, particularly for high impact and accessible technologies like stratospheric aerosol injection. This can provide direction and clarity for effective technology governance and Slippery Slope discussion. Furthermore, this typology differentiates the Slippery Slope from lock-in and highlights their interaction points. Slippery Slope dynamics are processes that can (but are not guaranteed to) lead to different types of lock-in. Lock-in is when a technology is entrenched in existing sociotechnical systems. Given the risks of unchecked undesired lock-in, lock-in is a state to be encouraged instead of avoided.","Tang, Aaron",Journal,Global Environmental Change,2023-05-01,The Fenner School of Environment & Society;University of Cambridge,Climate engineering ;  Governance ;  Innovation ;  Lock-in ;  Slippery slope ;  Stratospheric aerosol injection

A systematic review of machine learning approaches in carbon capture applications,"Climate change and global warming are among of the most important environmental issues and require adequate and immediate global action to preserve the planet for future generations. One of the essential technologies used to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate the worst effects of climate change is carbon capture technology. Many efforts have been made by scientists, industrial sectors, and policy-makers in looking for new technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emission goals. Research and development in creating new technology involve complex processes and require a digital system to optimize big data prediction as well as to reduce production time. A mathematical and statistical approach such as machine learning plays an important role in solving research problems, whereby this approach provides fast results in predicting big data and cost-efficient tools. In this study, a systematic review and bibliometric analysis were used to analyze the research trend, particularly on the keywords, number of publications, citations, countries, and authorship. This information is important for future research directions for researchers who venture into this area. In this study, the bibliometric analysis focuses on 2 main categories: co-authorship (countries and organizations) and keywords (author keyword). Based on the research trend, the United States (USA), China, Iran, Canada, and the United Kingdom are the leading countries contributing to this field since they have the highest publications and citations. Furthermore, the most common keywords used in the selected articles ranked according to the highest link strength. The top 6 keyword list includes machine learning, artificial neural network, CO2 capture, CO2 solubility, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and carbon capture and storage. The findings from this study can be used to open a wider spectrum for the research communities by providing global research trends, current innovations and current technology on machine learning in carbon capture application, identifying the active research areas or hot topics and future research direction to help fight climate change issue using smart advanced technology.","Hussin, Farihahusnah;Md Rahim, Siti Aqilah Nadhirah;Hatta, Nur Syahirah Mohamed;Aroua, Mohamed Kheireddine;Mazari, Shaukat Ali",Journal,Journal of CO2 Utilization,2023-05-01,Dawood University of Engineering & Technology (DUET);Sunway University;Universiti Malaya;Lancaster University,Bibliometric analysis ;  Carbon capture technology ;  Climate change ;  CO  adsorption 2 ;  Machine learning ;  Systematic review
Critical data at the crossroads: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey faces growing challenges,"NHANES needs urgent attention to ensure its future, which is facing emerging challenges associated with data collection, stagnant funding that has undercut innovation, and the increased call for granular data for subpopulations and groups at risk. The concerns do not rest merely on securing more funding but focus on the need for a constructive review of the survey to explore new approaches and identify appropriate change. This white paper, developed under the auspices of the ASN's Committee on Advocacy and Science Policy (CASP), is a call to the nutrition community to advocate for and support activities to prepare NHANES for future success in a changing nutrition world. Furthermore, because NHANES is much more than a nutrition survey and serves the needs of many in health fields and even commercial arenas, effective advocacy must be grounded in alliances among the survey's diverse stakeholders so that the full range of expertise and interests can engage. This article highlights the complicated nature of the survey along with key overarching challenges to underscore the importance of a measured, thoughtful, comprehensive, and collaborative approach to considering the future of NHANES. Starting-point questions are identified for the purposes of focusing dialog, discussion forums, and research. In particular, the CASP calls for a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study on NHANES to articulate an actionable framework for NHANES going forward. With a well-informed and integrated set of goals and recommendations that could be provided by such a study, a secure future for NHANES is more readily achievable.","Taylor, Christine L.;Madans, Jennifer H.;Chapman, Nancy N.;Woteki, Catherine E.;Briefel, Ronette R.;Dwyer, Johanna T.;Merkel, Joyce M.;Rothwell, Charles J.;Klurfeld, David M.;Seres, David S.;Coates, Paul M.",Journal,American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,2023-05-01,Columbia University Irving Medical Center;Tufts University;Indiana University Bloomington;Food and Drug Administration;National Center for Health Statistics;Iowa State University;USDA ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center;Billerica Memorial High School;N.

A holistic method for radical concept generation based on technological evolution: A case application of DC charging pile,"In the rapidly changeable market, radical innovation (RI) is highly demanded by enterprises to improve their product competitiveness. Enterprises need to efficiently generate ideal radical concepts for the successful implementation of RI. However, the existing research on RI mainly focuses on identifying radical concepts through various evaluation methods from the perspective of business and management. This is a post-hoc analysis, which limits the guidance for enterprises to plan and purposefully generate radical concepts from an ex-ante perspective. For the development of RI products in the engineering field, enterprises lack an effective method for the ex-ante generation of radical concepts. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic method for the ex-ante generation of radical concepts according to the technological evolution. An identification method for radical technology opportunities is proposed based on the evolutionary characteristics of the RI technological trajectory. Technological evolution laws and artificial neural networks are used to determine the evolution direction of subsystems for RI, thereby identify the search direction of new technologies. This paper also establishes a technical knowledge evaluation method and an analogy process for the ex-ante generation of radical concepts. The proposed method is applied in the ex-ante design of a DC charging pile for its feasibility and effectiveness. The proposed method not only provides an efficient ex-ante generation process of the radical concept for enterprise engineers, but also has the potential to enrich research on the RI and knowledge innovation.","Zhang, Lulu;Tan, Runhua;Peng, Qingjin;Yang, Wendan;Zhang, Junlei;Wang, Kang",Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023-05-01,Hebei University of Technology;University of Manitoba;National Engineering Research Center for Technological Innovation Method and Tool,Artificial neural network ;  DC charging pile ;  Radical concept ;  Radical innovation (RI) ;  Technological evolution laws ;  TRIZ

Discovering technology and science innovation opportunity based on sentence generation algorithm,"Science and technology are crucial elements in discovering innovation opportunities. They have their own practical and theoretical unique meaning in innovation factors. Scientific or technological information can be collected by patents or papers, and various approaches for innovation opportunities discovery are being proposed using text mining. Since a previous methodology using patents and papers discovered opportunities in science or technology itself, they cannot discover opportunities reflecting the science and technology relationship. In addition, since discovered innovation opportunities are formed within the keyword or phrase level, they cannot provide innovation direction or purpose. Therefore, this study suggests a new approach to discovering science and technology innovation opportunities that reflects the science–technology relationship and their concrete directions/purposes using the sentence generation algorithm. An algorithm-generated sentence can contain contextual flow and connection between keywords. In contrast, the generated sentences from the sentence model can reflect science and technology from mass data in a readable sentence. Key innovation factors from science and technology are extracted from generated sentences and then innovation opportunities with specific directions and purposes are suggested.","Roh, Taeyeoun;Yoon, Byungun",Journal,Journal of Informetrics,2023-05-01,"Dongguk University, Seoul",Innovation opportunity ;  Science innovation ;  Sentence Generation ;  Technology innovation
How ecological policy stringency moderates the influence of industrial innovation on environmental sustainability: The role of renewable energy transition in BRICST countries,"Global economies enforce strict environmental regulations and renewable energy transition policies to address climate vulnerabilities. The current study elucidates the effects of renewable energy transition, ecological governance, technology innovation, and economic growth on the environmental degradation of the BRICST (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and Turkey) nations. The study employed Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) on yearly data from 1990 to 2020. The empirical outcomes revealed that the nexus among the variables is quantile-dependent and grounded on the conditional distribution of consumption-based carbon emissions. Renewable energy transition and environmental policy stringency tend to curtail consumption-based carbon emissions; however, these effects weaken moving from lower to higher quantiles. Moreover, technological innovation significantly moderates the impact of environmental governance on emissions mitigation, mainly at lower to medium quantiles. These results suggest implementing integrated policy for innovation, energy transition, and ecological governance.","Liu, Xuemei;Yuan, Shuhan;Yu, Haoran;Liu, Zheng",Journal,Renewable Energy,2023-05-01,Zhongnan University of Economics and Law;Hunan Normal University,Consumption-based carbon emissions ;  Ecological governance ;  Renewable energy transition ;  Technology innovation
Understanding coastal social values through citizen science: The example of Coastsnap in Western Australia,"The coast is socially, economically, and environmentally vital to humanity, yet at risk due to population growth, development, and climate change. Coastal managers are required to make complex decisions regarding the trade-offs that may arise because of these threats, hence evidence-based policy is essential. Advances in biophysical data have improved understanding of coastal change, yet comparative social data is limited. Innovations are required to generate social values data that: (i) links with biophysical data; (ii) is consistent, representative, and long-term; and (iii) requires low resource investment. This paper reports on a pilot program that sought to address these needs by linking with an established citizen science program, CoastSnap, to collect information on community use and values in the Peron Naturaliste region, south-west Western Australia. The program successfully monitored community use and values uncovering the importance of nature-based activities and the mental/emotional health benefits of interacting with the coast. It highlights spatial differences in use and value that can support regional coastal planning. In the longer-term, the approach could enable decision-makers to monitor change in use and values resulting from, for example, infrastructure investments or physical coastal change. Limitations include little control over respondent sample and lack of knowledge regarding barriers to participation. Further research into the factors that motivate users and their preferences for interacting with the remote survey technologies, along with an expanded network of CoastSnap Social Survey sites, would facilitate regional, national, and global comparison of use and values. The approach provides a valuable addition to coastal managers’ data collection toolbox, generating social data that are temporal, integrates with biophysical data, and supports regional coastal planning, whilst increasing opportunities to interact with the public to enhance awareness, interest and support for coastal management.","Elrick-Barr, Carmen E.;Clifton, Julian;Cuttler, Michael;Perry, Craig;Rogers, Abbie A.",Journal,Ocean and Coastal Management,2023-05-01,The University of Western Australia;University of Lincoln;Peron Naturaliste Partnership,Climate change adaptation ;  Coastal management ;  Community values ;  Environmental management ;  Monitoring
Can renewable energy technology innovation promote mineral resources’ green utilization efficiency? Novel insights from regional development inequality,"Strengthening the mineral resource's green utilization efficiency is the key to achieving high-quality development and sustainable mining in China. Moreover, exploring the impact of renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) on mineral resources' green utilization efficiency is integral to boosting the mining industry's overall efficiency and facilitating the energy transition. However, the ability and way of different regions to develop and utilize RETI may depend on their geographical location. Using the dataset covering 30 provinces from 2001 to 2020, this study empirically reveals novel evidence of regional inequality of the impact of RETI on mineral resources' green utilization efficiency. Results show that RETI significantly affects mineral resources' green utilization efficiency. Study results still hold after replacing the explanatory variables, using the instrumental variables technique to solve the endogeneity problem, removing extreme values, and excluding the effects of extreme events. In addition, the impact of RETI on mineral resources' green utilization efficiency depends on the regional location in terms of both significance and marginal effects. RETI significantly promotes mineral resources' green utilization efficiency in the central and western regions, while the opposite is true for eastern regions. Finally, the impact of RETI on mineral resources' green utilization efficiency has various effects depending on the industrial structure and human capital level changes. These findings can provide partial enlightenment for accelerating RETI to facilitate mineral resources' green utilization efficiency.","Feng, Chen Yu;Yang, Xiaodong;Afshan, Sahar;Irfan, Muhamamd",Journal,Resources Policy,2023-05-01,Sunway University;Ilma University;Xiangtan University;Beijing Technology and Business University;Xinjiang University,Development inequality ;  Mineral resource green utilization efficiency ;  Renewable energy technology innovation ;  Sustainable development

Challenges and opportunities of light olefin production via thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of end-of-life polyolefins: Towards full recyclability,"Is full recyclability of polyolefins via chemical recycling a dream, or can it become a reality? The main problem in recycling plastic waste is that its composition is highly heterogeneous while sorting and purifying solutions to obtain mono-streams are complex and require large investments, thereby hampering the economy of scale. Ideally, novel chemical recycling processes are designed to have mixed plastic wastes as input and higher value products are produced such as C2–C4 olefins or aromatics instead of a low value oil. In this review we show the directions how we can realize these objectives. Classical thermal pyrolysis offers some possibilities but requires very high temperatures exceeding 800 °C to transform the plastic waste back into the desired temperatures. Nevertheless, because of its robustness, thermal pyrolysis of polyolefinic plastic waste is currently intensively studied and the first industrial applications are operated at low to medium temperature range to maximize oil as the main product. Catalytic pyrolysis is still under development, but under ideal lab-scale conditions around 85 wt.% of C2–C4 olefins can be produced when pure polyolefin feeds are used. With improved catalyst design it should be possible to get this number further up without affecting the catalyst stability. As the yield of light olefins in pyrolysis is impacted by both the process design (reactor type, the efficiency of plastic sorting prior to conversion, flexibility towards feed composition) and experimental parameters (temperature, catalyst type, catalyst/feed ratio, contact mode, residence time, addition of inert or reactants) also further improvements are possible in this respect. To industrialize pyrolysis of plastic waste, short residence times (<1 s) are crucial to avoid secondary reactions and by-products such as methane, coke, and aromatics. Pyrolysis reactors that are designed according to these principles, such as downers, spouted fluidized bed, and vortex reactors, are envisaged to result in optimal yields of C2–C4 olefins. However, coke formation seems to be inevitable and the reactor designs need to be sufficiently robust to allow for in-situ coke removal. For future research it will be crucial for the industrial viability of plastic waste pyrolysis to improve the purification of the plastic waste stream, optimize both the catalysts selectivity and stability, and design a suitable industrial reactor. It is envisaged that further innovations in these three areas will eventually allow reaching the 90 wt.% target.","Abbas-Abadi, Mehrdad Seifali;Ureel, Yannick;Eschenbacher, Andreas;Vermeire, Florence H.;Varghese, Robin John;Oenema, Jogchum;Stefanidis, Georgios D.;Van Geem, Kevin M.",Journal,Progress in Energy and Combustion Science,2023-05-01,Universiteit Gent;National Technical University of Athens (NTUA),Chemical recycling ;  Heterogeneous catalysts ;  Kinetic modeling ;  Light olefins ;  Polyolefins ;  Reaction engineering ;  Zeolite

Analysis of Biomechanics of Motor Vehicle Collisions for Passenger Cars: Implications for Passenger Vehicle Safety and Future Car Design Innovations,"Introduction: Investigating biomechanics of injury patterns from motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) informs improvements in vehicle safety. This study aims to investigate two-vehicle MVCs involving a passenger car and specific injury patterns associated with sources of injury, collision biomechanics, vehicle properties, and patient outcomes. Methods: Retrospective cohort study conducted to evaluate the biomechanics of specific injury patterns seen in MVCs involving passenger cars using the Crash Injury Research Engineering Network database between the years 2005 and 2015. Results: A total of 631 MVC cases were included from 2005 to 2015. The majority of cases involved injuries to the head or neck, the thorax, and the abdomen (80.5%). Head/neck injuries from the steering wheel were associated with significantly higher injury severity score compared to those from seatbelts (26.11 versus 18.28, P < 0.001) and airbags (26.11 versus 20.10, P = 0.006), as well as a >6-fold higher fatality rate (P = 0.019). Thoracic injuries caused by the center console were twice as likely to be fatal than those caused by the seatbelt (P = 0.09). Conclusions: Occupants suffering injuries to the head/neck, the thorax, and the abdomen had higher injury severity score and fatality rates compared to other body regions, demonstrating that manufacturing and safety guidelines should focus on minimizing these injury patterns.

Life Cycle Assessment of the Battery Cell Production: Using a Modular Material and Energy Flow Model to Assess Product and Process Innovations,"Battery cells and their production processes are developing continuously toward higher efficiencies. Conventional life cycle inventories (LCIs) applied in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies are either numerical or parametrized, which inhibits their application to changing developments in battery research. Therefore, this article presents an approach to develop modular material and energy flow (MEF) models for battery cell production. The modular MEF model is linked to the Brightway2 framework to generate LCI for six different innovations: 1) extrusion-based slurry preparation; 2) water-based electrode production; 3) dry coating; 4) thick electrodes; 5) change of active material; and 6) a combination of innovations. The results reveal that the modeled process and product innovations, particularly the dry coating process, can contribute to a reduction of more than 15% in CO2-eq emissions. With the presented approach, it is possible to model process and product innovations in a common environment, which enables a comparative analysis under changing model premises with reusable and adaptable models at the process level. This reduces the effort to evaluate process variations significantly and contributes to the use of LCA as an engineering tool.","von Drachenfels, Nicolas;Husmann, Jana;Khalid, Usama;Cerdas, Felipe;Herrmann, Christoph",Journal,Energy Technology,2023-05-01,Technische Universität Braunschweig,battery cell production ;  life cycle assessment ;  life cycle inventory ;  material and energy flows ;  modularization
I Can’t Quit: Experiences of Black Women in STEM Professions,"Using job embeddedness theory, this study investigated the off- and on-the-job forces experienced at the axis of race and gender that contribute to Black women staying in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. Using purposive, snowball sampling, 13 Black women with STEM degrees and professional experience were selected for semi-structured interviews via Zoom. Tensions in navigating the race–gender intersection were evident in participants’ experiences and informed their perceptions of fit, links, and sacrifices. Moreover, welcoming environments, financial stability, the desire to serve communities as role models, and opportunities to innovate, learn, and grow contributed to participants’ embeddedness in STEM professions. Contrary to previous research, respondents demonstrated high agency and confidence. Organizations can enhance the retention of Black women by providing growth opportunities and welcoming spaces. Specifically, inclusive leadership is essential to retaining a diverse workforce and making the value of Black women visible to drive STEM innovation.","Sendze, Margery S.",Journal,Journal of Career Assessment,2023-05-01,Grand Canyon University,"Black women ;  diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ;  Embeddedness in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ;  Intersectionality and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ;  Women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics"

Evolution of Surface Engineering in the Development of Textile-Based EMI Shields─A Review,"Innovations in electronics and the rapid developments in communication systems have been unprecedented and made life easier. One such advancement is wireless electronics, where gadgets operate in gigahertz frequencies, transmitting and receiving signals in the form of electromagnetic (EM) waves during their operation. The increased presence of EM waves in the atmosphere has led to EM pollution. With the miniaturization of devices, there is an increased volume of complex circuitry in a limited space, causing interference between them during operation, termed “electromagnetic interference” (EMI). EMI concerns are rising as they are considered severe threats to devices and their functioning. Flexible and lightweight EMI shielding materials are vital to combat this issue. Functional textiles are considered promising candidates with increasing attention due to their outstanding flexibility. They offer excellent design scope and can be integrated with different materials like metals, polymers, and their composites in different levels (fiber, yarn, and fabric). This review provides a concise note on the fundamental concepts and mechanisms of EMI shielding and emphasizes how textiles for EMI shielding applications have evolved over the past two decades. From metal yarn coweaved fabrics to multifunctional coatings, tremendous progress has been made design-wise. This review presents a holistic view of all these design architectures, critically analyzing their pros and cons, and a perspective indicating future research directions.","Jagadeshvaran, P.

"HCI Research on Agriculture: Competing Sociotechnical Imaginaries, Definitions, and Opportunities","Agriculture is foundational for food security on our planet. Considering climate change and other pressures on food production, HCI scholars have increasingly begun to examine how the field should approach agricultural innovation. We conducted a literature review of HCI research through the lens of competing future visions for good food systems : a ""conventional""vision of profit-oriented production, and an ""alternative""which prioritizes sustainability and community-led practices. Leveraging the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, we provide an empirical analysis of how HCI and adjacent applied computing projects align with these competing visions for agriculture. This review reveals, amongst other findings, a prioritization of the perspectives of the Global North and a need for more careful attention to the constraints and aspirations of subsistence farmers. Finally, we note the limits of the conventional-alternative binary that shapes much of contemporary HCI research focused on agriculture and offer opportunities for transcending this framing.","Doggett, Olivia;Bronson, Kelly;Soden, Robert",Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2023-04-19,York University;University of Ottawa;University of Toronto;St. Thomas University,agriculture ;  climate change ;  digital agriculture ;  food ;  futures ;  ICT4D ;  literature review ;  sustainability ;  urban agriculture

Linguistic Analysis Identifies Emergent Biomaterial Fabrication Trends for Orthopaedic Applications,"The expanse of publications in tissue engineering (TE) and orthopedic TE (OTE) over the past 20 years presents an opportunity to probe emergent trends in the field to better guide future technologies that can make an impact on musculoskeletal therapies. Leveraging this trove of knowledge, a hierarchical systematic search method and trend analysis using connected network mapping of key terms is developed. Within discrete time intervals, an accelerated publication rate for anatomic orthopedic tissue engineering (AOTE) of osteochondral defects, tendons, menisci, and entheses is identified. Within these growing fields, the top-listed key terms are extracted and stratified into evident categories, such as biomaterials, delivery method, or 3D printing and biofabrication. It is then identified which categories decreased, remained constant, increased, or emerged over time, identifying the specific emergent categories currently driving innovation in orthopedic repair technologies. Together, these data demonstrate a significant convergence of material types and descriptors used across tissue types. From this convergence, design criteria to support future research of anatomic constructs that mimic both the form and function of native tissues are formulated. In summary, this review identifies large-scale trends and predicts new directions in orthopedics that will define future materials and technologies.","Locke, Ryan C.;Zlotnick, Hannah M.;Stoeckl, Brendan D.;Fryhofer, George W.;Galarraga, Jonathan H.;Dhand, Abhishek P.;Zgonis, Miltiadis H.;Carey, James L.;Burdick, Jason A.;Mauck, Robert L.",Journal,Advanced Healthcare Materials,2023-04-17,College of Engineering and Applied Science;School of Engineering and Applied Science;U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs;University of Pennsylvania;University of Colorado Boulder,biomaterials ;  emergent trends ;  linguistic analyses ;  orthopedics ;  tissue engineering

Role: Role-Oriented Learning Environment: Innovative Educational Approach for Engineering Education,"Higher Education is constantly adapting to the needs of their stakeholders, which has led through time into the use of strategies such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Project-Oriented Learning (POL) and Research-Based Learning (RBL). These strategies have been widely used as they let students move from the theory they learn in class, into practical examples that make sense to students in relation to their future professional activity. Yet, educational centers keep on adapting and adopting more strategies that promote the development of competences among students. This is due to the need of employers to have professionals having the required skill sets to overcome the challenges of a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment. Thus, skillsets must not be limited to applying the knowledge they have, but also into giving them the tools to explore and understand alternatives outside their academic situations, by combining convergent and divergent thinking in a context that places them into the real-life situations they will be experiencing at work. Through this paper, we propose a methodology to adapt industrial needs into role-oriented learning.","Esqueda-Merino, Donovan M.;Mondragon-Ugarte, Diego;Vargas-Olivares, Arturo;Chong-Quero, J.

Research on the Application of Finite Element Method in Engineering Mechanics Teaching,"The teaching of Engineering Mechanics in vocational schools has always been a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance the teaching quality by utilizing digital instructional resources. We select a difficult question raised by students as the study target and establish a related finite element model. Numerous digital resources are obtained through simulation calculations. Based on these materials, we design and conduct teaching experiments. The results demonstrate that the teaching method significantly improves the teaching quality, and students' study enthusiasm is greatly enhanced. The color nephogram obtained using the finite element method is particularly beneficial for students to comprehend abstract concepts. The research ideas presented in this paper can be applied in the teaching of other chapters of Engineering Mechanics and can serve as a reference for teaching innovation in other courses. With the trend of future education moving towards digitalization, the approach presented in this paper highlights the potential for using digital resources to enhance teaching quality.","Wang, Shang;Wang, Xuelei;Peng, Fei",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-04-13,Beijing Polytechnic,Engineering mechanics ;  Finite element method ;  Simulation ;  Teaching
A Method to the Madness: Applying an Intersectional Analysis of Structural Oppression and Power in HCI and Design,"With increased focus on historically excluded populations, there have been recent calls for HCI research methods to more adequately acknowledge and address the historical context of racism, sexism, gendered racism, epistemic violence, classism, and so on. In this article, we utilize Black feminist epistemologies to serve as critical frameworks for understanding the historical context that reveals the interconnected systems of power that mutually influence one another to create unequal outcomes or social inequalities for different populations. Leveraging Black feminist thought (BFT) and intersectionality as critical social theories of design praxis, we introduce intersectional analysis of power - a method that enables HCI researchers, designers, and practitioners to identify and situate saturated sites of violence in a historical context and to transform the ways in which they engage with populations that have been historically oppressed. Engaging in self-reflection as researchers, we apply an intersectional analysis of power to co-design technologies with community street outreach workers who address violence in their predominantly Black communities. We: (1) identify the saturated site of violence; (2) identify the intersecting systems of power and who holds power (past and present); (3) describe the ""conceptual glue""that binds these intersecting systems together and the assumption(s) that those who hold power are employing to guide their interactions; (4) examine the ways in which Black people are subjugated, surveilled, and/or expected to assimilate to ""normative""ways of being and behaving; and (5) identify acts of resistance. This article contributes an alternative to traditional HCI and design methods that falsely perpetuate a lens of neutrality and colorblindness that centers on whiteness, innovation, and capitalism and ignores the history of State-sanctioned violence and structural oppression.","Erete, Sheena;Rankin, Yolanda;Thomas, Jakita",Journal,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,2023-04-13,"University of Maryland, College Park;Auburn University;Florida State University",Black feminism ;  critical HCI methods ;  Power ;  structural oppression

Alternative Energy Carriers: Unique Interfaces for Electrochemical Hydrogenic Transformations,"The shift toward renewable energy generation sources, characterized by their non-carbon emitting but variable nature, has spurred significant innovation in energy storage technologies. Advancements in foundational understanding from investments in basic science and clever engineering solutions, coupled with increasing industrial adoption, have resulted in a notable reduction in the cost of storing electricity from variable energy generation sources. These developments have paved the way for the exploration of new and innovative forms of energy storage that deviate from traditional technologies. In this perspective, it is posited that the progress made in energy storage research over recent years has opened the door to the development of energy carriers for technologies that are yet to be realized. To illustrate this concept, examples of alternative energy carriers are provided within the context of unique electrochemical interfaces for electrochemical hydrogenic transformations. The unique properties of these interfaces and electrochemical systems can be leveraged in ways not yet imagined, creating new possibilities for energy storage. A perspective on the progress and challenges for each interface as well as a general outlook for the advancement of energy carrier systems are provided.","Carroll, Gerard M.;Gebbie, Matthew A.;Stahl, Shannon S.;Johnson, Mathew R.;Luca, Oana R.;Petersen, Haley A.;Bomble, Yannick J.;Neale, Nathan R.;Cortright, Randy D.",Journal,Advanced Energy Materials,2023-04-13,UW-Madison College of Engineering;University of Wisconsin-Madison;National Renewable Energy Laboratory;University of Colorado Boulder,electrochemical interfaces ;  energy carriers ;  energy storage ;  hydrogen carriers
Designing electrocatalysts for seawater splitting: surface/interface engineering toward enhanced electrocatalytic performance,"As an ideal large-scale energy conversion/storage technology, electrochemical hydrogen production has great potential as a means of smoothing out the volatility of renewable sources. Electrocatalytic seawater splitting utilizes abundant natural seawater to replace purified water; this has considerable economic and environmental benefits, and will greatly expand the applications scope of water splitting. However, complex compositions existing in natural seawater hinder efficient H2 electrosynthesis, especially chlorides that corrode the catalysts. Advanced surface and interface engineering has been demonstrated to be critical for the construction of efficient and stable electrodes for seawater electrolysis. In the review, we firstly introduce the fundamentals of direct seawater splitting and provide a comprehensive analysis of the basic reactions on electrodes from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics. Subsequently, rational design strategies for HER and OER electrocatalysts applied to seawater or chloride-containing electrolytes in terms of catalytic activity, selectivity and corrosion resistance are discussed comprehensively. Moreover, the applications of surface/interface engineering in the performance tuning of seawater electrolytic electrocatalysts are presented.

Modular Domain Controller Design Approach: A Key Enabler for ADAS and Automated Driving Functionality,"Ensuring the safety of vehicle occupants has always been the primary focus of automakers. To achieve this goal, they have invested in the development of active safety features, which are designed to prevent accidents from occurring in the first place. These innovations are driven by a desire to save lives and reduce the risk of injury or death on the road. The implementation of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving functions requires a high level of complexity and coordination between various subsystems. To meet these challenges, modular design of the domain controller has emerged as a promising approach. By separating the controller into smaller, specialized modules, it is possible to more efficiently and effectively manage the various functions needed for ADAS and automated driving. In this paper, we present a summary of our research on the use of the modular design approach for the domain controller in the context of implementing ADAS and automated driving end-to-end functions. Testing at different levels is also a key factor in ensuring that the overall system is robust, and all functions perform as intended. We use the Automatic Parking Assist (APA) function as a case study to demonstrate how the APA function was implemented on our developed domain controller and to discuss the benefits of this approach. Through this case study, we provide insight into the potential of the modular design approach for the domain controller to support the development of advanced ADAS and automated driving systems and identify the key considerations that need to be addressed in order to effectively implement this approach, including the importance of testing at different levels","Mansour, Iyad;Singh, Sanjay",Conference Proceeding,SAE Technical Papers,2023-04-11,Arriver Software LLC;New Eagle,
Ͽ € Just because something works doesn't mean it can't be improved': An ethnographic analysis of the health system in Black Panther's Wakanda,"The emergence of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has introduced significant global challenges for healthcare systems, healthcare professionals and patients. This current climate creates an opportunity to learn from equitable health systems and move toward making fundamental changes to healthcare systems. Our ethnographic analysis of Wakanda's healthcare system in Black Panther, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, offers opportunities for system-level transformation across healthcare settings. We propose four healthcare system themes within the context of Wakandan identity: (1) technology as an instrument (blending bodies and technology, blending technology with tradition); (2) reimagining medication; (3) warfare and rehabilitation; and (4) preventative approaches to health (prioritising collective health, deprofessionalisation of healthcare services). The preceding themes represent core elements of Wakandan health systems that allow the people of Wakanda to thrive. Wakandans retain a strong identity and cultural traditions while embracing modern technologies. We found that effective upstream approaches to health for all are embedded in anti-colonial philosophies. Wakandans embrace innovation, embedding biomedical engineering and continuous improvement into care settings. For global health systems under strain, Wakanda's health system identifies equitable possibilities for system change, reminding us that culturally relevant prevention strategies can both decrease pressure on health services and allow all people to thrive.","Jackson, Jennifer;Ferreira, Carla;Scott, Melissa;Barah, Elke Jaibeeh;Upal, Zahra;Phelps, Krista;Mei, Carol;Woo, Haneul;Tung, Megan;Gadimova, Farida;Ewanyshyn, Alexandra;Perry, Samantha;Ens, Twyla;Ginn, Carla",Journal,BMJ Global Health,2023-04-07,Alberta Health Services;The University of British Columbia;University of Calgary;Cumming School of Medicine,Health systems ;  Health systems evaluation ;  Prevention strategies ;  Public Health ;  Qualitative study
Trends of integrated project delivery implementations viewed from an emerging innovation framework,"Purpose: Research into integrated project delivery (IPD) has attracted increased attention over the past 2 decades, and a significant number of IPD studies have been published more recently. The purpose of the study is to explore the state of IPD to reveal innovative areas of focus. Design/methodology/approach: The research presented puts forward a science mapping and bibliometrics methods to study systematic analysis of IPD scientific output published between 2006 and 2020. It uses a framework from emerging literature relating to innovation to incorporate a perspective of the process of innovation for the analysis of IPD. The adapted framework from the literature on innovation, called the Technology Innovation System (TIS), has functions that reveal novelty in the existing structures of IPD. The framework uses the analysis of scientific output from science mapping and bibliometric study techniques, using the ScienceDirect (SD) and Web of Science (WoS) databases as sources. The framework analyzes factors involved in the development and diffusion of the IPD approach and charts new knowledge development on IPD. Findings: From the analysis, future implementation of IPD will converge on cases of collaboration, as a systemic feature, among participating stakeholder teams. A significant and robust effect resulted from collaboration and integration as major mechanisms influence opportunities, problems and solutions within construction firms using IPD, marking a future trend. Reports further substantiate the importance and focus on collaboration and integration between IPD practitioners. With the same dynamic and gradual prominence, building information modeling (BIM) and new technology applications demonstrated the importance of the development and diffusion of IPD in the form of, for example, digital government initiatives. It is expected that the trend for IDS and resource mobilization functions will continue to grow – clear evidence of the benefits of the IPD approach in the construction sector. New evidence for gaining cognitive and normative legitimacy emerged. The expansion of new avenues for further legitimation is expected to enable growth. Research limitations/implications: Beyond the innovative approach of viewing IPD from the emerging innovation framework, the research presented fully contributes to IPD literature, providing a comprehensive state-of-the-art status and a quantitative analysis of IPD scientific output, thereby illuminating promising work areas for future research into IPD. The main limitation is related to the dynamic process of indexing of IPD literature in the WoS and SD – although many new research publications are added in the discipline, only a part of them have been indexed in the WoS and SD core database. Practical implications: The study revealed key evolving trends within the field, including instructive findings and implications concerning possible deficiencies. Based on factors from network visualizations and quantitative evaluation from major influential articles, journals and authors, future critical IPD implementation focus will be on BIM and sustainability concepts – centerpiece concepts for the evolving line of IPD growth and development in the architecture, engineering and construction industry. Social implications: This study fills the gap created in a shortage of studies mapping out the most critical contributions in journals, authors and research perspectives related to IPD. It presents a framework that can be used as an objective procedure to evaluate the topic. It is expected that the study will serve as a cornerstone for researchers in this field, as it provides a bibliometric analysis and presents trends using an analytical framework of innovation. Originality/value: The research presented is a keystone in the foundation of the literature review on this topic. The research draws on an existing framework for innovation – the TIS, developed from innovation studies using a robust theoretical framework to enable further analysis of IPD. This approach is one of a kind, using the results of scientometric analysis to study the scientific landscape and knowledge output of IPD in the AEC community. Science-mapping bibliometric analysis was conducted to shed light on IPD trends and explain factors that back or support the development and diffusion of IPD, including shaping and enabling evolution and growth.

Ammonia, which can function as a H2 carrier for later dehydrogenation in COx-free hydrogen production, is recognized as one of the key solutions. The utilization of nonthermal plasma to catalyze reactions is a plausible means of replacing CO2-polluting fossil-dependent thermal processes. In this perspective, we summarize currently explored mechanistic insights in the catalytic plasma reactions to evaluate their readiness for industrial applications and propose future research outlooks in plasma-driven hydrogen technologies, with a primary focus on ammonia reactions. Relevant reaction mechanisms and catalytic design in other reaction systems that involve hydrogen storage (e.g., CO2 hydrogenation, CO2 methanation) and hydrogen production (e.g., methane reforming) are also evaluated to supplement our primary discussion on ammonia synthesis and decomposition. We further discuss possible implications of using plasma catalysis from the perspective of energy efficiency in comparison to existing thermal-catalytic counterparts, wherein we include insights obtained from different reaction systems, catalyst design innovations, and reactor engineering. Herein, we present current research gaps and propose future research directions to achieve energy-efficient catalytic plasma hydrogen technologies.","Lim, Kang Hui;Yue, Yifei;Bella, None;Gao, Xingyuan;Zhang, Tianxi;Hu, Feiyang;Das, Sonali;Kawi, Sibudjing",Journal,ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,2023-04-03,"Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment;Guangdong University of Education;National University of Singapore;Indian Institute of Technology Bombay;Nanchang University;Guangdong University of and Education",Ammonia ;  Hydrogenation ;  Low-carbon hydrogen ;  Methanol ;  Nonthermal plasma catalysis ;  Reforming ;  Technoeconomic analysis

The commitment to development with new gene-editing techniques in Argentina,"The discovery that CRISPR could be used to edit DNA democratized access to genetic engineering by reducing the costs, time and knowledge required. In Argentina, it appeared as a ""window of opportunity"" to improve the insertion of biotechnological goods and services in the international market and to solve the problems generated by the massive extension of agriculture with GMO. Using interviews, observations, and secondary sources, this paper reconstructs the practices of scientists, businessmen, and government officials that make possible CRISPR research, development and innovation (R&D&i), identifying its limits and possibilities. It finds that the main challenge for ongoing innovations is the regulatory framework established by other countries. Therefore, the commitment to development based on this biotechnological application depends on strategies and geopolitical negotiations that allow the export of the results of the R&D+i carried out in the country.","Bilañski, Gisele Andrea",Journal,Mundo Agrario,2023-04-01,Universidad Nacional de San Martín,Agriculture ;  Development ;  Genetic engineering ;  Innovation ;  Regulation

Review of Research on the Properties and Resource Utilization of Coal Gangue Concrete,"Coal gangue is a by-product of the production of coal-associated minerals, and belongs to bulk solid waste material. coal gangue concrete is an important practice for its resource utilization. Carbon neutrality and carbon peaks require all industries to make corresponding plans for the sustainable development of green ecology. In terms of resource utilization of building materials, coal gangue was used as aggregates to develop high-performance concrete, which started a new material innovation in the construction and civil engineering industries. At the same time, it can accelerate the process of carbon neutralization as the backbone of the indispensable treatment of low-carbon resources. Scholars at home and abroad have done a lot of theoretical and experimental research on the mechanical properties and engineering application of coal gangue concrete, and have made significant progress in improving the performance of coal gangue concrete, engineering practical application and production technology innovation, and established a relatively complete research system. Based on the differences in chemical and physical properties of coal gangue in different regions, this paper elaborates on the mechanical and durability properties of coal gangue concrete prepared with different aggregates, analyzes the feasibility and current research limitations of coal gangue application in civil engineering, and looks forward to the resource utilization prospects of coal gangue as aggregate to prepare new concrete in road engineering and building structures, provide a new perspective and reference for the large-scale recycling and utilization of coal gangue and further research on coal gangue concrete.","Deng, Yousheng;Feng, Ailin;Meng, Liqing;Li, Long;Zhang, Mengyu;Zheng, Yunfang",Journal,Multipurpose Utilization of Mineral Resources,2023-04-01,Xi'an University of Science and Technology,Bulk solid waste material ;  Carbon neutrality ;  Coal gangue concrete ;  Durability ;  Mechanical properties ;  Resource-based application
Can environmental regulations induce residents to develop green lifestyles? Evidence from China,"How to promote green transformation in social life and consumption is a key issue that governments should pay attention to and solve. Academics have paid extensive attention to the green transition of production mode. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the green transition of lifestyle and relevant empirical studies on the theme of green lifestyle are rare. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2019, this paper examines the impact of environmental regulations on residents’ green lifestyles by constructing an econometric model and systematically explores the possible mechanism of environmental regulation on the green lifestyle. It is found that environmental regulation directly affects green lifestyles and can also positively affect residents’ green lifestyles by improving the level of green technology innovation at the production level. In addition, green environmental awareness positively modifies the impact of environmental regulation intensity on green lifestyles. Heterogeneity analysis and robustness analysis further enrich the reliability of the conclusions and results of this study. This paper attempts to open the “black box” in which environmental regulations guide residents to form green lifestyles and provide a reference for government policy-making and guiding residents to form green lifestyles.","Zheng, Qiaoqiao;Wan, Liang;Wang, Shanyong;Li, Jun;Wu, Jie;Song, Malin",Journal,Xitong Gongcheng Lilun yu Shijian/System Engineering Theory and Practice,2023-04-01,Anhui University of Finance and Economics;University of Science and Technology of China;Hefei University of Technology,environmental regulation ;  green environmental awareness ;  green lifestyle ;  green technology innovation
Innovation in tree fruit production system sustainability through horticultural engineering: case studies,"Genetic engineering of plants has offered fascinating possibilities over the past three decades, often overshadowing what might be called horticultural engineering solutions to a great many production challenges. This paper reviews the development of high impact, innovative advances in sustainable tree fruit production through the integration of plant morphological foundations, physiological research, improved cultivar and rootstock genotypes, biosystems engineering, and readily adopted orchard management practices: essentially, horticultural engineering. Harnessing certain evolutionary vegetative traits, such as meristem phyllotaxy, vertical shoot orientation, and apical dominance, as well as horticultural manipulations such as diffusion of vigor through multiple leaders, has guided our research approach to planar canopy development for fruit trees. The case studies focus on a) 20+ years of developing and refining variations of a planar canopy architecture (Upright Fruiting Offshoots, UFO) for sweet cherry production that deconstructed a genetically evolved forest tree into its fundamental fruiting units, then reassembled these units into precisely optimized light- and labor-efficient orchard structures, and b) 10 years of applying these same principles to improving peach production systems, with significant comparisons and contrasts (such as spur- vs. shoot-bearing habits) critical for ultimate success. Not only do these advances positively impact yield potential, fruit quality, labor efficiency, worker safety, reduced pesticide use, and facilitation of protected environments, but rapidly advancing digital imaging/sensing, data acquisition and interpretation, and robotic technologies also are more readily facilitated by horticulturally-engineered precision canopy architectures. While genetic engineering continues to offer unique and powerful tools for manipulating a single or a few genes, horticultural engineering solutions should not be overlooked for addressing the challenging complexities of perennial cropping systems like tree fruit production more quickly, with more rapid potential adoption, wide acceptance by the public, and a high probability for significant and widespread impacts.","Lang, G.

Review on warm mixing asphalt technology,"To further promote the carbon neutrality in the field of transportation, the advantages and limitations of the warm mixing asphalt technology were summarized in terms of energy conservation and emission reduction according to the research status in China and abroad. The temperature and viscosity reduction mechanisms of common warm mixing agents and warm mixing technologies and the influences of different warm mixing technologies on their properties were studied. The latest research progress of warm mixing technology in the modified asphalt mixture, recycled asphalt mixture, and other asphalt mixtures was reviewed. The effectiveness of energy conservation and emission reduction under reducing the construction temperature was analyzed when the warm mixing technology was applied in the modified asphalt mixture and recycled asphalt mixture. Then, the impacts of temperature reduction on the high-temperature performance, low-temperature performance, water stability, and fatigue performance of asphalt mixture were discussed. Research results show that the warm mixing technology has such advantages as environmental friendliness, energy conservation, emission reduction, and construction facilitation. However, it has also some drawbacks such as the high cost of warm mixing agent and the residual moisture in the warm mixing asphalt which exerts adverse effects on its performance. The commonly used warm mixing technology is mostly patented abroad, and it has been widely used in various asphalt mixtures after research, digestion, and absorption in China. Fully understanding the mechanism of warm mixing technology is crucial to the development of warm mixing asphalt materials and technologies characterized by low energy consumption, low emission, and low cost. The application of warm mixing technology in the modified asphalt mixture, recycled asphalt mixture, and other asphalt mixtures can reduce the viscosity and temperature during the construction, with remarkable effects of saving energy and reducing emission. The limitation factors of its application in engineering are the initial high cost of investment and the lack of low-temperature performance and water stability of the mixture. Exploring the scheme of combining the warm mixing technology with other types of asphalt mixtures is beneficial to promote the innovation and development of green highway. In a word, the warm mixing asphalt technology is an inevitable trend to achieve the goal of global carbon neutrality and is also one of the important ways to implement the development concept of green highway. 4 tabs, 9 figs, 131 refs.","Liang, Bo;Zhang, Hai Tao;Liang, Yuan;Wang, Xiao Feng;Zheng, Jian Long",Journal,Jiaotong Yunshu Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering,2023-04-01,Changsha University of Science and Technology,carbon neutrality ;  energy conservation and emission reduction ;  life cycle assessment ;  pavement material ;  road performance ;  warm mixing agent ;  warm mixing asphalt mixture
Asssessing the Green Technology Innovation Efficiency in Yangtze River Delta Region under Dual Carbon Background,"With the promotion of the dual carbon policy and the process of transforming and upgrading manufacturing, vigorously developing high-tech manufacturing with high-technology content and significant added value has become a powerful driving force to improve the development of the regional economy. In this regard, this research employs the two-stage network SBM-DEA method with undesirable outputs and multi-stage activities involved in the green production process. We examine the green technology innovation efficiency of high-tech manufacturing in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region from 2010 to 2020. We divide the activities of the high-tech manufacturing industry into two sub-stages, namely, the research and development (R&D) stage and the result transformation stage. The results are as follows: (1) The efficiency level of green technology innovation in Shanghai is at an outstanding level, having the most significant performance both in the R&D stage at 0.833 as well as in the result transformation stage at 1.006. (2) Anhui’s green technology innovation efficiency is mainly driven by the R&D stage. Green technology innovation efficiency in Jiangsu province depends primarily on the stage of result transformation, but there is still room for improvement in resource allocation. (3) Zhejiang needs to catch up in both the R&D stage and the result transformation stage, as well as to optimize the resource allocation of the green technology innovation process.","Xie, Yi;Zhou, Lingke",Journal,Processes,2023-04-01,Jiangsu University of Science and Technology;Sichuan University,dual carbon ;  green technology innovation efficiency ;  high-tech manufacturing ;  SBM-DEA ;  Yangtze River Delta region
"Asymmetric Nexus between Green Technology Innovations, Economic Policy Uncertainty, and Environmental Sustainability: Evidence from Italy","Over the last few decades, climate change and global warming have intensified a serious threat that may deteriorate global sustainable development. The factors significantly contributing to global warming are greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the variables affecting carbon emissions considerably. This study examines symmetric (linear) and asymmetric (non-linear) effects of green technology innovation (GTI), economic policy uncertainty (EPU) along with foreign direct investment (FDI), and economic development (GDP) on carbon emissions (CO2) by utilizing yearly time series data between 1970–2018 in Italy. We employed linear and non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approaches to examine short- and long-run estimates. The symmetric results show that GTI and EPU mitigate environmental degradation in the long run and intensify in the short run, whereas FDI increases environmental issues over the long and short run. Nevertheless, the asymmetric outcomes demonstrate that positive shocks in GTI lessen CO2 emissions, whereas negative shocks in GTI significantly escalate CO2 emissions. Furthermore, EPU and FDI positive and negative shocks significantly enhance environmental degradation. Based on these findings, important policy implications for policymakers to make strong policies to achieve carbon neutrality targets and achieve sustainable economic growth are proposed. Finally, because positive and negative changes in GTI, EPU, and FDI have different consequences on CO2 emissions, policymakers should consider asymmetry across these variables when assessing their impact.","Javed, Aamir;Fuinhas, José Alberto;Rapposelli, Agnese",Journal,Energies,2023-04-01,Centre for Business and Economics Research (CeBER);University of G. d'Annunzio Chieti and Pescara,CO  emissions 2 ;  economic policy uncertainty ;  foreign direct investment ;  GDP ;  green technology innovation
Research on the Effects of Welding Defects on the Strength Performance of Expandable Profile Liners and Approaches to Improve Welding Reliability,"Expandable profile liner (EPL) technology (EPLT) provides an effective solution for lost circulation trouble control without wellbore diameter loss or sacrificing completion and production performance. However, the reliability and stability of the welding seams determine the overall bearing capacity of the EPL string. The application of EPLT in more complicated conditions requires increasing the overall performance of the EPL string welding seams. In this study, we considered four types of artificial welding defects, including cracks, pores, slag inclusions, and incomplete penetration in EPL string samples, and performed internal pressure limit tests to obtain the ultimate failure strength of EPL strings with different welding defects. Abaqus was used to quantitatively assess the influence of welding defects on the strength performance of the EPL string. The critical dimensions and safety evaluation curves of various defects, under a working pressure of 30 MPa (safety factor 1.5), were obtained using a combination of numerical simulations and experiments. Using the latest welding defect identification and detection methods and relevant evaluation procedures, the type, size, and position of welding defects in EPL string can be identified quickly. The new welding process and integrated automatic welding equipment improved the welding quality and reliability of the EPL string. The new research on EPL welding seam defects and recent advancements in EPLT can bring significant economic benefits, thus promoting the application of EPLT to meet future application challenges. The technical innovations presented in this study provide an effective solution for drilling engineering staff to solve the drilling troubles associated with lost circulation and borehole instabilities and are also conducive for oil companies to address the future challenges of exploitation and development of unconventional oil and gas resources.","Zhao, Le;Tu, Yulin;Gao, Mingzhong",Journal,SPE Journal,2023-04-01,Sichuan University;Shenzhen University;Sinopec Tech Middle East LLC,
On the Viability of Diagrams and Drawings as System Requirements,"Requirement expression media is an overlooked consideration in requirements innovation. The path to including media other than natural language requirement sentences begins with determining the viability of media to be used as requirement expressions in systems engineering. This research uses the INCOSE characteristics for individual requirements and sets of requirements as a basis for an assessment of the sufficiency of model diagrams and engineering drawings to express requirements. A critical review of high-impact sources is used to develop characteristic lists for natural language requirement sentences and for model diagrams and engineering drawings. A comparative analysis of the characteristic lists for requirement sentences, model diagrams, and engineering drawings shows that each have the same fundamental characteristics and the differences are based on the ability of the media to represent abstraction. The contribution of this research is the establishment of model diagrams and engineering drawings as viable alternatives to natural language sentences for system engineering requirements expressions.","Kolligs, Jason;Thomas, Lawrence Dale",Journal,Systems,2023-04-01,The University of Alabama in Huntsville;Strategic Technology Consulting (STC),alternate media requirement expressions ;  drawings ;  engineering drawings ;  model diagrams ;  model-based systems engineering ;  models ;  requirements engineering ;  system requirements ;  systems engineering ;  systems thinking
The Impact of Intellectual Property Rights City Policy on Firm Green Innovation: A Quasi-Natural Experiment Based on a Staggered DID Model,"Green innovation is considered an important way to promote low-carbon society formation and the sustainable development of environmental engineering. However, few quantitative studies have focused on the impact of intellectual property rights (IPR) on firm green innovation (FGI). This paper constructs a quasi-natural experiment based on the IPR pilot city policy in China. We empirically investigated the influence of IPR policy on FGI using a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) model and Chinese listed company data from 2007 to 2020. The findings of this research are as follows: (1) IPR policy significantly promotes FGI, and its effectiveness is confirmed by a variety of robustness tests. (2) The IPR policy supports both green product and green process innovation, with a stronger effect on green product innovation. (3) The IPR policy encourages green independent R&D but has little influence on green joint R&D. (4) The IPR policy promotes FGI with a high knowledge intensity, state-owned enterprises, and firms in key city groups. (5) The IPR policy supports FGI primarily via two institutional channels: increasing R&D investment and easing financing constraints. This paper broadens the study of green innovation city policy and FGI development, offering new perspectives for achieving social and environmental sustainability.","Xia, Xingneng;Huang, Tao;Zhang, Sheng",Journal,Systems,2023-04-01,Xi'an Jiaotong University,city policy ;  DID model ;  green innovation ;  IPR

Recent Advances in Properties and Applications of Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Smart Cement-Based Composites,"Under the strategies of low-carbon and environmental protection, promoting green technology innovation to achieve carbon neutrality in the construction field has become a universal goal. As the building material with the highest consumption, concrete has gradually begun to transform into a multi-functional and intelligent product. Therefore, the research on carbon fiber-reinforced cement-based composites (CFRCs) is of relative interest. It mainly uses carbon fibers (CFs) with high elasticity, strength, and conductivity to disperse evenly into the concrete as a functional filler, to achieve the intelligent integration of concrete structures and function innovatively. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of CFRC is not only related to the content of CFs and environmental factors but also largely depends on the uniform dispersion and the interfacial bonding strength of CFs in cement paste. This work systematically presents a review of the current research status of the enhancement and modification mechanism of CFRC and the evaluation methods of CF dispersion. Moreover, it further discusses the improvement effects of different strengthening mechanisms on the mechanical properties, durability, and smart properties (thermoelectric effect, electrothermal effect, strain-sensitive effect) of CFRC, as well as the application feasibility of CFRC in structural real-time health monitoring, thermal energy harvesting, intelligent deformation adjustment, and other fields.

Spike sorting algorithms and their efficient hardware implementation: A comprehensive survey,"Objective. Spike sorting is a set of techniques used to analyze extracellular neural recordings, attributing individual spikes to individual neurons. This field has gained significant interest in neuroscience due to advances in implantable microelectrode arrays, capable of recording thousands of neurons simultaneously. High-density electrodes, combined with efficient and accurate spike sorting systems, are essential for various applications, including brain machine interfaces (BMIs), experimental neural prosthetics, real-time neurological disorder monitoring, and neuroscience research. However, given the resource constraints of modern applications, relying solely on algorithmic innovation is not enough. Instead, a co-optimization approach that combines hardware and spike sorting algorithms must be taken to develop neural recording systems suitable for resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and BMIs. This co-design requires careful consideration when selecting appropriate spike-sorting algorithms that match specific hardware and use cases. Approach. We investigated the recent literature on spike sorting, both in terms of hardware advancements and algorithms innovations. Moreover, we dedicated special attention to identifying suitable algorithm-hardware combinations, and their respective real-world applicabilities. Main results. In this review, we first examined the current progress in algorithms, and described the recent departure from the conventional '3-step' algorithms in favor of more advanced template matching or machine-learning-based techniques. Next, we explored innovative hardware options, including application-specific integrated circuits, field-programmable gate arrays, and in-memory computing devices (IMCs). Additionally, the challenges and future opportunities for spike sorting are discussed. Significance. This comprehensive review systematically summarizes the latest spike sorting techniques and demonstrates how they enable researchers to overcome traditional obstacles and unlock novel applications. Our goal is for this work to serve as a roadmap for future researchers seeking to identify the most appropriate spike sorting implementations for various experimental settings.

In the case of exceptional structures, few, if any, similar structures have been constructed in the same environment, and designers may feel helpless because they cannot rely on past experience, full scale models or standards, which do not cover exceptional structures. This is a typical situation where innovation may make a project feasible. However, innovation, which is to be distinguished from research conducted by academics, must obey certain rules to be effective and accepted by the community. These features are illustrated by few examples of exceptional civil engineering structures in earthquake prone areas; these examples also serve to highlight the interrelationships between practice, standardisation, education and innovation. All these activities, although carried out by different categories of people, benefit from each other to advance the civil engineering profession.","Pecker, Alain",Journal,Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering,2023-04-01,Scuola Universitaria Superiore IUSS di Pavia;Ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées,Earthquake engineering ;  Education ;  Geotechnical engineering ;  Innovation ;  Standardisation
"Exploring the use of futures, values, systems, and strategic thinking among engineering education research collaborators","Background: Multiple reports call for new ways of thinking to address challenges facing engineering education in the coming decades. Adopting these approaches first requires identifying and understanding existing ways of thinking among those engaging in engineering education research. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study is motivated by the recently published Framework for Applying Ways of Thinking in Engineering Education Research (FAWTEER). The purpose is to determine if and how the four ways of thinking proposed under FAWTEER—futures, values, systems, and strategic—are practiced by engineering education research collaborators. Design/Method: Seven engineer-social scientist collaborator pairs across heterogeneous research projects were interviewed in dyads. Data were analyzed using an inductive coding approach that was informed by the framework and literature. Results: Emergent findings provided evidence of collaborators' use of futures, values, systems, and strategic thinking, but the interpretations and relevance of a particular way of thinking varied depending on the project context. Proposal calls, organizational structures and policies, intentionality, and culture were identified as determinants that could foster or hinder the implementation of different ways of thinking. Conclusions: Ways of thinking may be taken for granted or partly ignored in research practices despite their potential influence on innovation. This study highlights how futures, values, systems, and strategic thinking are enacted in engineering education research and suggests the need to further explore connections between ways of thinking and cultures that exist at the departmental, institutional, and disciplinary levels.","Dalal, Medha;Carberry, Adam;Archambault, Leanna",Journal,Journal of Engineering Education,2023-04-01,Ira A.

The Ethical Implications of Tissue Engineering for Regenerative Purposes: A Systematic Review,"Tissue Engineering (TE) is a branch of Regenerative Medicine (RM) that combines stem cells and biomaterial scaffolds to create living tissue constructs to restore patients' organs after injury or disease. Over the last decade, emerging technologies such as 3D bioprinting, biofabrication, supramolecular materials, induced pluripotent stem cells, and organoids have entered the field. While this rapidly evolving field is expected to have great therapeutic potential, its development from bench to bedside presents several ethical and societal challenges. To make sure TE will reach its ultimate goal of improving patient welfare, these challenges should be mapped out and evaluated. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the ethical implications of the development and application of TE for regenerative purposes, as mentioned in the academic literature. A search query in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PhilPapers yielded 2451 unique articles. After systematic screening, 237 relevant ethical and biomedical articles published between 2008 and 2021 were included in our review. We identified a broad range of ethical implications that could be categorized under 10 themes. Seven themes trace the development from bench to bedside: (1) animal experimentation, (2) handling human tissue, (3) informed consent, (4) therapeutic potential, (5) risk and safety, (6) clinical translation, and (7) societal impact. Three themes represent ethical safeguards relevant to all developmental phases: (8) scientific integrity, (9) regulation, and (10) patient and public involvement. This review reveals that since 2008 a significant body of literature has emerged on how to design clinical trials for TE in a responsible manner. However, several topics remain in need of more attention. These include the acceptability of alternative translational pathways outside clinical trials, soft impacts on society and questions of ownership over engineered tissues. Overall, this overview of the ethical and societal implications of the field will help promote responsible development of new interventions in TE and RM. It can also serve as a valuable resource and educational tool for scientists, engineers, and clinicians in the field by providing an overview of the ethical considerations relevant to their work. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the ethical implications of Tissue Engineering (TE) have been reviewed systematically. By gathering existing scholarly work and identifying knowledge gaps, this review facilitates further research into the ethical and societal implications of TE and Regenerative Medicine (RM) and other emerging biomedical technologies. Moreover, it will serve as a valuable resource and educational tool for scientists, engineers, and clinicians in the field by providing an overview of the ethical considerations relevant to their work. As such, our review may promote successful and responsible development of new strategies in TE and RM.","De Kanter, Anne Floor J.;Jongsma, Karin R.;Verhaar, Marianne C.;Bredenoord, Annelien L.",Journal,Tissue Engineering - Part B: Reviews,2023-04-01,Erasmus School of Philosophy;University Medical Center Utrecht,bioethics ;  regenerative medicine ;  responsible innovation ;  scientific integrity ;  social impact ;  tissue engineering
Nexus between digital transformation and energy technology innovation: An empirical test of A-share listed enterprises,"In the era of digital economy, the economic model combining “substantial economy” and “digitalization” has spurred China's innovation activities, in particular energy technology innovation (ETI), with digital transformation (DT) becoming necessary for enterprises to stay competitive. However, how DT contributes to ETI remains unclear in both literature and practice. Recognizing their importance in ultimately sustaining enterprises' competitiveness, in this study we explore the nexus and mechanism between enterprise DT and ETI. In our research methodology, the data collected pertains to 1747 enterprises listed in A-shares from 2011 to 2019. We develop both static and dynamic benchmark regression models and a moderation effect model to test the relationships between DT and ETI. In addition, to address the endogeneity issue in model application, we introduce exogenous instrumental variables and adopt the generalized method of moment and a two-stage least square method. Our findings highlight that DT has not only a positive impact on ETI but also a heterogeneous effect on ETI in the types of enterprise ownerships and bias of energy technology progress. Moreover, it affects ETI mainly through total agency costs, financial technology, and research and development investment. Based on the findings, we offer policy recommendations for the coordination of digital economy and energy transition, providing guidance for developing countries. For example, digital platforms are recommended to be implemented at both the enterprise and national levels, in attempting to facilitate the development of digital economy and smart energy.","Du, Juntao;Shen, Zhiyang;Song, Malin;Zhang, Linda",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-04-01,Anhui University of Finance and Economics;Lille Économie Management ( LEM ),Digital transformation ;  Energy technology innovation ;  Moderation effect model ;  Word frequency
Towards next generation polymer surfaces: Nano- and microlayers of star macromolecules and their design for applications in biology and medicine,"Star polymers with well-defined molecular architectures have been widely studied in the last few decades. Of particular interest has been processing-structure-property relationships of star polymers in the thin film form and their potential applications in the field of biology and medicine. This review presents the state-of-the-art of research on nano- and microlayers of star polymers on solid substrates explored in the last two decades. We start the discussion with a short introduction to the general features of star polymers to introduce the reader to the subject. Subsequently, methods for the preparation of star polymer nano- and microlayers on solid surfaces and their resulting properties are discussed. Special emphasis will be given to the differences between the properties of layers obtained from star polymers and their linear analogues. The potential of star polymer nano- and microlayers to drive innovations in polymer technology will be illustrated with examples in areas such as antibacterial films, tissue engineering, or in systems delivering bioactive substances. Finally, a brief summary of challenges and future perspectives in the field of this interesting generation of polymeric materials is given.","Mendrek, Barbara;Oleszko-Torbus, Natalia;Teper, Paulina;Kowalczuk, Agnieszka",Journal,Progress in Polymer Science,2023-04-01,Polish Academy of Sciences,Grafting to ;  Nanostructured surfaces ;  Star polymer coatings ;  Star polymer layers ;  Star polymers ;  Surface functionalization
Carbon neutrality and green technology innovation efficiency in Chinese textile industry,"The present trend of rapid expansion in the textile industry is highly polluting and energy intensive, and the government intervention is necessitated. This study develops a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, examines the green technology innovation of listed textile enterprises, and explores its determining factors in order to address the issue of carbon emission reduction in the textile sector. The research sample for this study is obtained from 42 listed textile enterprises from 2017 to 2020. The research demonstrates: (1) the green technology innovation efficiency of domestic listed textile enterprises remains marginal; (2) from 2017 to 2020, the mean value of total factor productivity (TFP) and its decomposition index of listed enterprises in China's textile industry exhibit a downward trend, primarily as a consequence of the slowdown of technological progress; (3) the green technology of the entire industry is in recession from 2017 to 2020; (4) green technology innovation efficiency is inversely correlated with government subsidies, but positively correlated with net profit and asset size of enterprises. In light of the above information, enterprises should boost their ability to innovate with green technologies and implement a research and development (R&D) management development strategy that gives equal consideration to both economic and environmental benefits.","Xu, Xiaofeng;Cui, Xiaodan;Zhang, Yifan;Chen, Xiangyu;Li, Wenhong",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-04-01,East China University of Political Science and Law;Tongji University;Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Carbon neutrality ;  DEA ;  Green technology innovation ;  Textile enterprises
Cooperative Learning in Green Building Demonstration Projects: Insights from 30 Innovative and Environmentally Sustainable Demonstrations around the World,"Within the context of sustainable innovation in the building industry, the goal of this study is to investigate and discuss forms of cooperative learning in project organizations as an opportunity for realizing sustainable innovation. This paper analyzes 30 worldwide cases of sustainably innovative building projects, concentrating on the cooperative learning behavior of actors that ignite and contribute to sustainable building innovation. The analysis sheds light on three clusters of project organizations, their typical cooperative learning processes, and the cooperative sustainable learning effects achieved. Theoretically, this work contributes by suggesting an analytical model to study learning forms that support sustainable building innovation; practically, this study indicates that cooperative learning practices facilitate professionals, regardless of their role in project organizations, to be innovators in proposing and achieving green innovation in the construction engineering sector.","Nigra, Marianna;Bossink, Bart",Journal,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,2023-04-01,Politecnico di Torino;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Cooperative learning ;  Demonstration projects ;  engineering ;  Green construction ;  Sustainable building ;  Sustainable innovation
Is high-speed rail heading towards a low-carbon industry? Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in China,"Existing studies have investigated the environmental dividends of substituting high-speed rail (HSR) for other energy-intensive vehicles from an engineering standpoint, but they have yet to explore the economic effects of HSR and the associated carbon emissions reduction benefits. To fill the research gap, we use panel data from 285 Chinese cities between 2004 and 2014, and employ a spatial difference-in-differences model to empirically examine the impact of HSR opening on industrial CO2 emissions. After controlling for spillover effects from neighboring HSR cities, our results show that cities offering HSR services significantly reduce their own industrial CO2 emissions. This finding is robust and is unaffected by outliers, control group selection, time trends, geography and expectation factors, or endogeneity. The mechanism test reveals that the structural transformation effect, technological innovation effect, and investment attractiveness effect are three intermediate influence channels. Further research finds that the emissions reduction benefit increases as the spatial and temporal intensities of HSR openings ascend the ladder, and HSR services have a spillover effect within a 300-kilometer radius. Moreover, the carbon benefit of China's HSR far surpasses its carbon footprint, indicating that China's HSR is green after accounting for economic emissions reductions that were often neglected in prior research. Based on these findings, we recommend that China accelerate HSR expansion in order to reduce carbon emissions in a scientific and responsible manner.","Nie, Liang;Zhang, Zhong Xiang",Journal,Resource and Energy Economics,2023-04-01,Tianjin University;China Academy of Energy,China ;  CO  emissions 2 ;  High-speed rail ;  Impact mechanism ;  Spatial difference-in-differences
Investigation of dynamic behavior of prestressed FRP plate intended for strengthening prestressed RC beam,"Strengthening concrete beams by prestressed or not prestressed composite plates has become one of the widely used techniques in civil engineering with the aim of improving the durability of infrastructures, specifically against seismic solicitations. However, this type of reinforcement is quite new for prestressed concrete beams. Before using a composite plate for strengthening prestressed concrete beams, it is important to know its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, an analytical model based on the high-order theory and the laminate theory is proposed in order to well determine the free vibration characteristics of presetressed composite plate. The presence of prestressing tension effort in the composite plate, which was not taken into consideration in earlier studies for slender composite plates, is the main innovation of the current research. Parametric studies varying prestressing effort and fiber orientations are carried out in aim to find the best way to use the composite plate in the reinforcing of prestressed concrete beams. For comparative purposes, a finite element model is carried out in order to explore the behavior of the composite plate under several boundary conditions (B.Cs). As an important result, this research reveals that prestressing effort stiffens the composite plate and makes it a strong choice for reinforcing prestressed concrete beams by increasing natural frequencies and reducing deflexion.","Benali, Khaled;Krour, Baghdad;Atif Benatta, Mohamed;Hafid, Khetir;Bachir Bouiadjra, Mohamed;Mechab, Ismail;Bernard, Fabrice",Journal,Engineering Structures,2023-04-01,Université des Sciences et de la Technologie d’Oran Mohamed-Boudiaf;Université Djillali Liabes de Sidi Bel Abbes;INSA Rennes;Algerian National Thematic Agency of Research in Science and Technology (ATRST),Finite element model ;  High order theory ;  Laminate theory ;  Natural frequencies ;  Prestressed composite plates ;  Prestressed concrete beams
Leverage effect or crowding out effect? Evidence from low-carbon city pilot and energy technology innovation in China,"Energy technology composed of renewable and fossil energy is not entirely beneficial to the environment. Consequently, we believe that the direction of energy technology innovation should be clean to achieve sustainable development. This paper takes the low-carbon city pilot as a quasi-natural experiment, employs the difference-in-difference method and the energy technology patent data with A-share listed enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2007 to 2019 to explore the incentive effect, mechanism, and heterogeneity of low-carbon city pilot on the direction of energy technology innovation. We found that (1) the low-carbon city pilot has an incentive effect on the direction of energy technology innovation by promoting renewable energy technology, which indicates that the clean direction of energy technology innovation is taking shape. (2) The incentive effect of low-carbon city pilot on energy technology innovation is not the leverage effect superimposed on the established innovation activities of enterprises, but the crowding out effect on other technological innovation. This means that the pilot policy is suspected of negatively the productivity of enterprises. (3) The quality of energy technology innovation has not been stimulated, renewable energy technologies that are easy to generate high economic benefits are favored by enterprises, and environmental information disclosure profits to improve the policy effect of low-carbon city pilot. This study provides implications for the effective implementation of environmental policy and the synergistic of renewable and fossil energy technologies.","Qu, Fang;Xu, Lei;He, Chunyan",Journal,Sustainable Cities and Society,2023-04-01,Xihua University,Energy technology innovation ;  Environmental regulation ;  Fossil energy technology ;  Low-carbon city pilot ;  Renewable energy technology
The three pointers of research and development (R&D) for growth-boosting sustainable innovation system,"Research and development (R&D) is frequently touted and labelled as the fundamental engine for creating sustainable innovations and achieving climate transitions. Yet, recent R&D efforts have struggled to live up to the widespread life-altering results they delivered in the 1960s when the term R&D was coined. In our attempt to address this concern, we propose a sustainability pathway model to achieving an economically viable innovation system that is anchored in three important pointers of R&D which have long been viewed as mutually distinct components in R&D budgets—investment, talent, and learning institutions. Directing attention to the pervasive need to align R&D investments with talents and learning institutions, we delineate how these pointers of R&D coming together to constitute a trivalent force may drive a growth-boosting sustainable innovation system. While there is no simple recipe which suggests an optimal combination of new scientific understanding, technologies, and process that could help produce the much-needed innovations and technological change, we present a set of propositions that highlights opportunities for reflection on existing R&D investment strategies and serves as a bridge to connect the emergent scholarship on sustainability with the intellectual traditions of R&D in innovation management.","Sarpong, David;Boakye, Derrick;Ofosu, George;Botchie, David",Journal,Technovation,2023-04-01,Brunel Business School;Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen,Innovation ;  Learning institutions ;  Research and Development (R&D) ;  Sustainability ;  Talent
Engaging solution-based design process for integrated STEM program development: an exploratory study through autoethnographic design practice,"The role of design in the exploration of integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has rapidly expanded in recent years. Design has made an important contribution by providing instructional scaffolds in synthesising knowledge from multiple disciplines to solve real-world problems. Despite the potential of Design-based Pedagogy (DBP), there is a paucity of applicable DBP process models for constructing integrated STEM tasks and formulating implementation approaches. To address this issue, we enquire into the Solution-based Design Process (SBDP) that reconciles curriculum content knowledge and teaching through authentic problem finding and solving. Through an exploratory study of a self-critical reflection in autoethnographic design practice, we explore how the optimised SBDP can inform (i) The design skills and mindsets of DBP for integrated STEM education, and (ii) The instructional processes for constructing and implementing integrated STEM tasks involving design models. As found in this study, a unique feature of the Solution-based DBP is that it relates to the processes of thinking and reasoning—highly cognitive and logical; its application requires the skilled operation of 3D printing-based digital fabrication. Additionally, we demonstrated a Solution-based DBP, combined with 3D printing-based digital fabrication, and providing teachers with a structural blueprint for developing integrated STEM programs. Overall, this research contributes to the corpus of methodologically rigorous and evidence-based studies on design-led integrated STEM curriculums in the context of a specific country’s education system.","Zhou, Ding;Gomez, Rafael;Davis, James;Rittenbruch, Markus",Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2023-04-01,Southern University of Science and Technology;Queensland University of Technology,3D printing ;  Design-based pedagogy ;  Design-led educational innovation ;  Digital fabrication ;  Integrated STEM education ;  Solution-based design process
Technology-driven design process: teaching and mentoring technology-driven design process in industrial design education,"The Industrial Design (ID) education offers numerous opportunities for students to learn the market and user-centered approach; however, in cases in which design students lack technical knowledge, they can have difficulty and lack confidence in technology-driven design projects. The purpose of this study is to answer a research question “how are design students and recent graduates currently educated to contribute their design ability to the technology-driven NPD process?” A grounded theory approach was used to understand how design educators and practitioners teach, guide, and mentor ID students and novice industrial designers. Primary (semi-structured interviews and surveys) and secondary (syllabi and class activities about technology-driven design process) data were collected and reviewed to understand (1) ID educators’ and practitioners’ teaching/mentoring experience in technology-driven design projects and (2) ID students’ and recently graduated students’ experience in technology-driven design projects. Synthesizing both primary and secondary data led to the development of a technology-driven process model that will help to guide how to teach and mentor ID students and novice designers within a technology-driven context.","Kim, Byungsoo;Joines, Sharon;Feng, Jing",Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2023-04-01,NC State University;Kansas State University,Design methods ;  Design process ;  Industrial design education ;  Technology-driven innovation
Survey of Deep Representation Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Traditionally, speech emotion recognition (SER) research has relied on manually handcrafted acoustic features using feature engineering. However, the design of handcrafted features for complex SER tasks requires significant manual effort, which impedes generalisability and slows the pace of innovation. This has motivated the adoption of representation learning techniques that can automatically learn an intermediate representation of the input signal without any manual feature engineering. Representation learning has led to improved SER performance and enabled rapid innovation. Its effectiveness has further increased with advances in deep learning (DL), which has facilitated deep representation learning where hierarchical representations are automatically learned in a data-driven manner. This article presents the first comprehensive survey on the important topic of deep representation learning for SER. We highlight various techniques, related challenges and identify important future areas of research. Our survey bridges the gap in the literature since existing surveys either focus on SER with hand-engineered features or representation learning in the general setting without focusing on SER.","Latif, Siddique;Rana, Rajib;Khalifa, Sara;Jurdak, Raja;Qadir, Junaid;Schuller, Bjorn",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,2023-04-01,Computer Science and Engineering Department;The University of Queensland;Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation;UNSW Sydney;University of Southern Queensland;Universität Augsburg;Imperial College London;Queensland University of Technology,domain adaptation ;  multi task learning ;  representation learning ;  Speech emotion recognition ;  unsupervised learning
Combining the Analysis of Vertical and Horizontal Technology Convergence: Insights From the Case of Urban Innovation,"Technology convergence is 'the blurring of boundaries' between many sectors of technologies, resulting in the emergence of several new technologies. This phenomenon has been happening in many fields. While technology convergence has been analyzed often on a horizontal level, the whole landscape of technology movement among and within different system levels is still a question. Answers to this question can lead to an improvement of theory as well as new approaches for practitioners working in this field. We select urban innovation with its complex infrastructure as a test-bed in order to answer the question in a case study. We apply the Cooperative Patent Classification co-classification analysis to the USA patent data related to urban innovation in a systematic view from 1976 to 2018. Our study provides some insights into technology convergence in urban innovation based on the analysis of different system levels (vertical convergence) and within the super-system regarding city infrastructures (horizontal convergence). We find that both types of technology convergence occur in parallel. While some technological movements seem to be related to each other, others do not. This leads to the conclusion that at least in the case of related technology movements, researchers should integrate different system levels in their analysis.","Nguyen, Ngoc Uyen Phuong;Moehrle, Martin G.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-04-01,University of Economics - The University of Danang;Universität Bremen,Emerging technologies ;  fusion ;  patent analysis ;  smart cities ;  technology convergence ;  technology evolution ;  urban innovation
"Biological prosthesis, platelet enriched plasma and bone marrow stem cells in complicated incisional hernia reconstruction in emergency surgery: a prospective case control study","Numerous innovations have been aided by abdominal wall surgical repair. Abdominal wall surgery was drastically altered by synthetic materials. Tissue engineering was unquestionably first applied to biomaterials. The purpose of the present study is to compare different repeating approaches with rising tissue engineering complexity in repairing complex incisional hernia in emergency setting. Patients with complicated incisional hernia were prospec- tively included in the study and divided into 4 groups: DR (Direct Repair) group underwent direct reconstruction of the abdominal wall, BR (Biological mesh Repair) group underwent reconstruction of the abdominal wall with biological mesh (retro-muscular), BPR [Biological mesh and Platelet Enriched Plasma (PEP), gel] group underwent reconstruction of the abdominal wall with Biological mesh (retro-muscular) and PEP, BPSR (biological mesh, PEP gel and Bone Marrow Stem Cells) group underwent reconstruction of the abdominal wall with biological mesh (retro-muscular), PEP and Bone Marrow Stem cells (BMSc). Forty patients were enrolled. Patients in the DR group experienced a higher rate of severe complication (p<0.05). Recurrence rates were 60% for DR patients, 20% for BM patients and 10% for the BM+PEP group (p<0.05). Median follow-up period was 64.6, 55.7 and 55.8 months (p<0.05). 7-and 30-days abdominal wall thick-ness is progressively increased by different techniques: BP, BP+PEP and BP+PEP+BMSc (p<0.05). No mortality was regis-tered. Tissue engineering techniques in abdominal wall reconstruction showed promising results. They seem to reduce the recurrence rate without increasing complication one in complicated incisional abdominal wall hernia. Although many aspects are yet to be deter-mined and standardized, it seems extremely important to continue research and experimentation in this field.","Coccolini, Federico;Paratore, Filippo;Tartaglia, Dario;Cremonini, Camilla;Zocco, Giuseppe;Cobuccio, Luigi;Chiarugi, Massimo",Journal,Emergency Care Journal,2023-03-28,Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana;Ravenna Hospital,bone marrow ;  hernia reconstruction ;  platelet enriched plasma ;  stem cell ;  tissue engineering

How Can AI Help Improve Food Safety?,"With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the development and implementation of digital food systems are becoming increasingly possible. There is tremendous interest in using different AI applications, such as machine learning models, natural language processing, and computer vision to improve food safety. Possible AI applications are broad and include, but are not limited to, (a) food safety risk prediction and monitoring as well as food safety optimization throughout the supply chain, (b) improved public health systems (e.g., by providing early warning of outbreaks and source attribution), and (c) detection, identification, and characterization of foodborne pathogens. However, AI technologies in food safety lag behind in commercial development because of obstacles such as limited data sharing and limited collaborative research and development efforts.

The current and displacement data of the simulation and prototype experiments are compared and analyzed. The results show that when the power supply is AC 220 V 50 Hz full-wave rectification, the closing device can complete a 6 mm stroke within 19.6 ms, which verifies the correctness of the simulation results.

Relationships Between the Properties of Three Hot Engineering Granular Materials and Their Environmental Behaviors or Cytotoxicity,"With the innovation inmaterial science and technology, many new particulate materials have emerged, including particularly nanoparticles (NPs), microplastics (MPs) and biochars (BCs). The unique physical and chemical properties of these materials allow them to be applied in a variety of fields, such as biomedicine, packaging and pollution control. To date, the potential risks of these emerging materials on human health have not yet been fully understood during the application process. Although their cytotoxicity effects and reaction mechanisms have gradually become research hotspots worldwide, few efforts have been put on comparing the health risks of these new particulate materials at present. The unique properties of these materials, such as small size, high charge density and complex dissolved substances, could not only affect their environmental behaviors, but largely affect their toxic mechanisms and effects on animals, plants and microbial cells. Therefore, the objective of the present article is to compare and discuss how the physical properties of NPs, MPs, and BCs, including particle size, surface charge and dissolution rate, influence their corresponding environmental behaviors in adsorption and aggregation. Subsequently, the toxicity mechanisms (e.g. particle size, surface charge and dissolved substances) of these particular materials on animals, plants and microbial cells were also explored and summarized in the present study. The potential research gaps were analyzed, based on which the suggestions for improvement were present to provide fundamental knowledge in carrying out the risk assessment of emerging materials with similar properties.","Huang, Xuegang;Liu, Yang;Li, Bowen;Tan, Cong;Tan, Chunling;Song, Lan;Qiu, Hao",Journal,Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,2023-03-25,Southern University of Science and Technology;Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Kunming University of Science and Technology,biochars ;  cytotoxicity ;  environmental behavior ;  microplastics ;  nanoparticles
Speech Recognition Method Based on Deep Learning of Artificial Intelligence: An example of BLSTM-CTC model,"Under the influence of information, network and intelligent high-speed development situation, China's intelligent technology and other aspects have made great progress and achievements, derived a lot of advanced artificial intelligence technology, machine learning technology and deep learning technology, etc., to promote the development of intelligence and information in major fields. Artificial intelligence deep learning is the fusion of artificial intelligence technology and machine learning technology, which lays the foundation for the reform and innovation of artificial voice intelligent recognition technology and intelligent robot technology. So in order to improve the application level of intelligent speech recognition technology, it is necessary to continuously optimize the speech recognition method based on AI deep learning. In this regard, according to the relevant literature, this paper addresses the problem that phoneme features of varying duration are generated during the propagation of speech signals, and these features affect the correct rate of speech recognition, and the phoneme features of different lengths are standardized based on the deep learning research mentioned in this paper with BLSTM-CTC as an example.

Teaching Experiment of Engineering Mechanics Based on Finite Element Technology,"This study suggests utilizing digital teaching resources, specifically color U3 nephogram, to enhance the effectiveness of Engineering Mechanics classroom instruction. To establish this approach, the research team created a finite element model based on a challenging problem. By collecting and applying numerous digital materials, we conducted a teaching experiment with 37 students.

Research progress in tissue engineering scaffolds by 3D bioprinting,"Significance Tissue engineering is a new interdisciplinary field with great potential. It aims to solve the problems of repair, maintenance, improvement and replacement of tissue functions through the integration and innovation of engineering and life sciences. At present, planting functional cells into scaffolds with good biocompatibility and degradability, culturing in vitro for a period of time, and implanting into the body after maturation is the main way to repair or reconstruct tissue defects. 3D printing technology can synchronize the accumulation and forming of cells and biological materials, ensure the proliferation of cells in biological scaffolds and the transfer of nutrients and metabolic wastes, and have the advantages of stable structure and controllable shape, which is one of the most potential methods to realize the industrial manufacturing of tissue scaffolds. However, different from industrial 3D printing technology, 3D bioprinting requires special materials and processes, which are the basis for forming three-dimensional, porous network structures. In view of the characteristics of 3D bioprinting, this paper reviews the progress of 3D bioprinting technology, materials and applications for tissue engineering, so as to provide a reference for further promoting the development of 3D bioprinting technology for tissue engineering and the research in related fields. Progress Based on the current 3D bioprinting methods and the formation mechanism of related materials, this paper reviews the research progress of tissue engineering scaffolds prepared by 3D bioprinting in detail. There are four categories of 3D bioprinting technology: inkjet printing, extrusion printing, laser assisted printing and stereo lithography. Inkjet printing ink has low density with long curing time, which tends to cause cell drying and death after printing. Extrusion printing with high viscosity may cause nozzle blockage. The combination of biological materials with good rheological and mechanical properties and natural materials with good biological properties can effectively solve this problem. Laser assisted stereo lithography avoids the problem of nozzle blockage, but it also has the problems of high cost and residual biotoxic materials. As for the 3D biological printing materials, biological ceramic materials and polymers are mainly introduced, including their characteristics, curing mechanism and the application range. Chemical modification of natural materials or combining them with synthetic polymers can effectively adjust the mechanical property and biocompatibility of scaffolds, such as meth acrylic anhydride, gelatin (GelMA) in recent years has become a commonly used material in 3D biological printing. As a densifier, polyethylene oxide (PEO) can not only improve the printability of GelMA and other materials, but also flexibly regulate the pore size and void structure of the printing scaffold because of the water solubility of PEO through removing it. Aiming at the application of 3D bioprinting, this paper mainly introduces the latest research progress of 3D bioprinting in the construction of functional tissues such as blood vessels, bone, ears and hearts, which provides theoretical and practical reference for further promoting the development of 3D bioprinting technology for tissue engineering. Conclusions and Prospect This paper mainly introduced the 3D printing technology, materials and application and expounds the principles, operation process and the advantages and disadvantages of the inkjet printing, extrusion printing, laser assisted and stereo lithography printing technology. The technology problems such as speed, accuracy, cell survival and activity still need to be solved, especially for inkjet and extrusion biological print, in which cells are to be blocked by nozzles, and how to balance cell viability (requiring a large nozzle size) and printing accuracy (requiring a small nozzle size) is the main challenge. In terms of materials, the research of 3D bioprinting materials still has a great development space, including endowing materials with more abundant molding methods (such as light/thermal, physical/chemical double cross-linking, etc.) to improve their mechanical properties and printability, thereby improving the structural plasticity and stability of scaffolds. Based on the biomimetic principle, multimaterial materials, cells and bioactive factors are combined to improve biocompatibility. Heterogeneous and gradient composite 3D bioprinting materials are expected to meet the needs of complex biological tissues. It will be an important research direction in the future to regulate the degradation properties of materials and further study the structure and properties of 3D bioprinted scaffolds with time. At present, although the use of 3D bioprinting technology has successfully constructed functional tissues such as blood vessels, bone, ears, and heart, its clinical application is still in the initial stage. How to maintain cell activity, achieve organ function reconstruction, and solve the internal vascularization problem will be an important development direction in the future. It is believed that with the continuous improvement of 3D bioprinting technology and materials, 3D bioprinting will bring revolutionary changes to tissue engineering.","Wang, Shudong;Ma, Qian;Wang, Ke;Gu, Yuanhui",Journal,Fangzhi Xuebao/Journal of Textile Research,2023-03-15,Soochow University;Ltd;Yancheng Polytechnic College,3D bioprinting ;  biomaterial ;  extrusion printing ;  inkjet printing ;  laser assisted printing ;  medical textile ;  stereo lithography ;  tissue engineering

Energy subsidies and energy technology innovation: Policies for polygeneration systems diffusion,"Many countries have considered energy subsidies, with both successes and failures. Energy subsidies often have failed to achieve their stated objective of advancing national economic, social, and technological progress. Budgetary savings from the removal of energy subsidies and the resulting upsurge in energy prices may induce the adoption of innovative technologies in a country. The economic impact of energy subsidies has been analyzed for many countries in the literature. However, this issue with energy technology innovation using panel analysis has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study is intended to discover the effect of energy subsidies on energy technology innovation in the 25 highest energy subsidy-providing countries for the period of 2010–2020, employing advanced econometric approaches. The results confirm that energy subsidies and energy technology innovation are significantly cointegrated, and the removal of energy subsidies stimulates technological innovation, which induces the adoption of a renewable-based polygeneration system. The policy implication of this paper suggests going for further innovations in energy subsidy reforms for sustainability and technological innovation for polygeneration that may contribute to clean, sustainable, and affordable energy for all (SDG-7).","Hosan, Shahadat;Rahman, Md Matiar;Karmaker, Shamal Chandra;Saha, Bidyut Baran",Journal,Energy,2023-03-15,University of Dhaka;Kyushu University,Cointegration ;  Energy price ;  Energy subsidies ;  Polygeneration ;  Technological innovation

Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions,"Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well-known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers is investigated. These interactions are dually regulated by side-chain isomerization and end-cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA-series) exhibit stronger crystallinity with preferential face-on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC-series). In addition, the PM6 and LA-series acceptors exhibit moderate donor/acceptor interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC-series pairs, which helps to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors are over 14%. Moreover, LA-series acceptors show appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP-eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well-organized “alloy-like” mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23 further optimizes multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which results in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.","Han, Chenyu;Wang, Jianxiao;Zhang, Shuai;Chen, Liangliang;Bi, Fuzhen;Wang, Junjie;Yang, Chunming;Wang, Pengchao;Li, Yonghai;Bao, Xichang",Journal,Advanced Materials,2023-03-09,"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences;Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology;Institute of Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences;Qingdao University of Science and Technology;Shandong Energy Institute",compatibility ;  crystallinity ;  multidimensional interactions ;  organic solar cells ;  phenylalkyl
Experiences Piloting a Diversity and Inclusion in Computing Innovations Course,"With society's increasing dependence on computing innovations - -especially technologies that impact decision-making in fields such as healthcare, financial services, child welfare, hiring, safety, and policing - -it is increasingly important for the future creators of these innovations to learn how technologies can potentially negatively impact people of different identities and backgrounds. Unfortunately, few universities offer courses designed specifically for Computer Science and Engineering students to explore the issues of diversity, equity and inclusion of computing innovations. In this paper, we describe a one-semester, 3-credit course that we developed and piloted to address this gap at our institution. We describe the learning objectives, course schedule, in-class activities, and assignments, including pre-class preparation work, reflective journaling, and a capstone project. After significant discussion and activities on unpacking identity, the course covers nine different categories of computing innovations and the potential impacts on different identities. We summarize the resulting student artifacts and reflections, along with the instructors' reflections and steps toward further institutionalizing this kind of learning and reflection in a computer science program.","Kong, Minji;Pollock, Lori",Conference Proceeding,SIGCSE 2023 - Proceedings of the 54th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2023-03-02,University of Delaware,computing innovations ;  diversity ;  equity ;  inclusion
"Innovation models and interdisciplinarity in science, technology and innovation policy in Costa Rica","Purpose: This paper aims to analyse innovation models and interdisciplinarity in science, technology and innovation (STI) policy in Costa Rica between 2015 and 2021. The core focus is to evaluate the public policy in light of the groundwork that sustains the designed and proposed actions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied a qualitative approach to build a set of dimensions and conducted content-analysis of selected documents. The analysis encompasses all current STI public policy documents in Costa Rica, including the planning instruments of the Central Government and the National Policy on STI. Findings: The main findings show that STI policy in Costa Rica is based on different innovation models, but the projects and instruments themselves show the predominance of the reductionist model. Innovation receives a residual role. In turn, interdisciplinarity is based on the concept of convergence, which limits disciplinary collaboration to the natural, physical and engineering sciences, minimising contributions from other fields of knowledge to an instrumental role in innovation processes. Practical implications: The authors conclude that the interlinkage between open innovation models, the participation of diverse societal actors and the inclusion of an interdisciplinary perspective leads to inclusive and more democratic public policy, allowing more sectors and organisations to benefit from innovation processes. This would imply a greater reach and impact of the policy, conditions that translate into innovation achievements and a better return on public investment. Originality/value: This paper contributes to current discussions on STI policy by studying the implications of the link among policies, innovation models and interdisciplinarity.","Soto Kiewit, Luis Diego;Vienni Baptista, Bianca",Journal,Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,2023-03-02,Universidad Nacional;ETH Zürich,Costa Rica ;  Innovation models ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Qualitative research ;  Science policy ;  Technology and innovation policies

Advances in subsea carbon dioxide utilization and storage,"Decisive steps in innovation and competitiveness are needed to meet global greenhouse gas emissions and climate goals. As an effective method for reducing carbon emissions, carbon dioxide (CO2) storage and utilization on the seabed enable the transport of captured CO2 via pipelines or ships to permanent storage sites, such as saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs in subsea sediments, or by injecting CO2 for the replacement and displacement of subsea resources (oil, gas, gas hydrates, etc.). Subsea CO2 utilization and storage (SCUS) involves several research hotspots worldwide, including international and local laws and regulations, security, economics, environmental impact, and public acceptance. Its current research and engineering progress are also of great interest. In addition, the vigorous implementation of the energy transition and the rapid development of renewable energy sources globally have resulted in significant advancements in SCUS. This paper provides an overview of carbon dioxide storage and utilization mechanism in the seabed, analyzes key technical and economic issues, and summarizes existing research on safety risks, monitoring technologies, and investment and operating cost control to identify remaining knowledge gaps. This is followed by an overview of global engineering practice to update on current progress. Finally, combined with the actualities of China, the potential and trend of China's seabed carbon storage and utilization are summarized. This review demonstrates the enormous development prospects for seabed carbon storage and utilization, although some risks remain including leakage and contamination, with which innovation in monitoring technologies and the self-sealing effect of gas hydrate, safe subsea utilization and storage of CO2 can be achieved. Additionally, considering the development of renewable energy and the demand for large-scale energy storage, hydrogen, ammonia, or other energy carriers and carbon dioxide storage and utilization can be coupled into an industrial chain to form an economically competitive carbon geological storage mode.","Luo, Jiashun;Xie, Yachen;Hou, Michael Z.;Xiong, Ying;Wu, Xunning;Lüddeke, Christian Truitt;Huang, Liangchao",Journal,Energy Reviews,2023-03-01,Technische Universität Clausthal;Zhengzhou University;Southwest Petroleum University China;Peking University;Wuhan Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences,CO  hydrate 2 ;  CO  storage and utilization 2 ;  Economic evaluation ;  Subsea ;  Technical challenges

Academic Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurial Advisors and Their Advisees’ Outcomes,"The transfer of complex knowledge and skills is difficult, often requiring intensive interaction and extensive periods of coworking between a mentor and mentee, which is particularly true in apprenticeship-like settings and on-the-job training. This paper studies a context that quintessentially describes this type of learning: the academic laboratory. I focus on ways a change in the attention of a principal investigator, moving to entrepreneurship, may influence knowledge transmission and skill development by examining the relationship of this change with their PhD students’ scientific productivity and careers. To do so, I rely on novel restricted-access data encompassing faculty and PhD students in computer sciences, engineering, and the life sciences who were active at an elite U.S. research university from 2001 to 2017. The results suggest a substantial negative association between a professor’s entrepreneurial activity and the short- and long-run publication output of the PhD students they train. Furthermore, I detect a decrease in students’ likelihood of becoming professors themselves but an increase in their likelihood of working for consulting firms on graduation. Finally, I provide evidence suggesting that changes in trainee development are the most feasible drivers of the results rather than changes in trainee research orientation, selection, or life cycle effects.","Roche, Maria P.",Journal,Organization Science,2023-03-01,Scheller College of Business;Harvard Business School,academic entrepreneurship ;  entrepreneurial supervisors ;  human capital development ;  innovation ;  knowledge-based economy ;  productivity
Spatial Effect Analysis of Forestry Technology Innovation on Forestry Industry Economic Growth,"The forestry industry is a low-carbon green industry with great potential for development, but its current development model is facing multiple dilemmas that urgently require a shift to high-quality forestry development. Neoclassical theory and endogenous growth theory consider technology innovation as the foundation of economic growth. In order to explore the impact of forestry technology innovation (FTI) on the economic growth of forestry industry, this paper uses the entropy method, spatial Durbin model, and threshold model to explore the spatial effect of forestry technology innovation on forestry industry economy for analysis and exploration of the non-linear relationship between the two, and the panel data from 31 provinces in China from 2002 to 2020 are used as the sample for empirical study. Results show that: (1) Forestry technology innovation has a significant role in promoting the economic growth of the forestry industry and has obvious spatial spillover effects, which also promotes the economic growth of forestry in neighboring regions. (2) There is a threshold effect of forestry technology innovation on the economic growth of the forestry industry. When the forestry technology innovation exceeds its optimal interval, its effect on the economic growth of forestry industry shows diminishing marginal benefits. (3) Forestry technology innovation has industrial heterogeneity on the economic growth of the forestry industry. Therefore, managers should take advantage of the growth effect of forestry technology innovation in the forestry industry at the level of sustainability, and further make full use of the spatial effect resulting from the flow of technology to establish a system of communication and learning to form a virtuous coordination of the forestry economic environment for the high-quality development of the forestry industry.","Ma, Zhuoya;Liu, Tianle;Li, Jing;Liu, Zhentao;Chen, Wenhui",Journal,Forests,2023-03-01,Hebei Agricultural University;Beijing Forestry University,forestry industry economic growth ;  forestry technology innovation ;  spatial Dubin model ;  spatial effects ;  threshold model
Developing a Spatial Framework for Ship Vulnerability Assessment Based on Category Theory,"Ships vulnerability analysis is one of the most important issues in today’s research, to reduce damage and increase safety. To increase the safety of ships, the effective parameters of the vulnerability of ships, the impact of each of them, and the relationship between these parameters should be identified to formulate different scenarios to analyze the vulnerability of ships. This process leads to the formation of simulation models to assess the risk of vessels. The creation of a spatial conceptual framework is needed to create integrated vulnerability models. The most important innovation of this research is the development of a spatial framework for analyzing ships’ vulnerability based on category theory. A framework that can be used to model the various scenarios of ships’ vulnerability from a variety of perspectives. To provide this framework, objects, operators, relationships, and assumptions for vulnerability analysis have been developed. To better express and convey the concepts, the spatial framework of the vulnerability analysis is presented in the form of category theory, which is a mathematical structure. The category theory is a good tool for expressing and creating a mathematical structure for objects and complex relationships in the real world, where other tools do not have this ability. The benefits of the built-in framework have been described with an integrated, precise mathematical structure that can be generalized to other subjects. Studies show that the developed framework is capable of modeling different scenarios for vulnerability analysis to find the best solution to reduce vulnerability.","Ramezani, Abouzar;Malek, Mohammad Reza",Journal,Journal of Ship Research,2023-03-01,K.

YOLO-Based UAV Technology: A Review of the Research and Its Applications,"In recent decades, scientific and technological developments have continued to increase in speed, with researchers focusing not only on the innovation of single technologies but also on the cross-fertilization of multidisciplinary technologies. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has seen great progress in many aspects, such as geometric structure, flight characteristics, and navigation control. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm was developed and has been refined over the years to provide satisfactory performance for the real-time detection and classification of multiple targets. In the context of technology cross-fusion becoming a new focus, researchers have proposed YOLO-based UAV technology (YBUT) by integrating the above two technologies. This proposed integration succeeds in strengthening the application of emerging technologies and expanding the idea of the development of YOLO algorithms and drone technology. Therefore, this paper presents the development history of YBUT with reviews of the practical applications of YBUT in engineering, transportation, agriculture, automation, and other fields. The aim is to help new users to quickly understand YBUT and to help researchers, consumers, and stakeholders to quickly understand the research progress of the technology. The future of YBUT is also discussed to help explore the application of this technology in new areas.","Chen, Chunling;Zheng, Ziyue;Xu, Tongyu;Guo, Shuang;Feng, Shuai;Yao, Weixiang;Lan, Yubin",Journal,Drones,2023-03-01,South China Agricultural University;Shenyang Agricultural University,application ;  interdisciplinary ;  object detection ;  UAV ;  YOLO
A Taxonomy of Idea Management Tools for Supporting Front-End Innovation,"Idea management is a crucial pillar of corporate management. Organizations may save research expenses, influence future development, and maintain distinctive competency by controlling front-end ideas. To date, several idea management tools have been developed. However, it is unknown to what extent they support the idea management process. Therefore, this scoping review aims to understand the classification of idea management tools and their effectiveness through an overview of the academic literature. Electronic databases (Scopus, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science Core Index, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink) were searched, and a total of 38 journal papers (n = 38) from 2010 to 2020 were retrieved. We identified 30 different types of idea management tools categorized as digital tools (n = 21), guidelines (n = 5), and frameworks (n = 4), and these tools have been utilized by software designers, hardware designers, and stakeholders. The identified tools may support various stages of idea management, such as capturing, generating, implementing, monitoring, refinement, retrieving, selection, and sharing. However, most tools only support a single stage (either capture or generate), and they cannot track the life cycle of the ideas, which may lead to misunderstanding. Therefore, it is essential to develop tools for managing ideas that would allow end users, designers, and other stakeholders to minimize bias in selecting and prioritizing ideas.","Zhu, Di;Al Mahmud, Abdullah;Liu, Wei",Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2023-03-01,Swinburne University of Technology;Beijing Normal University,engineering design ;  fuzzy front end ;  idea generation ;  idea management ;  information system
"Comprehensive Review of Recent Advancements in Battery Technology, Propulsion, Power Interfaces, and Vehicle Network Systems for Intelligent Autonomous and Connected Electric Vehicles","Numerous recent innovations have been achieved with the goal of enhancing electric vehicles and the parts that go into them, particularly in the areas of managing energy, battery design and optimization, and autonomous driving. This promotes a more effective and sustainable eco-system and helps to build the next generation of electric car technology. This study offers insights into the most recent research and advancements in electric vehicles (EVs), as well as new, innovative, and promising technologies based on scientific data and facts associated with e-mobility from a technological standpoint, which may be achievable by 2030. Appropriate modeling and design strategies, including digital twins with connected Internet of Things (IoT), are discussed in this study. Vehicles with autonomous features have the potential to increase safety on roads, increase driving economy, and provide drivers more time to focus on other duties thanks to the Internet of Things idea. The enabling technology that entails a car moving out of a parking spot, traveling along a long highway, and then parking at the destination is also covered in this article. The development of autonomous vehicles depends on the data obtained for deployment in actual road conditions. There are also research gaps and proposals for autonomous, intelligent vehicles. One of the many social concerns that are described is the cause of an accident with an autonomous car. A smart device that can spot strange driving behavior and prevent accidents is briefly discussed. In addition, all EV-related fields are covered, including the likely technical challenges and knowledge gaps in each one, from in-depth battery material sciences through power electronics and powertrain engineering to market assessments and environmental assessments.","Abro, Ghulam E.Mustafa;Zulkifli, Saiful Azrin B.M.;Kumar, Kundan;El Ouanjli, Najib;Asirvadam, Vijanth Sagayan;Mossa, Mahmoud A.",Journal,Energies,2023-03-01,Faculty of Engineering;Université Hassan 1er;Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS,autonomous vehicles ;  digital twins ;  e-mobility ;  electric vehicles ;  EV components ;  IoT
A Preliminary Technology Readiness Assessment of Morphing Technology Applied to Case Studies,"In an innovative system, it is essential to keep under control the crucial development phases, which should consider several aspects involving, for instance, the modeling or the assessment of suitable analytical representations. Aiming to pursue a final demonstration to verify the actual capability of an engineering idea, however, some fundamental elements may have been partially considered. Many projects state the initial and final technology readiness level based on the famous scale introduced by the US National and Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) many years ago and now widespread in many fields of technology innovation. Its nine-step definition provides a high-level indication of the maturity of the observed innovative system. Trivially, the resolution of that macroscopic meter is not made for catching advancement details, but it rather provides comprehensive information on the examined technology. It is, therefore, necessary to refer to more sophisticated analysis tools that can show a more accurate picture of the development stage and helps designers to highlight points that deserve further attention and deeper analysis. The risk is to perform a very good demonstration test that can miss generality and remain confined only to that specific experimental campaign. Moving on to these assumptions, the authors expose three realizations of theirs concerning aeronautic morphing systems, to the analysis of a well-assessed Technology Readiness Level instrument. The aim is to define the aspects to be further assessed, the aspect to be considered fully mature, and even aspects that could miss some elementary point to attain full maturation. Such studies are not so frequent in the literature, and the authors believe to give a valuable, yet preliminary, contribution to the engineering of breakthrough systems. Without losing generality, the paper refers to the 2.2 version of a tool set up by the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and NASA, with the aim to standardize the evaluation process of the mentioned nine-step TRL.","Miceli, Marco Fabio;Ameduri, Salvatore;Dimino, Ignazio;Pecora, Rosario;Concilio, Antonio",Journal,Biomimetics,2023-03-01,Centro Italiano Ricerche Aerospaziali;Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II;ALI—Aerospace Laboratory for Innovative Components—S.C.A.R.L.,finger-like ;  flap ;  morphing ;  SMA ;  TRLs ;  winglet
Biomimicry and 3D-Printing of Mussel Adhesive Proteins for Regeneration of the Periodontium—A Review,"Innovation in the healthcare profession to solve complex human problems has always been emulated and based on solutions proven by nature. The conception of different biomimetic materials has allowed for extensive research that spans several fields, including biomechanics, material sciences, and microbiology. Due to the atypical characteristics of these biomaterials, dentistry can benefit from these applications in tissue engineering, regeneration, and replacement. This review highlights an overview of the application of different biomimetic biomaterials in dentistry and discusses the key biomaterials (hydroxyapatite, collagen, polymers) and biomimetic approaches (3D scaffolds, guided bone and tissue regeneration, bioadhesive gels) that have been researched to treat periodontal and peri-implant diseases in both natural dentition and dental implants. Following this, we focus on the recent novel application of mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) and their appealing adhesive properties, in addition to their key chemical and structural properties that relate to the engineering, regeneration, and replacement of important anatomical structures in the periodontium, such as the periodontal ligament (PDL). We also outline the potential challenges in employing MAPs as a biomimetic biomaterial in dentistry based on the current evidence in the literature. This provides insight into the possible increased functional longevity of natural dentition that can be translated to implant dentistry in the near future. These strategies, paired with 3D printing and its clinical application in natural dentition and implant dentistry, develop the potential of a biomimetic approach to overcoming clinical problems in dentistry.","Kwan, Jan C.;Dondani, Jay;Iyer, Janaki;Muaddi, Hasan A.;Nguyen, Thomas T.;Tran, Simon D.",Journal,Biomimetics,2023-03-01,King Khalid University;Université McGill,3D printing ;  biomaterials ;  biomimetics ;  dentistry ;  implant dentistry ;  mussel adhesive protein ;  peri-implantitis ;  periodontitis ;  periodontium ;  polydopamine ;  tissue engineering

New Frontiers in Three-Dimensional Culture Platforms to Improve Diabetes Research,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with defects in islet β-cell functioning and consequent hyperglycemia resulting in multi-organ damage. Physiologically relevant models that mimic human diabetic progression are urgently needed to identify new drug targets. Three-dimensional (3D) cell-culture systems are gaining a considerable interest in diabetic disease modelling and are being utilized as platforms for diabetic drug discovery and pancreatic tissue engineering. Three-dimensional models offer a marked advantage in obtaining physiologically relevant information and improve drug selectivity over conventional 2D (two-dimensional) cultures and rodent models. Indeed, recent evidence persuasively supports the adoption of appropriate 3D cell technology in β-cell cultivation. This review article provides a considerably updated view of the benefits of employing 3D models in the experimental workflow compared to conventional animal and 2D models. We compile the latest innovations in this field and discuss the various strategies used to generate 3D culture models in diabetic research. We also critically review the advantages and the limitations of each 3D technology, with particular attention to the maintenance of β-cell morphology, functionality, and intercellular crosstalk. Furthermore, we emphasize the scope of improvement needed in the 3D culture systems employed in diabetes research and the promises they hold as excellent research platforms in managing diabetes.","Mohandas, Sundhar;Gayatri, Vijaya;Kumaran, Kriya;Gopinath, Vipin;Paulmurugan, Ramasamy;Ramkumar, Kunka Mohanram",Journal,Pharmaceutics,2023-03-01,Malabar Cancer Centre;Stanford University School of Medicine;SRM Institute of Science and Technology,Diabetes mellitus ;  disease model ;  three-dimensional culture system ;  β-cell cultivation

Symbiotic Analysis of Security Assessment and Penetration Tests Guiding Real L4 Automated City Shuttles,"The Connected Automated Vehicle (CAV)’s deployment is proof of the wide evolution of autonomous driving technologies enabling vehicles to gradually dispose of their drivers. Within the scope of smart cities, such innovation has given rise to a new type of CAV: the Automated City Shuttle (ACS). Foreseen as the new paradigm aiming to shape the public transport model, the ACS elicits a plurality of new applications, such as the on-demand service in which a driverless shuttle offers the desired ride without human intervention. However, such a model raises cybersecurity concerns through the numerous attack surfaces and vehicle hyperconnection. This phenomenon was highlighted in several studies on CAVs, but very few research works tackled the specific case of ACSs, whose challenges and risks far exceed those of personal vehicles. The present work offers a comprehensive investigation of cybersecurity attacks, demonstrates a performed risk assessment based on the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, and showcases a penetration test over a real ACS of automation level four (L4) according to the Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE)’s ranking. Based on our experiments, we leverage fundamental cybersecurity recommendations with a focus on the ACS’s physical security.","Benyahya, Meriem;Bergerat, Pierre;Collen, Anastasija;Nijdam, Niels Alexander",Journal,Telecom,2023-03-01,Geneva School of Economics and Management,automated city shuttles ;  connected automated vehicles ;  cybersecurity ;  ISO/SAE 21434 ;  penetration testing ;  risk analysis
Process Parameters Analysis of Laser Phase Transformation Hardening on the Raceway Surface of Shield Main Bearing,"The main bearing of the shield machine has a huge structure and severe service conditions, which are prone to wear and fatigue damage. To improve the anti-wear and anti-fatigue ability of the raceway surface of the shield main bearing, laser transformation hardening under different parameters of the shield main bearing raceway material 42CrMo steel was researched. The effects of laser power and scanning speed on the phase transformation of 42CrMo steel and the depth of the hardened layer were studied. The numerical model was verified using the theoretical and experimental results. Orthogonal tables of laser processing parameters are established. The results show that the depth of the hardened raceway layer increases with increased laser power and decreased laser scanning speed. According to the results of orthogonal primary and secondary analyses and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the depth of the hardened layer of the raceway can reach 1.08 mm, and the hardened layer is relatively uniform (laser power, 2250 W; scanning speed, 20 mm/s; spot length, 5 mm). The research in this paper provides a theoretical basis and technological innovation for the processing methods and engineering applications of high-reliability and long-life shield main bearings, which is of great engineering significance.","He, Peiyu;Ding, Yi;Jiang, Shiying;Zhang, Hengjie;Shen, Tianyu;Wang, Yun",Journal,Photonics,2023-03-01,Jiangsu University,laser transformation ;  main bearing ;  primary and secondary factor ;  process parameters ;  raceway surface
Impact of E-Learning Activities on English as a Second Language Proficiency among Engineering Cohorts of Malaysian Higher Education: A 7-Month Longitudinal Study,"Recent technology implementation in learning has inspired language educators to employ various e-learning techniques, strategies, and applications in their pedagogical practices while aiming at improving specific learning efficiencies of students. The current study attempts to blend e-learning activities, including blogging, video making, online exercises, and digital storyboarding, with English language teaching and explores its impact on engineering cohorts at a public university in Malaysia. The longitudinal research study used three digital applications—Voyant Tools, Lumos Text Complexity Analyzer, and Advanced Text Analyzer—to analyze the data collected through a variety of digital assignments and activities from two English language courses during the researched academic semesters. Contributing to the available literature on the significance of integrating technology innovation with language learning, the study found that implementing e-learning activities can provide substantial insights into improving the learners’ different linguistic competencies, including writing competency, reading comprehension, and vocabulary enhancement.

Digital Money Options for the BRICS,"The article is time relevant, since a number of countries, such as China and Russia, started pilot testing their digital currencies in 2020, due to the necessity of contactless means of payment during the coronavirus pandemic. The purpose of this research is to revisit the phenomenon of the virtual money. What is new here is that this is one of the first papers concentrated on a digital currency for a group of countries. The article offers an econometric representation of how the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) currency may be utilized when hypothetically coined on a crypto-exchange of the BRICS monetary union. This research contains data condensed in a table and graphical form. The major idea of this article is that only a digital unit of account for a group of countries such as the BRICS, unlike a cryptocurrency, may help create a sustainable financial stability environment and solid monetary infrastructure. The author conducts a detailed analysis of a digital currency compared to a cryptocurrency. The hypothesis is that a shared digital currency for the BRICS may promote financial risk diversification through a risk-sharing mechanism. The author’s results include a formula that may provide a way of calculating the quantity of the BRICS’ digital currency, as well as a simulated representation of a would-be BRICS currency’s dynamics. The practical significance of this paper is that the proposed BRICS digital currency can find its use in investment portfolios as an asset. This asset may provide stable returns and benefit from the growth prospects of the BRICS economies as ones of the most rapidly developing markets in the world. Potential investors in the currency of the union may profit from the abundance of natural resources of Brazil, Russia, and South Africa in terms of energy and other minerals offered at the best world market prices, as well as the technology, labor, and durable goods of India and China priced at competitive valuations. The assets expressed in the BRICS currency have the potential of growing over the years, so a dollar invested today may turn an enormous return on investment within this decade, unlike stagnant markets in Europe, Japan, and the US. The author proves that a cryptocurrency cannot serve a shared currency function for the BRICS, and it stresses the very significance of circulating the shared digital currency in particular. Finally, the author simulates the dynamics of the BRICS’ digital currency and proposes an approach to calculating its exchange rate relative to some of the leading currencies in the international monetary system.","Zharikov, Mikhail Vyacheslavovich",Journal,International Journal of Financial Studies,2023-03-01,Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation,cryptocurrency ;  digital currency ;  digitization ;  financial innovation and engineering ;  shared monetary policy ;  shared money
Combining and evaluating function-oriented solutions in model-based systems engineering,"Increasing complexity and shorter innovation cycles require a rethink in the development of mechatronic products. A function-oriented development process using model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods promises to identify technical solutions via solution-neutral functional architectures. Since each function can typically be realized by multiple, alternative solutions the combinatorial number of overall system solutions explodes. Existing MBSE approaches enable to establish functional architectures as well as support the verification of solutions. However, evaluating different solution combinations with the current state of research involves repetitive and time-consuming modeling which leads to a heuristic selection of potentially suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we present a method for the systematic and function-oriented composition and model-based evaluation of solution combinations. Alternative solutions are structured based on a functional architecture, so that each possible solution combination can be composed and simulated with a minimum of effort, considering physical interactions and the efficiency. Based on simulation results, solution combinations can be verified against requirements and evaluated striving for the best solution combination. The elaborated method extends an existing MBSE approach and is illustrated by the running example of an electrical coolant pump of a passenger vehicle.","Irnich, Lukas;Jacobs, Georg;Zerwas, Thilo;Konrad, Christian",Journal,Forschung im Ingenieurwesen/Engineering Research,2023-03-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,
Contextual variation on teachers’ conceptions of ICT-enhanced teaching in engineering education,"Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, higher education all over the world is increasingly reliant on the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), which creates several opportunities and problems, especially in the field of engineering education. One of the significant aspects that needs to be bought to the academic attention is how teachers' use of ICT in engineering education has been transformed due to this pandemic. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate views, and practices that define varying conceptions of engineering university teachers’ use of ICT in their teaching. Phenomenography, an emerging research approach in engineering education was used as a theoretical and methodological underpinning. A cohort of 14 teachers was selected from two universities in Bangladesh to participate in a semi-structured in-depth interview. The findings revealed five qualitatively different categories of description such as: imparting information, transmitting structured knowledge, offering guided learning, engaging students toward practice and engaging students toward innovation. Relationships among the categories of description revealed four dimensions of variation such as: purpose of using ICT in engineering teaching, role of a teacher, role of a student and TPACK components. The study further found that ICT-usage underpins teacher's pedagogical approach to teaching engineering subjects and therefore provides useful information for university policy makers, teachers and curriculum designers toward quality teaching and learning. A quantitative investigation to determine the impact of the pedagogical approaches to teaching underpinned by ICT-use in engineering education is recommended.","Khalid, Mboka;Hossain Khan, Md Shahadat;Gregory, Sue",Journal,Heliyon,2023-03-01,Islamic University of Technology;University of New England Australia,Engineering teaching ;  ICT ;  Phenomenography and conceptions ;  TPACK
Clinician Perspectives on Cannulation for Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: A Mixed Methods Analysis,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a leading cause of mortality with survival rates of less than 10%. In selected patients, survival may be improved via timely application of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). However, ECPR is a complex and resource intensive intervention with a high risk of complications that impair widespread clinical adoption. This study employed a mixed approach of qualitative interview analysis embedded with quantitative data collection to uncover the major hurdles faced by clinicians during ECPR initiation. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight ECPR intensive care specialists with 2-10 years of experience working at a large, tertiary ECPR center in Australia. Clinicians identified dilation as the most time-consuming step, followed by draping, and decision-making during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patient selection. The most challenging step was the decision-making for patient selection, followed by dilation and imaging. These findings uncovered key barriers to ECPR, and identified priority areas for further research and clinical training. Major logistical hindrances will require well-defined protocols and improved clinical training. Engineering innovations in the identified areas may improve the delivery of ECPR, making it simpler and faster to deliver.","Wanigasekara, Devindi;Pellegrino, Vincent A.;Burrell, Aidan J.C.;Aung, Nyein;Gregory, Shaun D.",Journal,ASAIO Journal,2023-03-01,Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute;Monash University;The Alfred,clinician perspective ;  extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) ;  extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) ;  out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) ;  qualitative data analysis ;  Seldinger technique ;  ultrasound-guided cannulation ;  vascular dilation
The role of COP26 commitment and technological innovation in depletion of natural resources: Evidence from BRICS countries,"Recently, twenty sixty Conference of the Parties (COP26) related to climate change provided guidelines for reducing the harmful emissions that affect the environmental and natural resources management. These environmental and natural resources management issue need researchers' attention. Hence, the current article examines the factor of environmental degradation such as carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and methane emissions and technology innovation's impact on the natural resources management in BRICS countries. The article has also taken industrialization as the control variable. The article has used the secondary data extracted from World Development Indicators (WDI) from 2001 to 2020. The research has applied the Cross-Sectionally Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) technique to examine the linkage among the variables. The results indicated that the CO2 emissions, methane emissions, economic growth and industrialization have a positive and significant, while technology innovation has a negative and significant linkage with natural resources depletion in BRICS countries. This research helps the upcoming studies in examining this area in the future and also guides the regulators to formulate effective policies to implement the COP26 commitments to reduce climate change and improve the natural resources management.","Fang, Ming;Chang, Chiu Lan",Journal,Resources Policy,2023-03-01,Fuzhou University of Foreign Studies and Trade,CO 2 ;  Economic growth ;  emissions ;  Industrialization ;  Methane emissions ;  Natural resources management ;  Technology innovation
Implicit contradictions identification and solution process model for complex technical systems,"The innovation of complex technical systems is an evolutionary process of continuously resolving contradictions, and the implicit contradictions in it may be a great hidden threat causing the failure of system functions. Existing contradiction analysis methods show limitations in identifying and solving implicit contradictions. This paper proposed an implicit contradiction identification and solution process model for complex technical systems. Based on the perspective of evolution, first, in this model, an implicit contradiction identification method based on need evolution and functional failure prediction analyses is proposed. Then, the identified contradictions were standardized, an implicit contradiction network was developed quantitatively according to the correlation analysis of contradictions, contradictions were clustered, and the contradictions of the same group were ranked. Furthermore, for implicit contradictions, an optimization solution path was formulated by combining the parallel solution of implicit contradictions in different groups and the serial solution of implicit contradictions in the same group, which is convenient to solve the contradictions rapidly by using TRIZ (theory of inventive problem solving) tool. Finally, the model was validated by employing a solar cell module disassembly device as an engineering case, and a feasible innovation scheme was obtained. The dynamic identification and solution of new sub-contradictions in the process of implicit contradiction resolution will be the main research direction in the future.","Zhang, Jianhui;Pu, Xuejie;Zhao, Ruikai;Li, Jianyong;Nie, Zifeng",Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023-03-01,Hebei University of Technology;Ltd.,Complex technical system ;  Contradiction network construction ;  Implicit contradiction identification and solution ;  Optimal solution path ;  Solar cell module disassembly device ;  TRIZ
"New media environment, environmental regulation and corporate green technology innovation:Evidence from China","Understanding the impact and mechanisms between new media environment, environmental regulation and corporate green technology innovation are crucial to achieve environmentally inclusive growth of sustainable development goals. Based on the sample of Chinese A-share listed companies in the heavily polluting industries for the period 2010–2020, this paper investigates the impact of the new media environment and environmental regulation on corporate green technology innovation. The empirical results indicate that (i) the new media environment can motivate heavily polluting enterprises to meet stakeholder demands and significantly improve their corporate green technology innovation; (ii) heterogeneous environmental regulatory instruments (pollution charges and environmental protection subsidies) can jointly improve the green technology innovation of corporations through pushback and compensation effects; and (iii) effective environmental regulation tools can strengthen the stakeholder relationship between the government and enterprises, enhance the resource preparation and dynamic capabilities of heavily polluting enterprises to respond to public opinion crises, and thereby positively moderate the promotion of new media environments on corporate green technological innovation. Our findings help identify new drivers of corporate green technology innovation and confirm the combined effects of the new media environment and environmental regulation in stimulating corporate green behavior, which can facilitate the construction of ecological civilization.","Li, Zhenghui;Huang, Zimei;Su, Yaya",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-03-01,Hunan University of Technology and Business;Guangzhou University,Corporate green technology innovation ;  Environmental regulation ;  Moderating effects ;  New media environment
"Assessing the impact of renewable energy investment, green technology innovation, and industrialization on sustainable development: A case study of China","The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of the economic complexity index and its square, investments in the energy sector, green technological innovation, and the growth of the industrial structure in 32 provinces in China on carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2019. Modern methods that consider cross-sectional dependency, unit root test, co-integration test, IFE estimation, and one- and two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) models were used in the econometric analysis. The results showed that the economic complexity index is to blame for the worsening trends in China's carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast, we find that the economic complexity index square, investments in renewable energy, green technical innovation, and industrial structure all help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which is helpful for China's carbon-abatement goals. Carbon emissions are negatively affected by renewable energy's limited effect on green technology innovation and industrial structure. Based on these findings, a number of policy suggestions are offered.","Fang, Zhen",Journal,Renewable Energy,2023-03-01,Shandong University of Finance and Economics,Carbon emission ;  China ;  ECI ;  ECI 2 ;  Green technology innovation ;  IS ;  Renewable energy investment

This trend is expected to be doubles as revised Energy Efficient Directive (EU) is committed to add renewable share from 17% from 2015 to 34% in 2030. Among the effort to achieve the target highlighted by International Energy Agency (IEA) in their Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap is to develop or improved energy management on existing and new building to meet net zero energy building. One of the emerging and fast-growing solution is implementing Building Integration Photovoltaic (BIPV) as it offered not only clean electricity generation but also seamless integration aspect to the building envelope. However, due to a limitation factor such as insufficient BIPV infrastructure which dominantly base in European countries. This scenario limits the technology progress especially in Asian countries. Although attractive benefit shown by BIPV system, it is still having a crucial limitation on the visual and aesthetic appearance which considered as “unattractive” to the building appearance by viewers. Thus, there will be quite an issue to implement BIPV on architectural sensitive building such as historic and iconic building. In order to solve this issue, a pilot study of coloured BIPV system performance is conducted on an iconic building in tropical climate region which is Daya Bumi Building, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The method adopted is based on cross-platform between 3D modelling simulation in Building Information Modelling (BIM) software and detail solar analysis (PVsyst) to obtain accurate analysis results. Varies of coloured PV modules are assess and compared to obtain the optimum BIPV system configuration. The proposed BIPV system is able to produce energy of 679.72 MW annually with carbon saving of 10367.66 tCO2/year of CO2 emission. The coloured BIPV application are expected to camouflage the PV panel appearance on the building which could preserve the original architectural aesthetic. This research promotes conscious of BIPV as a crucial innovative solution in implementing PV panel on building without sacrificing the architectural aesthetic value. Furthermore, BIPV system design using BIM software can be replicate to provide seamless work transition between building architecture, structural engineering, renewable energy engineering and building operations. This is in line with Malaysian 10-10MySTIE Framework effort to transform into a knowledge-intensive and innovation driven economy which include production, management and distribution of energy from renewable energy sources.","Hamzah, Abdul Hazeem;Go, Yun Ii",Journal,"e-Prime - Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy",2023-03-01,Heriot-Watt University Malaysia,Aesthetic ;  Architectural ;  BIM ;  Coloured PV
Augmenting human innovation teams with artificial intelligence: Exploring transformer-based language models,"The use of transformer-based language models in artificial intelligence (AI) has increased adoption in various industries and led to significant productivity advancements in business operations. This article explores how these models can be used to augment human innovation teams in the new product development process, allowing for larger problem and solution spaces to be explored and ultimately leading to higher innovation performance. The article proposes the use of the AI-augmented double diamond framework to structure the exploration of how these models can assist in new product development (NPD) tasks, such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and idea generation. It also discusses the limitations of the technology and the potential impact of AI on established practices in NPD. The article establishes a research agenda for exploring the use of language models in this area and the role of humans in hybrid innovation teams.

DNA synthesis technologies to close the gene writing gap,"Synthetic DNA is of increasing demand across many sectors of research and commercial activities. Engineering biology, therapy, data storage and nanotechnology are set for rapid developments if DNA can be provided at scale and low cost. Stimulated by successes in next generation sequencing and gene editing technologies, DNA synthesis is already a burgeoning industry. However, the synthesis of >200 bp sequences remains unaffordable. To overcome these limitations and start writing DNA as effectively as it is read, alternative technologies have been developed including molecular assembly and cloning methods, template-independent enzymatic synthesis, microarray and rolling circle amplification techniques. Here, we review the progress in developing and commercializing these technologies, which are exemplified by innovations from leading companies. We discuss pros and cons of each technology, the need for oversight and regulatory policies for DNA synthesis as a whole and give an overview of DNA synthesis business models.

Local and global experience curves for lumpy and granular energy technologies,"Current electricity generation systems have been dominated by lumpy energy technologies because the electricity they create has been cheaper than that generated from granular technologies. Accelerating the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies to mitigate climate change will require a better understanding of how lumpy and granular technology innovations work to reduce domestic and foreign technology costs. We estimated one-factor and two-factor experience curves to identify drivers and assess the relative importance of local and global learning experiences in Korea's climate change mitigation efforts between lumpy and granular energy technologies. The results suggest that granular technologies are likely to play a key role in mitigating climate change due to a rapid decline in its cost. Further tapping the local potential of cost reduction in granular technologies will require decreasing the soft costs of solar technologies and ramping up wind power plant installations. The results also suggest that knowledge spillover is relatively limited and slow for lumpy technologies, but frequent and fast for granular technologies. To maximize the spillover of global learning to local innovators, policy makers should improve the absorptive capacity of a country and strengthen the global network ties of local firms.","Choi, Donghyun;Kim, Yeong Jae",Journal,Energy Policy,2023-03-01,Scheller College of Business;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;KDI School of Public Policy and Management,Energy technology ;  Experience curve ;  Research and development ;  Technological change
Progress of iPS cell-based transplantation therapy for retinal diseases,"The discovery of induced Pluripotent Stem) (iPS) cells has instigated innovation in various fields, including ophthalmology. Cell therapy has shown tremendous progress in translational research on retinal diseases, including the first-in-human transplantation of autologous iPS cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Cell therapy for retinitis pigmentosa (RP) has also been developed. Retinal organoid and photoreceptor cell transplantation has been shown to incorporate into the degenerated host retina, forming synapses with host neurons and resulting in functional recovery. Based on preclinical data, first-in-human transplantation of iPS cell-derived retinal sheets has been conducted. In this review, we summarize the current progress in iPS cell-based retinal cell transplantation research for retinal diseases, addressing some remaining challenges and future prospects.","Akiba, Ryutaro;Takahashi, Masayo;Baba, Takayuki;Mandai, Michiko",Journal,Japanese Journal of Ophthalmology,2023-03-01,Kobe City Eye Hospital;Graduate School of Medicine,

Fuel cell system production cost modeling and analysis,"Fuel cell technology is seen as a promising option for decarbonizing global mobility. The costs of fuel cell systems are currently too high for increasing market penetration. The Chair of Production Engineering of E-Mobility Components at RWTH Aachen University has developed a cost calculation model for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems based on the method of Process Based Cost Modeling (PBCM) and is investigating possibilities for reducing manufacturing costs through economies of scale in production. The aim of this publication is therefore to present the results of cost modeling of PEM fuel cell systems and to derive design areas for technical innovations in terms of cost reduction through economies of scale in production. To this end, technical production parameters with the greatest influence on the cost structure of PEM fuel cell systems are identified and ranked by applying a sensitivity analysis. Finally, this work provides a recommendation for strategic investments and formulates the need for further research to reduce PEM fuel cell system costs by economies of scale.","Kampker, Achim;Heimes, Heiner;Kehrer, Mario;Hagedorn, Sebastian;Reims, Philipp;Kaul, Oliver",Journal,Energy Reports,2023-03-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Cost modeling ;  Economies of scale ;  Fuel cell systems ;  Production costs ;  Sensitivity analysis
Functioning strategies of the research groups' leaders in the context of funding and policy instabilities<sup>☆</sup>,"We explore the strategies implemented by Research Groups' Leaders while coping with unstable contexts, characterized by incoherence and lack of coordination among different policy discourses and instruments, and scarce resources. We focus on a country where these conditions are present: Colombia. In doing so, we study two cases, one in nanotechnology and another one in biomedical engineering. Interviews, focus groups and workshops allowed us to identify and validate strategies grouped in four popular sayings, proper to local idiosyncrasy, highlighting the role of home institutions and principal investigators in facing such situations with resilience and resourcefulness, and even taking advantage of them. We find that Research Groups' Leaders use strategies such as: adapting, balancing agendas and funding sources, networking, and taking advantage of the support programs available at their home institution to continue functioning. These are setting the ground for a further survey which could pretend some generalization. However, policymakers could consider these findings when defining policy instruments or for assessing their effectiveness or impacts.","Jaime, Astrid;Pérez-Martelo, Constanza;Herrera, Bernardo;Ordóñez-Matamoros, Gonzalo;Vinck, Dominique",Journal,Review of Policy Research,2023-03-01,"Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios;Universidad Central, Bogota;Universidad Externado de Colombia;Pontificia Universidad Javeriana;Universiteit Twente;Université de Lausanne (UNIL)","bottom-up perspective ;  higher education institutions ;  principal investigators ;  research groups' strategies ;  science, technology, and innovation policy"
Infusing educational technologies in the heart of the university—A systematic literature review from an organisational perspective,"Educational technologies have experienced unprecedented prominence on university agendas with many institutions motivated to keep the lessons learned from the COVID-19 sparked transition with regard to online teaching. In response to this renewed interest in ensuring the longevity of educational technologies in higher education, this systematic review analysed the various organisational factors—for example, leadership, infrastructure, strategy—considered essential in the literature for the successful implementation of educational technologies. Specifically, we reviewed 1614 papers published in five prominent educational technology journals in the last decade. From this sample, we identified 47 papers that discussed organisational factors. Drawing on these studies, we constructed an organisational framework, which outlines the different organisational factors, actors and processes involved in implementing educational technologies. The identified organisational factors are structured into three main categories: (1) Leadership and Strategy, (2) Infrastructure and Resources and (3) Recognition and Motivation. Our aim was to further the scholarly understanding of the organisational layer involved in digital change as well as provide concrete recommendations for practitioners. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Previous research has stressed the importance of taking organisational factors such as infrastructure, leadership, strategy and staff commitment into account when implementing educational technologies. However, review papers have failed to systematically organise these studies to create a comprehensive understanding of the organisational factors involved in implementing educational technologies and ensuring their longevity at an institution. There is currently a high level of interest in how educational technologies can be implemented in the higher education landscape, as many institutions are facing the question of what lessons they can learn from the crisis and how they can continue on their path of digitalisation. What this paper adds This review paper addresses a gap in our scholarly understanding of the organisational layers involved in the implementation of educational technologies in higher education institutions (HEIs). This paper provides a framework on organisational factors, which influence the implementation of educational technologies in HEIs. This review paper demonstrates that bottom-up and opinion leadership, support structures tailored to the need and time of faculty as well as recognition and incentives have the largest impact on a sustainable implementation of educational technologies in HEIs. Implications for practice and/or policy Universities should create structures that enable innovation and creativity by promoting bottom-up and opinion leadership as well as shared decision-making processes as they are important for the successful implementation of educational technologies in HEIs. Besides providing a reliable and suitable infrastructure, institutional support and resources in terms of technical advice and training tailored to specific needs, should be in place when planning the implementation of educational technologies in HEIs. The additional workload instructors face when implementing digital teaching should be recognised and incentivised as it strengthens instructor engagement which is crucial for the implementation of educational technologies in HEIs.","Deacon, Bronwen;Laufer, Melissa;Schäfer, Len Ole",Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2023-03-01,FernUniversität in Hagen;Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society,educational technologies ;  higher education ;  infrastructure ;  leadership ;  organisational change ;  systematic review
The who and how of commercializing emerging technologies: A technology-focused review,"Emerging technologies combine high expectations with market and technological uncertainty. Scholars are increasingly interested in the commercialization of such emerging technologies, existing studies have worked to identify the actors, dynamics, and contexts conducive to successful commercialization efforts. However, collecting and organizing the findings of these studies has been challenging as they cover a broad spectrum of technologies and have significant differences among them. To address this challenge, the present study reviews existing research on the commercialization of emerging technologies by taking the technology view, explicitly considering the technologies’ shared and distinctive attributes. We have conducted a systematic literature review covering 154 articles published in 43 journals over 28 years and structured the results around the distinct factors that allow emerging technologies to help generate innovation. Our analysis differentiates between proprietary and generic technologies to explain how new entrants and incumbents take emerging technologies to market, with substantially different paths to generating technology-based innovations. Ultimately, we use this technological heterogeneity as a lens to better understand the factors and dynamics behind how emerging technologies are commercialized and used as drivers of future innovation.","Haessler, Philipp;Giones, Ferran;Brem, Alexander",Journal,Technovation,2023-03-01,"Universität Stuttgart;University of Southern Denmark, Sønderborg",Emerging technologies ;  Incumbents ;  Technology commercialization ;  Technology innovation
The Technologization of Entrepreneurial Processes: A Poverty Perspective,"Technology plays a crucial role in the entrepreneurship process. Yet, little is known of how the entrepreneurial processes of the poor are affected by technology and vice versa. Using interview data from a sample of low-income entrepreneurs, this article develops a framework for how the delicate interaction between entrepreneurial processes such as bricolage and effectuation, and (digital) technologies unfold. Building on interpretive inductive research, we uncovered four main categories that describe the technologization patterns of entrepreneurial individuals in poverty: strategies to resource the business; innovative capability; community building; and dynamic capabilities. Our work offers a more comprehensive understanding of technology and its impact on poverty ventures.","Santos, Susana C.;Neumeyer, Xaver",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-03-01,The University of New Mexico;Iscte – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa;Rowan University,Bricolage ;  causation ;  digital adaptability ;  digital literacy ;  digitalization ;  effectuation ;  entrepreneurial behavior ;  innovation ;  poverty ;  technology adoption
A bibliometric analysis of Research on Education 4.0 during the 2017–2021 period,"A bibliometric analysis of 309 publications related to Education 4.0 published in both Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases has been conducted to analyze the development of this research field since the first articles published in 2017. Although being an emerging field, the number of publications increased quickly. Scholars from developing countries (i.e., Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, and Philippines) are among the most productive authors, but internal and cross-country collaborations between them are very limited. Quality of the publication collection is not high as within the top ten most popular journals, five journals are not qualified to the Scopus database since 2020, and only three journals belong to the WoS core collections. Research topics related to Education 4.0 can be classified into five main clusters, including application of modern technologies on Education 4.0, effects of Industry 4.0 on teaching and learning activities, Education 4.0 in engineering education, education innovations in Education 4.0, and empirical research and quantitative analyses using questionnaires on different aspects of Education 4.0.","Dao, Lai Thai;Tran, Trung;Van Le, Hong;Nguyen, Giang Ngoc;Trinh, Thao Phuong Thi",Journal,Education and Information Technologies,2023-03-01,"Thai Nguyen University of Education;Banking University - Ho Chi Minh City;Vietnam National University, Hanoi;Vietnam Psycho-Pedagogical Association;Vietnam Academy for Ethnic Minorities;Vietnam National Institute of Educational Sciences",Bibliometric analysis ;  Education 4.0 ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Scopus database ;  Web of Science (WoS) database
Applying Human Values Theory to Software Engineering Practice: Lessons and Implications,"The study of human values in software engineering (SE) is increasingly recognised as a fundamental human-centric issue of SE decision making. However, values studies in SE still face a number of issues, including the difficulty of eliciting values in a systematic and structured way, the challenges of measuring and tracking values over time, and the lack of practice-based understanding of values among software practitioners. This paper aims to help address these issues by: 1) outlining a research framework that supports a systematic approach to values elicitation, analysis, and understanding; 2) introducing tools and techniques that help elicit and measure values during SE decision making processes in a systematic way; and 3) applying such tools to a month-long research sprint co-designed with an industry partner and conducted with 27 software practitioners. The case study builds on lessons from an earlier pilot (12 participants) and combines in-situ observations with the use of two values-informed tools: the Values Q-Sort (V-QS), and the Values-Retro. The V-QS adapts instruments from values research to the SE context, the Values-Retro adapts existing SE techniques to values theory. We distil implications for research and practice in ten lessons learned.","Ferrario, Maria Angela;Winter, Emily",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023-03-01,Queen's University Belfast;Lancaster University,agile retrospectives ;  case studies of practice ;  ethics ;  human values in software practice ;  human-centric software engineering ;  mixed-methods ;  non-functional requirements ;  responsible innovations ;  Software engineering
Exploring the Role of U.K. Government Policy in Developing the University Entrepreneurial Finance Ecosystem for Cleantech,"Vast sums of public money are invested into universities globally as anchor institutions and knowledge bases providing seedbed resources for research and development and entrepreneurship. Focusing on university science and technology research we examine two U.K. case studies of government support from the 'Innovation Knowledge Centre' (IKC) program to translate research into industry innovation for public good. Although IKCs are not tasked to address climate change, the two case studies demonstrate tremendous potential for Cleantech development. An exploratory entrepreneurial finance ('entfin') ecosystem theoretical lens contextualizes the catalytic roles of universities and public funding to support industry at the base of the innovation finance escalator. We thus develop university-industry ecosystems literature, addressing the gap in nurturing university entfin for climate change. Our qualitative case study methodology includes literature review and 51 key informant interviews with: policymakers; university research leaders, technology transfer officers, specialist research to industry innovation 'translation' staff, SME beneficiaries, trade bodies; and early-stage private finance providers. We reveal nuances in different emerging innovation sectors - notably their degree of maturity, locality, and outcome horizons for achieving impact, drawing attention to the key roles of universities and financing and their interactions within their entfin ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for government long horizon, deep pocket, investment, and integrated university entfin policy mix, alongside more open, inclusive, ecosystem development between different actors.","Owen, Robyn;Vedanthachari, Lakshminarasimhan",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-03-01,Middlesex University;London Business School,Cleantech ;  entrepreneurial finance ecosystem ;  innovation ;  policy evaluation ;  science and technology ;  universities
Insights from bauhaus innovation for education and workplaces in a post-pandemic world,"This paper examines Bauhaus School (1919–1933) innovation and relevance today. The School is a landmark in the history of design as a discipline and the development of design education. The School was also a workplace, commercialising Bauhaus-designed products. While drawing global interest in its innovations, the School faced resistance in Germany because it challenged conventions. This problem raises the questions: How did the School-workplace generate innovations amid the calamity of post-war Germany, and what is the significance of the Bauhaus for post-pandemic education and workplaces one hundred years on? The concept of ‘transgression’ is used to understand innovation at the Bauhaus School-workplace. Haraway discusses transgressive practices that disrupt established knowledges, moving ways of thinking and doing in new directions. Analysis of workplace learning research reveals that three interfacing dimensions make up innovation: (1) workplace environments, (2) the culture-order that facilitates innovation, and (3) learning in practice in authentic settings. This qualitative case study reports on how Bauhaus innovation emerged at the intersection of these key dimensions. There are surprising commonalities between the Bauhaus approach to innovation in challenging times and contemporary thinking about supporting innovation which are relevant to education, particularly STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, and workplaces in a world affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. Thus, encouraging people who challenge boundaries, rules or ‘the way things are’ can support innovation. This paper addresses a gap in workplace learning research on interrelated dimensions of innovation which the Bauhaus recognized. The study also offers an innovative approach to the examination of innovation across time and space whereas most contemporary studies of innovation focus on the present. Further, conceptualizing innovation as transgression offers a new way of thinking about innovation in design and in the workplace.","White-Hancock, Lorraine",Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2023-03-01,Monash University,Bauhaus ;  Design ;  Innovation ;  Transdisciplinary ;  Transgression
Unpacking secondary school technology teachers’ interpretations and experiences of teaching ‘problem-solving’,"Research relating to the nature and purpose of ‘design’ activity across education sectors has accelerated in recent years as governments and policy makers throughout the world highlight the importance of skills such as creative problem-solving and innovation. Within secondary schools, responsibility for teaching and learning through design is often assigned to Technology and Engineering subjects, however, gaps tend to exist in relation to what different teachers understand and experience about the teaching and learning of problem-solving and design in their classrooms. In this exploratory study, a small group of practicing secondary school teachers completed a one day training workshop where they were introduced to new knowledge and pedagogical skills relating to design problem-solving using a classroom intervention called ‘Designing Our Tomorrow’. The teachers participated in a focus group discussion before and after the workshop in which they discussed their experiences in teaching design. Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) (Lakoff & Johnson Metaphors we live, University of Chicago Press, 1980) was employed to highlight the figures of speech used by the teachers during the focus groups and from these a number of conceptual metaphors were identified that described their understandings and experiences of teaching design problem-solving. In synthesizing the broad theoretical base relating to understandings of design problem-solving and CMT together with the findings from the one day professional development workshop, the paper highlights the potential value for researchers in using CMT to unpack teachers' views on how design problem-solving is taught and learned in schools. Finally, the paper reveals a potential new space to inform and evaluate future professional development of Technology teachers, particularly where the focus is on complex and difficult to define concepts such as design and problem-solving.","Lane, Diarmaid;McGarr, Oliver;Nicholl, Bill",Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2023-03-01,The Faculty of Education;University of Limerick,Conceptual metaphor theory ;  Creativity ;  Design ;  Problem-solving ;  Professional development ;  Teachers
Can foods produced with new plant engineering techniques succeed in the marketplace? A case study of apples,"We present a model for research and development (R&D) investment in food innovations based on new plant engineering techniques (NPETs) and traditional hybridization methods. The framework combines uncertain and costly food innovation with consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the new food. The framework is applied with elicited WTP of French and US consumers for new improved apples. NPETs may be socially beneficial under full information and when the probability of success under NPETs is relatively high. Otherwise, the traditional hybridization is socially optimal. A probable collapse of conventional apples raises the social desirability of new apples generated by NPETs and traditional hybridization.","Marette, Stéphan;Beghin, John;Disdier, Anne Célia;Mojduszka, Eliza",Journal,Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,2023-03-01,Ecole d’Économie de Paris;Université Paris-Saclay;United States Department of Agriculture;University of Nebraska–Lincoln,apple ;  consumer information ;  food innovation ;  gene editing ;  industrial organization ;  new plant engineering techniques ;  willingness to pay
End-user modeling of quality for web components,"With years of frantic development, when release fast and release often was the mandatory rule for web technologies and services, the open source paradigm and online distribution repositories have imposed de facto standards for quality assessment in fast-paced innovation processes. Nowadays, however, in pursuit of productivity, security, and user satisfaction, the industry is beginning, through the introduction of new standards such as ECMAScript 6 or web components, to consider software engineering mandates for web technologies. This article reports a quality model aligned with international standard ISO/IEC 25010, covering web components technology, which ultimately aims to improve adoption by the software engineering industry, traditionally wary of agile Internet practices, the open source paradigm, and public repositories. Our research also presents an experimentation platform on which end users have validated the quality properties, highlighting the implicit connection with the perceived quality. The key result of our research convinces us that user ratings are suitable as a testing mechanism for product quality and quality-in-use metrics in order to define an absolute scale of comparison for web component quality.","Lizcano, David;Martínez-Ortíz, Andrés Leonardo;López, Genoveva;Grignard, Arnaud",Journal,Journal of Software: Evolution and Process,2023-03-01,Universidad a Distancia de Madrid;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;MIT Media Lab,end-user programming ;  end-user software engineering ;  human-computer interaction ;  human-inspired metrics ;  reliability ;  software quality

Orchestrating business model innovation: Insights from the project-based firm,"Business model innovation (BMI) is a powerful source of competitive advantage for firms in a dynamic world of increased digitalization. Despite the rise of BMI and the project-based firm as research fields, there is a profound need of unfolding the BMI in the context of the project-based firm. Theoretically, the study contributes with a new theoretical construct, orchestration of BMI, which here is defined as a series of organizational activities, which result in changes to the key elements of a firm's business model and/or the architecture linking these elements. Empirically, the study contributes with insight from a project-based firm in the engineering industry through qualitative analyses of 15 cases characterized by BMI. It is found that BMI in the project-based firm unfolds as iterative and network-centered processes led by entrepreneurial-driven project managers in the opportunistic pursuit of delivering value in innovative ways in concert with top and middle managers.","Løbner, Kristian",Book,Handbook of Research on Business Model Innovation Through Disruption and Digitalization,2023-02-27,Aarhus Universitet,
Reactivity and mechanism in chemical and synthetic biology,"Physical organic chemistry and mechanistic thinking provide a strong intellectual framework for understanding the chemical logic of evolvable informational macromolecules and metabolic transformations in living organisms.

Preliminary study on the construction of a data privacy protection course based on a teaching-in-practice range,"Since China’s Data Security Law, Personal Information Protection Law and related laws were formalized, demand for privacy protection technology talents has increased sharply, and data privacy protection courses have been gradually offered in the cyberspace security majors of various universities. Building on longstanding practices in data security research and teaching, the teaching team of “Academician Fang Binxing’s Experimental Class” (referred to as “Fang Class”) at Guangzhou University has proposed a teaching method for data privacy protection based on a teaching-in-practice range. In the selection of teaching course content, the teaching team selected eight typical key privacy protection techniques including anonymity model, differential privacy, searchable encryption, ciphertext computation, adversarial training, multimedia privacy protection, privacy policy conflict resolution, and privacy violation traceability. Besides, the corresponding teaching modules were designed, which were deployed in the teaching practice range for students to learn and train. Three teaching methods were designed, including the knowledge and application oriented teaching method which integrates theory and programming, the engineering practice oriented teaching method based on algorithm extension and adaptation, and the comprehensive practice oriented teaching method for practical application scenarios. Then the closed loop of “learning-doing-using” knowledge learning and application was realized.

Intersection Control in Mixed Traffic with Connected Automated Vehicles: A Review of Recent Developments and Research Frontiers,"Intersections are bottlenecks in urban traffic operations and can cause congestion. Traffic control is a crucial strategy in regulating traffic flow by preventing and alleviating traffic congestion; it is also a cost-effective approach. The development of communication and automation technologies has led to a new type of mixed traffic, comprised of regular vehicles (RVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). This has influenced the revolution of control objects, data environments, and control methods in urban traffic control. Beyond the challenges it brings, intersection traffic control provides opportunities for innovative developments in traffic control theory and methods. Intersection control in mixed traffic situations with CAVs is still in its infancy, but it has already become a hot topic both at home and abroad. According to the right of way, research on traffic signal timing, vehicle trajectory/path planning, and cooperative trajectory-signal control for mixed traffic control at an isolated intersection, in a corridor, and in a traffic network with shared facilities was first summarized; research on intersection control with dedicated facilities for autonomous driving was subsequently introduced, including CAV-dedicated lanes, CAV-dedicated links, CAV-dedicated zones, and dedicated bus rapid transit (BRT) lanes, which provide a separate right-of-way for CAVs. Even though current literature on intersection control in mixed traffic is still scarce, a comprehensive review on the topic has revealed a number of research questions that are yet to be addressed, including: the uncertainty in the driving behaviors of RVs; compliance rates of CVs; coupling of CV/CAV longitudinal and lateral trajectories; and spatial-temporal sparsity of CVs/ CAVs. Future research directions are also herein presented, including: trajectory planning of CAVs in mixed traffic; controlling mixed traffic by CAV trajectory planning; and cooperative control of CAVs and mixed traffic. It is expected that these topics will drive forward innovation of traffic control in mixed traffic with CAVs.","Ma, Wan Jing;Li, Jin Jue;Yu, Chun Hui",Journal,Zhongguo Gonglu Xuebao/China Journal of Highway and Transport,2023-02-20,Tongji University,mixed traffic with connected automated vehicle ;  review ;  traffic control ;  traffic engineering ;  traffic signal control ;  trajectory planning
Impact of dual credit policy on new energy vehicles technology innovation with information asymmetry,"Promoting new energy vehicles (NEVs) is one of the most effective means to solve the increasingly severe energy shortage and environmental pollution problems. Considering the dual credit policy and carmakers having private information, we construct the Stackelberg game models to obtain the optimal technology innovation strategy for the NEVs production systems under information symmetry and information asymmetry. Then, we compare the optimal solutions in different situations obtaining some interesting conclusions. The results reveal that (1) the dual credit policy can promote technology innovation and improve the technical performance of NEVs. Moreover, the higher the credits price and the higher the technology innovation credit coefficient, the more significant the promotion effect. (2) When customers’ technology preference is low, information asymmetry weakens the incentive effect of the dual credit policy. With the increase of credit price or technology innovation credit coefficient, the weakening of the dual credit policy incentive effect by information asymmetry becomes more significant.","Ma, Miaomiao;Meng, Weidong;Li, Yuyu;Huang, Bo",Journal,Applied Energy,2023-02-15,Chongqing University;Chongqing Normal University,Dual credit policy ;  Information asymmetry ;  New energy vehicle ;  Technology innovation
Can central environmental protection inspection induce corporate green technology innovation?,"As a major institutional innovation of China's environmental governance system, whether the central environmental protection inspection can induce green technology innovation in heavily polluting corporates is crucial to deepening the reform of China's environmental governance system. Based on corporate green patent data from 2010 to 2019, the Difference-in-difference model is used to test the impact of the central environmental protection inspection on corporate green technology innovation after theoretically analyzes. The study finds that the central environmental protection inspection has significantly stimulated the green technology innovation of pollution-intensive industrial companies, by, in the main, encouraging corporates to develop innovative practices which increase the utilization efficiency of fossil energy and decrease end process pollutant emissions. However, green innovations in new energy sources that radically reduce pollution emissions are not significant. In addition, the green technology innovation induced by the central environmental protection inspection is not a superposition effect based on existing innovation activities, but the result of a crowding out of other technological innovations.","Cheng, Zhonghua;Yu, Xuejin",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-02-10,Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,Central environmental protection inspection (CEPI) ;  Difference-in-difference (DID) ;  Green technology innovation (GTI) ;  Innovative targeting

Research and Discussion on Management of Hydrologic Survey Driven by New Generation Information Technology,"Since the 1970s, the Bureau of Hydrology, Changjiang Water Resources Commission has carried out research on automatic flood reporting, innovation of hydrometry methods, and improvement of 'one station, one policy' monitoring and reporting capabilities, laying a technical foundation for the development of hydrologic survey; the construction of Web-based intelligent hydrometry system ('WISH' system) has been carried out, laying an information foundation for hydrologic survey. Through the research and practice in recent years, the management system of 'Mainly patrol survey, combining standing survey with patrol survey' has been gradually established. However, while liberating the productive forces, hydrologic survey also brings some new problems, such as the marginalization of survey stations, hollow management, low survey efficiency and idle assets. Therefore, based on a comprehensive understanding of the management of grass-roots stations, equipment and facilities, and the development of patrol survey, the paper studied and discussed the management mode of hydrologic survey driven by the new generation of information technology in combination with new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning.","Mei, Junya;Deng, Shan;Zhao, Xin",Book Series,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,2023-02-06,Changjiang Water Resources Commission,direction of development ;  Hydrologic survey ;  hydrological monitoring ;  new generation information technology
Adsorptive removal of antibiotic pollutants from wastewater using biomass/biochar-based adsorbents,"This study explores adsorptive removal measures to shed light on current water treatment innovations for kinetic/isotherm models and their applications to antibiotic pollutants using a broad range of biomass-based adsorbents. The structure, classifications, sources, distribution, and different techniques for the remediation of antibiotics are discussed. Unlike previous studies, a wide range of adsorbents are covered and adsorption of comprehensive classes of antibiotics onto biomass/biochar-based adsorbents are categorized as β-lactam, fluoroquinolone, sulfonamide, tetracycline, macrolides, chloramphenicol, antiseptic additives, glycosamides, reductase inhibitors, and multiple antibiotic systems. This allows for an assessment of their performance and an understanding of current research breakthroughs in applying various adsorbent materials for antibiotic removal. Distinct from other studies in the field, the theoretical basis of different isotherm and kinetics models and the corresponding experimental insights into their applications to antibiotics are discussed extensively, thereby identifying the associated strengths, limitations, and efficacy of kinetics and isotherms for describing the performances of the adsorbents. In addition, we explore the regeneration of adsorbents and the potential applications of the adsorbents in engineering.

Progress and trend of world agricultural engineering discipline,"Here is an accurate track of the evolution process of the agricultural engineering discipline in the world in recent years. This article aims to understand the development trend of the discipline, and to provide a strong reference for China's agricultural engineering discipline, particularly for the discipline that supports agricultural power construction and Chinese modernization. Among them, 30 journals of the world's most representative ones were selected in the agricultural engineering field. The worldwide research on agricultural engineering was then mapped in the six periods from 1965-2021 using bibliometric methods and visual mapping software. The six periods were as follows: 1965-1970, 1971-1980, 1981-1990, 1991-2000, 2001-2010, and 2011-2021, respectively. The data were also collected in the scientific literature from the above 30 journals covered by the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. The results showed that the research objects were developed steadily from the conventional to the interdisciplinary fields in the world agricultural engineering discipline. The conventional research fields included water and soil resources, porous media, solute transport, the drying of agricultural products, the interaction between tillage tools and soil, the performance of tractors, livestock manure treatment, and environmental pollution control. The interdisciplinary research fields were associated with the development and utilization of biomass resources (lignocellulosic, biochar bioadsorption, heavy metal, dye removal, biofuel production, anaerobic digestion, and bioenergy system life cycle assessment), algae-related research (screening and cultivation of microalgae and macroalgae, lipid increase and carbon dioxide fixation in photobioreactors, conditions, technologies and methods related to harvesting, processing and production of biofuels, microalgae biorefining, life cycle analysis of microalgae biodiesel production), hydrology and water quality research (impacts of climate change on watershed hydrology, and SWAT (soil and water assessment tool) model), application of Internet of Things, information network technology, big data, artificial intelligence, and Global Position System (GPS), Geographic Information System (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS) advanced technologies in modern agriculture (unmanned aerial vehicle system, precision agriculture, smart agriculture, vertical farm), and membrane pollution. Six periods were then named after the initial, growing, transition, sublimation, flourishing, and blending period, according to the development of world agricultural engineering disciplines. In terms of research output, the USA was the world leader in the first four periods, then Canada and England. In the last two periods, China, India, and Brazil were among the top three, China jumped to the top in the final period. There was an ever-increasingly prominent interdisciplinary in the six periods. The output and influence of the related interdisciplinary research journals were strengthened gradually, such as Bioresource Technology, Industrial Crops and Products, Water Resources Research, Biomass and Bioenergy, and Computers and Electronics in Agriculture. Several suggestions were also proposed for the development of China's agricultural engineering discipline: 1) To systematically make the overall development plan of the discipline according to the needs of Chinese modernization development and agricultural power construction; 2) To continuously strengthen the cooperation with Europe, America, and the emerging developing countries in the fields of agriculture, biological systems engineering, environmental engineering, water and soil resources, computer and electronic information technology. 3) To develop a discipline that is guided by the goals and requirements of agricultural power construction. The findings can provide an important reference for the innovation and development of the agricultural engineering disciplines in China, particularly for the powerful science & technology and talent support for Chinese agricultural modernization.","Li, Li;Wang, Yingkuan;Fu, Zetian;Wang, Decheng;Huang, Guangqun",Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2023-02-01,Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China;China Agricultural University;Chinese Academy of Agricultural Engineering,agricultural engineering ;  bibliometrics ;  CiteSpace ;  discipline development ;  strong country in agriculture ;  visualization map
Technological path and geological guarantee for energy storage in underground space formed by coal mining,"Coal resource is still in the main position of China’s energy structure, but the development of coal industry is facing the new challenge of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality”. Actively developing coal underground space energy storage technology is an effective means to promote low-carbon and clean energy utilization, and also a key measure to ensure China’ s energy strategic security. This study discussed the potential utilization of underground space formed by coal mining based on the current energy storage technologies. Focusing on new energy storage technologies such as underground pumped storage hydropower plants in coal mines (UPSHCM), thermal energy storage (TES), compressed air energy storage (CAES), electrochemical energy storage (EES), coal underground space biomass energy storage (CUBES), and other storage based on underground space of coal mining, the concept and mode of energy storage for different types of energy in abandoned mines are mainly elaborated, and the key technical problems of geological guarantee faced in the process of energy storage are systematically analyzed. The general idea of the technology of energy storage in underground space formed by coal mining is: using the underground space formed by coal mining with low potential energy difference as a cascade reservoir (UPSHCM), or as a media and energy storage space (TES, CAES, EES, CUBES, etc.), which can not only improve the utilization rate of underground space formed by coal mining, avoid the waste of land resources, but also minimize the disturbance to the ecological environment. Although the underground space formed by coal mining can be used as a large-scale energy storage reservoir, there are still some geological problems and geological guarantee techniques to be solved urgently in its development and utilization process. The followings are mainly included: (1) Analysis and safety evaluation of geological conditions and siting suitability. Specifically, this study should be conducted on the geological factors of energy storage space in terms of geotechnical engineering properties and environmental geological conditions, to identify the main control factors of energy storage space stability and their weights, as well as establish the site selection index system and evaluation methods. Thereby, the regional structure, strength of surrounding rock and development of holes and fissures can be found out to ensure the safety of the site. (2) Construction of energy storage geological body and research on key technologies. That is, the multi-scale performance evolution model of the geological body under the coupling conditions of thermal (T), hydrological (H), mechanical (M) and chemistry (C) of the energy storage geological body should be constructed according to the actual conditions of underground space and relevant parameters. The isolation wall construction of underground space, the establishment of energy storage space system, the evaluation of energy storage potential, and the innovation in surrounding rock reinforcement and improvement, seepage prevention and other safety measures of underground space should be conducted in combination with numerical analysis and simulation technology. In addition, geological guarantee should be provided for the long-term safe and efficient development of underground space energy storage. (3) Research on the performance evolution of energy storage geological body. Definitely, the thermal damage characteristics of surrounding rock at multiple scales (microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic) and the deterioration mechanism of surrounding rock fatigue strength should be revealed based on the coupling model of multi-phase (solid and liquid) and multi-field (temperature, stress, seepage and chemical fields), so as to obtain the key parameters, including the physical parameters of energy storage medium, injection volume, injection-production frequency, energy storage time and energy storage pressure, etc. Besides, a reasonable surrounding rock reinforcement process and stability control technology should be developed, and the long-term settlement law of overburden rock should be analyzed, thus providing basis for the leakage prevention project of the reservoir. (4) Assessment of long-term safety and stability of underground space. The long-term and multi-scale health monitoring and dynamic evaluation of geological conditions, safety conditions and environmental conditions of underground space formed by coal mining should be carried out, a safety early warning system for the geological environment of storage should be built, and the operation process and geological environment evolution should be analyzed to provide all-round safety monitoring and early warning for energy storage in underground space formed by coal mining. This study could provide an idea for the utilization of underground space resource formed by coal mining in China, and promote the transformation and development of China’s coal industry to be green, clean and efficient under the “dual carbon” goal.","Sun, Qiang;Zhang, Weiqiang;Geng, Jishi;Hu, Jianjun;Zhang, Yuliang;Lyu, Chao;Ge, Zhenlong;Li, Pengfei;Jia, Hailiang;Liu, Yabin;Li, Yuxiang",Journal,Meitiandizhi Yu Kantan/Coal Geology and Exploration,2023-02-01,Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China;Shanxi DaTong DaXue;China University of Mining and Technology;Hebei University of Technology;Xi'an University of Science and Technology;Qinghai University;Shenzhen University,carbon neutrality ;  energy storage ;  geological guarantee ;  multi-phase and multi-field coupling ;  underground space formed by coal mining

Development and roadmap of laser additive manufacturing technology for aviation equipment,"As the most representative additive manufacturing method in the field of aviation equipment at present, the laser additive manufacturing supports the structure design innovation, rapid development and verification. Among them, selective laser melting is mainly used for precision near net shape manufacturing of complex precise functional structures, and laser direct metal deposition is mainly used for manufacturing large and complex load-bearing structures. In order to support the strategic layout of the development of additive manufacturing technology in the aviation field, this paper sorts the current situation and development trend of laser additive manufacturing, and points out that the focus of additive manufacturing development is bound to turn to the metallurgical quality, mechanical properties and their stability control of products. The research and development of intelligent functions such as online monitoring, parameter self-tuning control of additive manufacturing equipment are becoming a research hotspot. Either the research on mechanical behavior of additive parts based on damage failure analysis and life prediction or the performance evaluation and verification technology based on components and characteristic structures have begun to attract the attention of engineering application departments. Based on the analysis of the technology development trend, the development goal of laser additive manufacturing technology in the aviation field in 2035 and the corresponding policy and environmental support and guarantee needs are proposed, and the technical development roadmap in 2035 is put forward. In 2025-2035, the control technology of microstructure, property and deformation for additive manufacturing of ordinary metal, intermetallic compound, Nb-Si and ceramic based material is to be made a comprehensive breakthrough, the performance verification is to be basically completed, the functional assessment has been partially completed, and some products are to be entered mass production.

Human–Computer Interaction and Participation in Software Crowdsourcing,"Improvements in communication and networking technologies have transformed people’s lives and organizations’ activities. Web 2.0 innovation has provided a variety of hybridized applications and tools that have changed enterprises’ functional and communication processes. People use numerous platforms to broaden their social contacts, select items, execute duties, and learn new things. Context: Crowdsourcing is an internet-enabled problem-solving strategy that utilizes human–computer interaction to leverage the expertise of people to achieve business goals. In crowdsourcing approaches, three main entities work in collaboration to solve various problems. These entities are requestors (job providers), platforms, and online users. Tasks are announced by requestors on crowdsourcing platforms, and online users, after passing initial screening, are allowed to work on these tasks. Crowds participate to achieve various rewards. Motivation: Crowdsourcing is gaining importance as an alternate outsourcing approach in the software engineering industry. Crowdsourcing application development involves complicated tasks that vary considerably from the micro-tasks available on platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. To obtain the tangible opportunities of crowdsourcing in the realm of software development, corporations should first grasp how this technique works, what problems occur, and what factors might influence community involvement and co-creation. Online communities have become more popular recently with the rise in crowdsourcing platforms. These communities concentrate on specific problems and help people with solving and managing these problems. Objectives: We set three main goals to research crowd interaction: (1) find the appropriate characteristics of social crowd utilized for effective software crowdsourcing, (2) highlight the motivation of a crowd for virtual tasks, and (3) evaluate primary participation reasons by assessing various crowds using Fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS method. Conclusion: We developed a decision support system to examine the appropriate reasons of crowd participation in crowdsourcing. Rewards and employments were evaluated as the primary motives of crowds for accomplishing tasks on crowdsourcing platforms, knowledge sharing was evaluated as the third reason, ranking was the fourth, competency was the fifth, socialization was sixth, and source of inspiration was the seventh.","Khan, Habib Ullah;Ali, Farhad;Ghadi, Yazeed Yasin;Nazir, Shah;Ullah, Inam;Mohamed, Heba G.",Journal,Electronics (Switzerland),2023-02-01,College of Business and Economics;University of Swabi;Al Ain University;Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University;Chungbuk National University,cloud computing ;  co-creation ;  collaborative participation ;  crowd wisdom ;  human–computer interaction ;  Internet ;  social crowd visualization ;  social media interaction
Deep shale gas exploration and development in the southern Sichuan Basin: New progress and challenges,"There are abundant marine shale gas resources in the Sichuan Basin. After almost one decade of exploration and development, three national shale gas demonstration areas have been built in the Sichuan Basin and its periphery, and large-scale commercial development of middle and deep (above 3500 m in depth) shale gas has been successfully achieved. The volume of deep shale gas resources (3500–4500 m deep) of the upper Ordovician Wufeng Formation-lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation in the southern Sichuan Basin is 6.6 × 1012 m3, with huge exploration and exploitation potential, so it is an important area for large-scale shale gas production increase in China during the 14th Five-year Plan. Deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin is influenced by complex geological engineering conditions, such as great burial depth, high temperature and pressure, and large stress and stress difference, and its high-quality development faces many challenges. After systematically summarizing the new progresses and achievements in deep shale gas exploration and development in the southern Sichuan Basin, this paper analyzes the difficulties and challenges in deep shale gas exploration and development and puts forward the next research directions. And the following research results are obtained. First, based on early practical exploration and independent innovation, key shale gas exploration and development technologies with good area selection, good well deployment, good well drilling, good well fracturing and good well management as the core are formed, and the cultivation mode of high production well is established, which supports the large-scale benefit development of deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin. Second, systematical analysis indicates that the exploration and development of deep shale gas still faces a series of challenges in such three major fields as basic theory, key technology and management mode. Third, in the face of challenges, it is necessary to deepen basic theory research related to exploration and development, continuously improve key main technologies and constantly innovate mechanisms, systems and management modes. In conclusion, after years of continuous researches and pilot tests, a series of main exploration and development technologies suitable for the working conditions of deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin have been basically formed, the first deep shale gas reserves of trillion cubic meters has been submitted, and the first deep shale gas production increase block of ten billion cubic meters has been selected. Thus, great progresses have been made in the exploration and development of deep shale gas, which confirms the confidence and determination in exploring and developing deep shale gas and is of great guiding significance to the rapid development of shale gas industry in China.","He, Xiao;Chen, Gengsheng;Wu, Jianfa;Liu, Yong;Wu, Shuai;Zhang, Jian;Zhang, Xiaotao",Journal,Natural Gas Industry B,2023-02-01,China National Petroleum Corporation;Ltd.,Challenge ;  Deep shale gas ;  Exploration and development progress ;  Geology–engineering integration ;  Southern Sichuan Basin ;  Wufeng–Longmaxi
Profitable development technology of the Changning-Weiyuan National Shale Gas Demonstration Area in the Sichuan Basin and its enlightenment,"Since the approval to establishment, the Changning-Weiyuan National Shale Gas Demonstration Area in the Sichuan Basin (hereinafter referred to as Demonstration Area) has been built up into a shale gas industry demonstration base characterized with scale, technology, management and green after more than 10 years of exploration and practice. Its successful experience is of great guiding significance to the efficient development of unconventional oil and gas resources in China. In this paper, the technologies which were developed for the beneficial development of the Demonstration Area during the 13th Five-Year Plan are systematically reviewed and summarized. Then, some countermeasures are proposed to solve the difficulties and challenges to the long-term benefit and stable production of middle-deep shale gas in this area. And the following research results are obtained. First, during the construction of the Demonstration Area, the “three-control” shale gas enrichment and high-production theory is innovatively proposed, and the shale gas enrichment model in the southern Sichuan Basin is clarified. Second, a high-production well cultivation method based on geology-engineering integration is established by developing six main technologies for shale gas exploration and development, which effectively supports the large-scale beneficial development of shale gas in the Demonstration Area. Third, the beneficial development model of middle-deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin is preliminarily formed, and the benefit and efficiency of productivity construction are improved comprehensively. Fourth, the three measures of “controlling the decline rate, enhancing the reserve production and expanding the periphery” are used to support the replacement and stable production of middle-deep shale gas. In conclusion, to sustainably ensure the long-term benefit and stable production of shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin, it is still necessary to deepen fine reservoir description and complex mechanism understanding and explore EOR technologies. What's more, the important mean to improve the single-well shale gas production rate in this area is to strengthen the fine fracturing design and implementation under the deep integration of geology and engineering and improve the construction quality of fracturing network continuously. Furthermore, the only way to the low-cost development of the demonstration area is to promote the management reform and innovation continuously and improve the beneficial development model further.","Yong, Rui;Chen, Gengsheng;Yang, Xuefeng;Huang, Shan;Li, Bo;Zheng, Majia;Liu, Wenping;He, Yiping",Journal,Natural Gas Industry B,2023-02-01,PetroChina Company Limited;China National Petroleum Corporation,Changning-Weiyuan ;  Geology-engineering integration ;  Middle-deep formation ;  National Shale Gas Demonstration Area ;  Profitable development ;  Resource enrichment and high-production ;  Sichuan Basin ;  Stable production optimization
Mechanical Characterization and Constitutive Modeling of Nano-Stabilized Soil under Uniaxial Compression,"The stress–strain constitutive model under uniaxial compression is a basic element and important characterization method for determining physical and mechanical properties in cement-based materials research. In this study, a stress–strain constitutive model under uniaxial compression was established, which was based on a new nano-stabilized soil (NSS) through typical mechanical tests and constitutive relationship research. The results indicate that the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the nano-stabilized soil was enhanced with the increase in curing period and nano-stabilizer dosage, and that the strength growth rate reaches the maximum at a 12% dosage in the tested samples. The UCS of NSS under a 12% dosage is about 10~15% higher than that of ordinary stabilized soil (SS) without nano doping, and 25~40% higher compared with grade 42.5 cement-soil. The established constitutive model could accurately describe the linear-elastic and elastic-plastic deformation characteristics of NSS under uniaxial compression, which will be conducive to revealing the curve variation law of the stress–strain process. The research results could provide scientific support for the theoretical innovation and engineering application of green environmental protection materials.","Zhang, Xingchen;Gao, Jianen;Qiang, Minmin;Zhang, Haochen;Li, Xinghua;Long, Shaobo;Gao, Zhe;Fan, Henghui",Journal,Materials,2023-02-01,Yan'an University;Northwest A&F University;Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited,constitutive model ;  nano-stabilized soil ;  stress–strain curve ;  unconfined compressive strength
mRNA-Based Therapeutics in Cancer Treatment,"Over the past two decades, significant technological innovations have led to messenger RNA (mRNA) becoming a promising option for developing prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and genome engineering. The success of the two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has sparked new enthusiasm for other medical applications, particularly in cancer treatment. In vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNAs are structurally designed to resemble naturally occurring mature mRNA. Delivery of IVT mRNA via delivery platforms such as lipid nanoparticles allows host cells to produce many copies of encoded proteins, which can serve as antigens to stimulate immune responses or as additional beneficial proteins for supplements. mRNA-based cancer therapeutics include mRNA cancer vaccines, mRNA encoding cytokines, chimeric antigen receptors, tumor suppressors, and other combination therapies. To better understand the current development and research status of mRNA therapies for cancer treatment, this review focused on the molecular design, delivery systems, and clinical indications of mRNA therapies in cancer.","Sun, Han;Zhang, Yu;Wang, Ge;Yang, Wen;Xu, Yingjie",Journal,Pharmaceutics,2023-02-01,"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine;Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine",cancer immunotherapy ;  delivery ;  messenger RNA ;  modification ;  mRNA vaccine
Impact and Assessment of Suspension Stiffness on Vibration Propagation into Vehicle,"The impact of transport-induced vibrations on people is a particularly important problem. Sudden or intensifying vibration phenomena of a local nature may compromise safety, especially in transport. The paper addresses the results of research on the impact of spring stiffness parameters on the propagation of vibrations in the vehicle structure using simple amplitude and frequency measures. The use of the developed method of selective multi-criteria analysis of frequency bands made it possible to compare the vibrations recorded in the vehicle with a new or worn coil spring. The results of the present study allow the development of a large data base in which all signals are classified by the exploitation parameters and location of the propagation of vibration in the vehicle. The most important findings and achievements of the presented study are the testing of actual suspension components with real damage under controlled conditions, the identification of the vibration propagation path from the wheel to the driver and passenger feet, the quantitative comparison of vibrations affecting humans in the vehicle (through the feet), and the frequency decomposition of vibration for selected bands. These findings improve the proper interpretation of the developed measures and, as a result, the difficulties in using this knowledge at the engineering level, for example, in the design and construction improvement stage. Therefore, innovation points and engineering significances are a method of selective multi-criteria analysis of frequency bands and have potential applications in diagnostics and the design of suspension systems and in terms of passengers’ comfort.","Burdzik, Rafał",Journal,Sensors,2023-02-01,Silesian University of Technology,coil spring ;  suspension stiffness ;  vehicle ;  vibration propagation
Hydrogenase and Nitrogenase: Key Catalysts in Biohydrogen Production,"Hydrogen with high energy content is considered to be a promising alternative clean energy source. Biohydrogen production through microbes provides a renewable and immense hydrogen supply by utilizing raw materials such as inexhaustible natural sunlight, water, and even organic waste, which is supposed to solve the two problems of “energy supply and environment protection” at the same time. Hydrogenases and nitrogenases are two classes of key enzymes involved in biohydrogen production and can be applied under different biological conditions. Both the research on enzymatic catalytic mechanisms and the innovations of enzymatic techniques are important and necessary for the application of biohydrogen production. In this review, we introduce the enzymatic structures related to biohydrogen production, summarize recent enzymatic and genetic engineering works to enhance hydrogen production, and describe the chemical efforts of novel synthetic artificial enzymes inspired by the two biocatalysts. Continual studies on the two types of enzymes in the future will further improve the efficiency of biohydrogen production and contribute to the economic feasibility of biohydrogen as an energy source.","Xuan, Jinsong;He, Lingling;Wen, Wen;Feng, Yingang",Journal,Molecules,2023-02-01,Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;University of Science and Technology Beijing;Qingdao New Energy Shandong Laboratory;Shandong Energy Institute,biocatalyst ;  biohydrogen production ;  enzyme engineering ;  hydrogenases ;  nitrogenases

TSO-GCN: A Graph Convolutional Network approach for real-time and generalizable truss structural optimization,"The truss structural optimization is a major research topic in the field of structural, civil, aerospace engineering, etc. Conventionally, the truss structural optimization methods are often inefficient because they run in iterations and are computationally intensive during each iteration. In this paper, we propose a generative design framework based on deep learning networks to predict three dimensional structural topologies without iterative computations while achieving acceptable accuracy. Different from most commonly used deep learning driven structural optimization approaches that transform structural geometries into images, our innovation lies in solving optimization problems based on geometric analysis from the perspective of graphs, and efficiently predict the near optimal truss structure with a negligible computational time. Therefore, it shows potential significance in design scenarios when the structure is described by connections and massive number of optimization computations are required. The proposed generative design framework is called TSO-GCN (Truss Structural Optimization - Graph Convolutional Network), which is an encoder–decoder based graph convolution network designed to map the problem definition and the desired truss layout. Once trained, it is expected to directly predict truss layouts by feeding into the encoded optimization problem definitions. To train the TSO-GCN, a dataset consisting of different number of problem definitions and their corresponding minimum volume results generated by conventional methods is constructed and fed into the network. The experiments show that TSO-GCN can predict results with the near optimal accuracy compared with conventional approaches while costing an average time of only 1 s. Besides, extra experiments with totally unseen dataset are performed to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method.","Zheng, Shuai;Qiu, Lingjie;Lan, Fengxin",Journal,Applied Soft Computing,2023-02-01,Xi'an Jiaotong University,Graph Convolutional Networks ;  Ground structure method ;  Structural optimization ;  Truss optimization
Combining machine learning with a pharmaceutical technology roadmap to analyze technological innovation opportunities,"Technology roadmaps (TRM) with flexible architectural structures and development processes can effectively mitigate innovation dilemmas in pharmaceutical technology innovation opportunity analysis, such as long innovation cycles and inefficient translation. However, pharmaceutical technology innovation has become complicated and increasingly diverse. The current TRMs do not adapt well to this new reality. In response, this study proposes a systematic and specific framework to develop a pharmaceutical technology roadmap. Compared with standardized TRM, this TRM proposes three improvements. The first extension is the designing of the layers. The second extension is the selecting of the data source. The last extension is the processing of data sources. To validate the proposed framework, a case study in the field of hyperuricemia drugs was conducted. Our analysis focuses on the construction of a pharmaceutical TRM framework and a review of technology topics from multiple data sources that can supply quantitative information to explore the current trends. The analyzed results can assist the research and development professionals to predict technological opportunities and support experts to make more reasonable decision-making for a particular pharmaceutical domain.","Feng, Lijie;Zhao, Weiyu;Wang, Jinfeng;Feng, Jian;Guo, Yanan",Journal,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023-02-01,Shanghai Maritime University;Shanghai University;Zhengzhou University,Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) ;  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ;  Pharmaceutical technology innovation ;  Pharmaceutical technology opportunity analysis ;  Technology roadmap (TRM)
Technologies Driving the Shift to Smart Farming: A Review,"As today's agriculture industry is facing numerous challenges, including climate changes, encroachment of the urban environment, and lack of qualified farmers, there is a need for new practices to ensure sustainable agriculture and food supply. Consequently, there is an emphasis on upgrading farming practices by shifting toward smart farming (SF) - utilizing advanced information and communication technologies to improve the quantity and quality of the crop with minimal labor interference. SF has gained lots of interest in recent years utilizing a variety of technological innovations in the field, which imposes a challenge on farmers and technology integrators to identify suitable technologies and best practices for a particular application. This article provides a survey of the most recent SF scientific literature to identify common practices toward technology integration, challenges, and solutions. The survey was conducted on 588 papers published on the IEEE database following Cochrane methods to ensure appropriate analysis and interpretation of results. The papers' contributions were analyzed to identify necessary technologies that constitute SF, and consequently, research themes were identified. The identified themes are sensors, communication, big data, actuators and machines, and data analysis. Besides presenting an in-depth analysis of each identified theme, this article discusses integrating more than one technology in systems to achieve independency. The most common SF systems are remote monitoring, autonomous, and intelligent decision-making systems.","Elbeheiry, Nabila;Balog, Robert S.",Journal,IEEE Sensors Journal,2023-02-01,College of Engineering,Actuators ;  automation ;  data analysis ;  deep learning (DL) ;  Internet of Things (IoT) ;  irrigation systems ;  lowpower wide area network (LPWAN) ;  machine learning (ML) ;  microcontrollers ;  remote monitoring ;  robotics ;  smart farming (SF) ;  wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
Unlocking the eHealth professionals’ career pathways: A case of Gulf Cooperation Council countries,"Background: During the past two decades, various sectors and industries have undergone digital transformation. Healthcare is poised to make a full transformation in the near future. Although steps have been taken toward creating an infrastructure for digital health in the Middle East, as it stands, digital health is still an emerging field here. The current global health care crisis has underscored the need for digitization of the healthcare sector to provide high-value, high-quality care and knowledge generation. With the advent of digital transformation in countries around the globe, there is a rising demand for investment and innovation in health information technology. With the demand for health informatics (HI) graduates in different disciplines (e.g., healthcare professions, information technology, etc.), there is an urgent need to determine and regulate clear career pathways and the core competencies necessary for digital health professional to practice effectively and to allow technology to add value to the healthcare systems. Given the changing landscape of the profession, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are experiencing a rising demand to produce digital health professionals who can meet the needs of all the stakeholders involved, including patients, healthcare professionals, managers, and policymakers. However, despite the number of region-wide initiatives in the form of training programs, there remains a knowledge–practice gap and unclear job roles within the HI community. In recent years, regional digital health workforce initiatives have been put forward, such as the GCC Taskforce on Workforce Development in Digital Healthcare. The taskforce initiated a survey and several workshops to identify and classify HI disciplines according to the needs of the job market and through comparisons with similar efforts developed across the globe, such as the TIGER project and the EU*US eHealth Work project. Digital health implementation has been flourishing in the Middle East for the past 15 years. During this period, while digital health professions have been thriving in the industry to deliver tools and technologies, academic institutions have offered some amount of training and education in digital health; however, the career pathway for digital health professionals is not clear due to mismatch about the qualifications, skills, competencies and experience needed by the healthcare industry. Objectives: Due to this discrepancy between the academic curriculum and the skills needed in the healthcare industry, the objectives of this study are to define the career pathway for eHealth professions and identify the challenges experienced by academic institutions and the industry in describing digital health professionals. Methods: We elicited qualitative data by conducting six focus groups with individuals from different professional backgrounds, including healthcare workers, information managers, computer sciences professionals, and workers in the revenue cycle who participated in a workshop on November 2–3, 2019, in Dubai. All focus group sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed, and participants were de-identified before analysis. An exploratory method was used to identify themes and subthemes. Saturation was reached when similar responses were found during the analysis. In this study, we found that respondents clearly defined eHealth career pathways based on criteria that included qualifications, experience, job scope, and competency. We also explored the challenges that the respondents encountered, including differences in the required skill sets and training and the need to standardize the academic curriculum across the GCC region, to recognize the various career pathways, and to develop local training programs. Additionally, country-specific projects have been initiated, such as the competency-based Digital Health framework, which was developed by the Saudi Commission of Healthcare Specialties (SCFHS) in 2018. Competency-based digital health frameworks generally include relevant job definitions, roles, and recommended competencies. Both the GCC taskforce and the Saudi studies capitalized on previous efforts by professional organizations, including Canada's Digital Health formerly known as (COACH), the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and the Health Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS). Results: In this study, we found that respondents defined eHealth career pathways based on different criteria such as: qualifications; various background of health and IT in the HI field; work experiences; job scope and competency. We also further explore the challenges that the respondents encountered which delineates four key aspects such as need of hybrid skills to manage the digital transformation, need of standardization of academic curriculum across GCC, recognition of the career pathways by the industry in order to open up career opportunity and career advancement, and availability of local training programs for up­skilling the current health workforce. Conclusion: We believe that successful health digital transformation is not limited to technology advancement but requires an adaptive change in: the related competency-based frameworks, the organisation of work and career paths for eHealth professionals, and the development of educational programmes and joint degrees to equip clinicians with understanding of technology, and informaticians with understanding of healthcare. We anticipate that this work will be expanded and adopted by relevant professional and scientific bodies in the GCC region.","Zakaria, Nasriah;Zakaria, Norhayati;Alnobani, Omar;AlMalki, Manal;El-Hassan, Osama;Alhefzi, Mohammed I.;Househ, Mowafa;Jamal, Amr",Journal,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2023-02-01,"College of Business Administration;Almaarefa University;Dubai Health Authority;Hamad Bin Khalifa University, College of Science and Engineering;Jazan University;College of Medicine;Universiti Malaya;Pfizer Inc.;Saudi Association for Health Informatics (SAHI)",Career pathways ;  Digital health transformation ;  eHealth profession ;  GCC countries
Has the construction of ecological civilization promoted green technology innovation?,"Innovation in green technologies is the key force behind green development. We employed the difference-in-differences model to evaluate the influences of ecological civilization construction (ECC) on green technology innovation. The study discovered that the development of ecological civilization significantly increased the innovation of green technologies in the pilot area. Because green utility model patents (GUP) have a positive spatial spillover while green invention patents (GIP) have a siphon effect that causes a negative spatial overflow, the promotion effect on GUP is larger. Along with its direct effects, the construction of ecological civilization can also bring in environmental investments and human capital. Additionally, it can aid in enhancing the industrial infrastructure and organizational structure, which raises the level of innovation in green technology.","Hu, Jin;Hu, Mingjun;Zhang, Hong",Journal,Environmental Technology and Innovation,2023-02-01,Guizhou University of Finance and Economics;Wenzhou University,Ecological civilization construction ;  Green invention patent ;  Green technology innovation ;  Green utility model patent ;  Space spillover
"Catalytic reduction of water pollutants: knowledge gaps, lessons learned, and new opportunities","In this paper, we discuss the previous advances, current challenges, and future opportunities for the research of catalytic reduction of water pollutants. We present five case studies on the development of palladium-based catalysts for nitrate, chlorate, and perchlorate reduction with hydrogen gas under ambient conditions. We emphasize the realization of new functionalities through the screening and design of catalytic metal sites, including (i) platinum group metal (PGM) nanoparticles, (ii) the secondary metals for improving the reaction rate and product selectivity of nitrate reduction, (iii) oxygen-atom-transfer metal oxides for chlorate and perchlorate reduction, and (iv) ligand-enhanced coordination complexes for substantial activity enhancement. We also highlight the facile catalyst preparation approach that brought significant convenience to catalyst optimization. Based on our own studies, we then discuss directions of the catalyst research effort that are not immediately necessary or desirable, including (1) systematic study on the downstream aspects of under-developed catalysts, (2) random integration with hot concepts without a clear rationale, and (3) excessive and decorative experiments. We further address some general concerns regarding using H2 and PGMs in the catalytic system. Finally, we recommend future catalyst development in both “fundamental” and “applied” aspects. The purpose of this perspective is to remove major misconceptions about reductive catalysis research and bring back significant innovations for both scientific advancements and engineering applications to benefit environmental protection.

An alumni-based collaborative model to strengthen academia and industry partnership: The current challenges and strengths,"Industry-academia collaboration (IAC) has long been a source of discussion in various ways. A vital first step toward closing the gap is fostering alumni engagement in industry and academia. Industry-academia collaborations are like earth and water, and they live in harmony. They cannot exist apart from one another. The collaborative effort between industry and academia promotes improvement and innovation in technology and innovative research and enables the university to be more relevant to the industry. This article proposes a collaborative approach based on alumni influences and uses secondary data on the influences of alumni in engineering to enrich the collaboration between industry and academia. The industry and academia utilize the alumni’s potential to facilitate communication and offer their students and staff facilities. The research findings can be used by policymakers to innovate in the field of engineering and to strengthen the partnership between industry and academia in society. The model enables academia and industry to utilize the alumni strengths in enriching the collaboration; it also enhances academic research output, recruitment, fundraising, marketing, product promotion, and internship opportunities for students via alumni active participation. We propose some significant agendas for future work.","Malhotra, Ruchika;Massoudi, Massoud;Jindal, Rajni",Journal,Education and Information Technologies,2023-02-01,Delhi Technological University,Academia-alumni ;  Alumni association ;  Alumni engagement ;  Industry-academia collaboration ;  Internship and research

Design and innovation of audio IoT technology using music teaching intelligent mode,"The traditional music teaching model cannot meet the needs of modern music teaching. Therefore, this paper combines machine learning technology and Internet of Things audio technology to improve the music audio recognition algorithm. In order to ensure the smoothness between music frames and the continuity of speech, when the remaining length of the music audio stream tail is less than one frame length, it is directly discarded and no framing processing is performed. The main end of the integrated platform can communicate with the sub-end systems of each smart music classroom through a standard communication protocol by the front communication server, and access the information and data of each device subsystem in the smart music classroom. In addition, this paper combines the needs of music teaching to construct the layout of the smart music classroom and the software system architecture. After constructing the system, this paper designs experiments to verify the performance of the teaching system constructed in this paper. The experimental research results show that the audio technology based on the Internet of Things proposed in this paper can play an important role in music teaching.","Li, Lintao;Han, Zhongling",Journal,Neural Computing and Applications,2023-02-01,Qingdao University,Audio technology ;  Intelligent mode ;  Internet of things ;  Music teaching
Chemical surface modification of hydroxyapatite for biomedical application: a review,"Many attempts have been made to improve the bioactivity of medical grafts and implants. For its near resemblance to bine and dental materials, hydroxyapatite (HA) is frequently used as a biomaterial to stimulate bone regeneration and is frequently coated on implant surfaces to make them biocompatible. Various research groups are working on a variety of biomaterials in order to induce and even improve bioactivity at the bone-implant interface. A medical implant’s clinical effectiveness is largely determined by the biological response at the interface, as well as the mechanical qualities that are appropriate for the application. The production of HA, as well as innovations and progress in terms of surface modification and their subsequent use in biomedical applications such as cell adhesion, proliferation, bone regeneration, and reconstruction, is discussed in this study.","Nabipour, Hafezeh;Batool, Sadia;Hu, Yuan",Journal,Emergent Materials,2023-02-01,Fatima Jinnah Women University;University of Science and Technology of China,Apatite ;  Biomedical ;  Implants ;  Surface engineering ;  Surface modification
Educating the Engineer Entrepreneur of the Future: A Team Competency Perspective,"While the ability to function in multidisciplinary entrepreneurship teams is becoming increasingly important for engineers, research on this topic is still scarce. To address this gap, we propose a framework describing team competencies for engineering entrepreneurship students that builds on the literature on teams, entrepreneurship, and engineering. Our framework is comprised of three components with 12 team-level competencies. First, discipline-driven competencies: technology literacy, adapted innovation capacity, and stakeholder empathy. Second, task-contingent competencies, which include team entrepreneurial efficacy, capability to build diverse networks, ability to communicate and persuade nonengineering audiences, leveraging team resources, team value creation and capturing ability, and team resilience. And finally, third, team-contingent competencies, including shared mental models, team conflict management, and team reflexivity. With this conceptual model, we define key competencies that can help inform the development of relevant pedagogical content and exercises for team-based entrepreneurship programs. We conclude the article with a discussion of implications for practice and future research.","Neumeyer, Xaver;Santos, Susana C.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-02-01,University of North Carolina Wilmington;Iscte – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa;Rowan University,Engineering entrepreneurship education ;  entrepreneurship ;  multidisciplinary teams ;  team competencies ;  team-based entrepreneurship
Examining the Technical and Social Foundations of Mass Customization Capability: A Capability Hierarchy View,"While many firms aspire to develop a mass customization capability (MCC) and much is known about the antecedents of MCC, the structural links between different levels of operational capabilities and MCC are underexamined. From a capability hierarchy perspective, we propose a three-order capability hierarchy in which engineering and processing capabilities, along with decision-making norms, act as foundations for operational innovation capability and MCC. We test the proposed model with survey data from 498 firms worldwide using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping mediation analysis. Our results support a hierarchical structure of capabilities for MCC, which categorizes capabilities at different levels and disentangles their capability creation mechanisms in the operational process. Our research enriches the current mass customization research stream by examining the social microfoundations of MCC and addresses the theoretical and empirical relationships among MCC, innovation, and other operational capabilities from a capability hierarchy perspective. This article also underscores the importance of managing capability links for competitive advantages.","Liu, Zhongzhi;McCardle, Jie G.;Kull, Thomas J.;Krumwiede, Dennis",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-02-01,Georgia Southern University;Soochow University;Idaho State University;Arizona State University,Capability hierarchy ;  decision norms ;  mass customization capability (MCC) ;  operational innovation capability (OIC)
Factors Influencing Student Information Technology Adoption,"Innovating service delivery in higher education by leveraging technology is central to supporting goals of transforming higher education to center on the needs of today's students. Aligned with these goals, this article identifies key determinants of student information technology adoption. Using a mixed-methods and empirical approach based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a web-based survey was administered to undergraduate students at a public university in the Western United States to learn about their experiences with a web-based digital services platform (native mobile app and website), that aids students in accessing services and resources critical to maintaining their enrollment. Structural Equation Modeling, including Principal Components Analysis, was used to analyze 1841 valid survey responses and derive statistical results. The findings suggest that effort expectancy and social influence stand out as critical influences on behavioral intention to adopt the software for accessing university services, and new to UTAUT, that social influence and a students' basic technology skills are significant determinants of effort expectancy. This article makes unique contributions to the research literature. It applies UTAUT to a higher education context to help explain the critical determinants of the adoption of software for accessing university services. It also provides insights for how UTAUT can be applied in the university setting and offers suggestions for enhancing UTAUT.","Vanderschaaf, Hans P.;Daim, Tugrul U.;Basoglu, Nuri A.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-02-01,Portland State University;Oregon Health & Science University;Izmir Yüksek Teknoloji Enstitüsü,College students ;  higher education ;  information technology ;  service innovation ;  technological innovation
Cyborgs: Is it Sci-Fi or Nearest Future,"The rising innovative advancements across different logical fields have achieved radical changes in the manners we see and characterize being human in the present profoundly mechanically arranged society. Extending human abilities is something we have always been trying to do. This is where Cyborg (Cybernetic Organism) comes into the picture. Cyborg can be depicted as a machine man, which is a typical subject in sci-fi. Many writers have created different depictions under science fiction showing various aspects of future humans, life, culture, and society. Advancements in robotics, Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) research, molecular biology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, medicine, etc., are for the most part still in a test stage; however, all things considered, they will end up being a piece of our everyday experience. As the innovations create and change at an ever more prominent pace forcing the future upon us, the Cyborg idea as a future is evolving in like manner. This paper presents an overview of science fiction and a broad discussion on human transformation. We will try to find out different sectors where Cyborg has been used and attempt to see the scope of Cyborg in the future with all the limitations it may have to finally derive to a conclusion whether Cyborg is a typical subject in sci-fi or is it the nearest future.","Sangam, Shruti;Nisha, T.

Electrics/Electronics Platforms in the Automotive Industry: Challenges and Directions for Variant-Rich Systems Engineering,"Within the automotive industry, platform strategies are successfully used to efficiently develop large variant-rich systems. In parallel, new features in automotive systems continue to originate more and more from software-driven rather than hardware-driven innovations. To manage the growing relevance of software, automotive companies increasingly adopt concepts and methods from software-platform engineering, such as software product lines. However, there is a lack of concepts for integrated systems-platform engineering to support the management of hardware, software, and particularly their interactions within a (cyber-physical) variant-rich system. One particular concept that has been proposed to manage automotive-systems engineering are electrics/electronics platforms, but these are not well researched in the context of managing variant-rich systems. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of electrics/electronics platforms for managing variant-rich automotive systems throughout their whole life-cycle with their increasing share of software as well as of hardware-software interactions. For this purpose, we build on literature to elicit and compare concepts of electrics/electronics platforms with those of software and hardware platforms, and map these concepts to state-of-Art practices employed at one automotive company. Based on these comparisons, we identify key challenges and research directions to move towards the practical adoption of electrics/electronics platforms in the automotive industry.","Holsten, Lennart;Frank, Christian;Krüger, Jacob;Leich, Thomas",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023-01-25,"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Volkswagen AG;Hochschule Harz, Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften (FH)",automotive ;  cyber-physical system ;  electric/electronic platform ;  life-cycle management ;  variant management
Life cycle assessment teaching innovation: experiences from a Brazilian higher education institution,"Purpose: The inclusion of sustainability in higher education courses has been debated in recent decades and has gained particular emphasis throughout the COVID-19. This paper aims to show how the context of the pandemic, which demanded the transition from in-person classes to virtual classes, was used to illustrate better the concepts of life cycle assessment (LCA) for Production Engineering students in a Brazilian University. Design/methodology/approach: The research strategy used was action research. Throughout the discipline offering, the environmental impacts resulting from in-person and remote classes were comparatively assessed through a practical activity using LCA. Students’ behaviour and perception of the activities were recorded by the professor and discussed with the other researchers on the team. At the end of the course, students answered a questionnaire to assess their satisfaction with different aspects of the discipline, and these data were analysed via Fuzzy Delphi. Findings: The results focus on discussing the pedagogical aspects of this experience and not the environmental impacts resulting from each class modality. It was possible to notice a greater engagement of students when using a project that directly involved their daily activities (food, transportation, use of electronics, etc.) compared to the traditional approach of teaching LCA concepts. In this traditional approach, the examples focussed on the industrial sector, a more distant context from the reality of most students. Student feedback demonstrated great acceptance by them regarding the approach adopted. Originality/value: This study contributes to expanding debates about sustainability insertion in higher education and the training of professionals more aligned with the sustainable development agenda.","Silva, Diogo Aparecido Lopes;Giusti, Gabriela;Rampasso, Izabela Simon;Farrapo Junior, Antonio Carlos;Anholon, Rosley",Journal,International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education,2023-01-24,Universidade Estadual de Campinas;Universidad Católica del Norte;Universidade Federal de São Carlos,Brazil ;  COVID-19 ;  Engineering education ;  Fuzzy Delphi ;  Life cycle assessment ;  Sustainability insertion
Applications of SMILE-extracted lenticules in ophthalmology,"• AIM: To review recent innovations, challenges, and applications of small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) extracted lenticule for treating ocular disorders. • METHODS: A literature review was performed in the PubMed database, which was last updated on 30 December 2021. There was no limit regarding language. The authors evaluated the reference lists of the collected papers to find any relevant research. • RESULTS: Due to the simplicity and accuracy of modern femtosecond lasers and the extensive development of SMILE surgery, many healthy human corneal stromal lenticules were extracted during surgery, motivating some professionals to investigate the SMILE lenticule reusability in different ocular disorders. In addition, new approaches had been developed to preserve, modify, and bioengineer the corneal stroma, leading to the optimal use of discarded byproducts such as lenticules from SMILE surgery. The lenticules can be effectively re-implanted into the autologous or allogenic corneas of human subjects to treat refractive errors, corneal ectasia, and corneal perforation and serve as a patch graft for glaucoma drainage devices with better cosmetic outcomes. • CONCLUSION: SMILE-extracted lenticules could be a viable alternative to human donor corneal tissue.","Aghamollaei, Hossein;Hashemi, Hassan;Fallahtafti, Mahsa;Daryabari, Seyed Hashem;Khabazkhoob, Mehdi;Jadidi, Khosrow",Journal,International Journal of Ophthalmology,2023-01-18,Semnan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services;Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences;Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences;Noor Eye Hospital,corneal lenticule implantation ;  corneal perforation ;  femtosecond laser ;  keratoconus ;  small incision lenticule extraction ;  stromal keratophakia

Reviewing the sociotechnical dynamics of carbon removal,"In recent years, carbon removal and associated net-zero energy technologies have emerged as serious options for policymakers and scientists to consider when trying to address climate change. How, where, and when to use these options effectively are, however, polemic, and research examining the social or justice dimensions of deployment—actual or prospective—remains uncommon. This review provides an interdisciplinary and holistic perspective of the sociotechnical dynamics of carbon-removal options. It employs a sociotechnical approach that reveals the different epistemic, economic, technical, social, political, and environmental elements necessary for a net-zero energy transition. In this review, we first summarize seven broad classes of carbon removal—afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, marine biomass and blue carbon, direct air capture with carbon storage, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, enhanced weathering, and biochar. The review then explores four critical sociotechnical areas in greater depth: modeling and assessment, social acceptance, innovation and scaling, and policy and governance. We conclude with implications for policy and research.","Sovacool, Benjamin K.;Baum, Chad M.;Low, Sean",Journal,Joule,2023-01-18,University of Sussex Business School;Aarhus Universitet;Boston University,carbon dioxide removal ;  climate engineering ;  greenhouse gas removal ;  negative emissions technologies ;  net-zero transition
Revisiting the whole systems approach: designing supply chains in a turbulent world,"Purpose: The systems approach is an exemplar of design science research (DSR), whereby specific designs yield generic knowledge. DSR is increasingly being adopted in logistics and operations management research, but many point to neglect of the human aspects of solutions developed. The authors argue that it is possible to look back at the history of the systems movement to seek precedent for ‘dealing’ with the social components, providing a methodologically pluralistic ‘research design’ framework. Thereby, systems approaches are foundational to providing a design-based ‘science’ to progressing the logistics and supply chain management field, dealing with contemporary topics such as resilience. Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertake a discursive assessment of relevant streams of engineering, social science and systems research, with a conceptual development of how the latter influences supply chain design approaches. Findings: Building on a phenomenological framework, the authors create a generic design science research design (DSRD) that enables researchers to choose and integrate the right tools and methods to address simple, complicated and complex problems, dealing with technological, process and social problems. Research limitations/implications: The DSRD provides a framework by which to exploit a range of methodological stances to problem solving, including quantitative modelling perspectives and ‘soft’ systems social science approaches. Four substantive gaps are identified for future research – establishing the root cause domain of the problem, how to deal with the hierarchy of systems within systems, establishing appropriate criteria for the solution design and how best to deal with chaotic and disordered systems. Originality/value: The authors argue that the systems approaches offer methodological pluralism by which a generic DSRD may be applied to enhance supply chain design. The authors show the relevance of the DSRD to supply chain design problems including in reducing supply chain dynamics and enhance resilience. In doing so, the study points towards an integrated perspective and future research agenda for designing resilient supply chains.","Naim, Mohamed M.;Gosling, Jonathan",Journal,International Journal of Logistics Management,2023-01-18,Cardiff Business School,Supply chain competences ;  Supply chain innovation ;  Supply chain integration ;  Supply chain strategy ;  Supply chain redesign
An osteoarthritis model in vitro: characteristics and new design idea,"BACKGROUND: In domestic and foreign literature, an in vitro model is an important tool to study the pathogenesis and effective treatment of osteoarthritis. All kinds of in vitro models have their advantages and disadvantages and related applications; however, so far, there is no ideal experimental model that can study all the characteristics of osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE: To review relevant literature in recent years and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of various osteoarthritis models in vitro and their related applications, providing further understanding of osteoarthritis and its therapeutic methods. METHODS: The articles related to PubMed, CNKI, VIP, and WanFang databases from 2010 to 2021 were searched by computer with the English search words: “osteoarthritis, in vitro, model” in English and Chinese. Sixty-three qualified literature with strong correlation and relatively new publication years were selected for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Two-dimensional cell culture models of osteoarthritis are easy to be constructed and produced on a large scale, but they are only suitable for studies at the cellular level due to the lack of typical three-dimensional microstructure and interactions with surrounding cells and extracellular matrix. Explant model and three-dimensional cell culture provide an internal environment close to the physical condition of the human body, which can be used to study not only cytokines stimulation but also physical injuries and biomechanical changes. Therefore, we can better study the molecular mechanism of osteoarthritis and propose available interventions. However, from the view of tissue volume and cell vitality, mass production of these models is difficult. In addition, the article also discusses advanced tissue engineering models such as three-dimensional biofabrication models, organoids, and organ-on-a-chip models. Three-dimensional bio-printing technologies and bioreactors have obvious advantages in precise control of tissue structure, transport of bioactive molecules, dynamic cell culture and other aspects, but it still needs further improvement and innovation at present. In general, compared with the two-dimensional cell culture model, the in vitro three-dimensional tissue model is more suitable for current research and individualized treatment of osteoarthritis. In the future, it is expected to integrate emerging technologies such as organ chip technology, three-dimensional bio-printing technology and bioreactor, and eventually develop a more suitable platform for osteoarthritis treatment and drug testing.","Li, Mingxiu;Wang, Xuan;Yang, Jie;Li, Yi",Journal,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,2023-01-18,Xi'an Honghui Hospital;Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine,cost ;  in vitro model ;  osteoarthritis ;  research progress ;  review ;  three-dimensional ;  tissue explant ;  treatment ;  two-dimensional
A differential game analysis on green technology innovation in a supply chain with information sharing of dynamic demand,"Purpose: The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of the information sharing of the dynamic demand on green technology innovation and profits in supply chain from a long-term perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The authors consider a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. The retailer has access to the information of dynamic demand of the green product, whereas the manufacturer invests in green technology innovation. Differential game theory is adopted to establish three models under three different scenarios, namely (1) decentralized decision without information sharing of dynamic demand (Model N-D), (2) decentralized decision with information sharing of dynamic demand (Model S-D) and (3) centralized decision with information sharing of dynamic demand (Model S-C). Findings: The optimal equilibrium results show that information sharing of dynamic demand can improve the green technology innovation level and increase the green technology stocks only in centralized supply chain. In the long term, the information sharing of dynamic demand can make the retailer more profitable. If the influence of green technology innovation on green technology stocks is great enough or the cost coefficient of green technology innovation is small enough, the manufacturer and decentralized supply chain can benefit from information sharing. In centralized supply chain, the value of demand information sharing is greater than that of decentralized supply chain. Originality/value: The authors used game theory to investigate demand information sharing and the green technology innovation in a supply chain. Specially, the demand information is dynamic, which is a variable that changes over time. Moreover, our research is based on a long-term perspective. Thus, differential game is adopted in this paper.","Wei, Junyi;Wang, Chuanxu",Journal,Kybernetes,2023-01-17,Shanghai Maritime University,Differential game ;  Dynamic demand ;  Green product ;  Green technology innovation ;  Information sharing
Numerical simulation and experimental study on an innovative vortex eliminator using a modified SST turbulence model for gas-liquid two-phase flow,"Vortices in the turbine and pump threatens the safe operation of the unit. The purpose of this paper is to design an antivortex guide cone (AVGC) based on the dynamic characteristics of the vortices. A new approach with modified SAS-SST turbulence model was adopted to simulate the vortex, which is verified by model experiments. The velocity gradient is the key factor of vortex generation, so the antivortex device with vortex elimination blades adopt streamline structure to reduce the velocity gradient in vortex area. Three schemes with N0 (N0 is the number of vortex elimination blades) of 4, 6 and 8 are designed respectively. The study results indicate that the vortex elimination effect of AVGC varies greatly with different N0, resulting in great differences in the performance of the unit. Some local small-scale vortices still exist near AVGC in Scheme 1 (N0 = 4). In Scheme 2 (N0 = 6) is 6, vortices can be eliminated thoroughly with the least hydraulic loss and the unit efficiency improved by 1.8%. In Scheme 3 (N0 = 8), some new channel vortex will be generated in the blade channel, resulting in more hydraulic loss. Only the hydraulic loss produced by AVGC less than that produced by vortex that indicate the scheme is feasible. The research work can provide important academic value and engineering insights to eliminate vortex.","Song, Xijie;Luo, Yongyao;Chao, Liu;Wang, Zhengwei;Jin, Yan",Journal,Ocean Engineering,2023-01-15,State Key Laboratory of Hydro Science and Engineering;Yangzhou University,Antivortex guide cone ;  Gas-liquid two-phase flow ;  Modified SST turbulence model ;  Turbine and pump ;  Vortex elimination effect
How does innovation consortium promote low-carbon agricultural technology innovation: An evolutionary game analysis,"Low-carbon agriculture is a crucial component of sustainable development; technological innovation is the cornerstone of the agricultural transformation towards low-carbon production. This study developed a tripartite evolutionary game model for agricultural enterprise, university, and the government. It examined the low-carbon technology innovation of the agricultural innovation from an innovation consortium's perspective, considering the dilemma that China's low-carbon agriculture development faces owing to the lack of a single subject's innovation capability. The simulation's outcomes indicated: (1) The increase in collaborative innovation revenue, default costs (three–six times), and additional social benefits of collaborative innovation effectively promoted the evolutionary game results to (1,1,1), which means agricultural enterprises and universities choose collaborative innovation, and the government chooses to provide subsidies; (2) Enhancing innovation subsidies influenced game outcomes to a certain degree, but the effect was limited. The findings provide theoretical basis for government to enact policies to promote scientific and technological progress and to develop low-carbon agriculture.","Luo, Jianli;Hu, Mingjun;Huang, Minmin;Bai, Yanhu",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-01-15,Wenzhou University,Agriculture ;  Evolutionary game ;  Innovation consortium ;  Low-carbon ;  Technological innovation
From isolated actions to systemic transformations: Exploring innovative initiatives on engineering education for sustainable development in Brazil,"The engineering profession has been highlighted in the context of a growing need for professionals capable of addressing the pressing challenges of sustainability. The purpose of this study is to present innovative experiences in engineering education for sustainable development in Brazil. This research was conducted in three stages: first, innovative initiatives were mapped through document research, literature review, grey literature, and the press; second, 37 academics who created and/or participated in these initiatives were interviewed, including professors, program coordinators, department heads, engineering school directors, and university chancellors; and third, the initiatives were analyzed and discussed with a team of specialists. The initiatives can be categorized into two types: innovative actions, projects, and structures (i.e., isolated actions, institutional projects, and institutional structure) and engineering programs with innovative characteristics (i.e., innovative curricula and pedagogical approaches, and new organizational paradigms to support engineering schools). Key characteristics, conceptual foundations, examples, and contributions to the sustainable development goals are discussed for each type of initiative. Emerging topics related to engineering education for sustainable development were identified and related to real cases. A shift towards a sustainability paradigm in engineering education is dependent on university top management commitment and can be accelerated by integrating initiatives at multiple levels of the university system.","Sigahi, Tiago F.A.C.;Sznelwar, Laerte Idal",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-01-15,Universidade Estadual de Campinas;Universidade de São Paulo,Education for sustainable development ;  Engineering education ;  Innovation ;  SDG ;  Sustainability
The impact of education on the Energy Trilemma Index: A sustainable innovativeness perspective for resilient energy systems,"This study investigates the association between the Energy Trilemma Index (ETI) (which measures secure, affordable, and sustainable energy) and a country's level of education from a sustainable innovativeness perspective. We analyze if school life expectancy (SLE) and the students' predispositions towards STEM degrees (science, technology, engineering or mathematics) can stimulate the creation of sustainable and resilient energy systems. We perform a regression analysis based on data from 118 countries, and we employ both an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and a robust-to-outliers MM-estimator. The statistical investigation reveals that the higher the school life expectancy, the higher the ETI. By contrast, we find no significant association between the ETI and the percentage of STEM graduates. So what matters in energy sustainability is the number of persons who decide to continue tertiary studies rather than their attitudes towards studying scientific subjects. This research paper contributes to the literature on renewable energy, circular economy (CE), sustainable innovation, and knowledge management by demonstrating how education can aid in implementing energy systems that adhere to the triple bottom-line approach (society, economy, and environment). Thus, sustainable and resilient energy systems can be spurred by not only environmental and economic variables but also social ones. Therefore, the traditional approach of the CE for achieving sustainable development should be substituted by alternative CE approaches that consider social variables. From the managerial standpoint, a high SLE can foster resilient energy systems through the creation of ad hoc policies, the birth of new companies connected to the renewable energy sector, and new organizational forms of energy management handled directly by citizens.","Gibellato, Simone;Ballestra, Luca Vincenzo;Fiano, Fabio;Graziano, Domenico;Luca Gregori, Gian",Journal,Applied Energy,2023-01-15,Link Campus University;Università Politecnica delle Marche;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli;Università degli Studi di Torino,Education ;  Energy management ;  Energy sustainability ;  Energy Trilemma Index ;  Sustainable innovativeness

Lessons from COVID-19 for improving diagnostic access in future pandemics,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed the critical and expanding roles of testing. Despite the development of over a thousand brand of tests - with some close to fulfilling the 4As (accuracy, access, affordability, and actionability via quick time to result) of an ideal diagnostic test - gaps persisted in developing tests to fit public health needs, and in providing equitable access. Here, we review how the use cases for testing evolved over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with associated engineering challenges (and potential lessons) at each phase for test developers. We summarise lessons learnt from the recent epidemic and propose four areas for future cooperative effort among test developers, government regulators and policy makers, public health experts, and the public: 1) develop new models for public sector funding and research and development; 2) increase testing capacity by investing in adaptable open-platform technologies at every level of the healthcare system; 3) build data connectivity infrastructures to support a connected diagnostic system as a backbone for surveillance; and 4) facilitate the rapid translation of innovation into use through a coordinated framework for regulatory approval and policy development.","Peeling, Rosanna W.;Sia, Samuel K.",Journal,Lab on a Chip,2023-01-11,London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine;The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science,
"The Implementation of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) Based Design Thinkingln The Ethical Dilemma Story Project to Improve Student's Creative Thinking and Learning Outcomes","Creative thinking skills play an essential role in improving student learning outcomes. The creative thinking skills of class X students are still lacking, which is only limited to imitating or duplicating what has been exemplified. and there is no innovation in it. The solution to this problem is to apply the STEAM-based Design Thinking learning model to the Ethical Dilemma Story (EDS) project. This study aims to explain the implementation of the STEAM-based Design Thinking learning model in improving the creative thinking skills of class X high school students. The type of research used is Classroom Action Research using a mixed-method concurrent embedded design. The subjects of this study were students of class X MIA 3 SMA 6 Malang. The learning activities are carried out in two cycles, the topic of the virus and the topic of the ecosystem with the stages of 1) Empathize, 2) Define, 3) Ideate, 4) Prototype, and 5) Test. Students create a dilemma story related to the problems raised through articles and videos in the define stage. The ethical dilemma story that has been made will be integrated with a prototype that will be made as a form of a solution to the dilemma stories made by students. Concerning STEAM, in the Virus material, students create projects that help students prevent viruses from entering or maintain student health during a pandemic. In contrast, in the Ecosystem topic, students make projects related to maintaining ecosystems in the human body. The results showed that learning Biology with the STEAM-based Design Thinking learning model improved students' creative thinking skills and learning outcomes. Design Thinking builds students' ways of thinking based on new creations because in the process, it will focus on perceptual and practical activities. This study recommends applying the DT learning model by helping students explore planning learning activities, carrying out collaborative projects, and ultimately producing a product to improve their learning outcomes and creative thinking skills.","Pramashela, Adelia Dwinta;Suwono, Hadi",Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2023-01-10,Universitas Negeri Malang,
Backcasting frugally innovative smart sustainable future cities,"This paper envisions alternative scenarios for future cities that are resilient environmentally, socially, economically, and embedded in smart infrastructure and governance. It reinforces the position that although complementary, the backcasting approach is more appropriate for future city planning. There is limited research that envisions how future cities can be backcasted with frugal innovation (FI) underpinning the sustainability pillars. This research aims to narrow the gap. The methodology is based on a systematic literature review and secondary exploratory case studies. The results of the TOWS (threats, opportunities, weaknesses, strengths) analysis on the suitability of FI on smart sustainable cities (SSC) developmental policies show that FI is an affordable and inclusive way to sustainably develop cities without injury to the environment. The findings reveal that the five pillars of a smart sustainable future city can integrate frugal innovation and lean engineering concepts to ensure sustainable development at lower costs. Through frugal innovation embedded in city infrastructure, cleaner methods of production can be realized, and inclusiveness can be fostered.","Ebolor, Alexander",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2023-01-10,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Backcasting ;  ESG ;  Frugal innovation ;  SDGs ;  Smart sustainable cities
Active learning to develop disciplinary competencies related to automatic control in engineering curricula using low cost do-it-yourself didactic stations,"Introduction: In general, in automatic control courses, the process of designing and testing a control system includes applying physical laws to model the system, working with virtual models, building one or various prototypes, and testing the control algorithms. However, in the industry, the approach must be more pragmatic because the design and implementation time must be shorter, and the success of the solution must be ensured. Methods: Challenged with this problem, a black-box model from which data are generated turns into a convenient starting point to design and implement the automation, and this approach is addressed in this research. The herein proposal is the design and implementation of didactic stations and their application in undergraduate automatic control courses. In the context of active learning, by using the stations to identify the model’s dynamics, and subsequently, design and implement an automatic system, students reinforce the theory and receive another stimulus for the development of competencies in automatic control. Results: The didactic stations emulate those cases in the industry where the hardware is already working, and it is necessary to automate or improve some process following a practical approach. During the first phase, students, guided by professors, designed and implemented four electromechanical prototypes. The second phase was using the prototypes in the curricular courses Control Engineering and Computerized Control to implement and evaluate controllers. The research included a control group and an experimental group. The group using the stations had a higher final course average grade than the control group. Discussion: The findings encourage the application of this type of approach to complement the teaching of automatic control, which could positively impact the professional performance of future control engineers.","Navarro-Durán, David;Félix-Herrán, Luis C.;Membrillo-Hernández, Jorge;Craig, Kevin C.;Ramírez-Cadena, Miguel J.;Ramírez-Mendoza, Ricardo A.",Journal,Frontiers in Education,2023-01-09,Hofstra University;Tecnológico de Monterrey,active learning ;  automatic control systems ;  competencies ;  educational innovation ;  problem based learning
6G and Onward to Next G: The road to the multiverse,"This book weaves emerging themes in future 6G and Next G networks carefully together. It points to three spheres of contexts with different narratives for the year 2030 and beyond, in which the coming Metaverse as the precursor of the future Multiverse can be embedded naturally. The book aims at providing the reader with new cross-disciplinary research material, ranging from communication and computer science to cognitive science, social sciences, and behavioral economics, for building a deeper Metaverse. It will be instrumental in helping the reader find and overcome some of the most common 6G and Next G blind spots. Modern networks are more than communication and computer science. They may be better viewed as techno-social systems that exhibit complex adaptive system behavior and resemble biological superorganisms. 6G and especially Next G should go beyond continuing the linear incremental 6G=5G+1G mindset of past generations of mobile networks.

Performance prediction of a distributed Joule-Thomson effect cooler with pillars,"Hampson type Joule-Thomson (J-T) throttle coolers are widely used for cooling infrared detectors and many electronic components. The conventional J-T throttle coolers are not compact, with low heat transfer efficiency and small cooling capacity. In this paper, a stacked column cluster type microchannel distributed J-T throttle cooler is designed through combining a compact microchannel etched and shaped by photolithography and an atomic diffusion fusion welding process with a J-T throttle cooler. The dimensions of the cooler are 10 mm for the inlet section, 145 mm for the throttling and heat exchange section, 10 mm for the expansion chamber, with 6 layers staggered high pressure channels and 6 low pressure channels. The cooling performance of the cooler under various low-temperature and high-pressure operating conditions were studied through simulations, and the results showed that the cold-end temperatures were 158.0, 147.9, 146.1, 144.1, and 141.1 K for an inlet pressure of 5.20 MPa and inlet temperatures of 280.0, 270.0, 260.0, 250.0, and 240.0 K, respectively, with argon as the work gas. The cold-end temperatures were 163.6, 159.4, 156.8, 154.6, and 152.7 K for an inlet pressure of 5.60, 6.00, 6.40, 6.80, and 7.20 MPa respectively in 288.0 K inlet temperature. In the process of working medium flow and heat transfer in the microcolumn group channel of the cooler, the temperature and pressure change significantly. When the working medium in the flow reaches the phase change state, that is, the phase change temperature and pressure reach, due to the gas liquefies and the flow rate drops, the working medium loses the gas throttling refrigeration effect, and the temperature no longer decreases significantly, and the refrigeration temperature is limited by this. In addition, compared with different inlet pressures, when the inlet temperature is 280.0 K, the 5.20 MPa nitrogen throttling refrigeration temperature is close to the argon gas at 2.98 MPa, which are 223.4 K and 234.9 K, respectively. Therefore, high pressure nitrogen can be considered to replace low pressure argon in engineering applications. In view of the problems involved in the research process of traditional micro-channel throttling coolers, the innovative solutions are put forward in this paper, which can bring new innovations and thoughts for the future research and application of such problems.","Wang, Jia;Cui, Xiaoyu;Geng, Hui;She, Hailong;Chang, Zhihao",Journal,Applied Thermal Engineering,2023-01-05,University of Shanghai for Science and Technology,Argon ;  PCHE ;  Simulation ;  Throttling cooler
IMPACT OF INNOVATION ORGANIZATION NETWORK ON THE SYNERGY OF CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: EVIDENCE FROM MEGAPROJECT PRACTICES IN CHINA,"The construction industry has made an indispensable contribution to China’s environmental and economic de-velopment. With the advent of the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) era, cross-organizational collaboration has enabled megaproject participants to engage significantly in problem-solving and technological innovation. The impact of innovation organization network on the synergy of cross-organizational technological innovation (COTI synergy) in megaprojects is imperative for theoretical researchers and engineering practitioners. Therefore, this study aims to develop a hypothetical model of innovation organization network and COTI synergy, focusing on the mediating role of interorganizational relationships and the moderating effect of the technological innovation environment. The results of 211 questionnaires from the Chinese construction industry show that innovation organization network improves COTI syn-ergy. Trust and communication play a vital mediating role between innovation organization network and COTI synergy. Moreover, innovative culture has a significant positive moderating effect on innovation organization network and interor-ganizational relationships. From the perspective of organization network, this study provides new insights into the development of technological innovation management research on megaprojects, theoretical references, and practical suggestions for project teams in developing countries to improve collaborative technological innovation efficiency.","Zhao, Na;Fan, Dongjiao;Chen, Yun;Wu, Chunlin",Journal,Journal of Civil Engineering and Management,2023-01-03,Beihang University;Changsha University of Science and Technology,collaboration innovation ;  cross-organizational technological innovation ;  innovation organization network ;  inter-organizational relation-ships ;  megaprojects ;  technological innovation environment
Family formation and the career trajectories of women engineering PhDs,"Purpose: The underrepresentation of women in engineering has important consequences for meeting the need for a larger, talented scientific and technological labor force. Increasing the proportion of women faculty in engineering will help increase the persistence probabilities of women undergraduate and graduate students in engineering, as well as contribute to the range and diversity of ideas toward innovations and solutions to the greatest engineering challenges. This study aims to examine the association among gender, family formation and post-PhD employment patterns of a cohort of engineering doctorates. Design/methodology/approach: Using the National Science Foundation’s Survey of Doctorate Recipients data, 2001–2010, descriptive and multinomial logit regression analyses are conducted to illustrate the career trajectories of engineering PhDs over a ten-year period. Findings: The career trajectories of engineering PhDs are nonlinear, and transitions between employment sectors commonly occur over the ten-year time period studied. Although women engineering PhDs with young dependents are less likely to be employed initially after PhD completion, they tend to enter the workforce in the academic sector as time progresses. Early post-PhD employment as a postdoctoral researcher or in the academic sector contributes to the pursuit of the professoriate downstream. Originality/value: While previous studies tend to focus on the early career outcomes of science and engineering students, this study contributes to the literature by focusing on the long-term career outcomes of engineering doctorates. Research findings provide engineering PhD students and PhDs with more information regarding potential post-PhD career trajectories, highlighting the multitude of career options and transitions that occur over time. Research findings also provide higher education administrators and doctoral program stakeholders with foundational information toward designing and revitalizing professional development programs to help PhD students prepare for the workforce. The findings have the potential to be applied toward helping increase diversity by shaping policies and programs to encourage multiple alternative career pathways to the professoriate.","Main, Joyce B.",Journal,Studies in Graduate and Postdoctoral Education,2023-01-02,Purdue University,Careers ;  Engineering ;  Faculty ;  Family formation ;  PhDs ;  Women
Successful innovation strategies to overcome the technical challenges in the development of wave energy technologies,"The process of designing wave energy technologies is complex and time-consuming, involving many decisions. Despite numerous wave energy concepts being developed in the last 30 years, none have reached commercial readiness due to unresolved technical challenges and high costs in comparison to other renewable energy sources. To address the wave energy industry's high aspirations, this research proposes a systematic problem-solving approach based on sound Systems Engineering methods from the outset of technology development. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is used for problem formulation and selection, ensuring the traceability of requirements. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is used for concept generation, providing efficiency and predictability by exploring a vast solution space. This approach has identified the top-five Inventive Principles to overcome the most critical technical challenges for wave energy technologies in the utility-scale market. Promising concepts are also suggested for each Inventive Principle. While the current research does not focus on a specific concept, this approach provides a structured way to assess the potential of innovative archetypes holistically.","Ruiz-Minguela, Pablo;Blanco, Jesus M.;Nava, Vincenzo",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference,2023-01-01,Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA);Universidad del Pais Vasco,Inventive Principles ;  QFD ;  Systems Engineering ;  Technical Contradictions ;  TRIZ ;  Wave Energy
Genome Editing for Biotic Stress Resistance in Medicinal Plants,"Plants are continually subjected to a range of physical and biological stressors throughout their growth period. Insects and pests, like other biotic stressors, have created significant concerns about lower productivity, which jeopardizes agricultural production. Genome engineering, also known as genome editing, has emerged as a cutting-edge breeding technique capable of altering the genomes of plants, animals, microbes, and humans. Since ancient times, humans have used medicinal plants for food, medicine, and industrial purposes. Both traditional biotechnology and more recent next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have been used successfully to improve natural chemicals derived from plants with medical potential. To modify the genome at the transcriptional level, protein-based editing approaches like zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like end nucleases (TALENs) were previously frequently employed. CRISPR/associated9 (Cas9) endonucleases are a powerful, resilient, and precise site-directed mutagenesis method in transcriptome gene editing. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing employs specially created guide RNAs to detect a three-base pair protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence situated downstream of the target DNA. The current review compiles current research published between 2010 and 2020 on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technologies in traditional medicines, describing significant innovations, difficulties, and prospects, as well as noting the technique’s broader application in crop and lesser species. The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method has been utilised successfully in plants to boost agricultural productivity and stress tolerance. Despite this, only a small number of medicinal plants have been altered using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique because to a lack of appropriate transformation and regeneration techniques, and also a lack of comprehensive genome and mRNA sequencing data. However, a variety of secondary metabolic activities in plants (e.g. alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and saponin) altered lately using CRISPR/Cas-editing through knocking out, knocking in, and point mutations, modulation of gene expression, including targeted mutagenesis.","Insaf, Muhammad;Saddique, Muhammad Abu Bakar;Sher, Muhammad Ali;Khan, Mahmood Alam;Usman, Muhammad;Karimi, Saira;Binyamin, Rana;Khan, Zulqurnain",Book,"Medicinal Plants: Microbial Interactions, Molecular Techniques and Therapeutic Trends",2023-01-01,"MNS-University of Agriculture, Multan;COMSATS University Islamabad;Muhammad Nawaz Shareef University of Agriculture",Biotic stress ;  CRISPR/Cas9 ;  Diseases ;  Insect/Pest ;  Stress resistance

"RETRACTED CHAPTER: Computational and Informatics Methodologies in Drug Discovery, with Focuson Natural Products","In the field of biomedical research, innovations for developing novel therapeutic drugs are one of the distinguished assignments that are indispensable for scientific, economic, and social progress. The precision of drug discovery and development approaches can be enhanced by efficient computational methodologies. Developments in the computational biology and informatics algorithms have greatly augmented the efficiency of the drug discovery strategies at various levels. However, drug discovery rate, in general, has reduced immensely because of its dependence on the small molecules as the preliminary source of new and innovative hypothesis. Natural products like metabolites and immunological factors are a massive resource of bioactive molecules from varied origins. Some of them are supported by traditional medicines for thousands of years and are immensely uncoupled from the range of small molecules usually utilized for drug discovery. Nevertheless, natural products retain unique features that differentiate them from conventional and outdated small-molecule drug leads, demanding novel techniques and access for evaluating their therapeutic capability. In this chapter, we scrutinize a list of advanced techniques in computational biology, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, and informational engineering for data directed drug discovery from biological resources. Herein, we emphasize on the procedures that intend to saturate the void among the conventional outdated small-molecule drug leads and the various types of organic compound discovery methodologies. In order to completely clout the limitations of standard drug informatics practices, we explored the existing gaps and barriers that need to be overcome. At last, we concluded the chapter through a “road map” of the research significances, which pursues to apprehend this objective.","Kumari, Anchala;Rajput, Vikrant Singh",Book,Drugs and a Methodological Compendium: From bench to bedside,2023-01-01,Central University of Rajasthan;Indian Council of Medical Research,
Integrated Façades as a Product-Service System,"The Circular Economy (CE) attempts to realign business incentives, across all fields of human industry, to support the preservation of raw materials within closed economic loops. Within this conceptual frame, Product-Service Systems (PSS) combine the use of tangible products such as building technologies, with intangible maintenance and monitoring services, to enhance the delivery of valuable performance while limiting the use of materials and other finite resources. This paper explores the potential for the application of CE and PSS organisation principles in the delivery of Façades-as-a-Service. It explores how the benefits brought about by this way of thinking - lower initial capital requirements, material ownership retention by suppliers, and long-term interdisciplinary collaboration - could lead to a more efficient façade construction industry, while accelerating the rate and depth of building energy renovations. Within the current process for designing, manufacturing, and operating façades there is a gap between supply-side discoveries and demand-side needs, which hinders the implementation of resource-efficient façades. Façade-leasing as a form of product-service system keeps suppliers committed, throughout the building’s service-life, to safeguard optimum performance in operation, while actively stimulating clients to adopt innovative technical solutions. The paper elaborates on both supply-side façade innovations and the demand-side conditions necessary to implement such business models, and also explores the costs and benefits of product-service systems as new collaboration models to align supply and demand incentives. It builds upon the research project “Façade leasing” (Azcárate-Aguerre, 2014) and combines knowledge about façade design and engineering (supply-side approach) with the knowledge about client needs, performance criteria, and willingness to pay (demand-side approach). The research methodology includes a literature review and expert interviews, integrating both theory and practice. This paper argues that a Product-Service System approach to façade design, construction, operation, and renovation could accelerate the rate and depth of building energy renovations. It could also provide incentives to supply- and demand-side stakeholders, to implement Circular Economy principles through new models of product ownership, service contracting, and performance delivery. It aims at establishing the general conceptual frame of a Product-Service System for leasable façades, setting the basic parameters to be considered when designing a PSS-based business model, and formulating its value proposition.",,Book Series,A+BE Architecture and the Built Environment,2023-01-01,,

Effective leadership is required to transform the sector to address these challenges and meet the future needs of society. However, there remains a lack of empirical evidence relating to leadership requirements, assessment, and development, in the context of the Irish AEC sector. As part of an ongoing study with the aim of developing resources to support leadership development, this research, conducted through a review of literature, examines how leadership is being assessed and explored in the AEC sector. The findings highlight the importance of leadership in addressing critical issues facing the sector including innovation, modernisation, sustainability, and safety. Furthermore, the findings underscore methodological challenges faced in exploring leadership in practice from a solely positivist quantitative approach.

INCENTIVISING SUPPLIER INNOVATION IN MEGA INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS: EXPLORING THE RESULT OF INNOVATION BONUSES,"Prior research emphasizes that public clients need to use their client role and their procurement strategies to facilitate supplier innovation to accelerate sustainable development of the built environment. The purpose of this paper is to increase the understanding of Swedish Traffic Administration (STA), as the largest public client of infrastructure in Sweden, implementation of procurement strategies may influence supplier innovation. This paper explores an initiative by the STA to promote supplier innovation through offering innovation bonuses to four engineering consultancy firms, contracted for the early planning and design stage of the East Link mega project. The study is based on secondary data from STA's documentation of 51 innovation proposals submitted by the four firms. The result indicates that while innovation bonuses generate proposals of supplier innovation, public clients carefully need to consider how to formulate appropriate incentives and reward systems for specific windows of opportunity.","Wennstroem, Anders;Havenvid, Malena I.;Eriksson, Per Erik;Larsson, Johan",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 39th Annual ARCOM Conference: Constructing for the Future, ARCOM 2023",2023-01-01,Trafikverket;Luleå University of Technology;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),incentivisation ;  innovation ;  procurement ;  public client

Talk to your data: Enhancing Business Intelligence and Inventory Management with LLM-Driven Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL for Database Querying,"This paper delves into the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in revolutionizing business intelligence and inventory management through semantic parsing and text-to-SQL methodologies. It assesses various LLM models, such as DIN-SQL, DSP, NSQL, GPT, CoPilot, and LLaMa, elucidating their capabilities and contributions. Two critical analyses are presented here. The first compares cutting-edge LLM models using cosine similarity and cost efficiency metrics. The second analysis enhances GPT's precision through prompt engineerings, like few-shot techniques, and explores frameworks like DIN-SQL, NSQL, and DSP. DIN-SQL substantially boosts accuracy, and NSQL demonstrates potential in specific scenarios. This research underscores the transformative potential of LLM-driven models in business intelligence and inventory management. DIN-SQL, in particular, emerges as a game-changer with the potential to reshape inventory management practices. GPT showcases its versatility through fine-tuning for tasks beyond conventional programming, while CoPilot offers a cost-effective alternative. This study emphasizes the importance of cost-effectiveness in real-world applications, with LLaMa and CoPilot being practical choices. NSQL, with its budget-friendly and semi-accurate solution, holds promise for semantic parsing in growing companies.

Establishing Business Incubation Centers for Social Impacts and Smart Education Fostering Entrepreneurial Mindset,"While many business incubation centers (BIC) exist in universities worldwide, establishing one in developing countries is always challenging. In doing so, what is often overlooked is that while business incubation centers are established very formally, they usually do not meet the desired key performance indicators. Failure to meet fundamental key performance indicators eliminates incubation's true spirit that focuses on smart education, entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, and uplift of intellectual capital. This paper shares the methodical practices and terms of reference (TORs) that explain how business incubation centers should be established in universities in developing countries. The paper presents establishment and operational methods that were formulated for two live cases. These methods were formulated after consultation with a large set of stakeholders, such as the university's leadership, academicians from a wide range of faculties/departments, and administrative departments concerning quality, technology, strategy, research, commercialization, and product innovation. The terms of reference presented in this paper are found to ensure the business incubation center’s conformance to performance criteria for better social impacts, smart education, innovation, and entrepreneurial mindset.","Ahsan, Ali;Affandi, Hina;Siddique, Sara;Saha, Ratna",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Technology Management, Operations and Decisions, ICTMOD 2023",2023-01-01,"Torrens University Australia;Foundation University, Islamabad",business incubation center ;  developing countries ;  university
Artificial Intelligence for Competency Assessment in Design Education: A Review of Literature,"One of the biggest challenges for instructors involved in design education (DE) is fair and thorough assessment of student design competencies. Over the past few years, new technological innovations have emerged to support teaching and learning in DE, especially the complex process of assessment. One of these technological innovations is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a promising research topic at the edge of technology, innovation, and education that is gaining great attention in contemporary design society. It is often defined as the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. AI-based assessment of competencies in DE has the potential to make the assessment more efficient and effective. Although AI itself is not recent, it is a relatively new and innovative way to assess students’ design competencies. We conducted a review of the literature to identify and analyze research in the assessment of competencies in DE. In this paper, we (1) review the issues faced by students and instructors in the assessment of DE, (2) review AI-based assessment of competencies in engineering design, and (3) propose recommendations for AI-based assessment of competencies for design education.","Khan, Sumbul;Blessing, Lucienne;Ndiaye, Yakhoub",Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2023-01-01,Singapore University of Technology and Design,
Navigation Sensor Technology Assessment Capability for Data-Driven Systems Analysis,"The capability to assess the mission performance of novel navigation technologies from a systems-level approach and to provide quantitative results is crucial. With growing interest and innovations from NASA’s commercial partners, data-driven results that quantify the technological impact will guide research developments and facilitate stakeholder decision-making while requiring less time and resources. This paper presents a method to evaluate various sensor combinations and their impact on the overall system performance using an existing six degrees-of-freedom, physics-based engineering simulation for a government reference lunar lander as a testbed. Selected navigation technologies over various technology readiness levels, including Inertial Measurement Units, Navigation Doppler Lidar, and radar altimeter-radar velocimeter, were studied in this paper. Results using this testbed to perform sensitivity studies and to provide quantitative assessments are reported. One key finding is that there are diminishing returns for reducing sensor errors. The most influential sensor parameter to landing success are vehicle configuration and mission dependent. Results from this method could be used by stakeholders to make data-driven systems-based decisions and by technology developers as guidance for the specific parameter improvements that will have the most significant impact on mission success. This capability could be further used to assess alternative scenarios should one type of technology become unavailable or to re-assess initial assumptions and identify appropriate requirements from a system perspective.","Lee, Esther;Tartabini, Paul V.;Starr, Brett R.;Friz, Paul D.;Karlgaard, Christopher D.;Samareh, Jamshid",Conference Proceeding,"Accelerating Space Commerce, Exploration, and New Discovery Conference, ASCEND 2023",2023-01-01,NASA Langley Research Center,
Application Table: A Bridge Connecting the Designing “With-The-Material” and “The-Material” Paradigms,"Over the last few decades, advances in high-performance computing, new material characterization methods, and, more recently, an emphasis on integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) have been a catalyst for multiscale modeling and simulationbased design of materials and structures in the aerospace industry. In 2016 NASA sponsored a 2040 Vision study (which appeared in 2018) to define the potential 25-year future state required for integrated multiscale modeling of materials and systems (e.g., load-bearing structures) to accelerate the pace and reduce the expense of innovation in future aerospace and aeronautical systems. The study envisions a cyber-physical-social ecosystem comprised of experimentally verified and validated (V & V) computational models, tools, and techniques, along with the associated digital tapestry, that impacts the entire supply chain to enable costeffective, rapid, and revolutionary design of “fit-for-purpose” materials, components, and systems. Consequently, the development of a robust information management system that incorporates (across the full life cycle) both experimental (real data) and virtual data resulting from the application of various simulation tools (at single or multiple length scales), therefore enabling the virtual design and optimization of materials throughout their processing – internal structure – property – performance envelope, has become critical. This need is also fueled by the demands for higher efficiency in material testing; consistency, quality, and traceability of data; product design; engineering analysis; as well as control of access to proprietary or sensitive information. This is particularly true when attempting to merge ICME practices with recent additive manufacturing technology which will enable production of the resulting 2040 Vision material and structural designs. At NASA Glenn Research Center we are exploring the future of material science through the use of novel characterization methodologies, high performance computing, and recently an emphasis on integrated computational materials engineering (ICME). Herein, recent efforts to incorporate an Application Table within NASA Glenn Research Center’s ICME Granta MI database is presented. The goal is to provide a place where material and structural application information/requirements can be linked so as to marry the “design the-material” and the “design-with-material” paradigms and thereby enable application-driven design and optimization of materials and structures by providing a central location that links material processing at various length scales to the application’s performance requirements. This paper discusses the specifics of this Application Table as well as best practices and key principles for the development of a robust materials information management system to enable the 2040 Vision integrated materials and structures ecosystem. Furthermore, it presents the intended role of the Application Table in the future of ICME design of “fit-for-purpose” materials,showing the need for a well-established framework that can successfully bridge the gap between the design “the material” and design “with-the-material” paradigms.","Arnold, Steven M.;Hearley, Brandon L.;Cebon, Dave",Conference Proceeding,"AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition, 2023",2023-01-01,"NASA Glenn Research Center;ANSYS, Inc.",

Reference process modelling in demand-driven agri-food supply chains: a configuration-based framework,"Purpose: Agri-food companies increasingly participate in demand-driven supply chains that are able to adapt flexibly to changes in the marketplace. The objective of this chapter is to design a configuration-based framework for reference process modelling, which enhances the interoperability and agility of information systems as required in such dynamic supply chains. Methodology/approach: The research has designed a generic framework based on literature review and on an investigation of existing reference models. Next, the framework is tested in several agri-food sectors using a multiple case study approach. The case study results are abstracted to reusable models and incorporated in the framework. Findings: The main results are: a definition of basic design requirements for reference process models in demand-driven agri-food supply chains, an analysis of the extent to what existing reference models meet these requirements, a modeling framework for designing reference process models, and applications of the framework in agri-food industry. (Practical/managerial) implications: The designed framework supplies agri-food managers with a toolkit to model a broad variety of process configurations as apparent in agri-food supply chains. The framework comprises a consistent set of supply chain models, which intermediates between supply chain design and information systems engineering. As such it enhances shared understanding and reuse of both cross-industry and sector-specific process knowledge. However, successful adoption and industry-wide application of the designed framework requires an open innovation approach in further development and maintenance. Policy makers could play an important role in lowering the barriers for such an approach, since the additional benefits are not always obvious for individual companies, especially in the short term.","Verdouw, C.

Adaptability and Fidelity: Exploring the Relationship Between the Two When Implementing SC2.0,"Stepped Care 2.0 (SC2.0) is an evolving, flexible, continuously improving model for mental health care grounded in co-design. Because SC2.0 is meant to be adapted by communities and organizations to serve local needs and populations, the question of what it means to implement SC2.0 with fidelity is a challenging one. Fidelity has consistently been shown to be associated with effectiveness and successful outcomes, and it is therefore important to develop frameworks to determine the degree to which an intervention has been implemented with fidelity. A pillar of good implementation practice is the development and description of “core components,” which is one of the key requirements of a usable innovation (National Implementation Research Network). Core components are the features necessary for an innovation to function as intended and to achieve the desired outcomes (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2019). In this chapter, we describe the process of developing core components for SC2.0 and explain how these core components can be used to provide guidance to organizations and communities seeking to implement SC2.0 with fidelity. We conclude that SC2.0 is a model that requires adaptation to achieve fidelity to its core components and guiding principles, which means that adaptations that align with the core components and guiding principles are not a challenge to fidelity, but proof of it.","Jaouich, Alexia;Carey, Stacie;Saxton, Kaitlin;Rash, Joshua;Brown, Jacquie",Book,Stepped Care 2.0: The Power of Conundrums,2023-01-01,Memorial University of Newfoundland,

Challenged-Based Learning: Virtual PFC Projects Defended on 2020,"The universal problem called All But Thesis Syndrome has been in effect for decades. In Computer Science careers, a frequent problem is to increase the number of graduates, given the high demand of the software industry. The article presents CBL methodology as a strategy that contributes to the achievement of academic and personal objectives. Thus, this study aims at identifying and communicating the end-of career products, named as 'Proyecto Final de Carrera' projects, analyzed, designed, developed and possibly implemented in times of COVID-19 pandemic, with the approach used in Argentina. Method This study was exploratory through data collected to investigate the subject from a high specificity (sample). The sample consisted of students who defended their PFC projects in 2020. The experience is located in a public university in Argentina. Results: nineteen students -corresponding to sixteen projects, because some of them were designed by teams. - completed and defended their PFC. Five of them were women. Besides, the study revealed that these PFC projects -corresponding to Challenge-based learning- applied the general phases of the software cycle: analysis, design, and development. However, the explicit implementation in target scopes is smaller than the total. It is relevant to note that the number of students who concluded their PFC projects were similar to PFC projects concluded in 2019. These projects have been supported or defended on online modalities. Therefore, these practices have innovated from face-to-face to virtual activity. Thus, virtual modalities implemented them as an innovation allowed students to continue and end their degree studies. Finally, this research essentially contributes to generating empirical evidence in the Computer Science discipline associated with the All But Thesis Syndrome. In addition, this study is associated with the Challenge-based learning as strategies in order to be able to cope with this universal issue.","Marino, Sonia I.",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - JICV 2023: 13th International Conference on Virtual Campus,2023-01-01,Universidad Nacional del Nordeste,Challenge-based learning ;  Higher Education ;  University Degree (1st Level) or Dissertations ;  virtual evaluation
Innovation Potential as a New Element in University Theses,"Few theses drive technological development, and even fewer contribute to innovation. This is partly due to a gap in the structure of research reports. This study aims to propose the inclusion of 'Innovation Potential' (IP) as a new element to bridge this gap in thesis structures, aligning with the open innovation model. Qualitative research was conducted to develop a tool for evaluating the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of theses. This was complemented by a quantitative approach to identify the most frequent TRL and IP levels. The sample included specialized literature and 354 undergraduate and postgraduate theses from a local university. The results showed that the theses predominantly fall into TRL1 and TRL2, highlighting the need to integrate IP into thesis structures. It was concluded that the IP should be placed in either the Results or Recommendations sections.","Del Carpio Ramos, Hilda A.;Del Carpio Ramos, Pedro Antonio;Garcia-Penalvo, Francisco Jose;Del Carpio Hernandez, Sergio Rafael B.;Ninaquispe, Jose Carlos Montes;Del Carpio, Rosa Maria Chiclayo",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - JICV 2023: 13th International Conference on Virtual Campus,2023-01-01,Universidad Nacional de Cañete;Universidad Tecnológica del Perú;Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo;Universidad de Salamanca,innovation potential ;  research results ;  Science ;  technology and innovation ;  theses ;  TRL

Research on Image Scene Classification Using Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks Based on Fusion Attention Mechanism,"In the field of image scene classification, with the continuous innovation of DL (Deep Learning) technology, these technologies have achieved excellent results in traditional image classification tasks. This article is based on the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) method, which extracts features from the original image input and equally processes the features of each channel. This process wastes unnecessary calculations to obtain rich low-frequency features, lacks discriminative learning ability across feature channels, and ultimately hinders the representativeness of deep networks. Research has shown that in the test results of three methods on different datasets, it can be found that the classification accuracy of our method is 91.59%, while the accuracy of Full and Object are 72.76% and 81.46%, respectively. It can be seen that the classification accuracy of our method is the highest among the three methods, proving the effectiveness of our method. In addition, compared with other better methods, this method is also superior to other methods because it extracts useful information, which is more discriminative and can better classify image scenes. Determine the importance of features on the channel based on attention weight, in order to focus on more representative features and improve network classification performance.","Chen, Duanyun;Chen, Jun;Han, Jiayi;Su, Suyan;Lin, Shu",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2023 International Conference on Computer Simulation and Modeling, Information Security, CSMIS 2023",2023-01-01,Fuzhou University;State Grid Fujian Xiamen Electric Power Supply Company;State Grid Fujian Electric Power Company,Convolutional neural network ;  Image scene classification ;  Integrating attention mechanisms ;  Lightweight

Promoting Jizai with Robots that Are Currently Helpful—You Will Not Understand Unless You Jump In,"In order for us to know if a research field that we know nothing about will suit us and if it will be worthwhile for us to devote ourselves to, the only thing we can do is to jump in and experience it. With this mindset, I have been able to pursue research in trans-disciplinary studies that are not restricted to existing boundaries and conduct pioneering research that applied my own specialty of robotics to medicine leading to a fusion of the two. I have studied humanoid robots at first. What especially interested me was the haptic sense, and I started research of sensory in Biomedical Engineering area. My basic stance in applying robots to the medical field is that humans should do most of the work with support from machines kept to a minimum. Even in Jizai research, the basic principle that humans are the masters and robots are the subjects does not change. The Jizai research examples that we are working on are the “Third Arm” and “detachable body” as a development of the Third Arm. In our laboratory, we are also promoting turning technology into businesses. It is important for researchers to envision technology that will bring innovation to specific purposes. Two concepts that I am emphasizing recently are design thinking and vision-oriented thinking. One other thing that I work on as one who is affiliated with a university is the development of researchers. I believe it is important for us to have two or more axes in both research and in our daily lives. In research, in addition to your research theme as part of a project, you should have your own research theme. One of the keys to concurrently succeeding at multiple jobs is to cooperate with your colleagues.","Iwata, Hiroyasu",Book,Theory of JIZAI Body: Towards Mastery Over the Extended Self,2023-01-01,Waseda University;Japan Science and Technology Agency;Institute for Mechanical Engineering Frontiers;Ltd.;Ltd.;Research Fellow of Japan Society;School of Science and Engineering;The Japanese Society of Nutrition and Dietetics;Society of Biomechanisms of,

"The ABC’s of Science, Technology & Innovation (STI) Policy: Spelling Out Problems, Consequences and Viable Solutions","Innovation is a widely applied yet poorly understood term in the context of public policies and practices among Western nations. Technological innovations specifically have and will continue to advance civilization, shape modern society, and drive the economic health and geo-political standing of nations. This book offers a unique interpretation of science, technology & innovation (STI) policies in Western nations, particularly in regard to government-sponsored programs. The author challenges established thinking, directly addressing numerous myths that cloud our understanding of innovation and proposes a fresh perspective grounded in fundamental logic and analysis. Written in short chapters and presented in an alphabetically organized framework, this book addresses what is working and what isn’t working in current STI policies and suggests that the most efficient and effective way to generate technological innovations that yield the desired socio-economic benefits, is for national governments to sponsor directed scientific research and directed engineering development, and align both with the requirements of carefully managed commercial production. The book also features examples drawn from government data, scholarly literature, practitioner anecdotes and the author’s personal experience.","Lane, Joseph P.",Book,"The ABC’s of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy: Spelling Out Problems, Consequences and Viable Solutions",2023-01-01,"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York",Aristotle’s Three States of Knowledge ;  China’s Innovation Strategy ;  Federal Laboratory Consortium ;  National Science Foundation ;  Orphan Product Approach ;  Science ;  Technology & Innovation ;  Technology Transfer

An Analysis of Final Grades in a Mathematics Course for the Enhancement of Upcoming Engineering Students' Academic Performance by Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques,"The objective of this work is to show the importance of the use of Multivariate Statistics in the field of Research, particularly in Teaching Innovation. With the required mathematical support, it was proven that it is possible to improve the grading system semiannually providing feedback on the evaluation instruments and the weightings used in the formulas to obtain the final average of a previous subject, in which unsatisfactory results were obtained, using different methods of multivariate statistical analysis such as multiple linear regression, multivariate normal distribution, the principal components method and factorial analysis. The results obtained suggest that it is preferable to condense classic evaluations such as exams and assignments, in learning outcomes by units, and that it is necessary to incorporate a different evaluation, which allows assessing punctual attendance to classes, since, although usually this variable is not part of the evaluation, it was found to be a key piece in the approval of a subject. Finally, a Chernoff face analysis was carried out for the comparison of the final results obtained in the “MATLAB” 2018-II and “Numerical Methods” 2019-I subjects, taught at the School of Environmental Civil Engineering of the participant university, concluding that the implementation of this proposal, with which the approval of the entire second group of students was achieved, allows the optimization of academic performance through a methodology that is aimed at any teacher who wishes to replicate the same.","Hananel, Alberto;Loaiza, Sandra;Collantes, Jaime",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2023-01-01,Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo;Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo;Universidad de Granada,academic performance ;  Chernoff faces ;  multivariate statistics ;  teaching innovation
ASSESSING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) AWARENESS LEVEL AMONG THE ROYAL MALAYSIA AIR FORCE (RMAF) OFFICER: PUBLIC PROJECT,"Building Information Modelling (BIM) is said as an evolving and transformative technology that has revolutionised innovation within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation (AECO) industry. The fundamental premise of BIM revolves around facilitating collaboration across diverse project teams throughout the entirety of a project's lifecycle. Despite the Malaysian construction industry's ambitions to integrate BIM into public projects exceeding RM10 million in value, the utilisation of BIM remains vague in public projects financed by the Royal Malaysia Air Force (RMAF) and overseen by the Malaysian Public Works Department (PWD). As a result, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the present awareness of BIM among project teams within the RMAF. A survey in the form of a questionnaire has been disseminated to project teams engaged in public building projects across Malaysia, funded by the RMAF. This research adopted descriptive data analysis using a combination of manual calculation of maturity level score and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings indicate a significant majority of project teams within the RMAF exhibit limited awareness of BIM implementation. Consequently, further investigation is needed to examine the underlying factors contributing to this conspicuous lack of awareness within the teams, with corresponding suggestions for enhancement. From there, this could help public officers like RMAF to have a better awareness of how to adopt modern construction practices which enhance a country's standing on the global stage.","Saedin, Ridzuan;Brahim, Juliana;Nasir, Nasyairi Mat",Journal,Malaysian Construction Research Journal,2023-01-01,"Ministry of Defence, Government of Malaysia;Universiti Teknologi MARA",Awareness ;  Building Information Modelling (BIM) ;  Maturity Model ;  Performance ;  Public Project
Exploring plant microbiome: a holistic approach to sustainable agriculture,"Plant microbiome comprises dynamic consortium of all the microbes (bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes) colonizing multiple tissues in rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere or microbiome comprising all the microbial genomes. The interplay between plant–microbe interaction and unveiling its role helps in accelerating plant growth for better productivity and sustainability. At present, the crop production is constrained by a number of factors like unanticipated climatic changes, demographic patterns and the need for sustainable production is a must. Traditional farming practices have already been exhausted in terms of their effectiveness in increasing production and productivity which necessitates the inclusion of microbial innovations. Success in use of microorganisms as bioinoculant in biofertilizers and biopesticides would offer opportunities to serve as an alternative to chemical products in farming practices and promoting sustainability. Exploring plant microbiota with regard to different species and/or plant genotype, environmental condition, nutrient uptake, and biotic/abiotic stresses would provide us with suitable strategies and better candidate for a particular area. Since these microorganisms are rich repositories of biosynthetic pathways and production of specific biomolecules, the research in allied sectors and advancement of genetic tools would aid in modulating the properties of specific microbes and improved microbial consortium is helpful to agriculture community to meet the demands of expanding population in a sustainable manner. Advancements in genetic engineering to improve characteristic and inclusion of genetic modified organisms with upgraded functions to fulfill food security issues can address the issue up to a certain extent. Crop breeding programs have yet to be explored for improvement and selection of plant microbiome. The advent of automated DNA synthesis, sequencing, molecular biology, and computational bioinformatics with the latest gene editing tools like CRISPR-Cas has found variable applications in agriculture sector but their implementation in microbial research is limited. Deciphering this key relation between plant microbiome and their influence on soil and plant growth is critical to examine and utilize their benefits in sustainable food production. The research in sustainable agriculture is progressing to improve soil health and increase productivity among which the plant microbiome is emerging as a new horizon which is less explored but provides with wider range of opportunities for a healthier mother earth reaching through sustainable ends.","Krishna, Stuti;Bhutia, Dawa Dolma;Chaubey, Ranjan Kumar;Sudhir, Ichini",Book,Microbiome Drivers of Ecosystem Function,2023-01-01,Navsari Agricultural University;Banaras Hindu University,Endosphere ;  GMO ;  microbiota ;  phyllosphere ;  rhizosphere
STEAM Education and Innovation Learning Towards Circular Strategies,"In these times of climate crisis, we must focus more on developing various educational and training programmes to teach circular strategies and business transformation to build the adaptive competence of future talent and support the circular transformation of product and service design.

Developing countries facing climate change challenges in this fourth industrial revolution (4IR) era need skilled workforces to create inventive solutions. The education system needs to develop human capital to find better solutions to the problems of climate change that can be undertaken with limited resources and that can meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This chapter explores how STEAM education and innovation learning can raise awareness of the circular economy and help young people take responsibility for tackling climate issues. Based on the analysis of available data, documents, journals, and reports, the qualitative study described in this chapter explores the need for specific educational approaches to survive changes to our climate and create green businesses for a sustainable future. The research findings reveal that STEAM education and innovation learning can lead to responsible enterprises able to implement circular strategies to drive sustainable development in developing countries.","Khanom, Naiyer Fatema",Book Series,Sustainable Development Goals Series,2023-01-01,The University of Queensland;Founder Institute Adelaide Chapter;Wisecar Private Ltd.,Circular economy ;  Green enterprises ;  Human capital ;  Innovation learning ;  STEAM Education ;  Sustainable development
Research on Feature Extraction of Power Grid Technical Transformation Project Based on NLP-LSTM,"The power grid production technology transformation project is an important guarantee task for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the power grid. The power grid technical renovation projects under different project types and voltage levels also have their own characteristics. Therefore, the factors related to various power grid technical renovation projects are very complex and diverse, making the design of evaluation index systems for these projects very difficult. The obtained index systems often fail to accurately reflect the characteristics of cost management and evaluation of technical renovation projects, and cannot guarantee the objectivity and accuracy of evaluation results. This paper proposes to use the principle of natural language processing technology, combined with word segmentation technology to classify the existing technical innovation projects, and use LSTM neural network combined with the existing evaluation index set of the whole process cost management to screen the key index features, finally forming a relatively simplified evaluation index system. Through analysis, it is found that the feature extraction method proposed in this paper is highly accurate, and the feature extraction results are reasonable.","Qi, Xia;An, Lei",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2023 International Conference on Advances in Electrical Engineering and Computer Applications, AEECA 2023",2023-01-01,State Grid Jibei Electric Power Company Limited,deep learning ;  engineering project management ;  natural language processing ;  power grid technical transformation project
On the effectiveness of experiential teaching methods: the impact of University Challenges on students' attitudinal development,"The adoption of experiential teaching methods (e.g., flipped classroom, case-based learning, university challenges, etc.) with respect to traditional ones is gaining momentum in educational institutions. Due to the spread of those experiential methodologies, the aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of university challenges on students' attitudinal development, impact on fit to role and job satisfaction. We developed a questionnaire and a personality test, which we administered to two datasets of Engineering & Management students, from 2022 onwards. The first questionnaire was developed by combining 249 items from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) and dimensions from the O*NET workstyles, which respectively represent a database of psychological constructs and job profiles characteristics. The second questionnaire was designed by integrating dimensions from occupational dimensions and occupational dimensions. The study found that Analytical Thinking and Innovation are positively related to the participation to the University Challenge. Job satisfaction is influenced by many different factors, with no evident impact generated by participation to contests during academic studies. The research allowed to quantitatively demonstrate the impact and influence played by one of the experiential teaching methods - namely, challenge-based learning, although not yet widely adopted.","Di Luozzo, S.;Fantozzi, I.

Research on Application of Artificial Intelligence in Power System Fault Detection,"The stable operation of the power system is crucial for the normal operation of society. To improve the reliability and safety of the power system, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in power system fault detection has become a research focus. This study used a deep learning model - Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and compared it with traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) to evaluate its performance in power system fault detection. In the experiment, this paper selects the power system data set containing various fault types and complex time series, and carries out detailed data preprocessing. By training and testing two models, the experimental results show that Bi-LSTM is obviously superior to the traditional SVM method in accuracy, recall and Fl value. This shows that the deep learning model can better capture the characteristics of complex time series data in power system and improve the accuracy and robustness of fault detection. This study provides empirical support for the introduction of AI technology in the field of power system, and lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary cooperation and technological innovation.

Improving Success Rates for Underrepresented Students in an Information Systems Program,"Despite decades of effort and millions of dollars invested towards diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at many U.S. universities, a lack of diversity persists in information systems (IS) programs in both the student body makeup and faculty hiring pools. In 2019, women earned at least half of science and engineering degrees, but only 20% of computing degrees (Hamrick, 2019). Organizations that prioritize diversity consistently perform better and produce more innovative products. Considering that successful technology companies thrive on innovation, they should be clamoring to hire more diverse graduates in STEM and computing fields such as information systems. Despite recent layoffs in the technology sector (mostly related to prospective technologies like virtual reality and artificial intelligence), companies continue to anticipate significant shortages in available talent (Mearian, 2023). IS graduates are still in high demand and IS programs need to identify barriers to students’ success, particularly underrepresented students. Underrepresented students are more likely to encounter difficulties related to financial resources, familial support, and prejudice from faculty and peers. While social inclusion research has begun developing important theories to explain participation in IS such as Individual Differences Theory of Gender and IT (IDTGIT) (Trauth, 2002, 2013), academic research does not always clearly provide practical advice to faculty seeking immediate answers to make a meaningful impact for IS programs. This TREO talk will present results from a small exploratory, mixed methods study that asked underrepresented students about barriers they faced in an IS program housed in a College of Business in the Southeast U.S. The study was designed and conducted by an undergraduate student as part of her honors capstone project. One hundred three students of all backgrounds were recruited to take an online survey, of which 60 students provided complete answers. From the online survey, seven underrepresented students agreed to be interviewed about their experiences with the IS program. Participants suggested several simple yet impactful, practical and actionable steps that the IS program could immediately take to improve these students’ likelihood of success.","Warren, Mya R.;Connolly, Amy J.",Conference Proceeding,"29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023",2023-01-01,James Madison University,
Design Thinking to Improve Multi-Stakeholder Requirements Engineering,"Requirements engineering is perceived as one of software development's most vital but complex activities. Despite considerable advances, many software products continue to fail to fulfil their users' needs. A multi-stakeholder environment with several groups of users and developers additionally exacerbates known challenges in requirements elicitation. Following principles of action research, we investigate how practices of design thinking as an established approach to human-centred innovation may overcome or at least attenuate challenges of requirements elicitation in a multi-stakeholder environment. By observing and modelling the current requirements elicitation process of a multi-stakeholder app development project of an international OEM, we identified several challenges, for example, related to arbitrary prioritisation of requirements. Integrating our empirical observations of the requirements elicitation process with extant knowledge of design thinking, we propose a new requirements engineering process to address the challenges we identified. An evaluation of Infused Design thinking within the new process in the app development project supports the expectation of improved outcomes. As a key benefit, we observed improvements in the understanding of user needs in the engineering and development teams when harnessing the new process. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for both research and practice.","Ludmann, Julia;Przybilla, Leonard",Conference Proceeding,"29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023",2023-01-01,Technische Universität München,Agile Development ;  Design Thinking ;  Industry ;  Multi-Stakeholder ;  Requirements Elicitation ;  Requirements Engineering

Empowering Domain Experts in Developing AI: Challenges of bottom-up ML development platforms,"Recent trends in AI development, exemplified by innovations like automated machine learning and generative AI, have significantly increased the bottom-up organizational deployment of AI. No- and low-code AI tools empower domain experts to develop AI and thus foster organizational innovation. At the same time, the inherent opaqueness of AI, complemented by the abandonment of requirement to follow rigorous IS development and implementation methods, implies a loss of oversight over the IT for individual domain experts and their organization, and inability to account for the regulatory requirements on AI use. We build on expert knowledge of no- and low-code AI deployment in different types of organizations, and the emerging theorizing on weakly structured systems (WSS) to argue that conventional methods of software engineering and IS deployment can’t help organizations harness the risks of innovation-fostering bottom-up developments of ML tools by domain experts. In this research in progress paper we review the inherent risks and limitations of AI - opacity, explainability, bias, and controllability - in the context of ethical and regulatory requirements. We argue that maintaining human oversight is pivotal for the bottom-up ML developments to remain “under control” and suggest directions for future research on how to balance the innovation potential and risk in bottom-up ML development projects.","Thalmann, Stefan;Fomin, Vladislav V.;Ramos, Isabel;Gremsl, Thomas;Mourzine, Eugene",Conference Proceeding,"International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2023: ""Rising like a Phoenix: Emerging from the Pandemic and Reshaping Human Endeavors with Digital Technologies""",2023-01-01,Vilniaus Universitetas;Rockwell Automation;Universität Graz;Universidade do Minho,AI ;  autoML ;  Bottom-up development ;  domain experts ;  low-code ;  no-code

Research on Structure Reliability Design Technology of High Power Ceramic Based Microsystem package,"In recent years, China has made rapid progress in the field of microsystem technology through independent innovation, which has also led to profound changes in the design concept of electronic information system architecture. It has begun to move from the research stage of basic theory to the stage of engineering research and development, especially in the field of high-power microsystems, and has made breakthrough progress. Due to the large number of integrated chips, high density, and high reliability requirements of microsystems, most microsystems adopt ceramic solder pillar array CCGA package with high package density, good thermal performance, and good airtightness. The package and substrate are designed as an integrated design, greatly saving layout space. As the carrier of microsystems, the structural reliability of ceramic package plays a crucial role in the performance of microsystems. Therefore, based on the high-density multi-layer co fired ceramic technology system, this paper uses finite element analysis software to conduct a systematic simulation study on the structural reliability of microsystem package, forming structural design rules for large-sized and highly reliable package suitable for microsystem package. In this paper, multi-level parts matching technology is mainly used to solve the thermal stress problem caused by the large difference of coefficient of thermal expansion between different parts of the large-scale micro system package. Microsystems designed using this technology have advantages such as high reliability, high density, and high performance, low power consumption, and short design cycles.","Yang, Zhen Tao;Chen, Jiang Tao;Yu, Fei;Wang, De Jian",Conference Proceeding,"2023 24th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology, ICEPT 2023",2023-01-01,Cetc,Coefficient of thermal expansion ;  Microsystems ;  Multi-layer co-fired ceramic ;  Structural reliability
Bilingual Chatbot Powered by Artificial Intelligence for Academic Advice,"The role of academic advising in advancing institutions' educational goals is becoming more widely recognised. Utilizing technology tools like Canvas and Degree Works, universities have made considerable investments in assisting instructional advisers and student success measures. The demand for innovation that can support academic advisors in their duty to direct students toward academic achievement is growing, and AI tools that encourage the effective use of human capital are well-placed to fill that requirement. Functions for chatbots can be used as technology-mediated assistance to give knowledge and engaging content to help students succeed. This project set out to create, build, and assess an automated, AI-enabled advising resource (the AVA chatbot) for use in an honour's college setting to provide academic counselling and university-related information. The researchers came to the conclusion that chatbots could assist educational universities in efficiently supporting their student populations by giving 24/7 advice, following and evaluating total assistance, and identifying data perceptions in real time.

The science of stem cells and stem cell engineering for cellular agriculture,"The cultivated meat industry is growing quickly with investments from industry, nonprofits, and governmental grants. Selection of an appropriate source for cell lines will dictate the barriers and solutions needed for their proliferation and differentiation into a cultivated meat product. Skeletal muscle myofibers are the primary source of nutrients, and fat cells and connective tissue-producing cells are critical for flavor and texture, respectively. Adult stem cells (ASCs) are programmed to create the components of meat but are limited in their expansion capabilities in culture. Genetic modification of ASCs may increase their proliferation capacity but must meet regulatory and consumer acceptance. Pluripotent stem cells can address proliferation limitations and differentiation ability, but require specialized culture conditions that are currently unsuitable for cultivated meat at a large scale. Continued research has the potential to overcome these obstacles and to provide innovations that can make cultivated meat more cost effective, sustainably produced, nutritional, flavorful, and widely accessible.","Smith, Lucas Robert;Jara, Thomas;Denicol, Anna",Book,"Cellular Agriculture: Technology, Society, Sustainability and Science",2023-01-01,"University of California, Davis",Adipogenesis ;  Differentiation ;  Embryonic stem cells ;  Muscle stem cells ;  Myogenesis ;  Satellite cells ;  Stem cells
Enhancing the Performance of 4-Bit Absolute-Value Detectors Design Strategies and Optimization,"The investigation of 4-bit absolute-value detectors holds paramount significance owing to their versatile applicability across diverse domains, spanning signal processing, automation control, and healthcare. Through the enhancement of 4-bit absolute-value detectors, the potential to cater to the distinctive demands of various application realms becomes more pronounced, thereby imparting tangible benefits to both society and the engineering sector. This research is dedicated to the minimization of detector latency and power consumption while preserving the absolute-value detection function, consequently elevating the comprehensive performance of 4-bit absolute-value detectors. Firstly, an innovative circuit topology for the 4-bit Absolute-Value Detector was devised, wherein the process of obtaining the absolute value of the input signal (x[n]) was inverted through a conversion to 2's complement format. Moreover, the conventional comparator was supplanted by a chain adder with a reduced number of logic gates. Subsequently, a logic style optimization strategy was implemented, employing static CMOS logic for AND and OR gates, and PTL logic for XOR gates, with the aim of minimizing latency and energy consumption. Lastly, a variable-controlling approach was utilized in calculations, encompassing the evaluation of delay and energy reduction when considering Vdd only, Sizing only, or both Vdd and Sizing, followed by the selection of the most advantageous energy reduction through result comparison. In the course of the project's validation phase, the 4-bit absolute-value detector designed herein featured a total of 22 logic gates. Through meticulous circuit variable optimization based on Matlab mathematical model, the latency of the 4-bit absolute-value detector reached a remarkable low of 14.6 ∗ FO4, accompanied by a substantial energy savings of up to 69.26%. The refinement of the circuit topology, the optimization of transistor-level logic gate implementation, and the adjustment of both Vdd voltage and transistor sizes collectively contributed to a significant enhancement in detector performance. This enhancement not only translated into reduced energy consumption but also yielded decreased latency. The efficacy of this design approach is transferable to other circuit designs, offering the potential for performance enhancements.","Long, Junyu",Conference Proceeding,"2023 7th International Conference on Electrical, Mechanical and Computer Engineering, ICEMCE 2023",2023-01-01,Southwest Jiaotong University,4-bit Absolute-Value Detector ;  Circuit Design ;  Delay and Energy Optimization ;  Innovation and Future Research

Impacts of Catastrophic Forgetting: From a Machine Learning Engineering Perspective,"Software validation is the method of ensuring that a software system is built correctly, meets user needs, and functions according to defined requirements. In the current age, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are at the forefront of technological innovation. Software engineering practices are being adopted in the ML/DL domain to assist in defining and mapping software validation anomalies, e.g., catastrophic forgetting. A ML model can be engineered, trained, and used to fulfill a requirement specification based on its classification capabilities. Catastrophic forgetting can cause a model to forget a class fully or partially insofar as a requirement is no longer fulfilled. This paper posits that catastrophic forgetting is an issue of ML validation and presents the issues of catastrophic forgetting in the novel domain of ML engineering. Ideally, this paper will spark a discussion and lend insight to the future direction of ML validation and verification. Future work includes developing case studies to observe the validation and verification challenges of catastrophic forgetting. The authors suggest researchers explore other ML/DL anomalies that might impact validation and verification.","Elvira, Timothy;Couder, Juan Ortiz;Procko, Tyler Thomas;Ochoa, Omar",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2023 Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing, CSCE 2023",2023-01-01,Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University,Catastrophic Forgetting Paper Type - 'Short research Paper' ;  ML Engineering ;  Software Engineering ;  Software Validation ;  Software Verification
Extended reality technologies for public engagement and skills development,"We will illustrate some experiences and projects presented at the VITE I conference in the field of extended reality technologies for public engagement and skill development. Extended technologies have many benefits when applied to educational contexts, providing immersive and engaging learning spaces, enhancing the sense of perception and grasp to the students, and thus improving the process of learning and motivation to access to science.

Unlimited Sampling of FRI Signals with Dithered One-Bit Quantization,"Recent research in sampling theory suggests utilizing unlimited sampling with one-bit quantization time-varying threshold (UNO) for bandlimited signals. The UNO framework addresses the problems associated with the finite dynamic range and limited quantization levels in conventional ADCs. However, the input signal in many engineering applications is not bandlimited. Of particular interest are the finite rate of innovation (FRI) signals that are characterized by finitely many samples per unit of time and need not be bandlimited. In this work, leveraging upon the generalized FRI sampling theory, we introduce a novel sampling approach for FRI signals that utilizes low-cost one-bit ADCs. We extend this one-bit generalized FRI (OBi-GeFRI) sampling to include unlimited sampling for FRI signals in the form of a new unlimited one-bit FRI (UNOFRI) framework. We rely on the highly efficient random Kaczmarz algorithm, a linear feasibility problem solver, for signal reconstruction in both OBi-GeFRI and UNOFRI. Our numerical examples illustrate the viability of these sampling techniques to tackle the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art.","Eamaz, Arian;Yeganegi, Farhang;Mishra, Kumar Vijay;Soltanalian, Mojtaba",Conference Proceeding,"Conference Record - Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers",2023-01-01,University of Illinois at Chicago;DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory,FRI signals ;  Kaczmarz algorithm ;  one-bit quantization ;  time-varying sampling threshold ;  unlimited sampling

Embracing Diversity and Inclusion: A Decolonial Approach to Urban Computing,"This vision paper underscores the technical challenges and difficulties of addressing urban computing from a Diversity and Inclusion (DEI) decolonial standpoint. Issues of DEI, which encompass factors such as gender, race, age, socio-economic status, physical abilities, and religion, necessitate a shift in how we conceptualise the design of scientific and engineering methodologies. The decolonial perspective can be employed to scrutinise the influence of dominant viewpoints on our understanding of progress, innovation, and their contribution to societal welfare. The hypothesis is that these perspectives can be integrated into the design processes that deal with solutions, knowledge, and information systems across all layers, from infrastructure to application and user interfaces.

Remote sensing monitoring method of livestock in grassland based on multi-scale features and multi-models fusion,"China is a large country of grassland and animal husbandry. Overloading and overgrazing is one of the main causes of grassland degradation in China. To protect the grassland, it is necessary to precisely monitoring livestock carrying capacity, which is the key to evaluation and control grass-livestock balance. However, traditional method of livestock carrying capacity such as hierarchical statistics, sampling field survey and online camera monitoring is whether time-consuming, labor-intensive, costly or poor quality. So it is very urgent to find a kind of efficient and precise monitoring method of livestock carrying capacity in grassland. To achieve this goal, this research proposes an efficient and precise monitoring method of the livestock in grassland by using of sub-meter resolution satellite image. The method not only fuses multi-scale features of livestock in sub-meter resolution satellite image such as “blob feature”、“flock feature”、“moving feature”, but also integrates deep learning technology and object oriented recognition technology. Firstly, considering that the livestock in satellite image is a kind of small (tiny) target, it uses kinds of image enhancement method such as bilateral filtering and Laplace of Gaussian (LoG) operator to enhance the weak livestock signal successfully. Secondly, in consideration of “flock feature”of livestock flock, it use a kind of“livestock flock detection model”based on deep learning technology to get the rough distribution area of livestock flocks. Thirdly, in consideration of“blob feature”and“moving feature”of livestock, it use a kind of“livestock blob detection method”based on LoG Gradient Difference and object oriented recognition technology to get the possible livestock blobs. Finally, by integrating the detecting result of both livestock flocks and livestock blobs, it uses the livestock blobs result to enhance and verify the livestock flocks result, and the enhanced and verified livestock flocks and the livestock blobs within them is finally get by using some simple manually revising work. Through an experiment in Xilingol grassland, it is found that the approach has good effect on livestock flock detection: with positive detection rate about 0.802 and false detection rate about 0.244, especially as to big livestock flock, the positive detection rate is up to 0.937, the false detection rate is low to 0.072. It is very helpful for the monitoring and supervision of livestock flock in grassland, and can also provide reference for remote sensing monitoring of other“small (tiny) targets”. It is of great significance both in terms of technological innovation and business application. It makes a litter effort in promoting the livestock satellite remote sensing monitoring into an intuitive and fine monitoring era- “Number-Counting Era”.","Xiao, Rulin;Gao, Jixi;Liu, Aijun;Hou, Peng;Zhang, Wenguo;Yang, Yong;Li, Yunbao;Fu, Zhuo;Jin, Chuanping;Yang, Xu;Zheng, Shuhua;Yin, Shoujing",Journal,National Remote Sensing Bulletin,2023-01-01,Ecological Environment Monitoring Center of Mianyang;Ministry of Ecology and Environment Center for Satellite Application on Ecology and Environment;Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Grassland Remote Sensing and Emergency Technical Reserve Key Laboratory,grassland ;  livestock ;  livestock carrying ;  remote sensing ;  small (tiny) target
Mobile Application Implementation as Agriculture 4.0 Strategy for Sugarcane Yield Prediction,"Information engineering strategies play a significant and transformative role in shaping the landscape of digital agriculture. It drives innovation and efficiency in modern farming practices, with a specific focus on enhancing the value of agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane. The application of mobile technology plays a crucial part in achieving increased sugarcane productivity. Mobile applications, equipped with advanced developer features, offer rapid and user-friendly access to vital information. Traditional methods of estimating sugarcane production relied on manual data recording on paper, followed by data transfer to computer systems, typically managed by sugar factory junior plant officers. This conventional approach presents several inherent weaknesses, including time and effort intensiveness during data recording and entry. Additionally, the potential for errors in calculation and data input is a concern. The storage capacity for paper-based documents is finite, and farmers are often unable to autonomously assess their production potential. The objective of this research is to confront these obstacles by creating a sugarcane production application for Android. This application functions as an information engineering approach focused on forecasting sugarcane yields for plantation owners and their assistants. The development procedure adhered to the systematic waterfall method, following the principles of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model. Data collection was carried out through observations, while interviews with junior plant officers provided valuable insights into sugarcane estimation techniques. Analysis involved the synthesis of observational and interview data to inform the design of the application's interface and algorithmic system. The resulting application significantly simplifies the process of estimating production potential for farmers, enabling them to access sugarcane productivity data during harvest. Consequently, sugar factories can guarantee both the quantity and the quality of their sugarcane raw materials with confidence.","Mawandha, Hangger Gahara;Rahutomo, Reza;Suparyanto, Teddy;Pardamean, Bens",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2023 9th International HCI and UX Conference in Indonesia, CHIuXiD 2023",2023-01-01,Bina Nusantara University;Faculty of Agricultural Technology,Agriculture 4.0 ;  Android ;  Mobile Application ;  Prediction ;  Sugarcane

RGB Attention-Aware Enhancement for Underwater Image Enhancement,"Underwater image enhancement is an important tool for acquiring deep-sea resources, marine environment monitoring, submarine pipeline maintenance and other fields. Due to the special characteristics of underwater environment, underwater images often suffer from incomplete image information such as blurring, noise, and uneven illumination, which seriously limits the value of underwater images in scientific research and engineering applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes the RGB attention-aware enhancement conditional generative adversarial network for underwater image enhancement. The network learns the end-to-end mapping from input images to enhanced outputs. A key innovation in this paper is the RGB attention-aware enhancement module incorporated into the generator. This module effectively extracts features and adjusts the contrast and saturation of underwater image colors. Meanwhile, L1 loss function and adversarial loss function are proposed in this paper, which can focus on ground truth image features in a targeted way. In this study, we use numerous comparative tests to confirm the superiority of the suggested strategy in real underwater image enhancement. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other advanced techniques in enhancing underwater images. Moreover, it exhibits superior generalization performance. It can also adapt to the needs of underwater image enhancement in a variety of scenarios and conditions.","Cai, Qiang;Wu, Chenying;Li, Haisheng;Cao, Ying",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2023 China Automation Congress, CAC 2023",2023-01-01,Beijing Technology and Business University,attention mechanisms ;  generative adversarial network ;  Underwater image enhancement
Alertness Anticipation Innovations in Driver Safety Predictions,"Drowsy driving is a major contributor to traffic accidents and a major risk to public safety. The development of driver sleepiness detection systems has found success in recent years with the use of machine learning techniques. This work proposes a comprehensive approach to machine learning algorithms - such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) - for the detection of driver sleepiness. In this paper, investigate how these algorithms perform when trained on a picture dataset. Using a camera mounted in the car, the suggested system first takes live pictures of the driver's face. After that, facial landmarks are taken out of these pictures and used as input data for machine learning models. To identify the patterns linked to drowsiness, each algorithm is trained using a labelled dataset that includes both alert and sleepy facial expressions. Using cross-validation approaches, the performance of each algorithm is assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By informing sleepy drivers in real time so they can take the appropriate safety measures or take a break, the suggested system has the potential to improve road safety. An important way to assess the suitability of various machine learning algorithms for driver sleepiness detection applications is to compare them. To improve the system's accuracy and resilience in real-world situations, more research can concentrate on incorporating other sensor data, such as eye movement patterns or steering habits.","Priyanka, S.;Keerthika, S.;Arunesh, J.;Priyadharshini, S.;Sanjay, S.;Anudeep, C.",Conference Proceeding,"3rd IEEE International Conference on ICT in Business Industry and Government, ICTBIG 2023",2023-01-01,Kongu Engineering College,CNN ;  Deep Learning ;  KNN ;  Random Forest and Machine Learning ;  RNN ;  SVM

Base Anchors in Model of Global Quality Management System (G-QMS) in System of Systems (SoS),"This research addresses an advanced topic in Industrial Engineering, which integrates innovation to relative new and rapidly evolving disciplines of Quality Management System (QMS), System of Systems (SoS), Globalization and Systems approaches such as Systems Thinking, by defining a field of research for Global Quality Management System (G-QMS) in SoS. From the literature on each of these disciplines separately, among them in Globalization [1], in QMS [2], in SoS [3] and in Systems Thinking [4-5], it is found that each discipline is generally still in a preliminary state in referring to organizational systems in particular those which are also global. In addition, they emphasize the importance and potential contribution in the further progress of these disciplines in organizational applications. This research focuses on the concepts, structure, contents and behavior of G-QMS in SoS which is characterized by a global and multi-organizational deployment, in target to create foundational principles for defining and modelling this kind of G-QMS with the unique characteristics and needs for the SoS. Our exploratory study, uses the methodology of the Grounded Theory [6] combined with an analytical review and professional experience. It reveals, in its conclusions, eight base anchors that might underlie any model of G-QMS in SoS [7]. Furthermore, a consolidated view of the eight base anchors together with their main factors and aspects, creates an initial model of G-QMS in SoS [7]. In addition, the study findings emphasized that G-QMS is a necessary condition for SoS, while the management of G-QMS is inseparable from the management of the SoS. By doing so, they reinforce the motivation in further progressing this research. Further to this exploratory study, an extensive field research in real global SoS organizations, is currently being conducted, to base the knowledge in G-QMS in SoS for the sake of establishing definition, structure and model.

Forming a space industry engineering team in a newly formed Research and Development departments of a developing countries,"As global interest in space exploration continues to grow, developing countries are seeking to solidify their presence in the industry, by forming space industry engineering teams. Advancements in cutting-edge technologies, such as the James Webb telescope, the Perseverance Rover, and highly sophisticated nanosatellites, have opened up endless possibilities for new players to establish themselves as leaders of the modern space cohort. These developments have had a significant impact on the space industry, as they have paved the way for the involvement of developing countries in innovations and discoveries. Despite their desire to participate in the space industry, developing countries still face numerous challenges to establish themselves. Aside from the significant financial investment required, the biggest challenge is the lack of experienced engineering talent. The availability of a skilled and dedicated engineering workforce is essential for countries and companies to create an independent environment and continue advancing in the industry. Forming a team without ready processes, procedures and infrastructure such as labs and tools poses hardships for new teams attempting to dive into research and prepare prototypes. At early stages the main focus point of developing countries is to increase socio-economic conditions and specifically improve the quality of general education. They prioritize investments into assets that bring short-term benefits. The educational targets of these countries are to prepare young generations by giving them basic engineering and quantitative skills. On the contrary, advancing the space industry requires an in-depth expertise in system and subsystem level engineering, and most of the projects must be initiated with long-term benefits in mind. A methodology is required to deal with the challenges that come with an inexperienced pool of new engineers, in order to realize the long-term benefits of independent development. This paper examines an approach to forming and preparing design and development engineers in developing countries, the challenges that arise during the process, and key factors to consider during the recruitment phase. It will also analyze the types of initial projects, team structures, and vision formation, as well as integral non-engineering related factors.","Gadimov, Tahir",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2023-01-01,Space Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Azercosmos),Azerbaijan ;  developing country ;  R&D ;  Workforce
Saving Lives by Integrating Space-Based Solutions,"In the U.S. alone, approximately 100 deaths and 82 percent of lifeguard rescues-with estimations of thousands worldwide-are killed by rip currents annually [1]. This paper investigates the integration of earth observation solutions and artificial intelligence (AI) with drone technology to address specific user-needs at the coast. There is a particular focus on rescue workers who require extensive knowledge of rip currents to save lives. However, to produce a market-effective tool for coastal users, multiple stakeholders must be united to provide purchasing power. To gain market insight and the effect of combining data, market research on coastal users and operators in the Netherlands is combined with detailed knowledge from Iliad Digital Twins of the Ocean, with a particular focus on meteorology and climate, fisheries and insurance sectors as part of the novel Iliad approach. The study directly addresses the gaps between space and non-space coastal technology through comprehensive market analysis and technological innovation. To understand user-needs, the paper investigates the Dutch coast as a case study, entailing collaboration with a diverse array of coastal users from lifeguards, investors, drone operators, naval personnel and regional authorities. At present, drone technology is advancing for coastal rescue applications providing high resolution imagery, but with the reduced operational costs of open access remote sensing images in comparison to in-situ monitoring, satellite imagery can also be used worldwide, building historical datasets for coastal safety education. The research also approaches the matter in question of the economic value of saving lives, which should not be overlooked during technological innovation. Accordingly, integrating advancing technology and data allows space-based solutions to address multiple needs of coastal users by providing a spatio-temporally, and economically feasible, advantageous service.","Buckley, T.;Yao, J.;Peters, S.;Kazanjian, G.;Blankert, R.;Wever, C.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2023-01-01,American University of Armenia;Katwijk Reddingsbridage;Maritime Emerging Technologies Innovation Park (METIP);STICHTING DOTSPACE;Water Insight,market ;  remote sensing ;  rescue ;  rip current ;  risk map

GET Space - Growth of Education and Technology for Space: An Interdisciplinary Education Project on Tethered CubeSat Missions and Robotic Space Technologies at the University of Stuttgart,"In 2022, the University of Stuttgart's Institute of Space Systems (IRS) launched an interdisciplinary education program, combining study courses on Small Satellite Design and Robotic Space Systems. Within the innovative format student teams of different disciplines work together on the design of a complex space system technology development in both, theoretical design studies and practical hands-on projects. This initiative fosters collaboration between student teams from each course to achieve a common objective. In total, four different student teams and supervising experts from various research disciplines like satellite design, space robotics, orbit mechanics, HF communications, mechanism design, from both, industry and research, are linked together. The interdisciplinary educational project is funded by the Innovation in Higher Education Foundation (Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre, StIL) and covers four semester courses over a one-year project duration. Within the education program, several teaching and learning formats like lectures, practical tutorials, analytical & theoretical design studies, student-led milestone presentations and technical reviews, are elaborated and combined. The main overall technological mission goal of the program is the analyses and development of small sized autonomous space system for future reduction of space debris using a tethered satellite system. To setup a competitive framework, the participating student teams were divided into two competitive development clusters which were required to fulfil the same mission goal. Experiences from past educational projects showed, that the competitive framework enhances the individual motivation as well as the team dynamics significantly, but also allows to foster a communicative exchange of innovative solutions and a profound reflection on the own research results at qual basis. Besides technical knowledge-gains on the highly complex subject of space system development, also individual key competences and a reflection of professional emphasis of the students are fostered. Within this context, student teams of the Small Satellite Design Course explored concepts and designs for tethered CubeSat missions in feasibility studies. These CubeSat platforms are equipped with robotic sensory payloads which allow detection and tracking of CubeSat-sized objects within a distance of 100 m, since the mission is designed as a tethered CubeSat mission. These sensory packages are developed and tested in breadboard-models by the student teams within the Space Robotics Course' hands-on project. All teams have a significantly high number of interfaces to coordinate within the seminar projects during analyses and elaboration of the technical solutions. These interfaces comprise mechanical, electrical, data and organisational aspects between course projects, subsystems even down to the component level. The final results were presented within two final full-day presentation events. This paper outlines the program's framework, course formats and activities, and the lessons learned from this innovative education program and shall reflect on the experience and learning outcome of the project for both, students and supervisors.","Gewehr, Moritz;Kanzow, Marlin;Blank, Sebastian;Bonidis, Anastasia Natascha;von Ruedorffer, Paul Edler;Friedrich, Daniel;Kobiak, Dimitry;Kocic, Ilija;Komposch, Maximilian;Largent, Patrick;Lauer, Luc;Lehnert, Philipp;Mayer, Christian;Nevola, Mario Domenico;Pentke, Nils;Pfaff, Johannes;Preis, Max;Schneider, Maximilian;Siedler, Jan;Siemer, Reinke Dirk;Steif, Maximilian;Teichröb, Leon;Wirch, Daniel;Fugmann, Martin;Lengowski, Michael;Winterhalder, Patrick;Klinkner, Sabine",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2023-01-01,Universität Stuttgart,CubeSats ;  Education ;  Hands-on Project Work ;  Interdisciplinary Education Program ;  Space Robotics ;  Tethered Systems

Artificial Intelligence and its Effectiveness in Modern Teaching,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is not a new term; its beginnings go back to the beginnings of the fifth decade in the year 1955. Since the emergence of artificial intelligence, it has been in the process of continuous development and spread of its technologies, until it recently reached the most prominent application, which is the ChatGPT program. AI technology is one of the most important modern technologies that contribute to the development of many fields, raise the level of quality, improve productivity, and increase efficiency. Education is one of the most important areas affected by modern technologies, which moved education from the ordinary level to the level of creativity and innovation. The idea of this research comes from several reasons: 1- The rapid transfer of education to a larger world in a short period, 2- The many positives that artificial intelligence had and acquired; 3- The need for the teacher to develop himself in this field and keep pace with the modern era, 4- The absence of motivation among many students, and the infiltration of boredom and lethargy among their ranks. 5- The need for the courses taught by the student to adapt technology in this era, and the inclusion of artificial intelligence completes that. 6- Enriching the research library with a study related to the important topic needed by the teacher and the student. 7- The limited thinking of some students and the lack of scientific communication and its stopping at a certain point.","Alomran, Hanadi Mohammad;Alhazmi, Omar Hussain",Conference Proceeding,"2023 International Conference on Data Science, Agents and Artificial Intelligence, ICDSAAI 2023",2023-01-01,Taibah University,AI ;  AI application ;  AIED ;  Artificial intelligence ;  ChatGPT ;  Education ;  Learning

An approach for eliciting requirements from digital sources in organisations using the Scrum method,"The business world is nowadays characterized by complexity due to rapidly evolving market and customer requirements. As a consequence, software providers are facing the challenge of delivering products with higher pace and innovation. The agile methodology has a big impact on how software systems are developed - it should facilitate business value in short iterations. Requirements are the base of all software systems, and consequently, Requirements Engineering (RE) plays one of the most important roles in system development. Traditional elicitation techniques relying on stakeholders’ requests do not cover the increasing demands for considering unintended data from organisations' related digital sources, internal (transaction logs, sensors) or external (e.g., microblogs), amplifying thus the need for the elicitation of data-driven requirements. This study proposes a process that combines data-driven and traditional RE approaches for Agile software development, and specifically for the Scrum method. The process intends to assist Agile professionals to elicit requirements from digital sources in combination with intended data derived from the stakeholders without impacting the main Agile practices. The motivation for the research origins from the case studies carried in few companies having the challenge to include data-driven requirements into their Agile approaches. The usage of the proposal is illustrated on an enterprise software case, while several Scrum professionals were interviewed to evaluate its correctness and importance.","Georgiadis, Stylianos;Zdravkovic, Jelena;Stirna, Janis",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2023-01-01,Stockholms universitet;European Dynamics,Data-Driven Requirements Engineering ;  Enterprise Agile Frameworks ;  Scrum ;  User Stories

Smart City Replication Engineering: A Conceptual Framework,"With the emergence of smart city approaches, the concept of replication also gained importance. The principle of replication is based on the shared understanding that cities benefit from a formalized exchange of information, experience, ideas, and technical solutions. Cities are assumed to face similar challenges even if they differ in many characteristics and can benefit from shared knowledge about successfully implemented smart city applications. By definition, the process of replication refers in this context to the respective translation to another location. The results from one pilot case are transported or 'copied' to other geographic areas, albeit under possibly different boundary conditions.In this paper, Design Science Research (DSR) serves as a methodological approach to build a conceptual framework that facilitates replication activities considering relevant research gaps, demands, and previous activities. The framework adds the perspective of complexity and systems research to extend the methodical replication portfolio with a complementing conceptual, strategic, and participatory tool.","Ruess, Patrick",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit, E-TEMS 2023 - Conference Proceedings",2023-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO,Design Science Research ;  Smart City ;  Smart City Replication ;  Urban Innovation
Advances in the convergent evolution of phenotypes and diversification of developmental mechanisms of floral spurs,"Background & Aim: The floral spur stands out as a key innovative trait that has evolved in response to the interaction between plants and pollinators. This trait is widely distributed in angiosperms, showcasing a highly variable morphology among different species.

Ecodesign Methods Integration into SMEs Product Development,"Various methods—as systematic procedures for achieving results—and tools—as technical or mental aids for achieving results—(for simplicity, referred to as techniques in the following) have been developed for the sustainable development of products. This multitude of options, however, poses a challenge to product developers, because so far there is no practical approach to interlinked product development that sufficiently takes ecological requirements into account and is easy to adopt for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). It is particularly difficult for SMEs and start-ups to choose suitable techniques and utilise them in their normal day-to-day operations, which makes it increasingly difficult for them to align their innovation activities with ecological requirements (Pigosso et al. in J Indian Inst Sci 95(4):405–426 (2015); Ernzer and Birkhofer in The 7th International Design Conference, Dubrovnik, pp. 1305–1310 (2002)). The present work deals with current techniques that were selected based on predefined criteria for integrability in SMEs and the promotion of the development of a product that is sustainable (Kokoschko et al. in Entwerfen Entwickeln Erleben in Produktentwicklung und Design 2021. Entwerfen Entwickeln Erleben, pp. 49–57 (2021); Kokoschko et al. in Design for Tomorrow–Volume 1. Springer Singapore, Singapore, pp. 901–910 (2021)) and integrated into the product development process (PDP) concept of Integrated Design Engineering (IDE) (Integrated Design Engineering, Ein interdisziplinäres Modell für die ganzheitliche Produktentwicklung. Springer Vieweg, Berlin, 2014) and thus tested for their moment of use, practicability and manageability. Therefore, two case studies of product development were used to test the techniques, and the process model was adapted based on the experiences and results of the case studies. The aim of this work is to help SMEs and start-ups develop products more competitively with context-specific technique proposals and their descriptions and thereby contribute to sustainability through the development of sustainable product development processes. This allows both the design and manufacture of products to be aligned with ecological environmental requirements, making a major contribution to the development of an integrated and interconnected PDP and thus is an important step towards solving current environmental problems (Herrmann in Ganzheitliches Life Cycle Management, Nachhaltigkeit und Lebenszyklusorientierung in Unternehmen. VDI-Buch. Springer, Berlin, 2010). Also, it will be discussed that sustainability in this context is to be understood in two ways: firstly, application sustainability, which describes the long-term use of a sustainability technique, and secondly, the development of products that become more sustainable through the use of certain techniques (product sustainability).","Kokoschko, Björn;Wohak, Lisa;Schabacker, Michael",Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2023-01-01,Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg,

The Research on Decision-making of Carbon Neutrality Technology in Green Supply Chain Based on Cost Reduction,"This paper considers a two-tier supply chain game model composed of an upstream manufacturer and a downstream retailer, where the upstream manufacturer invests in carbon-neutral technological innovation that can reduce production costs and increase consumer demand. Based on this game model, the optimal equilibrium outcome of the supply chain is solved, and the influences of the carbon-neutral sensitivity coefficient, the investment coefficient for carbon-neutral technology innovation, carbon emission reduction efficiency, and the carbon-neutral technology cost reduction efficiency on the operation decision of supply chain companies are examined. The results show that (1) increasing consumers' carbon-neutral sensitivity coefficient will improve the level of carbon-neutral technology innovation, market demand, and supply chain performance, while the pricing strategy of products is related to market size. If the market size is large enough, the pricing strategy of products will increase, on the contrary, the pricing strategy of products will decrease. (2) With the increase in the investment coefficient of carbon-neutral technological innovation, both the wholesale price and the market price increase, while the level of carbon-neutral technological innovation, market demand, and supply chain performance decrease. (3) The increase in carbon-neutral technology cost reduction efficiency leads to an increase in carbon-neutral technology innovation level, market demand, and profit of supply chain enterprises, while product wholesale and market prices are reduced. (4) With the increase of carbon emission reduction efficiency per unit product, the level of carbon-neutral technology innovation level, product sales and profits of supply chain enterprises all increase, while the wholesale price and sales price of products decrease.","Fan, Jianchang;Chen, Shuangshuang",Conference Proceeding,"11th International Symposium on Project Management, ISPM 2023",2023-01-01,Nanjing University of Finance and Economics,Cost reduction ;  Green supply chain ;  Technological innovation of carbon neutrality

Serious Games for Cybersecurity: How to Improve Perception and Human Factors,"Cybersecurity is a growing problem in today's technological innovation and new digital economy. Threat actors cause a danger to people's safety or lead to the compromise of intellectual property, either sold on the dark web or used as leverage for ransom. Many executives believe cybersecurity is the responsibility of Information Technologies (IT). It is everyone's responsibility. Countering cyber threats requires focusing on people and behaviors and cognitive models; the mere technicalities are not enough to face the issue. With this in mind, the following research analyzes existing frameworks in the literature for developing serious games for cybersecurity. They are developed to train and educate individuals in various aspects of cybersecurity, including threat detection, incident response, and risk management. Moreover, combining serious games and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a powerful approach to cybersecurity training and education. By integrating Explainable AI techniques into serious games, users can better understand the decision-making processes within the game environment. Players can learn how to interpret the explanations provided by AI models, identify potential limitations or errors, and make decisions based on both AI-generated insights and their own domain knowledge. This combination equips individuals with the skills to improve perception and human factors in cybersecurity.","Barletta, Vita Santa;Calvano, Miriana;Caruso, Federica;Curci, Antonio;Piccinno, Antonio",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Metrology for eXtended Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering, MetroXRAINE 2023 - Proceedings",2023-01-01,Università degli studi di Bari Aldo Moro;Università degli Studi dell'Aquila,cybersecurity ;  Explainable AI ;  human factors ;  serious game

TAKING THE PULSE OF RESPONSIBLE DESIGN; EXHIBITIONS AS A CRITICAL DISCOURSE VENUE,"While there are examples of public discourse around responsible innovation in science, technology, and engineering, less exists on public discussion in the field of responsible design. Without creating space for this to happen, how can design educators stay abreast of the contemporary perspectives of the societies they wish their students to serve? Using a single case study methodology, we describe a snapshot safari activity which convened a multidisciplinary group of scholars and practitioners to reflect on and discuss design exhibits and their relation to social innovation. We propose this activity as a conceptual model for convening new forms of publics around exhibited work, enabling critical discourse on different responsible design perspectives. We believe this model could form the basis of further active research ultimately supporting universities to stay contemporary in their relationship with society through a better understanding how others understand responsible design and helping design pedagogy nurture the responsible designers the modern world needs.","Simmons, Helen;Spencer, Nick;Bailey, Mark",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Responsible Innovation for Global Co-Habitation, E and PDE 2023",2023-01-01,University of Northumbria,Design show ;  exhibitions ;  publics ;  responsible design

"DATA AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: THE NEED FOR A DATA PRACTICE PARADIGM IN DESIGN EDUCATION, A PROJECT-BASED REFLECTION ON USING MATLAB SOFTWARE FOR SENSOR DATA CAPTURE AND ANALYSIS","This paper discusses how MATLAB software was integrated into the research and design process by capturing and visualising data to inform a 4th-year capstone undergraduate industrial design product development project. Examined within the project framework are perspectives on; data use for design projects from the literature, data collection, understanding project data, designer alternate skill set, using data to justify design direction, associated data capture technologies, data-driven changes of state for UIs (User Interface) and a proposal that designers need to have a data practice paradigm. As technology rapidly embeds into almost every aspect of society data is produced and captured at a diversity and scale previously unparalleled. Tools and systems to capture and assess such data simultaneously are being democratised, bringing new understandings and accessibility to systems for testing hypotheses more efficiently, either with sensor-based open-source hardware microprocessors or commercial data capturing systems. Designers developing smart products, smart system proposals, and IoT devices need to integrate these data capture and assessment tools into traditional product development and research processes. This is especially significant in projects where subtle technical innovation and application of new technologies, “technology epiphanies”[9], or natural user interfaces (NUI) are present. These themes are critical to designers at present; engineers, data scientists and computing scientists apply data analysis techniques to design problems previously in the product designer’s training skillset. Having an applied understanding of such processes would permit designers to regain control over domains slipping into the grasp of allied product development disciplines.","Berry, James",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Responsible Innovation for Global Co-Habitation, E and PDE 2023",2023-01-01,Western Sydney University,Arduino ;  control systems ;  Data ;  IoT product development ;  MATLAB ;  NUI ;  Simulink ;  TUI ;  UI ;  user interface

Grip mastic asphalt - high friction asphalt for wearing course with the addition of steel slag,"Adherence between tire and pavement surface is essential to ensure traffic safety and driving comfortability. The phenomenon is very complex and there are many impact factors affecting the friction performance, including the tire type, pavement structure characteristics, pavement material characteristics, aggregate gradation, wet and dry condition, and vehicle speed. For this reason, significative efforts were made to understand the macroscopic friction based on continuum mechanics (Liu et al. 2021; Zorowski 1973) and the correlation between the micro texture of asphalt pavement that determines the actual contact area between tire and pavement and influences the intermolecular force and adhesion force (Chu et al. 2017). In this field the most evolutive model is represented by the study in micro-friction area (Yue Hou et al. 2018) analysed using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. From an experimental perspective, several combinations of asphalt mixes and aggregates were investigated in terms of skid resistance to tyre. High value of skid resistance was easily related to the use of aggregate with high polished stone value (PSV) and mixes designed with high texture. An innovative test, the German Wehner Schulze test, was proposed within Europe as a replacement of the PSV and was developed with the aim to simulate the trafficking and assess the change of skid resistance with time of samples or cores extracted from pavement surface (Huschek 2004). Important comparison of PSV and WS methods are available in the literature (Allen et al. 2008). Moreover, Highway Administrations are every day committed in the promotion of innovations and technologies that enhance road safety. Among those, the most important one is related to the identification of materials or treatment able to significantly enhance skid resistance. These solutions reach a high level of importance when applied in locations with high friction demand with the aim to reduce crashes. With the aim to define innovative solutions for asphalt pavement to be used along the highway network, the research center of Fiano Romano (RM) investigated the friction properties of asphalt mixtures made with the addition of steel slag. The project belongs to an innovative approach aimed at the development of a sustainable engineering where the supply of natural sources is limited, and the use of recycled materials is encouraged.","Tozzo, Cristina;Chiola, Davide;Gasbarro, Nicoletta;Spinelli, Paolo",Conference Proceeding,"Roads and Airports Pavement Surface Characteristics - Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Pavement Surface Characteristics, SURF 2022",2023-01-01,S.p.A.;Tecne Gruppo Autostrade per l’Italia S.p.A,Pavement Temperature ;  Prediction Models ;  Temperature Distribution

MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF YUCCA PLANT FOR POTENTIAL BIOMIMETIC APPLICATIONS,"Hesperoyucca Whipplei (HW), commonly known as the chaparral yucca, is a species of yucca native to the southwestern United States, particularly California and Arizona. This plant has adapted to thrive in dry, arid conditions, making it an interesting subject for studying the mechanical properties of its physical structures. Research has shown that the chaparral yucca has distinctive physical and structural characteristics that allow it to withstand external forces and environmental stresses. For example, the yucca's leaves and stems are composed of fibrous tissue that provides both stiffness and flexibility, allowing them to bend and resist breaking under wind and other physical stresses. For this paper, experiments were performed to establish the mechanical properties of HW with a focus on understanding its distinctive physical and structural characteristics. Tensile tests were conducted on different components of the plant, including whole leaf samples, fiber bundles, braided fibers, and single fibers. Similarly, the outer bark of the stalks underwent 3-point bending testing. Studying the mechanical properties of HW can provide valuable insights into the plant's adaptation to its environment and inspire new innovations in materials science and engineering.","Shaw, Rickelle;Robertson, Kyle;Vargas-Silva, Gustavo;Mixon, Daryl;Jawaharlal, Mariappan",Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2023-01-01,"Universidad Pública de Navarra;California State University, Sacramento;California State Polytechnic University, Pomona;Rivian;Advanced Sterilization Products",Advanced bioinspired materials ;  Biological materials ;  Materials structure ;  Mechanical properties ;  Plants

An Immersive Curriculum to Develop Computational Science and Research Skills in a Cohort-Based Internship Program,"Workforce education is a key challenge as computational science, including data science and machine learning, increasingly influences critical application spaces such as public health and medicine, space exploration, national security, autonomous systems and cybersecurity. Developing core software development, analysis, and machine learning skills will enable workers to have impact across a range of spaces. These skills are in high demand in industrial research and development, but we do not believe that traditional recruiting and training models in industry (e.g., internships, continuing education) are serving the needs of the diverse populations of students who will be required to revolutionize these fields. To accelerate workforce development in these key areas, we have designed and executed a machine learning and research skills training curriculum for our cohort-based research internship program, the Cohort-based Integrated Research Community for Undergraduate Innovation and Trailblazing (CIRCUIT). The program targets trailblazing, high-Achieving students who face barriers in achieving their goals, and the training program is aimed at accelerating their growth as leaders in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence research. The training curricula and support structure is designed to be flexible to student and research project needs during a research internship. Utilizing both existing online material and custom workshops, this model consists of a compressed data science and machine learning curriculum, a series of professional development training workshops, and team-based challenges. Strategies allow for customization of these training efforts for individual students and projects. Over four cohorts, this training curricula has helped students achieve mastery of data science and machine learning concepts, produce key demonstrations and work products in their cohort research projects, and progress to further internships, graduate school, and employment.","Johnson, Erik C.;Villafane-Delgado, Marisel;Symonette, Danilo;Carr, Katherine Ann;Hughes, Marisa;Burroughs, Julie;Floryanzia, Sydney;Cervantes, Martha;Gray-Roncal, William R.",Conference Proceeding,"13th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2023",2023-01-01,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,artificial intelligence ;  cohort-based ;  data science ;  internship ;  machine learning
A Comparative Analysis for Optimal Wind Farm Cluster Identification Using Hopkins Index and Silhouette Coefficient,"Wind farms, intricate and sophisticated structures composed of multiple strategically positioned wind turbines, represent a remarkable feat of engineering and innovation. This paper investigates the identification of optimal cluster count for wind farm layout optimization using wind speed data. The objective is to compare the clustering results obtained from two methods: Silhouette coefficient and Hopkins clustering index. The study focuses on the utilization of K-means clustering to identify cluster configurations that best represent the layout of the wind farm. The wind speed data used in this research corresponds to an offshore wind farm, comprising 25 turbines over a 30-day period. The silhouette coefficient and Hopkins clustering index are utilized to identify the ideal number of clusters for the wind farm layout. The results of the study prove the effectiveness of both methodologies in estimating the optimal cluster number. The silhouette coefficient analysis reveals an optimal cluster number of 8, with a coefficient value of 0.1368. The wind farm layouts obtained from each method are compared and plotted to visualize the clustering configurations. In contrast, the Hopkins-based layout results in a smaller number of clusters, implying a more cohesive turbine distribution. The results of this study offer insights into the determination of the optimal cluster number for wind farm layout optimization. The comparison of the silhouette coefficient and Hopkins clustering index serves as a valuable reference for wind farm developers and operators in making informed decisions regarding the number of clusters to consider in the layout design.","Tao, Siyu;Kimutai, Victor;Feijóo, Andrés",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE 4th China International Youth Conference on Electrical Engineering, CIYCEE 2023",2023-01-01,Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Cluster analysis ;  Hopkins statistics index ;  Offshore wind farms ;  Silhouette coefficient ;  Wind farm clustering
Designing and Evaluating MahjongBrain: A Digital Cognitive Assessment Tool Through Gamification,"Early detection of cognitive decline is of utmost importance, as research suggests that certain risk factors can be modified to slow down or even prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. However, traditional cognitive assessments require a significant amount of time and resources, which can burden both the participants and the clinicians administering the tests. This study developed a new digital cognitive assessment tool called MahjongBrain that incorporates Mahjong elements into eight digital games to improve engagement and interest among older adults during the assessment process. After presenting the software framework, assessment content, and system implementation, we conduct the usability test on 5 participants (mean age 65 years old, 20% women) in Anhui, China. The results demonstrate that the MahjongBrain is user-friendly for older adults, with the majority of participants reporting positive attitudes towards it (mean system usability scale score: 74). Furthermore, we introduce three novel digital measures which could be utilized by machine learning methods to detect subtle changes in cognitive function, including a) the scores and time to completion for each test within each cognitive domain, b) the time-stamped coordinates from the finger tracking, and c) the position of the screen as the participant is playing the games. These initial findings indicate the innovation and transformation of MahjongBrain in cognitive assessment, although further usability and validation tests are needed.","Yang, Jiaoyun;Jiang, Richu;Ding, Huitong;Au, Rhoda;Chen, Jinying;Li, Clara;An, Ning",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2023-01-01,Framingham Heart Study;School of Public Health;Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai;Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine;Hefei University of Technology,Digital Cognitive Assessment ;  Gamification ;  Mahjong ;  Usability Test

Thermophysical Characteristics of Nanofluids: A Review,"Rapid advancement in nanotechnology over the past 10 years has given scientists and technologists plenty to consider. One of the amazing results of such innovation is nanofluid, in which metallic and non-metallic nanoparticles are sus pended colloidally in commonly used base fluids. The peculiar thermal behaviour of nanoscale fluids was only recently discovered by leading researchers, and since then, nanofluids have been the subject of intense investigation all around the world. This is because they have the potential to be an improved thermophysical heat trans mission fluid and because they are crucial for uses like oil recovery and medicine delivery. Recent research on nanofluids has revealed that these fluids have superior heat transmission and wetting properties. In addition, water-based nanofluids are more environmentally friendly than mineral oil quench medium. Due to these potential benefits, quench media based on nanofluids have been developed for use in heat treatment procedures. It was unexpected and outside the realm of then-current theories that nanofluids with comparable low particle concentrations would have a larger thermal capacity (conductivity). According to the experimental find ings, the thermal conductivity of nanofluids increases with decreasing particle size. Micrometre-sized particle-based fluid suspensions reveal no such significant augmentation. Another critical characteristic that demands the same focus is viscosity, which has a significant influence on heat transmission. Nanofluid stability is essential to their successful operation in thermal systems. In addition to this, a number of other thermophysical characteristics, for instance, thermal conduction, heat flux, density, viscosity, and specific heat, are crucial for materials to keep their thermophysical characteristics after manufacture for an extended period of time. But before nanofluids can be used commercially, there are a few problems that need to be fixed. Stability and functioning performance are the two key concerns of nanofluids. In light of the fact, the intention of this chapter is to provide thorough analysis on thermophysical features of nanofluids and some potential opportunities for upcoming research that could be important as the literature in this field is lengthened across an extensive range of fields, including heat transfer, physics, chemical engineering, material science, and synthetic chemistry.","Hsu, Chou Yi;Satpathy, Gargibala;Al Kamzari, Fatma Issa;Manikandan, E.;Ajaj, Yathrib;Al Kindi, Aithar Salim",Book,"Modern Nanotechnology: Volume 2: Green Synthesis, Sustainable Energy and Impacts",2023-01-01,Thiruvalluvar University;Sree Balaji Medical College & Hospital;German University of Technology in Oman;Chia-Nan University of Pharmacy and Science Taiwan,Heat transmission ;  Nanofluid ;  Nanofluid stability ;  Nanotechnology ;  Operational performance ;  Synthetic chemistry ;  Thermal conductivity ;  Thermophysical ;  Wetting properties

Why technology-supported classrooms: An analysis of classroom behavior data from AIGC,"The infusion of technology into educational settings has become a pivotal element in modern teaching methodologies. Technology-Supported Classrooms (TSCs) blend digital tools with traditional teaching methods, fostering an interactive learning environment. While these classrooms offer distinct advantages, such as streamlined teaching workflows and heightened student engagement, they have not consistently translated into improved academic outcomes. This paper explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) to address these limitations. Through data analytics, the study evaluates and refines learning processes and academic results, focusing on three unique types of TSCs: Cloud-Service, Cloud-Interaction, and Cloud-Collaboration Classrooms. Several critical factors are scrutinized, including the ability of TSCs to support cognitive development, the appropriateness of software tools across various academic disciplines, shifts in student behavior trends, and the effectiveness of these classrooms in generating student-driven content. The findings underscore the effectiveness of TSCs in improving learning efficiency, fostering classroom interaction, and facilitating independent learning. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitation of relying on a restricted dataset for AI analysis. This research offers valuable insights for educators and policymakers, emphasizing the transformative potential of AIGC and AI in the educational landscape.","Dai, Yi;Huang, Yi Zhe;Zhang, Yun Feng;Xu, Xiao Shu",Conference Proceeding,"2023 International Conference on Intelligent Education and Intelligent Research, IEIR 2023",2023-01-01,City University of Macau;Macao Polytechnic University;Wenzhou University,Artificial Intelligence Generated Content(AIGC) ;  education innovation ;  learning analytics ;  student behavior analysis ;  technology-supported classrooms(TC)
Semi-structured expert interview-based requirements elicitation for a digitalized production ramp-up,"Due to the ever-shortening innovation cycles and the rapid change of customer demands, enterprises introduce new, innovative, and modern products at an increasingly faster frequency and desirably lower costs. The technological change of products and mass customization increase the product complexity. This development requires manufacturing enterprises to perform more frequent production ramp-ups. Many production ramp-up projects miss the time, cost, and quality targets, causing manufacturing enterprises to lose potential profit due to later market introduction. Although digital tools are widely applied during the serial production phase, their potential during production ramp-up is hardly investigated in the scientific literature. Moreover, no guidelines exist on how to use digital tools during the production ramp-up in various industries. To provide data-driven support for the production ramp-up phase, requirements for the functionality of digital tools need to be defined. Henceforth, this paper applies a requirements engineering (RE) approach to elicit the requirements for digital tools to support the production ramp-up phase based on a comprehensive literature review and semi-structured expert interviews. In total, 13 experts from seven different industries participated in the interviews. After introducing the necessary theoretical foundations and the current state of research in ramp-up management literature, the RE process is described in detail. The RE process is based on user stories - an agile development tool - and the ISO 29148, which outlines an international standard for RE processes. The result is a set of requirements for the functionality of digital tools during the production ramp-up phase. Finally, the paper presents an outlook on future research perspectives for applying the elicited requirements in practice.","Stang, Julian;Kroeger, Sebastian;Zaeh, Michael F.",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2023-01-01,Technische Universität München,Industry 4.0 ;  production ramp-up ;  requirements engineering ;  semi-structured expert interviews
Aerospace Qualification Services Knowledge Graph: A Leap towards Enhanced Data Management,"In the field of aerospace product qualification services, AddQual’s operation relies on the effective coordination of data from diverse sources. This is presently achieved through a relational model, which has displayed numerous limitations, including the lack of semantic enrichment, data heterogeneity, and horizontal data evolution.

It is organized around 10 Pilots which cover various actions such as preserving, studying, managing and interacting with musical heritage. Its advantage is that it uses semantic web technologies (ontologies and resulting knowledge graphs) as lingua franca binding the different Pilot data together. More specifically and additionally to the common use of GitHub repositories in research projects, Polifonia adds an additional organizational structure, what we call a Research Ecosystem. The Polifonia Research Ecosystem documents project outputs and their mutual dependencies as semantic artifacts, developing annotations for both (output and dependencies). This paper details the design and implementation of such a Research Ecosystem as a specific approach to effectively coordinate collaboration and related software production. Using the case of the Polifonia project, the paper reflects on the opportunities and challenges arising when it comes to formalize best practices to execute innovative research processes. Finally, we discuss the potential impact that such developments could have on future bibliometrics and information retrieval practices.","Daga, Enrico;Daquino, Marilena;Fournier-S’niehotta, Raphaël;Guillotel-Nothmann, Christophe;Scharnhorst, Andrea",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2023-01-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences - KNAW;Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers;The Open University;CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,information retrieval ;  interdisciplinary collaboration ;  knowledge organisation ;  ontology engineering ;  project-based research

The future of cell-instructive biomaterials for tissue regeneration–a perspective from early career clinician-scientists,"Cell-instructive biomaterials are an essential component in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In the past three decades since the term “Tissue Engineering” was coined, researchers have made significant progress towards regenerating disease or damage tissues and organs by combining innovations in biomaterials, signaling molecules and cell therapies. However, challenges persist including limitations in properties of cell-instructive biomaterials, lack of advanced manufacturing technologies for precise spatiotemporal control of key players in tissue engineering, and hurdles in clinical translation and regulatory process. In this perspective article, we briefly review the current state of the field including the evolution in our understanding of the role biomaterial mechanics and scaffolding architecture, development of self-healing and modular biomaterials, and progress in advanced manufacturing technologies such as 3D bioprinting. In addition, we discuss about how innovation in research technologies including multi-omics and spatial biology, and advanced imaging modalities may pave the way for enhancing our understanding about cell-biomaterial interactions. Finally, we present our perspective as early career clinicians and researchers on the key role and potential impact that clinician-scientists can generate in the development, validation, clinical translation and adoption of the next-generation of cell-instructive biomaterials for application in engineering tissues and organs to impact human health.","Rangel, Rodrigo;Swanson, W.

"Co-Designing Technology Scaffolds and Scripts for Co-Regulated, Adaptable Learning Community Curricula","Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI) is a learning community model that offers a set of principles to guide the design of collective inquiry scripts, however, the model has yet to include any direct role for a student model, nor any explicit mechanism for adaptable scripts. This study presents a technology innovation, co-designed with a middle school mathematics teacher, that will serve to support student modeling and adaptable scripts. Part of a larger study presently in progress, this paper presents a work-in-progress of the design-based research method, focused on problem identification, design, and testing of the scripts and technology innovation. The conjecture of the broader design experiment is that by adding new forms of scaffolds and student-sensitive adaptable scripts to KCI, we can facilitate adaptations and co-regulation of learning that promote student outcomes (e.g., content acquisition, engagement, social-emotional learning, and the development of learners' identities in mathematics).","Wiebe, Joel P.;Martin, Emilia;Slotta, James D.",Conference Proceeding,"Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL",2023-01-01,University of Toronto;Upper Canada College,

Redefining the Organization of Research and Development for Technology-Based Companies in the Age of Stake-holder Capitalism - A Purpose-Driven Management Approach,"This paper redefines the Research and Development (R&D) department of technology-based enterprises from the perspective of purpose-driven management and categorizes purpose-driven management into three types: (i) Purpose for the Alignment of Mission, Vision, and Values; (ii) Purpose for Social Contribution; and (iii) Purpose for Stakeholder Engagement. A fourth-generation purpose-driven R& D model in response to the VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity)-era is proposed, emphasizing the importance of aligning R& D with the company's purpose and contribution to society. By clarifying a company's values and purpose, the entire organization, including R& D, can adapt quickly to market changes and foster innovation. The characteristics of purpose-driven R& D are shown from the three perspectives of purpose-driven management, which help clarify a company's introverted and extroverted existential values and enable the entire corporate organization, including R& D, to interact quickly and frequently with the marketplace, thereby realizing an ecosystem centered on core competencies.","Shintani, Yukihiro",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2023 14th IIAI International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics, IIAI-AAI 2023",2023-01-01,Chiba Institute of Technology,Age of Stakeholder Capitalism ;  purpose-driven management ;  Research and Development (R&D) management

Accelerating an integrative view of quantum biology,"Quantum biology studies span multiple disciplines including physics, engineering, and biology with the goal of understanding the quantum underpinnings of living systems. Recent findings have brought wide attention to the role of quantum mechanisms in the function and regulation of biological processes. Moreover, a number of activities have been integral in building a vibrant quantum biology community. Due to the inherent interdisciplinary nature of the field, it is a challenge for quantum biology researchers to integrate and advance findings across the physical and biological disciplines. Here we outline achievable approaches to developing a shared platform—including the establishment of standardized manipulation tools and sensors, and a common scientific lexicon. Building a shared community framework is also crucial for fostering robust interdisciplinary collaborations, enhancing knowledge sharing, and diversifying participation in quantum biology. A unified approach promises not only to deepen our understanding of biological systems at a quantum level but also to accelerate the frontiers of medical and technological innovations.","Kinsey, Luke J.;Beane, Wendy S.;Tseng, Kelly Ai Sun",Journal,Frontiers in Physiology,2023-01-01,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas;Kalamazoo College;Western Michigan University",non-trivial quantum effects ;  quantum biology ;  quantum physics ;  quantum technology ;  spin chemistry

Design and Fabrication of 3D Bioprinter for Tissue Engineering: Current Innovations and Future Perspectives,"Several advancements in material production technologies have occurred over the last few decades. Additive manufacturing (AM), often known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a three-dimensional object manufacturing process that involves adding material per layer from a digital file generated by a computer program. A 3D printer was the equipment utilized in AM. When orthopedic doctors and tissue engineering professionals saw the use of this technology to produce gadgets and models to aid in surgical procedures, as well as tissue printing and cultivation, 3D bio-printing gained significance in health. Bio-inks/hydrogels containing cells, medicines, and growth modulators are utilized in bio-printing to create scaffolds and cellular 3D structures. It is a process that utilizes computer-aided design (CAD) data to create three-dimensional objects through the successive accumulation of materials. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various industrial sectors and production lines by reducing time and cost while producing more efficient products. The aerospace, automobile, and healthcare industries are particularly poised to benefit from the mass production capabilities of AM. A particularly promising application of this technology is 3D bioprinting, which involves the creation of 3D structures. This research involves the creation of a 3D bio-printing platform based on extrusion for manufacturing hydrogels. To expel the biomaterial, a bio-extruder with an adjustable syringe pump holder is used. While the syringe pump holder is designed to securely hold syringes of various sizes, ranging from 1ml to 5ml. The syringe pump holder is adjustable to accommodate different syringe diameters and lengths.","Khan, Muhammad Hasanat;Awan, Muhammad Umer Farooq;Khan, Asfand Yar Bahadar;Ul Haq, Izhar",Conference Proceeding,"18th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies, ICET 2023",2023-01-01,"University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar;University of Engineering and Technology",3D Bioprinter ;  3D Designing ;  Additive Manufacturing ;  Bioprinter material ;  Fabrication ;  Tissue Engineering
Implementation of an Effective Project-Based Learning Methodology in the Freshman Year of Engineering and Technology Programs,"The goal of this innovative practice paper is to describe the implementation of a project-based learning mechanism in the academic curriculum. One such mechanism called 'Innovative Projects' has been implemented at our university to systematically foster an innovation culture among all students of engineering and technology programs at the grassroots level. The primary goal of this initiation is to encourage, inspire, and nurture all freshman students of various engineering and technology programs by assisting them in developing innovative ideas and prototyping them. This initiative provides an excellent opportunity for new undergraduate students to develop innovative ideas using Arduino and Raspberry Pi embedded boards. Innovative projects also provide an opportunity for freshman students to interact with first year students from other departments in order to improve their research skills and encourage interdisciplinary projects. The plan allows students to select their own project group members and a faculty advisor, allowing them to take advantage of intensive course training and laboratory facilities. This strategic plan ensures that students gain knowledge through a project-based learning process to solve many real-world technology-related problems. In this paper, we will describe our experiences of successfully implementing innovative project courses in the freshman year of all engineering and technology programs offered at our university. In the previous and present academic years, two courses on innovative projects were introduced for the first time in the curricula of all engineering and technology programs offered at our university. These two courses are named Innovative Project-Arduino Using Embedded C (CSE 1002) and Innovative Project-Raspberry Pi Using Python (CSE 1003). The CSE 1002 and CSE 1003 courses were offered for the first time in the freshman year during the spring semester of the academic year 2021-22 and during the fall semester of the academic year 2022-23, respectively. The introduction of these two innovative project courses has completed its initial successful pilot run for the first batch of over 5000 freshman students. These two courses are currently being offered for the second batch of over 5000 freshman students. Experiences gained during the pilot run are being infused into the second batch offering of these courses and will be shared in this article. All aspects starting from the design of these two innovative projects courses, the establishment of a dedicated innovative laboratory to support these courses, pedagogical approaches adopted for teaching these courses, assessment, and evaluation of these courses will be discussed. The introduction and successful implementation of such innovative project courses on a massive scale in the freshman year of all engineering and technology programs at the university level is a novel concept. Focus groups conducted with the freshman students of the various engineering and technology programs demonstrate that they valued this opportunity because it provided them with the necessary technical and entrepreneurial skills that may be required to succeed in the capstone projects later in their respective undergraduate programs.","Faiz, Mohammed Mujahid Ulla;Divyarani, M.

Optimizing Indonesian Education Through National Standards: Implications for Engineering and Computer Science,"This study examines the National Education Standards (NES) in the context of improving the quality of education in Indonesia. The research employs a quantitative approach, specifically path analysis, to test the relationship between various components of the Indonesian NES using eight key variables: content, process, graduate competencies, educators and educational staff, facilities and infrastructure, management, financing, and educational assessment. The population for this study consists of educational institutions across Indonesia, including primary and secondary levels. Data will be collected through accreditation documents, gathered from the National Accreditation Agency. The research findings indicate that management standards have a positive influence on evaluation, process, and content standards, underscoring the importance of effective management in promoting continuous improvement and aligning educational practices with desired outcomes. The standards for educational personnel were found to negatively impact evaluation standards, while infrastructure and facilities standards positively affected evaluation but negatively influenced process and content standards. Financing standards showed no significant influence on outcome standards. In enhancing graduate competency standards, content standards negatively impacted, while process and evaluation standards contributed positively. The study findings suggest that optimizing educational quality necessitates improving management standards, engaging teachers in professional development, ensuring efficient learning practices, and maintaining rigorous evaluation processes. When applied to engineering and computer science education, these findings can foster an environment of continuous learning and innovation, promote professional development for educators, highlight the need for well-equipped facilities, and emphasize the importance of aligning instructional practices with curricular goals, thereby preparing graduates to meet the challenges of the 21st century.","Arjanto, Paul;Bafadal, Ibrahim;Atmoko, Adi;Sunandar, Asep;Wiwenly Senduk, Feibry Feronika",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Universitas Negeri Malang,educational components ;  management and evaluation ;  national education standards ;  quality of education ;  quantitative analysis

Exploration and Research on the Open and Shared New Engineering Maker Practice Education,"Maker spaces have become an important platform for students' technological innovation and entrepreneurship activities in many universities. In order to provide students with innovative practice teaching platforms, promote the sharing of teaching resources in higher education parks, and advance the development of 'new engineering education' in engineering practice teaching, depending on the construction of 'school-enterprise co-built innovation laboratories', this study mainly carried out interdisciplinary themed maker space education. The focus of maker space education is on platform and curriculum system establishment, maker space organization and management, and the effectiveness and evaluation of maker space education. Firstly, by implementing the concept of 'school-enterprise cooperation' and adopting a combination of practical teaching and MOOC(Massive Open Online Course) teaching methods, this study explores the construction of a modular maker space practice teaching curriculum system with cutting-edge topics such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, and artificial intelligence, leveraging the self-developed virtual reality platform. Then the 'Innovation Workshop' student association is created to regularly organize students' maker space training and technology activities, and an open and shared management mechanism is established with the student association as the main body to strengthen maker space security management. Finally, with the themes of 'fusion of innovation and competition' and 'product-driven', the top-level design of maker space education is optimized to cultivate and expand innovative thought, and vigorously improve scientific and technological innovation competition results through competition-driven teaching, promote the landing and application of maker space products. During the two years operation of the maker space, excellent products with the theme of intelligent robot design have been completed, which won two first prizes, one second prize in national science and technology competitions, and one special prize in provincial and ministerial competitions have been awarded. The maker space shows great significance to improve the students' innovation and practical abilities.","Sun, Zhibo;Li, Zhilong;Qian, Zheng;Qi, Haitao;Shi, Chengkun",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Beihang University,Maker practice education ;  Maker Space ;  Practice Teaching ;  Shared

Persistence Priorities and Financial Servingness in an Emerging HSI,"As the demographics in the United States' college going population continues to shift, the number of HSIs grows annually, yet research in higher education indicates a difference between enrolling Hispanic students in great numbers and serving the Hispanic/LatinX population [1], [2] Servingness is embodied in structures and practices that constitute HSIs, and is manifested in the acts of institutional agents who interpret policy, advocate for students, and access resources on behalf of students. This paper describes the findings from an initial case study of a public US east coast Emerging Hispanic Serving Institution recently funded by the National Science Foundation to provide scholarships for high-achieving students with great financial need. In an effort to understand financial barriers students face in attending college in a post-pandemic context, the first author interviewed key stakeholders at EAST STEM University. The research question driving the study was: How is EAST STEM changing its infrastructure to develop diverse support structures that serve students? Data for this pilot case study were collected from unstructured interviews with the lead faculty member of the grant in the computer science department, document analysis of institutional data (e.g., contextual data from the US Department of Education, publicly available information from Excellencia in Education, institutional profile data from the Institute of Educational Statistics), and from formal interviews with key stakeholders across the university. Interviews were transcribed and coded using emerging themes with Dedoose software. The staff interviewed in this study span five administrative offices and academic departments. Findings from this case suggest the institutional goals of promoting diversity and increasing persistence were values that aligned with the acts of servingness utilized at East STEM University to advocate holistically for student needs [3]. Interviews with institutional agents indicate two ways the institution supported student progression through the major-through human resource allocation and through financial prioritization for equity. Within this institutional context, institutional agents enacted servingness through their emphasis on equity and persistence priorities, with, in some cases, a critical lens supportive of student success[4]. Key to their efforts in promoting persistence for students were three actions-creating space for one-on-one engagement with students, advocating on students' behalf across multiple administrative offices, and adapting and reinterpreting policies to support continued student enrollment. This study illustrates how institutional agents aligned serving with a key institutional initiative, and shows how that alignment created space for innovation in meeting undergraduate students' financial needs.","Hug, Sarah",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Colorado Evaluation & Research Consulting,diversity ;  equity ;  financial barriers ;  inclusion ;  student support structures

In education, the combination of emerging digital technologies, innovative pedagogical processes and spaces, and active learning has been called education 4.0. Education 4.0 involves key concepts capable of transforming engineering education with the participation of society, industry, university, and the government. Through a scoping literature review, our goals are: (1) to evaluate the impacts of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Construction 4.0 (C4.0), and Education 4.0 (E4.0) on engineering education and the synergy between these concepts; (2) to evaluate how undergraduate teaching in Civil Engineering and Construction Management is synergistically inserted with I4.0, E4.0 and C4.0; and to identify the challenges and opportunities for improving these programs. The authors utilized a scoping literature review using the Scopus database to identify research related to education in Civil Engineering and Construction Management within each concept (I4.0, C4.0, and E4.0). The works selected in the searches were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to identify the main research themes and gaps. Our findings indicate that research and practices for improving the curricula of engineering courses using digital technology and active learning exist. However, these are usually in low synergy with research and practices related to Industry 4.0 and Construction 4.0. Our results help researchers and other stakeholders in engineering education grasp the implications of current changes in industry and education for the alignment of undergraduate curricula of Civil Engineering and Construction Management with 4.0 concepts. Future research could build upon our findings to further explore defining strategies to transform and modernize the curriculum of engineering courses using innovative teaching tools and methodology, such as competency-based education.","De Souza, Alex Sander Clemente;Debs, Luciana",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Purdue Polytechnic Institute;Universidade Federal de São Carlos,Construction 4.0 ;  Education 4.0 ;  engineering curriculum ;  engineering education ;  Industry 4.0 ;  undergraduate education
The Impact of Project-Based Technology Management Courses on Alumni Entrepreneurial and Innovation Self-Efficacies,"This Work in Progress paper focuses on the impact of a project-based education program on the entrepreneurial and innovation self-efficacies of the program's alumni. The Social Cognitive Theory is the theoretical foundation of this study, which builds on a previous study conducted among mechanical engineering graduate students at Stanford University. The goal of this current research is to identify the career pathways of the alumni, how this education program impacted their entrepreneurial outcomes and innovation behaviors and provide analysis and recommendations to the program's teaching team. To achieve this a survey was deployed to 1000 program alumni, covering a 25-year span from 1998 to 2023.","Hysi, Kei;Sheppard, Sheri;Chen, Helen L.;Toye, George;Milanov, Hana",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,"TUM School of Management, Munich;Stanford University",alumni ;  education ;  entrepreneurship ;  innovation ;  self-efficacy
The Roles of Student Staff in Engineering Makerspaces,"In recent years, substantial resources have been invested into makerspaces in the community, K-12 schools, and higher education based on the underlying assumption that their creation will lead to experience that ignite interest, engagement, and persistence in engineering. University makerspaces are thought to have the potential to support entrepreneurship, innovation, and design, alongside the undergraduate engineering curriculum [1]. Despite this pedagogical potential, research tents to focus on the organization and operation of the makerspace (e.g., the design and layout, the type of equipment, the role of administration) [2], [3]. One opportunity to dig deeper into the research on makerspaces is an exploration of the pedagogy with the makerspace, specifically, the role of student staff in these spaces. In this work in progress paper, we seek to understand how student staff interact with one another, other students, as well as university faculty and staff within the context of academic makerspaces. In partnership with a makerspace at two large, public institutions in the Southwest, we conducted twelve interviews with students who held various staff roles within the makerspace. The interviews were conducted in Fall 2021 and Spring of 2023 and lasted between fifteen and forty-five minutes in length. A team of two researchers used a qualitative analysis approach to identify themes and findings from the interviews in the Summer of 2023.The analysis of this data begins to uncover the ways in which students interact with others in makerspace as well as the various roles they occupy and their contributions to the space. Findings include the intersection of hierarchy within the space among student staff and spaces of inclusion or exclusion. Implications are discussed and include how these findings can inform education research practice in informal spaces such as academic makerspaces and formal spaces, such as classrooms, where student interaction occurs.","Boklage, Audrey",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Cockrell School of Engineering,Interaction ;  Makerspace ;  Student Staff
Best Practices for Cultivating Innovative Thinking Skills in Innovation Competitions and Programs,"Engineering and computing education have always embraced student Innovation Competitions and Programs (ICPs), such as design challenges, hackathons, startup competitions, and boot camps. These programs are typically organized to increase interest in STEM fields, achieve the broader objective of forming well-rounded engineers and encourage students to bring their innovative ideas into real life. In addition, all ICPs also aim to advance students' innovative thinking skills. With the increased focus on entrepreneurship and innovation in STEM programs, many higher education institutions now organize some form of ICPs. This increased popularity of ICPs bears the questions of (i) whether ICPs achieve their intended objectives, (ii) what program components are most effective, and (iii) how to design ICPs for recruiting diverse student groups. Although these questions are highly relevant to advancing the educational benefits of ICPs, the literature lacks holistic studies focusing on the best practices of ICPs. In this paper, we present the findings of a qualitative research study to investigate ICP types and attributes that make the most impact on fostering an innovation mindset. We interviewed the organizers of ICPs to understand their objectives for organizing their events and rationales for specific program elements. Besides, we asked questions about how they promote their events, the best ways to reach out to students, team selection and forming, their assessment and judging procedures, during and after competition support, and the best practices and challenges. These interview scripts were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. An analysis of extracted thematic concepts was performed to identify the best practices and strategies that ICP organizers utilize to increase the Impact of their programs. The paper presents the preliminary results of this thematic analysis of the codes. Overall, findings suggest that incorporating more entrepreneurial elements, innovation training in ICPs, and effective mentoring may improve the learning outcomes related to innovative thinking skills.","Konak, Abdullah;Kulturel-Konak, Sadan;Schneider, David R.;Mehta, Khanjan",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Cornell University College of Engineering;Penn State Berks;Lehigh University,critical thinking ;  design competitions ;  entrepreneurship ;  extracurricular ;  innovation ;  student competitions
"Analysis of Vlog Transcripts using Topic Modeling, Summarizer, and Cluster Analysis","This paper demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze qualitative data for engineering education research purposes. Three NLP models are applied: topic modelling, which identifies salient keywords in text; summarizer, which extracts and concatenates sentences with unique meaning from a text; and cluster analysis, which groups texts together based on similar word sequences. The study applied these techniques to short video logs, or vlogs, collected as part of a case study of undergraduate engineering students' exposure to a social innovation curriculum. The curriculum aimed to teach students to use their engineering skills to identify and address issues that cause suffering for marginalized communities. In the vlogs, students responded to prompts asking them to describe what social issues they are passionate about, how they relate to these issues, and how they would propose exploring and addressing those issues. Vlogs were transcribed, pre-processed, and then examined with each technique to identify patterns within and across the prompts. Widely-recognized limitations of NLP techniques included the potential loss of important contextual information and the dependence on large volumes of data to produce valid and reliable results. Despite these limitations, the combination of three techniques was effective for locating high priority transcripts within the data corpus, identifying themes within and across vlogs, and supporting longitudinal analysis of student responses. Previous literature has documented the utility of topic modeling and other NLP techniques to analyze large volumes of written text on, for example, course evaluations or student writing assignments. Importantly, this study demonstrates the novel and meaningful application of topic modelling, summarizer, and cluster analysis to analyze a relatively small corpus of transcript data. Given these results, we are optimistic about the potential for NLP approaches to complement other analysis techniques and make the analysis of transcript data more efficient and feasible.","Singh, Upmanyu;Sikorski, Tiffany Rose;Wortham, Erica;Shittu, Ekundayo",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,The George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science;The George Washington University,cluster analysis ;  Natural Language Processing ;  social innovation ;  topic modeling
Development of a π-Shaped Undergraduate Curriculum Using a Curriculum Continuity Checkup Process Coupled with an Iterative Application of Kotter's Change Model,"(WIP) Engineering education is rapidly changing, motivated by deep transformations in societies and economies, accelerating evolution of student mindsets, experiential components of student training, industry needs and the increase in the variety of engineering-related occupations, response to Industry 5.0 and Healthcare 4.0, and incorporation of modern pedagogy, advanced education technologies, and future engineering education trends into curricula. A comprehensive process is required to permit engineering programs to comprehensively redesign engineering curricula in response to these internal and external transformative motivators. This paper presents a faculty-driven, data-informed, and education development-supported curriculum continuity review coupled with an iterative application of a teleological approach to comprehensively redesign an undergraduate engineering curriculum. The comprehensive redesign of a 128-credit hour, nationally-ranked biomedical engineering undergraduate program at a tier 1 U.S. research university is used as an exemplar. Initial findings are based on five iterations of Kotter's change model applied over a three-year period. Results demonstrate a comprehensively redesigned curriculum informed by qualitative and quantitative data and buy-in from multiple stakeholders, including faculty and students. Gaps, redundancies, and bottlenecks in the curriculum were defined and comprehensively addressed by creating 23 curriculum competencies, installing a new pedagogical framework consisting of four pillars - design and translational thinking, creativity and innovation, discovery and exploration, and global citizenship - vertically integrating the curriculum, and transiting the curriculum from a T-shaped to π-shaped education model.","Patrick, Charles;McShane, Michael",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering,Biomedical Engineering ;  Curriculum Redesign ;  Kotter's Change Model ;  Undergraduate
Micro-Credential Digital Badges in Engineering and Computing at an MSI: The Student's Perspective (Work in Progress),"This Work in Progress (WIP) seeks to examine Micro-Credentials (MCs) as a vehicle for an emerging transformative pedagogical movement in engineering and computing (EC) at a Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). MCs are short and concentrated, personalized, competency-based courses that allow learners to gain proof of qualification by demonstrating their mastery of skills, knowledge, and behaviors deemed essential by various stakeholders. Constant technological advances and changes have resulted in a growing interest in MCs as a means of generating new growth opportunities and addressing gaps in specific competencies and skills. MCs may not only equip students entering the EC workforce with the advanced skills needed, but also offer the transition to more successful and diverse career paths. As such, there is a need for higher education institutions to understand the potential value, explore the offerings, and consider effective MC designs. To gain a deeper understanding of students' motivations and the diverse decision-making factors behind students' decisions to enroll in MCs, this WIP employed the Expectancy-Value Theory. The authors used collaborative inquiry to investigate: (1) who MC courses appeal to and what their motivations to enroll are; (2) when these courses can be taken; (3) how MC digital badges impact the learner's career choices and professional development; and (4) the potential outcomes from acquiring an MC digital badge. The findings of this study highlighted (1) the valuable role of MCs as a vehicle for acquiring skills and competencies; (2) the varying levels of awareness and familiarity with MCs and their benefits to students; (3) the lack of integration of MCs with EC curricula; and (4) lack of dissemination of MC offerings at the academic institution. Results evinced the intrinsic value of MCs in fostering skill enhancement, professional development, and consequently career advancement. To this end, it is crucial to further examine MCs to assess their long-term feasibility and effectiveness in higher educational institutions, as well as to serve students in achieving academic and professional success.","Kayyali, Mais;Müller, Claudia Calle;McKie, Morgan H.;Kali, Maimuna Begum;Strong, Alexandra Coso;Elzomor, Mohamed",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,FIU College of Engineering and Computing;Florida International University,Engineering Education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Micro-credential Digital Badges ;  Workforce Development
Understanding Student Engagement during an Experiential Learning Task Using Eye Tracking: A Case Study,"With the increasing technological innovation, the application of technology to the STEM classroom for purposes of teaching and learning has gained importance. Research has demonstrated that many STEM concepts are abstract in nature, and students find it difficult to comprehend them fully during lectures. Therefore, using a simulated real-world environment to engage students in experiential learning can help them to learn and internalize the concepts better. In this pilot research case study, our aim was to study student engagement and cognitive load during a visual experiential learning task using eye-tracking, which is an established method of studying user engagement and cognitive load. Seven undergraduate students enrolled in an Engineering Technology course were taught the 5S framework, a Lean concept in a lecture, and then asked to analyze its real-world implementation at workplaces in a 2-part experiential learning activity, involving two pictures and a video of 5S transformation at different workplace settings. The students had to identify the changes implemented as part of 5S transformation and eye-tracking data was recorded while they performed the above analyses. Students also wrote a reflection on their learnings and completed an online survey upon completion of the activity. The study used a multi-method design to answer the following research questions: What were the engagement levels, emotions, and cognitive load experienced by the students when engaged in the visual experiential learning activity? What learning gains were reported by the students upon completion of the activity? The results of the study demonstrated that students experienced a higher level of positive emotion and low negative emotions while engaged in the learning activity. The overall cognitive load of the students was low as a whole, but results did indicate that students reported a high cognitive load for the 'performance' construct of the NASA TLX scale. The analysis of the ocular parameters obtained from the eye tracker indicated that students demonstrated the highest average fixation duration (indicator of engagement level) for the video component of the activity, followed by picture 1 and picture 2. Further, it was observed that average pupil dilation was highest for picture 1, followed by the video and picture 2. Lastly, the student reflections were qualitatively analyzed to determine the students' learning gains. The analysis revealed that students demonstrated metacognition, self-belief and acquired new knowledge as an outcome of this activity. Students also acknowledged that they acquired new knowledge by participating in the activity.Overall, the study results indicate that allowing students to participate in intentionally designed simulations can help students to understand the application of the concept in a real world-setting.","Jaiswal, Aparajita;Venkatesh, Jeevithashree;Nanda, Gaurav",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Purdue University,5S ;  cognitive load ;  engagement levels ;  Engineering technology ;  eye-tracking ;  undergraduate
Perceived Barriers and Costs Associated with Participation in Student Innovation Competitions,"Student innovation competitions and programs, hereafter called ICPs, such as hackathons, start-up incubator competitions, design challenges, boot camps, and customer discovery labs, have emerged as pipeline-builders and transformative for higher education entrepreneurial ecosystems. Moreover, ICPs foster students' STEM-based experiences and serve as a gateway for career readiness. There is a disparity in ICP participation of students underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) compared to student groups dominating STEM fields. While research supports the importance and benefits of STEM students' participation in these programs, literature discussing the students' perceptions of these programs remains limited. In order to increase diverse students' motivations for participating in ICPs and make ICPs more inclusive learning experiences for all students, this paper will answer two research questions: (i) what are the barriers that discourage student participation in ICPs, and (ii) what are the costs that associate with participation in ICPs? The primary research methodology in this paper is semi-structured interviews. Thirty-eight students (25 females vs. 13 males and 21 participants vs. 17 non-participants) were interviewed after a recruitment survey. The interview questions were crafted and analyzed based on the known scales and theories in the literature, namely the Expectancy-Value-Cost Scale and the Theory of Planned Behavior. Through student interviews, student perceptions of fitting in these co-curricular activities, i.e., ICPs, were explored, with a particular interest being students who are underrepresented in STEM. The complete recordings of the interviewee responses to interview questions were transcribed into text and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. The research findings will contribute to making the innovation ecosystem more inclusive and diverse by uncovering factors that discourage students from engaging in ICPs. Two levels of barriers were identified, institutional and individual. Institutional-level barriers include 'low program awareness' and 'lack of diversity and inclusiveness,' whereas individual barriers include 'not matching self-identity' and 'low expectancy of success.' As for costs, apart from 'opportunity cost,' 'teamwork cost' has emerged to be another important cost dimension that associates with ICP participation. The ongoing research direction is to share the findings with the STEM educators and ICP organizers so that they are aware of these barriers and costs of participating in ICPs, which might be a basis for designing and testing interventions.","Kulturel-Konak, Sadan;Leung, Ada;Konak, Abdullah",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Penn State Berks,design competitions ;  entrepreneurship ;  extracurricular ;  inclusivity ;  innovation ;  student competitions ;  underrepresented students
Gamification in the Teaching of Ecology for University Students,"Technological resources have enabled the development of new learning options in scientific education. Among these resources, gamification promotes learning through activities such as game elements, use of prizes, flagship rewards, dynamic missions, levels, and scores. Keeping students interested in learning scientific concepts can be a challenge for teachers. Therefore, the objective of the present research was to apply gamification using the Genially platform as a complement to the teaching of the Ecology subject to generate a positively impact on the learning process of students of the Department of Environmental Engineering. In this study, the students used the gamifications and completed the activities and dynamic missions focused on biodiversity, conservation, and sustainability. The research data was collected in an initial test and a final test. The results showed that gamifications for the Ecology subject improved students' grades up to 62.5% compared to the control group. The use of gamification is expected to be a tool that provides teachers with new alternatives to develop in students', professional skills such as teamwork, effective communication, research, and innovation in students.","Vera-Morales, Marcos;García, Galo Cedeño;Lucas, Veris Saldarriaga;León-Castro, Leonardo",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies on Education and Research, ICALTER 2023",2023-01-01,Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral Ecuador;Campus Politécnico El Limón,Ecology ;  Environmental Engineering ;  environnent ;  gamification ;  technologies
The New Frontier of Cybersecurity: Emerging Threats and Innovations,"In today's digitally interconnected world, cybersecurity threats have reached unprecedented levels, presenting a pressing concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. This study employs a qualitative research approach to comprehensively examine the diverse threats of cybersecurity and their impacts across various sectors. Four primary categories of threats are identified and analyzed, encompassing malware attacks, social engineering attacks, network vulnerabilities, and data breaches. The research delves into the consequences of these threats on individuals, organizations, and society at large. The findings reveal a range of key emerging threats in cybersecurity, including advanced persistent threats, ransomware attacks, Internet of Things (IoT) vulnerabilities, and social engineering exploits. Consequently, it is evident that emerging cybersecurity threats pose substantial risks to both organizations and individuals. The sophistication and diversity of these emerging threats necessitate a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. This approach should include robust security measures, comprehensive employee training, and regular security audits. The implications of these emerging threats are extensive, with potential consequences such as financial loss, reputational damage, and compromised personal information.

It highlights the significance of using strong passwords, encryption methods, and regularly updating software to bolster cyber defenses.","Dave, Daksh;Sawhney, Gauransh;Aggarwal, Pushkar;Silswal, Nitish;Khut, Dhruv",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - ICT 2023 - 29th International Conference on Telecommunications: Next-Generation Telecommunications for Digital Inclusion and Universal Access,2023-01-01,"Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai;Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani",Cybersecurity ;  Data breaches ;  Malware attacks ;  Phishing ;  Zero-day exploits
Work in Progress: Creating a 'Mechanical Engineering Teaching Community of Practice' for Faculty Learning and Sharing Pedagogical Changes and Innovation,"In this work in progress we explain the development of a process or changing the teaching culture at the department of mechanical engineering of Texas A&M. The Strategy is based on addressing (a) development of reflective teachers (b) developing shared vision (c) considering policy and (d) faculty initiated curricular innovations. Teachers were trained in lean startup (incremental innovation) approaches to educational innovation. A community of practice was developed to build trust, share learning from innovations and to develop accountability. A systematic approach is being developed to evaluate the efficacy of this change strategy especially with engaging late adopters and sceptics. Preliminary results indicate that that creating and nurturing a teaching community of practice (a part of a comprehensive change strategy) is very effective in promoting a culture of innovation in teaching.","Gao, Rujun;Hipwell, M.

Co-sharing secondary qualitative research data to understand technology adoption in engineering education courses,"This work in progress paper we explain our process of co-sharing secondary qualitative data from separate projects funded by the National Science Foundation to better understand factors which influence faculty technology adoption in engineering education and provide a high-level presentation of preliminary results. Study A conducted 21 interviews of engineering faculty at a Midwestern US, STEM-centered university. These faculty were interviewed about the factors influencing their adoption and teaching of new engineering technologies, with a focus on programming languages, software, and instrumentation. Technology adoption models were applied as a theoretical lens for results analysis. Study B conducted 9 interviews with faculty in the College of Engineering at a Southern US university on the adoption of online laboratories in their instructional settings. The interviews focused on how faculty make use of online laboratories in electrical engineering as an essential resource. Innovation and propagation theories were applied as a theoretical lens for data analysis. The two data sets were co-shared for secondary analysis by each research group, using their own theoretical approaches. Preliminary findings lead us to believe that co-sharing of secondary data can expand qualitative data sets while providing a means for theoretical triangulation, improving data analysis.","Jarvie-Eggart, Michelle;May, Dominik;Mayoki, Deborah;Carlson, Katrina;Smith, Landon",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,College of Engineering;College of Engineering;Bergische Universität Wuppertal;Michigan Technological University,engineering education ;  qualitative research ;  secondary data sharing ;  technology adoption
Using the Technology Acceptance Model to Understand Intention to Use a CS-Based Curriculum,"In the ever-evolving field of computer science (CS) education, the significance of K-12 teachers and their backgrounds have often been overshadowed by the predominant focus on students. Teachers in K-12 often lack the necessary expertise in CS and have limited support provided by existing CS-based curricula. While research on CS education effectiveness grows, limited attention has been given to the factors influencing teachers' intention to use or adoption of CS-based curricula. Prior research revealed that despite professional development and positive reactions to teaching innovations, curriculum adoption cannot be guaranteed. However, existing studies have concentrated on university-level instructors who possess extensive CS knowledge and a strong passion for teaching it. In this research study, we apply the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which factors perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude into the intention to use technology, as a framework for understanding and predicting the intention to use a CS-based curriculum among secondary mathematics graduate teacher candidates in their last quarter of student teaching. Our findings highlight the TAM as a valuable tool for evaluating teachers' attitude toward and intention to use CS-based curricula, enabling informed decision-making for future curriculum developers. Teacher candidates who expressed a negative intention to use expressed concerns regarding Teacher Knowledge, Student Understanding, and Student Resources, while those who intended to use emphasized their appreciation for Lesson Plan Content and Lesson Plan Quality. It was interesting that prominent themes in perceived ease of use, which were Lesson Plan Content and Lesson Plan Quality, differed from the most frequent themes that emerged in perceived usefulness, namely Student Understanding, Student Engagement, and Pedagogical Alternative. This contrast highlights the importance of considering multiple factors and perspectives when designing and assessing CS-based curricula, which can help curriculum developers create more inclusive CS-based curricula that address and support the diverse backgrounds of K-12 teachers.","Parham-Mocello, Jennifer;Gupta, Ayushi",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2023-01-01,Oregon State University,Computer science education ;  curriculum ;  K-12 teachers ;  Technology Acceptance Model

Soil Nutrient Analysis in Agricultural Crops,"Agriculture is an important area of research and is also considered to be a very critical area. As per the data collected from the farmer and citizens, it is found that nowadays the citizens are playing an important role in assisting farmers to provide solutions to the current system by doing research and innovation in the farming sector. The government too is providing benefits by funding the agricultural research projects which the citizens are working on. This has directly created an advantage for the farmers. Now in this research area, a lot of work has been carried out using the new hardware and software technology. This has made the farmers very easy to yield better crops. Adding to this there are other research that are being carried out on finding the quality of the soil and predicting the disease of the plant. The majority of the work carried out in the agricultural industry is by the IT industry. In the review paper, various soil nutrients are taken into account such as pH value, nitrogen content, phosphorous content, organic carbon, potassium content, and electric conductivity (salinity in the soil). The paper also focuses more on the different ML algorithms that is discussed in the last decade. On the technological front, we study more on how the farmers can be assisted in improving the crop by doing predictions using the ML technique. A novel approach has been found for performing farming in a smarter way. Also, the government provides grants to researchers to carry out innovative projects in the area of agriculture.","Aditya Pai, H.;Mahesh, T.

IoT-Based Model for Student Ability Segmentation in Higher Education: A Technology and Innovation Management Approach,"Recent surveys indicate a growing gap between college students’ comprehensive abilities and the workforce’s actual demands. Addressing this issue, our study innovatively applies Internet of Things (IoT) technology to analyze and evaluate the comprehensive abilities of college students from a management and innovation perspective. We scrutinize the essential elements of a comprehensive ability index system across multiple levels, incorporating views from teachers, students, and biological standpoints. Leveraging IoT technology, we have constructed a sophisticated topological model encompassing 22 secondary ability indicators. This model represents a breakthrough in education management, enabling a more nuanced understanding of student abilities in various disciplines. We employ principal component analysis and feature cluster analysis to establish an integrated evaluation method. This method provides a detailed assessment of student capabilities across six majors: English Translation, Mathematics and Application, Hotel Management, Advertising, Business Administration, and Educational Technology. The results, with scores ranging from 0.0992 to 2.0254, surpass the average baseline of 0, highlighting the model’s efficacy in identifying specific areas of improvement. This research is of substantial theoretical and practical importance, particularly for the enhancement of Chinese college medical education. By pinpointing the shortcomings in each major, our IoT-based model facilitates a more scientifically informed approach to student development. It underscores the potential of merging technology and innovation management in higher education, offering a strategic framework to bridge the gap between academic training and professional requirements.","Mo, Xun",Journal,Journal of Commercial Biotechnology,2023-01-01,Huaiyin Institute of Technology,biological perspective ;  cluster analysis method ;  comprehensive ability ;  integrated evaluation ;  principal component analysis ;  sub-divisional topological model

Borehole monitoring capability includes hybrid fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing for passive monitoring or for performing heat pulse tests in active mode, as well as arrays of permanently installed ERT downhole electrodes to measure subsurface electrical resistivity, enabling both in-hole and cross-hole tomography for tracking subsurface changes in 4D. Together with pressure data from downhole data loggers and monitoring of flow and heat pump/chiller operation, this provides an atscale field laboratory for evaluating the engineering and energy performance of the components of mine water geothermal systems. An initial hydrogeological and hydrochemical conceptual model has been developed using borehole, pump test and baseline monitoring data. Integrated analysis of hydrogeological, geoelectrical, thermal and geochemical data provides a much more comprehensive understanding of geothermal processes in low-temperature mine water systems. Insights gained from research undertaken during commissioning will enable science users to tailor and optimise their proposals for research and innovation at the Glasgow Observatory.","Monaghan, A.;Kuras, O.;Boon, D.;MacAllister, D.

A Study of Problem-solving Ability in Science and Technology Innovation Courses under the IPO Framework: Digital Literacy as A Mediator,"Science and technology innovation education is an important aspect of youth quality education. Promoting students' problem-solving and innovation abilities through science and technology innovation activities has become an important issue that educators need to face nowadays. Based on the input-process-outcome (IPO) framework, this paper constructed a hypothetical model of the influence mechanism of students' problem-solving ability. And we analyzed based on 1,092 survey data from a region in Wuhan, China, to verify the validity of the model. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the science and technology innovation courses (STIC) needed to be further strengthened. STIC had a significant impact on students' problem-solving ability; digital literacy as a process variable played a mediating role between the STIC and problem-solving ability, which significantly improved students' problem-solving ability.","Zhu, Zhifang;Zhang, Yi;Zhao, Sunan",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2023 International Symposium on Educational Technology, ISET 2023",2023-01-01,Central China Normal University,digital literacy ;  IPO framework ;  problem-solving ability ;  science and technology innovation courses
"Transforming Teachers' Professional Development with Technology Innovation Integration in Essuekyir, Ghana","This article provides an evaluation of teachers' technological skills enhancement, after adapting teacher professional development training, while integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) innovations into teaching methodologies in Essuekyir, a rural community in Ghana. The availability of training for teachers in Essuekyir was made feasible by deploying the Internet Backpack, a secure mobile broadband Internet connectivity tool which can be used to connect to the Internet with or without Wi-Fi or cellular network access. The Internet Backpack provides an immediate connectivity solution that allows users to be able to communicate from almost any location. The online learning resources provided by the Ghanaian Ministry of Education, at no cost, now accessible in rural Essuekyir, previously were mainly accessible by schools and teachers in urban areas. Our research finds that in Essuekyir, as an Internet connectivity device, the Internet Backpack effectively facilitates community Internet access for teachers as they learn how to adapt and use online learning systems for their, and their students, digital inclusion.","Appiah-Okyere, Jane A.;Taana Smith, Danielle;Kwaa-Aidoo, Ephrem K.;McKnight, Lee W.;Osae, Erika Mamley",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference, GHTC 2023",2023-01-01,"School of Information Studies;University of Professional Studies, Accra;Syracuse University;University of Education",Digital Inclusion ;  Educational Attainment ;  Ghana ;  Internet Backpack ;  Teacher Training
Towards a Foundation for Intelligent Contracts,"This article investigates the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within LegalTech. We define an ontology to form the basis for Trustworthy AI processing of contract automation. The value of our research is that it applies an ontology, as existing tool, in contract automation. Two perspectives are emphasized: communications analysis and risk analysis. They are explored under a new prism. Our context is Intelligent Contracts (iContracts), which aim at reducing the time-consuming and often complex contractual process by minimizing human involvement. Contract communications and risk analysis processes are often neglected in automation. Therefore, our research investigates to what extent is possible to design an ontology for contract automation based upon the combination of both. Our methodology is twofolded. First, we concentrate on applying key word search on an online database to demonstrate the lack of available solutions. Second, we develop an ontology based upon a case study of a freelancer agreement. Of course, we use existing literature to further engineer the ontology. Our finding shows that 9.4 percent of LegalTech solutions deal with contract automation. From them, 0.7 percent focus on communications and risk automation for contracting. The conceptual expressiveness of the ontology is validated with research to the use case. A follow-up discussion suggests that the ontology should be further engineered from a third perspective, trustworthiness, and should be re-validated experimentally. Our conclusion underlines the need for further innovation in contract automation, especially in relation to communications and risk data.","Stathis, Georgios;Trantas, Athanasios;Biagioni, Giulia;van den Herik, Jaap;Custers, Bart;Daniele, Laura;Katsigiannis, Theofilos",Conference Proceeding,International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence,2023-01-01,Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek- TNO;Universiteit Leiden,Artificial Intelligence ;  Contract Automation ;  Intelligent Contracts ;  LegalTech ;  Ontology Engineering ;  Preventive/Proactive Law ;  Trustworthy AI
Transitioning to the Digital Generation: An Examination of the GIGA Initiative (2019-) and Usage Patterns of Educational Smartphone Apps: A Case Study of Anonymous Students' Learning in the COVID-19 Vortex,"To achieve the realization of the Global and Innovation Gateway for All (GIGA) initiative (2019), proposed in December 2019 by the Primary and Secondary Education Planning Division of the Elementary and Secondary Education Bureau of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, a movement has emerged to utilize information and communication technology (ICT) in the field of education. The history of ICT education in Japan dates back to the 100 Schools Project (1994), which aimed to provide network access environments, and the New 100 Schools Project (1997), which marked the beginning of full-scale ICT education in Japan. However, Japan continues to face a social issue, namely, the serious shortage of digital human resources; simultaneously, the new curriculum guidelines have started to make programming compulsory in elementary and junior high schools in order to enhance digital literacy. Accordingly, the GIGA initiative (2019) - a policy to distribute one tablet terminal to every elementary and junior high school student in Japan - and online classes have been rapidly promoted following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this paper, we discuss the usage dynamics of smartphone-based learning applications among young people (analyzing data from January-September 2020) and their current status. Further, the results are summarized and future research topics and issues are discussed. The results show that there are situations in which ICT learning environments can be effectively utilized and others in which they cannot, depending on the differences between digital students and analog students who utilize ICT in their studies; this indicates that we are currently in a transition to a generation of digital natives. ICT education has both advantages and disadvantages, and it is expected that it will be used in combination with conventional educational methods while assessing the characteristics of ICT education in the future. The dataset used in this study is an online survey conducted in February 2021 on Android smartphone users with prior permission from Fuller, Inc. and the laboratory of Professor Tadamasa Kimura. The data was obtained in a form that does not allow the identification of any single individual. The survey responses are based on the user's own judgment, and the results of the survey are presented here with the consent of the user to analyze the combination of smartphone log data and survey responses.","Kawahata, Yasuko",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2023 22nd IEEE/WIC International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, WI-IAT 2023",2023-01-01,Rikkyo University,Digital Natives ;  Extracurricular Learning ;  GIGA Initiative ;  ICT Education ;  Smartphone Applications
Art Critically Examining Generative AI,"In the rapidly evolving world of generative artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial to exercise our human capacity for critical analysis of that technology. The CRAiEDL STEAM Collective brings together emerging artists, engineers, ethicists, academics, and makers to leverage art as a unique lens to critically examine technology and (re)evaluate its meaning and function in the world. In this paper, we report on our experiences using STEAM and research-creation methodologies in a pilot study that produced two critical artworks co-created with generative AI tools: ""Calibrating Stretched Transparency"", which explores biases inherent to decision-making tools used in large-scale technopolitical climate projects, and ""I'm Honoured To Serve"", which examines the seductive design of digital environments that generate user data for profit. This pilot research project demonstrated the value and effectiveness of using art and research-creation in a STEAM context to critically examine the rapidly evolving world of technology, including generative AI, and the role of arts and humanities in responsible AI innovation. The overall project resulted in a reconfiguring of each member's understanding of the potential for STEAM to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries to produce a new type of expertise (i.e., STEAM expertise) and new knowledge (e.g., a critical STEAM-informed perspective on voice-based AI assistants, in the case of ""I'm Honoured To Serve"").","Rodier, Chantal;Millar, Jason;Deisinger, Willem;Hodgson, Sarah Jasmine",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE IFEES World Engineering Education Forum and Global Engineering Deans Council: Convergence for a Better World: A Call to Action, WEEF-GEDC 2023 - Proceedings",2023-01-01,University of Ottawa,AI ;  critical artmaking ;  Engineering Education ;  ethics ;  generative AI ;  research-creation ;  STEAM ;  STEAM education

Laboratory of Social Innovation in Water Engineering and its effect on the provision of drinking water service in rural areas and marginalized urban areas,"The provision of drinking water service in rural areas and marginalized urban areas is a challenge, mainly due to the dispersion that communities and the environment where they are located due to their isolation and difficult access. Data from the United Nations Organization indicate that 884 million people in the world and approximately 7 million in Mexico do not have access to drinking water. On average, only 75% of homes in rural areas receive drinking water through a pipe.Among the benefits provided by this service are the increase in well-being and the development of economic activities.Aware of the importance of prioritizing the supply of drinking water, particularly in vulnerable areas, the laboratory for social innovation in water engineering emerged in this institution with the purpose of designing, building, and sustainably operating drinking water supply systems.This paper presents the results of the impact of the innovation laboratory on students to design a water pipeline, from a nearby source of supply to a community that lacks drinking water supply. The results show the development of disciplinary and transversal competences to achieve significant learning in water sustainability.","Toriz, Elizabeth;Garcia, Andres;Aparicio, Marcelino;Diaz, Juan Manuel",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE IFEES World Engineering Education Forum and Global Engineering Deans Council: Convergence for a Better World: A Call to Action, WEEF-GEDC 2023 - Proceedings",2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Sociedad Interactiva de Capacitación y Educación Para El Desarrollo Sustentanble;Sociedad Interactiva de Capacitación y Educación Para El Desarrollo Sustentable,Clean water and sanitation ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education in engineering ;  Laboratory of social innovation in water engineering ;  Sustainable use of water
Challenge-Based Learning and the Industry Liaison as Educational Partners,"In today's rapidly changing world, educational institutions have the responsibility and commitment of preparing young professionals with the knowledge and skills to solve problems that do not exist with tools that have not yet been invented. In response to this challenge, our university has recently implemented its new educational model based on four pillars: Challenge-Based Learning (CBL), flexibility in when and where the learning experience takes place, inspiring trained faculty, and a memorable educational experience. The objective of CBL is to develop students' competencies by engaging them in real-life contexts to solve real-life problems. In this educational model, industry plays a relevant role as training partners, also known as educational partners at our university, by providing a real context with a real need and guiding students along the challenge-solving process. This study describes the liaison process to plan and implement the university-industry collaboration for each engineering course. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this work analyses the experience and impact of engaging industry and external organizations as educational partners within engineering courses of different engineering programs at three different campuses of our university.

"Development of disciplinary and transversal skills in Biotechnology Engineering students, through the first interactive plant culture laboratory as a part of the Semilla Museum in the state of Chihuahua","Nowadays, the incorporation of real projects in real enterprises is crucial to the best academic preparation and best achievement of students. This paper compares the final grades of two different academic models used by one of the most important private universities in Mexico, Tecnologico de Monterrey on the same subject. One of the academic models is based on the use of a ""formed partner""who provides a real problem, called a challenge, in a real context. The other academic model is based on traditional instruction in classes given by a professor in a classroom. In this research, a mixed-type evaluation was carried out, and qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Six groups from both different educational models previously mentioned were tested. For the qualitative part, the opinion of the students was obtained in a survey. Most of the students agreed by mentioning that the social service project was highly relevant, that it helped their learning, and that it resulted in a benefit to the community. For the quantitative part, students' final averages were compared to establish if the student's performance was better in any of the two educational models. The results showed that there was statistical evidence to affirm that the academic achievement of students under the Tec21 educational model is significantly higher than the student achievement in the Tec20 model (p-value 0.00). Likewise, there was no difference between the final average grades of the 4 groups from Tec20, and between the final grades of 2 groups from the Tec21 educational model (p-value 0.780). The importance of carrying out projects to improve students' performance was demonstrated and even, in this particular kind of social service project to develop social awareness.","Reyna, Josefina Castillo;Barriga, C.

Art as Reinforcement for the Decision to Study Engineering: a STEAM case of Challenge-based Learning,"This research investigates the impact of the integration of Art into a challenge-based STEM curriculum - forming a STEAM approach - on engineering students' career commitment and major selection at a private Mexican university. Our goal was to study the impact of this integration while they were sophomores and under a general education curriculum. We performed descriptive, correlational statistics and data clustering of the answers to a digital optional survey that collected the student's perceived outcomes from the STEAM Challenge entitled ""Sound, Engineering and Art"". Our research findings demonstrate that such integration significantly reinforces students' commitment to engineering as a career, and their choice of major within the field. A noteworthy 98% of the participants reported active engagement in the STEAM Challenge, leading to increased confidence in their decision to study engineering (72%) and their selection of majors (65%). Moreover, 80% of students perceived the incorporation of art in the challenge positively, suggesting its potential to sustain student interest, and lower the dropout rates. Even though 91% of participants expressed certainty in pursuing engineering, only 75% were sure about their major, underlining the potential of STEAM challenges in helping students refine their academic, and career paths. Cluster analysis further highlighted the significant influence of students' experience during the challenge on their perception and subsequent decision to study engineering. These findings contribute to the understanding of the factors in students' career choice, while having significant implications for the design of engineering curricula and strategies for student retention in engineering programs.","Mena-Aviles, Elizabeth;Ruelas-Mejia, Jorge Arturo;Barcenas-Cardenas, Miguel;Camacho-Zuniga, Claudia",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE IFEES World Engineering Education Forum and Global Engineering Deans Council: Convergence for a Better World: A Call to Action, WEEF-GEDC 2023 - Proceedings",2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,career decision making ;  Challenge-based learning ;  educational innovation ;  engineering dropout rate ;  higher education ;  STEAM education
Enhancing mathematics education through AI Chatbots in a Flipped Learning Environment,"Current work reports the implementation of a flipped learning activity with the assistance of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot to provide insights into how AI can be used to enhance learning outcomes. AI chatbots have the potential to revolutionize education, including engineering education; however, their accelerated development has raised concern among the academic community, leading in some cases to restrict their use. This reaction often stems from the perception that AI chatbots could threaten the current educational paradigm or undermine academic integrity and learning outcomes. Through action research, we explored how the use of Bing Chat could enhance a flipped learning collaborative activity within a Mathematics for Decision-making course. The activity was implemented with 32 students in a private Mexican institution who solved a task for verifying the completion of the home assignment and fostering the discussion inside the classroom. Our data consisted of these solutions, as well as an individual reflection on the usefulness of Bing Chat and its effectiveness in aiding the completion of the task. We conducted a quantitative analysis, through the descriptive statistics of the grades obtained in such task, and a qualitative analysis, through the text mining of the individual reflections. Part of the analysis focused on determining whether interacting with the chatbot encouraged students' development of critical thinking skills by using, analyzing, and evaluating the chatbot's and their own performance. This research is particularly relevant to STEM education, where technological proficiency is a key skill and an AI chatbot can potentially enhance students' autonomous and active learning, as well as foster the development of their critical thinking skills.","Martinez-Tellez, Reyna;Camacho-Zuniga, Claudia",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE IFEES World Engineering Education Forum and Global Engineering Deans Council: Convergence for a Better World: A Call to Action, WEEF-GEDC 2023 - Proceedings",2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Bing Chat ;  ChatGPT ;  Critical Thinking ;  Educational Innovation ;  Flipped Learning ;  Mathematics

Abstract Beyond the Pedagogical Illusion? Historical-Comparative Reflections on the Impact History of Moral Education of Children and Adolescents,"This article can be broken down into two parts, perhaps somewhat unequally as far as its orientation is concerned. In the first part, the author takes the reader on a kind of exploration of the history of moral education, a subject which, at first glance and from the perspective of the years he spent studying educational historiography, appears to be rather undeveloped terrain. Since the piece is related to the awarding of the Comenius Medal, Comenius himself already provides a good starting point for this round of studies. As in the case of Herbart, another classic within the canon of educational history, Comenius held the opinion that morality plays a key role in upbringing of young people, which became increasingly scintillating in appearance from the Enlightenment onwards. For in a well-regulated society, it was by means of upbringing and education that individual freedom could be created. However, in the course of the 20th century and to the shame of humanity, people were forced to witness how the idea that people and society could be shaped by social engineering could equally give rise to a lack of freedom, as the aberrations of Nazism, fascism and ultimately Marxism-Leninism unequivocally demonstrated. So can such “reversals” of modern-day thought ultimately teach us any overall lessons about the content, manner and results with which moral curricula are imposed? Or must we first set out to identify the “abnormal” cases that society first branded as such and only subsequently extract those lessons? In other words, can extraordinary situations and events teach us something about the everyday reality of moral education as manifested in the so-called “civilising offensive” that took place from the end of the 18th century onwards? As far as the Low Countries are concerned, the author is, for that matter, setting foot on familiar ground. By utilising previous research on Belgium, Flanders and the (Belgian) Congo, the second part of the article wastes no time in examining what moral education meant in more specific terms in the 20th century. In that regard, the focus not only lies on contextualising the insights and questions raised by the first part, as a “tour d’horizon”, but equally on analysing them in greater depth. After all, the author’s years of research already provide three interesting points of reference: 1) the strong continuity of the patronising perspective; 2) the problematic nature of thinking about educational innovations and didactic innovations in binary terms, such as “old” and “new”, and 3) the lack of a straightforward link between parenting and educational goals on the one hand and their results and effects (including and especially in the long term) on the other. Which leads inevitably to the conclusion that education, important as it is, must not be overestimated. Nor should history for that matter. Perhaps both are nothing more than an opportunity to partake of a meaningful encounter that may be effective, but whose outcome one can never be sure of. Which in turn does not take away from the fact that we must still place our hopes on it. For hope is probably the most positive thing that human beings carry within them, just as Comenius himself proved in his lifetime, by the way.","Depaepe, Marc",Journal,Historia Scholastica,2023-01-01,Latvijas Universitāte;KU Leuven,18th-20th centuries ;  character formation ;  effects of education and upbringing ;  identity and/or personality education ;  impact history ;  moral education ;  morality ;  Western Europe

Biogenesis and Green Synthesis of Metal Nanoparticles and Their Pharmacological Applications,"Nanomaterial innovation is the primary catalyst of advancement in nanotechnology. Although there are many known chemical processes for creating nanoparticles that use harmful substances, it is now more important than ever to use processes that are safer, greener, and more environmentally friendly. The goal of research in this field is to use diverse life forms as ""nanoparticle factories."" Phytochemicals can convert salt into the appropriate nanoparticles thanks to their regular biosynthetic routes. In recent years, green chemistry methods for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles have emerged as a fresh and exciting area of study. Metal nanoparticles, including gold (Au), silver (Ag), iron (Fe), and cadmium (Cd) along with certain oxides, can be synthesized using a variety of chemical and physical techniques as well as biological techniques carried out using plants. It has been discovered that methods involving plant-mediated synthesis are a more efficient and cost-effective way to create these metal nanoparticles. The plant-mediated nanoparticles are used as potential pharmaceutical agents for many diseases, including hepatitis, cancer, malaria, and HIV. Due to the higher efficacy and fewer side effects of nanodrugs compared to other commercial cancer drugs, the synthesis of nanoparticles targeting biological pathways has gained tremendous popularity. This review paper aims to cover the different green methods for the biogenesis of these nanoparticles, the different compounds and salts used, and the metals obtained. Ultimately, the significance and prospects of these metal nanoparticles especially in the fields of medicine, pharmacology, drug designing, and drug delivery engineering will also be commented on.","Ghosh, Ahana;Pappuswamy, Manikantan;Chaudhary, Aditi;Meyyazhagan, Arun;Arumugam, Vijaya Anand;Balasubramanian, Balamuralikrishnan;Meganathan, Gomathy",Journal,Plant Science Today,2023-01-01,Christ University;Sejong University;Bharathiar University,Biotechnology ;  Green synthesis ;  Nanoparticles ;  Pharmacological ;  Phytochemicals
Research and Practice on the Talent Evaluation Model of the First-class Undergraduate Major in Network Engineering for Emerging engineering,"In view of the continuous quality improvement of network engineering education in the context of emerging engineering, we propose a talent evaluation method in the field of network engineering based on deep reinforcement learning with time windows.

Research on the Impact of Implicit Contracts on User Knowledge Contribution in Open Innovation Communities,"Open innovation communities (OICs) have been expanding the scope of enterprises' innovation activities, and their effective functioning hinges on the ongoing knowledge contributions from users. However, the research on the impact of contractual governance mechanisms on users' knowledge-contribution behaviors has yet to be further explored. In this study, we provide a comprehensive definition of implicit contracts in OICs, clarify their dimensions, investigate their impact on users' knowledge contribution, and explore how users' network positions moderate these effects. Subsequently, we employ a questionnaire survey combined with web crawling to collect user data and empirically test the theoretical hypotheses. The results demonstrate that both user-user implicit contracts (i.e., user reciprocity, user trust, and user recognition) and user-community implicit contracts (i.e., community incentives, community trust, and community support) significantly and positively affect user knowledge contribution. Furthermore, users' structural holes exert a significant positive moderating effect on these relationships. Notably, the moderating effect of network centrality is only significant in the influence of user-community implicit contracts, and not significant in the relationship between user-user implicit contracts and user knowledge contribution. The insights derived from this study offer valuable practical guidance for effectively operating and managing OICs.","Lu, Xinyuan;Meng, Hua;Wang, Xuelin",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,Central China Normal University,implicit contract ;  knowledge contribution ;  network centrality ;  network position ;  Open innovation community (OIC) ;  structural holes ;  user behavior
Cyber-Bullying Detection for Multimodal Data Convolutional Neural Network with Butterfly Optimisation,"Social media platforms are seeing an increase in the issue of cyberbullying, which has both immediate and long-term impacts on its victims. The development of automated systems that employ by using machine learning to recognise instances of cyberbullying and the actors involved, such as victims and perpetrators, has been the focus of research to solve this issue. The methods in this expanding body of work were systematic reviews that have already been investigated, but the computational aspects have an emphasis on technical innovation, features of engineering, or optimisation performance rather than focusing on the goals, conceptions, aspirations, or human expectations. In this research, we provide a systematic literature for a human-centred evaluation of the work done over the previous ten years to detect automated cyberbullying. Seven machine learning classifiers, including the convolutional neural network and butterfly optimisation (BO), were also used in this study. The accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and time consumption of each of these techniques were utilised in the classification to determine when to apply the recognition rates to the whole text and image dataset. The experimental results show how effective our proposed convolutional neural network with butterfly optimisation (CNN + BO) algorithm is, with a median accuracy of roughly 94.61% for text, 91.16% for images, and 89.45% for info graphs. In addition, we demonstrate that the results of our approach are significantly better in terms of sensitivity, precision, and time consumption. In this work, we demonstrate how user context influences the detection of online bullying.","Sivanantham, Kalimuthu;Vijaykumar, V.

Design method of key parameters of gas reservoir engineering for complex reservoir type underground gas storages,"The underground gas storages (hereinafter referred to as UGSs) rebuilt from oil and gas reservoirs in China are characterized by great burial depth, complex structures, poor reservoir physical properties, and strong heterogeneity. The UGS construction targets in China involve complex types, such as complex fault blocks, strong water invasion, abnormal pressure, and high oil content condensate gas reservoir, so conventional gas reservoir engineering parameter design methods are not applicable, and especially there are some special requirements for trap sealing analysis, storage capacity parameter design, and injection–production capacity evaluation. Focusing on these difficulties, this paper carries out independent innovation and technological bottleneck breakthrough. Beginning with the geological characteristics of UGS construction targets, the four-dimensional dynamic sealing evaluation technology for complex fault block UGSs is developed, and the storage capacity prediction method for abnormal pressure UGSs and the zonal multi-factor coupled injection and production capacity prediction model for water invasion UGSs are established. In addition, the new condensate gas-reservoir UGS construction model of ""Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)–collaboration–gas storage"" and the optimized technical strategies are demonstrated. And the following research results are obtained. First, physical simulation experiments reveal the fatigue damage and fault slip mechanisms in the cap rocks of complex fault block UGSs, so as to enable the quantitative evaluation of dynamic sealing indicators, which lays an importation foundation for the site selection of complex fault block UGSs. Second, in view that the rocks of ultra-high-pressure fractured UGSs exhibit strong stress sensitivity, a new effective storage capacity prediction method considering compressibility coefficient change and bound water expansion is established, and a multi-cycle injection and production capacity prediction method considering cycle time change and water invasion is formed for different zones of strong water invasion UGSs, so as to achieve a scientific design of UGS construction parameters. Third, a new model of condensate gas reservoir EOR collaborated with UGS construction is established, the rational transition timing of ""EOR–collaboration–gas storage"" is determined, and the staged UGS construction parameter design method and the well pattern deployment strategies are prepared. In conclusion, the proposed design method of key parameters in gas reservoir engineering of complex oil- and gas-reservoir UGSs provides a powerful support for Sinopec's construction and operation of complex oil- and gas-reservoir UGSs, and has a good guiding role in the construction of similar UGSs.","Zeng, Daqian;Zhang, Guangquan;Yang, Xiaosong;Jia, Yuewei;Zhu, Sinan;Wang, Zhibao;Zhang, Junfa;Mi, Lidong;Tian, Hongwei;Qin, Yufu",Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2023-01-01,Sinopec,Abnormal pressure ;  Collaboration ;  Complex fault blocks ;  Dynamic sealing performance ;  Injection and production capacity ;  Storage capacity parameters ;  Underground gas storage ;  Water invasion

"Reflexive, relevant and interactive: a STEM student-centred pedagogical approach for responsible research and innovation (RRI) training in higher education","Background: Whilst Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) principles are increasingly informing and shaping Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) research narratives and practices, the training of higher education (HE) STEM students in RRI is still developing, creating a mismatch between training provision and sector practices and expectations. Purpose: Training of HE STEM students in RRI principles is a key component of the long-term changes RRI frameworks hope to achieve. However, little is known about postgraduate (PG) students’ awareness of, perceptions of and attitudes towards RRI, despite the pedagogical implications. This paper offers grounded insights and recommendations to shape this emerging area of pedagogical research and practice. Sample: Forty-nine PG STEM students with a range of nationalities enrolled in six UK higher education institutions. Most students had not received prior formal RRI training, although a small number of students who had received some RRI training were selected for comparative purposes. Design and methods: An exploratory, small-scale student-led, mixed-methods study that investigated PG STEM students’ engagements with RRI. Key objectives were to assess awareness and knowledge base; explore attitudes towards RRI; gauge the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RRI engagement; identify student preferences in relation to RRI training. Results: The data points to the importance of individual characteristics and cultural backgrounds in shaping students’ engagement with RRI, as well as the significance of the context of student engagement with RRI. Although generally unaware of formal RRI frameworks, respondents provided examples of RRI that were drawn from national/cultural contexts. The perceived relevance of RRI varied with training level (Masters’ or PhD). A preference for interactive training in RRI was expressed, with some students commenting on the challenge of becoming reflexive practitioners. Conclusions: This study provides important evidence to inform the pedagogical approach to RRI in HE STEM training, which the authors argue ought to be supported, reflexive, relevant, and interactive.","Brahic, Bénédicte A.M.;Miao, Shijie;Webb, Simon J.;Harvey, Alison G.",Journal,Research in Science and Technological Education,2023-01-01,Faculty of Science and Engineering;Manchester Metropolitan University;The University of Manchester,Higher education ;  postgraduate science courses ;  Responsible Research and Innovation ;  Student-centred pedagogy

Carbon nanotube nanocomposite scaffolds: advances in fabrication and applications for tissue regeneration and cancer therapy,"Carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite scaffolds have emerged as highly promising frameworks for tissue engineering research. By leveraging their intrinsic electrical conductivity and valuable mechanical properties, CNTs are commonly dispersed into polymers to create robust, electrically conductive scaffolds that facilitate tissue regeneration and remodeling. This article explores the latest progress and challenges related to CNT dispersion, functionalization, and scaffold printing techniques, including electrospinning and 3D printing. Notably, these CNT scaffolds have demonstrated remarkable positive effects across various cell culture systems, stimulating neuronal growth, promoting cardiomyocyte maturation, and facilitating osteocyte differentiation. These encouraging results have sparked significant interest within the regenerative medicine field, including neural, cardiac, muscle, and bone regenerations. However, addressing the concern of CNT cytotoxicity in these scaffolds remains critical. Consequently, substantial efforts are focused on exploring strategies to minimize cytotoxicity associated with CNT-based scaffolds. Moreover, researchers have also explored the intriguing possibility of utilizing the natural cytotoxic properties of CNTs to selectively target cancer cells, opening up promising avenues for cancer therapy. More research should be conducted on cutting-edge applications of CNT-based scaffolds through phototherapy and electrothermal ablation. Unlike drug delivery systems, these novel methodologies can combine 3D additive manufacturing with the innate physical properties of CNT in response to electromagnetic stimuli to efficiently target localized tumors. Taken together, the unique properties of CNT-based nanocomposite scaffolds position them as promising candidates for revolutionary breakthroughs in both regenerative medicine and cancer treatment. Continued research and innovation in this area hold significant promise for improving healthcare outcomes.","Shar, Andy;Shar, Angela;Joung, Daeha",Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2023-01-01,Virginia Commonwealth University Health System;University of Florida College of Medicine;Virginia Commonwealth University,3D printing ;  cancer therapy ;  carbon nanotube ;  conductive scaffold ;  regenerative medicine ;  tissue engineering
Football and the video assistant referee: A grounded theory approach,"Few studies have examined the impact of technological officiating aids on football. The purpose of this study is to design a comprehensive model examining the use of video assistant referee (VAR) technology in football. Based on interviews with eminent sports experts, this study explores the use of VAR technology in football and provides a paradigm model. Data analysis was based on the continuous comparison method during three stages of open, axial and selective coding. The findings point to the ability of a referee to make an informed decision regarding an incident during a match and trends suggest continuing adoption of new technologies in decision support systems. In the model, causal conditions (e.g. rules and regulations, innovation in football) attract attention to the axial phenomenon (i.e. application of VAR technology to football) and strategies for its use (e.g. Total Quality Management, justice, increasing referee supervision) given the interfering factors (e.g. fair play, competition) and existing contexts (e.g. control of anti-football behaviours, referee performance, information technology, IT, control of violence and aggression), which create consequences (i.e. process weakness, slowing down the game, passion killing, increasing the quality of the referee’s decision, increasing referee confidence, economical, increasing decision-making accuracy). Therefore, given the contextual conditions and the intervening factors, implementing VAR technology should improve the quality of football competitions. The research concludes that VAR has the potential to enhance the quality of football competitions but also acknowledges the need to address its negative impacts and ensure sustainable development.","Pashaie, Sajjad;Dickson, Geoff;Abdavi, Fatemeh;Badri Azarin, Yaqhub;Golmohammadi, Hamed;Zheng, Jinming;Habibpour, Romina",Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part P: Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology",2023-01-01,La Trobe Business School;Cumhuriyet Üniversitesi;University of Tabriz;Nanyang Technological University;Charkhe Nilofari Azerbaijan Education Institute,decision support technologies ;  soccer ;  sport officials ;  technological officiating aids ;  total quality management ;  Video assistant referee
Rethinking value creation: Value innovation for sustainability transitions,"Business models for sustainability transitions is an emerging research field that investigates the roles of firm activities in contributing to much-needed fundamental, societal shifts to more sustainable modes of production and consumption. In an attempt to make this field more accessible to business practitioners, this paper reframes 'contributing to' in the more familiar, value-centered language of business model design, and positions the sustainability transition process itself as a stakeholder of the firm from a business model perspective, thereby suggesting that firms can 'propose, create, capture, or destroy value' for sustainability transitions. Doing so presents new opportunities for value innovation (business model innovation by rethinking the firm's value proposition) for firms within sustainability transitions. The Resilience of Sustainability Transitions framework is used as a starting point for understanding transition resilience as a form of value for the transition process. This conceptualization of value for the transition highlights ways for firms to support and facilitate transitions beyond the current standard of developing and commercializing radical, sustainable innovations. Value creation by addressing resilience requirements, as suggested in this paper, is therefore a way for risk-shy, but politically powerful, incumbent firms to contribute positively to sustainability transitions without having to face the potential competency disruption often associated with radical innovation.","Venter, Karen;De Kock, Imke",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Engineering, Technology, and Innovation: Shaping the Future, ICE 2023",2023-01-01,Stellenbosch University,business models ;  incumbent firms ;  sustainability transitions ;  value innovation

Efficient Solvers for Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations in Computational Fluid Dynamics,"Improving the computational efficiency of solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) is a key area of focus for this research, which has the ability to significantly impact computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The complexities of fluid flow phenomena can be difficult for traditional methods to handle, leading to simulations that are resource-intensive and computationally slow. The urgent requirement for improved computational tools capable of quickly and precisely simulating complex fluid dynamics scenarios is the driving force behind the significance of this research. New approaches are needed to solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which are characterized by turbulent flows, fluid-structure interactions, and high computing resource intensity. Adaptive mesh optimization and high-performance computing architectures are combined in the AMO-HPI technique, which provides a strategic solution. Adaptive Mesh Optimization based on High-Performance Integration (AMO-HPI) is suggested in this research as a way to improve the accuracy of solutions by focusing computational resources on regions of interest through adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Making effective use of shared-memory parallelism and message-passing interfaces (MPI) to divide up computational tasks. Improvements in engineering system performance, reliability, and safety can be achieved by the effective simulation of fluid dynamics processes, which opens up new design areas that were previously unreachable. When compared to other methods, AMO-HPI performs better in simulations due to its optimal resource utilization and decreased processing time. In addition to improving CFD methodology, this research could have far-reaching effects on engineering design processes in several industries, which would be great for innovation and sustainable development.","Mishra, Nidhi",Journal,Advances in Nonlinear Variational Inequalities,2023-01-01,Kalinga University,Computational ;  Differential ;  Dynamics ;  Equations ;  Fluid ;  High-Performance ;  Integration ;  Mesh ;  Nonlinear ;  Optimization ;  Partial

Exploring the Ethical and Societal Concerns of Generative AI in Internet of Things (IoT) Environments,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two rapidly evolving technologies that have the potential to revolutionise many aspects of our lives today. Generative AI, a subset of AI technologies, has a unique ability to create and manipulate content based on patterns learned from vast datasets, and when combined with the interconnected nature of IoT devices, they hold great promise across industries. Leveraging deep learning capabilities, Generative AI can intelligently analyze and apply the vast amounts of data generated from the internet to optimize operations and drive innovation. However, the potential integration of Generative AI and IoT systems in the future could raise notable ethical and societal concerns. These may encompass worries about privacy, security risks, biases and fairness challenges, lack of autonomy and human control, and emerging issues like the lack of ethical content creation. Given the relatively new nature of Generative AI technologies, this paper explores the ethical and societal concerns that may arise should Generative AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) environments integrate. By shedding light on these ethical and societal concerns, this research seeks to stimulate a nuanced understanding of the critical balance between technological advancement and responsible deployment, guiding stakeholders towards an ethically sound integration of Generative AI within IoT ecosystems.","Chimbga, Bridget",Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2023-01-01,University of Pretoria;Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR),Artificial Intelligence ;  Generative AI ;  Internet of Things

Intelligent design path of Huayao cross-stitch patterns based on style characteristics,"Ethnic patterns, a kind of visual symbols with unique representation forms and symbolic connotations, serve as a nation’s unique marks in terms of its historical background, social environment, production and life, ideas and beliefs, presenting distinct regional and national characteristics. The Huayao ethnic group is a small branch of the Yao nationality, with a time-honored history and rich culture of thousands of years. Huayao cross-stitch is a unique artistic form of folk handicraft owned by the Huayao people as well as a “living carrier” of Huayao people’s everlasting national culture. Huayao cross-stitch patterns, aesthetically appealing with rich cultural implications, hold evolutionary records of the development and change of Huayao national culture. The innovative design of Huayao cross-stitch patterns is one of the most effective ways to activate the inner vitality of Huayao culture. At present, the active use of intelligent technology to inherit and innovate ethnic patterns is a hot topic among the scholarly community under the background of deep integration of culture and technology. In this way, the design cycle can be greatly shortened and pattern forms can be significantly enriched, which opens up unlimited creative space for the innovative design of ethnic patterns. However, the majority of existing research on the intelligent generation of ethnic patterns focuses on the use of intelligent technology, and there are few attempts regarding an in-depth exploration of the style characteristics of ethnic patterns. This paper explored the forms and methods of the intelligent generation of Huayao cross-stitch patterns based on retaining their style characteristics. Firstly, the descriptions of style characteristics of Huayao cross-stitch patterns were collected and semantically summarized by using Kansei engineering experiments and questionnaires or surveys. Typical factors determining style characteristics were extracted through importance evaluation and statistical analysis. Then, the extracted factors were analyzed and summarized into four dimensions in terms of style characteristics: composition, modeling, semantics and stitches, based on which, the setting and conversion of intelligent design forms of Huayao cross-stitch patterns were carried out. Finally, the deep learning network algorithm learning was carried out by constructing the main patterns of Huayao cross-stitch and the stick figure image data set to generate the patterns with Huayao cross-stitch style characteristics. According to the data characteristics of the outer contour of Huayao cross-stitch patterns, the contour detection filling module and the shape module were then introduced, and a novel model structure named “HYCycleGAN” was proposed to intelligently generate the main patterns of Huayao cross-stitch, and then the intelligent design practice was carried out with accordance with the preset pattern organization forms to generate an adjustable auxiliary design scheme. In this paper, from the perspective of the continuation of the style characteristics of Huayao cross-stitch patterns, the intelligent generation interactive system of Huayao cross-stitch patterns was constructed through the recognition and extraction of factors with Huayao cross-stitch style characteristics and by the conversion and setting of design forms, and by the selection and optimization of feasible intelligent design methods. With the help of this system, users can freely set a canvas size, a composition mode and input the main patterns and select the filling patterns to generate new cross-stitch patterns. The design generation experiment was carried out and its priority degree was then evaluated, aiming at optimizing the path of intelligent design and providing new ideas for the intelligent design method of ethnic patterns. Extraction and retaining of the style characteristics of Huayao cross-stitch patterns is the basis and key to the design transformation and cultural innovation of Huayao culture. Huayao cross-stitch patterns boast characteristics and values beyond multiple dimensions of form, behavior and spirit. Therefore, the extraction of the style characteristics of Huayao cross-stitch patterns needs a much more solid field investigation and data collection from a holistic and systematic perspective in order to expand the breadth and depth of the current research. Besides, there is still room for expanding the expression forms and application scenarios in the exploration of intelligent design forms, which is also the research focus of the next stage.","Chen, Junchun;Ji, Tie;Peng, Jian;Wang, Bin",Journal,Journal of Silk,2023-01-01,Hunan University;Central South University,ethnic pattern ;  folk handicrafts ;  generative adversarial networks (GANs) ;  Huayao cross-stitch ;  intelligent design ;  style characteristics

Generating Use Case Specification from SALT GUI,"Requirement engineering plays a crucial role in the initial phase of software development. Among the commonly utilized artifacts for requirements is the Use Case Specification, which aids in identifying scenarios and resolving inconsistencies, ambiguities, and incompleteness in the requirements document. This process of scenario identification is also applicable in human-computer interaction, particularly in user interfaces where the graphical user interface (GUI) serves as the closest interface for user interaction and feedback. Recognizing this connection, using GUIs to generate a Use Case Specification emerged. This research proposes an approach for generating a Use Case Specification from the SALT GUI. The primary method employed in this study involves the use of Regular Expressions. A SALT GUI format was also formulated and integrated into an activity diagram to achieve the desired output. Consequently, the proposed approach successfully predicts tasks from SALT GUI to generate a Use Case Specification, yielding a precision score of 0.875, a recall of 0.625, and an f-score of 0.833. These results substantiate the feasibility of generating a Use Case Specification from SALT GUI.","Awalurahman, Halim Wildan;Raharjana, Indra Kharisma;Hanief, Rifqi;Rohmani, Syahrul Akbar;Korompis, Rikza Biknada;Oktavian, Mahardika Riesma;Azky Hamdani, Muhammad Wildan;Zaman, Badrus;Kartono, ",Conference Proceeding,"2023 15th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ICITEE 2023",2023-01-01,Universitas Airlangga,Process Innovation ;  Regular Expressions ;  Requirements Engineering ;  SALT GUI ;  Use Case Specification

ENHANCING QUALITY TEACHING THROUGH INFORMAL COMMUNITY LEARNING IN KNOWLEDGE CENTRES,"Teaching and learning have always been at the heart of the missions of universities. The growing interest nowadays to pay attention to the quality of higher education teaching results in initiatives such as the establishment of Teaching and Learning Centres (TLCs). The Academy for Learning and Teaching (ALT) at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has recently been created, and it is still under construction, with the purpose of promoting quality of teaching through engaging staff in interaction and in learning lessons from evidence-based educational practices and innovation in engineering education. Furthermore, ALT supports the professional development of faculty teaching staff through Learning Communities (LCs) as informal learning mechanisms that stimulate knowledge sharing about engineering education experiences across departments (and universities). LCs facilitate interaction with peers, discussions on educational practices, working in teams, and exposing academic and education support staff to have access to state-of-the-art research and information on educational issues. LCs are organized by themes, such as Digitalization, that cover topics relevant to innovative practices, e.g., Learning Analytics, Artificial Intelligence in education or Digital Assessment. The purpose of this study is to present the ALT model as a knowledge centre in engineering education that stimulates the advancement of quality teaching. Specifically, we analyze successful factors to constitute Learning Communities, as well as, the motivation of the teaching staff to participate in the LC associated to the TU/e ALT. ALT may serve as an inspiring model for other engineering and technical higher education institutions and universities wishing to promote professional development of teachers.","Gómez-Puente, Sonia M.;Ventura-Medina, Esther",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Centres for Teaching and Learning ;  Informal learning ;  Innovative Teaching & Learning Methods ;  Learning Communities
The Need for Interdisciplinarity: A Case on Employees' Perspectives,"The issue of interdisciplinarity contains disparate nodes of knowledge and practices, including a wealth of information concerning the potential and value of interdisciplinary work. In the context of companies that handle large-scale and complex tasks, interdisciplinarity takes on a real-life role since its presence and importance is readily observable and, as this paper shows, a conscious, deliberate, and highly valued aspect of innovation in companies. Academic literature on the issue of interdisciplinarity asserts that engineers in the future need a wealth of competences, including ability to collaborate in interdisciplinary teams. Aalborg University in Denmark has experimented with interdisciplinarity in various PBL contexts; the guiding research problem of this paper concerns how work practices call for interdisciplinary competence development. Through this perspective, we gain insight into how interdisciplinary competences are relevant for students at AAU as a competence that must be proactively developed. The data set consists of nine interviews collected from a large Danish company. The interviews have been transcribed using Nvivo and coded according to the research problem. As the results of the qualitative data indicates, interdisciplinarity is not just an important competence for employees, but also a prerequisite for problem solving. Results indicate that interdisciplinarity is a competence that students must develop because interdisciplinarity is actively used for problem-solving in the types of jobs that engineering graduates will get in the future.","Friedrichsen, D.;Winther, M.;Kolmos, A.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Aalborg University,competences ;  development ;  engineer ;  future ;  Interdisciplinarity
TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY - FOSTERING GENDER DIMENSIONS FOR INCLUSIVENESS IN SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND PRODUCTION (STEP) FIELDS,"Statistics from the Engineering Council of South Africa indicate that a large number of women who enter the engineering sector leave their careers in the early stages because they felt isolated and experienced discrimination in this traditionally male-dominated industry. Furthermore, research on global trends have highlighted the importance of an inclusive atmosphere as a result of the increase in the proportion of female decision-makers, racial and ethnic background differences, persons with disabilities and generation gaps with resulting different learning styles and needs. Literature also suggests that workforce diversity that maximises inclusion and minimises resistance, allows organisations to create change that fosters the human potential of their employees to the extent that diversity could be an organisation's competitive advantage. To assist with fostering a culture of inclusion a Leadership Development Programme (LDP) was designed for early to mid-career male and female employees in Science, Technology Engineering and Production (STEP) fields by the Women in Engineering Leadership Association (WELA) at a South African university. The focus of the four-day programme included leadership, communication, diversity, being a team player, lean management and tools for effective problem-solving in addition to a two-day practical team exercise in a simulated working environment. This research paper outlines the study's theoretical framework and the results from a survey and industry focus groups that guided the design of the STEP LDP. The qualitative post-workshop data from STEP LDP participants is also discussed. The results illustrated the importance and perceived value of the programme to those who had participated. Accordingly, this paper also explores and reports on the transformation in thinking following the programme participation and provides feedback and suggestions to improve the LDP. Creating an inclusive environment in the workplace is a key factor for employee growth and satisfaction as well as promoting an inclusive leadership culture. It is recommended that similar programmes are presented by other universities or within organisations to foster inclusion, thereby facilitating employee retention, in particular, women in engineering.","Lourens, A.;Truter, N.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Nelson Mandela University,diversity ;  diversity ;  Inclusion ;  Inclusion ;  innovation ;  innovation ;  leadership ;  leadership ;  transformation ;  transformation
'THERE'S A MACHINE ON THE TEAM': EMPLOYERS' PERSPECTIVES ON GRADUATE EMPLOYABILITY IN DIGITISED WORKPLACES,"The implementation of interconnected digital and cyber-physical technologies across engineering fields is changing the nature of professional work. These new forms of work present both technical and social challenges; it is therefore timely to consider the implications of the digital transformation of work for engineering education. In this study the focus is on the technical and social skills that employers have identified as desirable for productive work practices in digital/cyber-physical environments. The research question guiding the study is: What technical and social skills do employers in digitised/cyber-physical workplaces value in engineering graduates? The study drew on Legitimation Code Theory's Specialization dimension to reveal the underpinning principles of how technical and social skills are integrated in digital environments. Structured interviews with employers were analysed to categorise the technical and social skills that were highly regarded in environments that had implemented digital and related technologies. The study identified three levels of socio-technical integration valued by employers, namely: 1) enthusiasm for, and appreciation of, the role of digital and related technologies in addressing engineering and societal challenges; 2) teamwork and/or client support in digitised environments; and 3) interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration for digital and related technological innovation. The study identified an emerging shift from a skills discourse that assumes a separation between technical and social skills towards one that captures the dynamics of socio-technical integration in digitised and related technological practice.","Winberg, C.;Winberg, S.

GOING BEYOND INTENTIONS: A METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY AMONG ENGINEERING EDUCATION ALUMNI,"This research paper proposes a novel methodology for evaluating entrepreneurial activity among engineering education alumni using their public CVs as our main source of information. The objective is to go beyond measuring entrepreneurship intentions or mindset through surveys, and instead analyse actual career data to assess the impact of entrepreneurship education. The study utilises shared user data and employs GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models to infer entrepreneurial activity that extends beyond job titles, delving into the specific responsibilities and achievements associated with each position. The analysis shows that the proposed methodology, which uses context enriching to enhance model accuracy, effectively identifies instances of entrepreneurial activity among CVs profiles data. This approach provides a way to evaluate the effectiveness of entrepreneurship and innovation courses. Combining the insights gained through the proposed method with internal data sources would enable institutions to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of program impact on alumni career paths. The study underscores the potential of AI models to facilitate the collection and analysis of data that has traditionally been challenging to access. Moreover, the research highlights the importance of evaluating the long-term impact of entrepreneurship education on alumni career trajectories, a key factor in addressing the growing field of engineering education. Ultimately, this study contributes to the academic discourse on entrepreneurship education by offering a novel approach for assessing the impact of such programs on alumni outcomes, thus enabling institutions to make data-driven decisions to improve program offerings.","Garcia-Huertes, S.;Bragós, R.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Artificial Intelligence (AI) ;  Engineering Education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) ;  Innovation ;  Machine Learning (ML) ;  Program evaluation
THE ART OF REPAIRING - OR HOW TO TEACH ENGINEERING STUDENTS SUSTAINABLE DESIGN PRINCIPLES,"Project-based learning bridges the gap between theoretical training and practical applications. The motivation of students to participate is increased especially by working out real-life problems. To provide this kind of practical learning experience, we are establishing a repair project for broken, otherwise discarded, lab equipment. It will not only help to reduce waste and save money by repairing research equipment, but will also encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. Providing a space to learn about the underlying functional properties of various often highly specialized lab instruments, students identify malfunctions, deepen understanding of vulnerable designs, and discuss and perform strategies for repairing them under guidance, while collecting credit points. Through gaining a deep understanding of how these instruments work, students may even invent new strategies to realize similar tasks or add new features. This project builds on the findings from a 2021 pilot study. We discovered that by offering a repair project, students were able to gain a deeper understanding of theoretical concepts, improve their self-confidence as well as their motivation in learning, and increase their awareness of sustainable design. In the following, we are presenting the transformation of the pilot study into a current course concept. With weekly mini-evaluations we are monitoring students' learning success towards their learning goals and share the results.","Kühne, Stefan;Forbrig, Christian;Marckwardt, Anja;Kober, Julian;Rappsilber, Juri;Oberschmidt, Dirk",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin,fostering engineering skills ;  problem-based project learning ;  student empowerment ;  sustainability
Rethinking Evolution of Active Learning in the Hybrid/Online Engineering Education in the Post-COVID-19 Era: A quantitative keyword co-occurrence analysis,"In response to COVID-19, education witnessed a rapid shift to online and virtual platforms. Our previous research has raised questions about the efficacy of these methods for hands-on practice and active learning experiences - crucial elements of engineering education. Emergent solutions like online laboratories and virtual field trips have led to the rise of a hybrid learning era in the post-pandemic context. This change necessitates a reassessment of active learning in hybrid/online engineering education. In this study, we examine recent literature on online and virtual education during and post-COVID-19 to redefine and reevaluate strategies for engaging students actively. We propose using VOSViewer to analyze the occurrence of keywords in post-COVID-19 literature to define a visualization between the interests in research and the content of key papers in situating active learning for hybrid/online education. We analyze the evolution of active learning theory, outline its characteristics in the new era, and propose a literature review focusing on how digital technology can synergize with learning approaches to foster active learning. We also address concerns related to hands-on practice and active learning and discuss innovations developed to mitigate these challenges. Our goal is to provide fresh insights and stimulate further research on enhancing active learning within hybrid/online engineering education in the post-pandemic era.","Xu, Y.;Piyatamrong, T.;Nyamapfene, A.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,University College London,Active Learning ;  Engineering Education ;  Hybrid/Online Education ;  Technology Mediated Active Learning
DISCOVERING SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES IN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION SITES,"This practice paper is a descriptive account of an experience with a sustainable development learning project for engineering students in a Science, Technology and Society (STS) course at Bilkent University. The students participated in the STS Sustainability Awards competition for two semesters in one academic year, an event that was inspired by Bilkent University's 2021-2022 Sustainability Year. As part of the project, the students found a company or laboratory, consulted them on their innovation practices and asked questions that were grounded in Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) approaches. RRI can provide an opening for students to explore how various values, including sustainability and privacy, are considered in innovation practices. The values by design approach can help engineering students to see that innovators consider both instrumental and qualitative values during the innovation process. Although the project has been used in other years, the sustainability awards motivated students to explore how innovators respond to concerns around a range of sustainability issues. The award recipients produced projects on smart homes, nanotechnology-based solar panels, clean meat, industry 4.0, geothermal energy, air cars and magnetic resonance imaging technology, and gave presentations in events hosted by the Faculty of Engineering administrators. Although future research in this area is needed, applied learning experiences, such as the one that is described in this paper, could have the potential to help bridge the disciplinary divide between STS and engineering.","Downey, R.

Supporting Innovation in Higher Education: How Higher Education Can Support Innovative Teaching Practices,"Educational institutions that want to successfully innovate regarding the education they provide must synchronise organisational growth with educational growth. To support such innovation, a maturity model can help identify successful teaching and learning practices by encouraging experimentation, collaboration and alignment with strategic goals. Although maturity models that support staff in the process of innovating education are valuable, they are scarce. This phenomenological study explored the views of staff from the Centre for Expertise in Learning and Teaching (CELT) on readiness for innovation at the University of Twente (UT). We surveyed staff members who were actively involved in projects or teacher initiatives aimed at educational innovation. The questionnaire consisted of 137 closed-ended multiple-choice questions (e.g. 'Is teaching support guided by the latest research findings?') and answers on a five-point scale ('Not', 'Partly', 'Largely', 'Fully' and 'Don't know'). The survey's structure was based on that of the maturity model. The questions were divided into five categories of processes: learning (directly affecting pedagogy), development (related to the creation and maintenance of resources), support (related to support and operational management), evaluation (related to evaluation and quality control throughout its lifecycle) and organisation (related to institutional planning and management). After the survey results were analysed, respondents were invited to reflect on its outcomes, share their insights and suggest possible explanations for the results. In this paper, we present the educational support staff's maturity model results and discuss how these results can influence the effects of teachers' innovative practices.","Chapel, L.;Imanbayeva, A.;Petrova, N.;Borst, S.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Universiteit Twente,Challenge based learning ;  Higher education ;  Innovation readiness ;  Maturity Model ;  Teaching practice
A FRAMEWORK FOR A SCOPING REVIEW OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,"The digitalization of engineering education has made significant progress in recent years not only due to societal circumstances such as COVID-19, but also thanks to technological development and progress and digital transformation of engineering education seems more imminent than ever. This paper presents the development of a framework and process for an ongoing scoping review regarding frameworks for digital transformation of engineering education. Empirical studies on digital innovations in specific small-scale contexts are numerous and the literature is rich. This study, however, aims to identify more systematic and holistic approaches to digital transformation. At this stage the review work has resulted in 21 research papers for full-text screening from 4 databases, SCOPUS, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Engineering Village. The proposed framework facilitates analysis of how frameworks for digital transformation of engineering education are informed and conceptualized ideologically in the sense of what digitalization should do for engineering education and how they guide and facilitate digital transformation. The framework builds on and combines theory from educational and digital transformation research and enables elicitation of essential elements of digital transformation in an educational context, including ideologies, models, dimensions, actors, elements, and levels of digitalization.","Lyngdorf, N.

SHARED INTERESTS IN LIVE CASE-BASED LEARNING - STUDENTS' DYNAMIC ROLE IN AN INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM,"Teaching engineering students to navigate complex innovation ecosystems and deal with wicked problems is vital for contributing to sustainable development. Research shows that case-based learning with real-life challenges boosts motivation and learning outcomes. This paper presents a course that is in the core of an ecosystem where engineering students engage with hospitals, and work on the hospitals' documented innovation needs. By design, the course setup has a double purpose: in a learning context, the course strengthens intrapreneurship education, with students acting in an empowered role like professional consultants. In an organizational context, the course enhances knowledge sharing, filling in the gap of innovation competences and resources needed to create value and stimulate intrapreneurial initiatives. The ecosystem has evolved as result of an iterated development of the course including the tools and frameworks that empower the students to act as autonomous innovation consultants in constant interaction with the process of mobilizing the case partners. Thus, this paper presents a study based on current experiences and learnings, focusing on the relationship between the facilitation of student empowerment in live case-based learning and the impact on both 1) engineering students' motivation and learning outcomes; 2) value creation for the participating ecosystem. The paper builds on qualitative data from two sources: yearly follow-up interviews with case partners since 2018, and student reflection reports from 2022.","Keiding, V.;Grex, S.;Lorenzini, G.

A SCOPING REVIEW OF EXAMPLES ON MISSION-DRIVEN AND MISSION-ORIENTED INNOVATION IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION RESEARCH,"Engineers of the future are being requested to become part of solutions for dealing with complexities in the world, exemplified by the adaptation of the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). Ensuring that engineering students are introduced to these is of the utmost importance, if sustainable solutions to grand challenges shall be developed, whether being of technological, social and cultural, and/or economic character. This paper entails a scoping review of the concept of mission-driven or mission-oriented innovation, as defined by the European Commission (EC) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in engineering education research (EER). Seven papers were identified as relevant out of 50 papers derived from five databases, which were then reviewed by the two authors, indicating a substantial gap within engineering education research of mission-driven initiatives in education and research. It further reveals significant overlapping understandings, as the papers included often align their focuses with the SDGs without relating them to mission-driven or mission-oriented conceptual understandings. Outcomes of this scoping review propose that the field of EER acknowledges possible affordances, albeit challenges are still present, for engineering students in applying missions as a binding component for framing projects, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and partnerships with companies, authorities, or other stakeholders. Finally, future research directions are suggested in the field of EER with regards to mission-driven or mission-oriented innovation for grasping practical circumstances for staff and students involved in the works of dealing with complexities through missions.","Christiansen, S.

Can Students' Self-Efficacy Beliefs Explain Academic Motivation and Career Intentions?,"In our technologized and increasingly complex world, jobs in STEM make a crucial contribution to innovation and sustainability. However, there are still many vacancies in this field. To tackle the shortage of professionals, it is even more important to successfully prepare qualified young people for engineering careers and foster competences that promote innovative and creative solutions. In addition to cognitive abilities, research has shown how self-efficacy, which describes confidence in one's own abilities to successfully overcome obstacles, can influence students' motivation, interest and therefore academic and vocational training success. Studies show that people with a strong belief in their own competence have greater persistence in completing and problem-solving tasks. Hence, this paper discusses how the students' own perception of self-efficacy can influence their interest in the subject, academic retention, and subsequent career intentions and success. To gain further empirical insights, data from the mixed-methods study “digiMINT” will be collected using narrative interviews with female pupils, STEM students and employees, as well as industry representatives. The aim is to understand conditions of engineering education and jobs, and additionally the perception of self-efficacy as a predictive factor of career intentions. Furthermore, it will be evaluated how self-efficacy can be cultivated as a valuable skill in engineering education and teaching additionally to cognitive skills. In long term, promoting a positive experience for students' own self-efficacy could support a sustainable integration into the labor market and equip future engineers with an interdisciplinary which is particularly relevant for complex tasks in an increasingly complex world.","Wimmer, A.

CONGRUENCE AND FRICTION BETWEEN TEACHERS' INTENTIONS AND STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF CBL COURSES,"Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) has become specifically popular in higher engineering education as it embraces authentic, active, and interdisciplinary learning that requires students' self-direction and collaborative decision-making. The CBL compass (van den Beemt et al. 2023) has been widely applied to capture the variety of educational innovations under the CBL label regarding their vision, teaching and learning, and support. As the tool only captures the teachers' intentions and goals, the question remains whether discrepancies occur with student perceptions of the CBL learning environment that may cause friction. Therefore, this research project explored these discrepancies more thoroughly with teachers and students from CBL courses at four technical universities across Europe. First, to understand the commonalities and differences between the courses, all courses were mapped with the CBL compass. Analyses of the outcomes showed that the courses varied regarding their implementation of the 36 indicators of CBL represented by the tool - most strongly regarding collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, assessment, and aspects of learning technologies, facilities, and support. In the next step, we applied the student version of the CBL compass to understand student perception of these indicators and capture differences with teachers' intentions. The results mostly show a high agreement between teachers' intentions and students' perceptions. Friction arises in indicators regarding the complexity of the challenge, the involvement of external stakeholders, and the assessment. The results do not only help our understanding of student learning gains and experiences in CBL but may feed back into teachers' CBL design processes.","Helker, K.;Michel, S.;Bots, M.;Mottl, P.;Michelson, A.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Tallinna Tehnikaülikool;Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Technische Universität München;Czech Technical University in Prague,Challenge-Based Learning ;  Educational Innovation ;  Learning Environment ;  Student ;  Teacher
CONCEPTUAL MODELLING AS AN OVERARCHING RESEARCH SKILL,"Today's society is impacted by complex, fast and continuously changing problems. These need to be tackled inter-, multi and transdisciplinary. At the University of Twente, we have developed a new CBL minor Intelligence, creativity, and responsible technological innovation in societal transformations, (ICR&TIST), which focuses on research skills in complex socio-technological problem-solving contexts. The design of this minor has been guided by new insights from long-running research aimed at developing a Philosophy of Science for the Engineering Sciences and extensive experiences with engineering education in project-based learning (PjBL). Education in scientific research tends to focus on academic contexts, while scientific research in real-world problem-contexts (e.g., sustainability) requires the ability to effectively and responsibly construct relevant, reliable and intelligible knowledge for the benefit of the concrete, local problem and possible solutions, using everything science has to offer (knowledge, methods, instruments, mathematical tools). This type of scientific research calls for a new paradigm, called an engineering paradigm of science. Conceptual modelling (rather than hypothesis testing) fits better the core activity of this type of scientific research and should therefore be seen as an overarching skill. The educational design of the minor has adopted conceptual modelling as the overarching learning objective. This new concept, how to work with the accompanying conceptual modelling methodology (B&K method) and understand the underlying philosophical insights appears exciting and challenging for the multi-disciplinary educational-design team. This paper will elaborate on the educational design process, the resulting design of the minor, and preliminary findings in the pilot-phase.","Boon, M.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Universiteit Twente,Engineering Paradigm of Science ;  Higher-order-thinking-skills ;  Interdisciplinary research ;  Socio-technological problems ;  Sustainability
EXPLORING THE FABRICATION LAB CONCEPT FOR LEARNING SUSTAINABLE CO-INNOVATION IN INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION - AN ACTION RESEARCH CASE FROM AUSTRIA,"According to recent studies, cooperative innovation between universities and industry, especially with small and medium firms, is not as frequent as expected. Case-studies of regional innovation systems have shown that open access to state-of-the-art research infrastructure, services, skills and activities are needed to achieve long-term innovation partnerships. Co-innovation requires particular skills beyond technical knowledge, which are not always addressed in engineering curricula at university. Fab labs are a concept that potentially fosters students in the acquisition of such skills. In this paper, we describe our experiences in designing, building and running a fab lab as a new element for industrial engineering education at our university in Austria.","Erol, S.;Grano, A.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Fachhochschule Wiener Neustadt,co-innovation ;  engineering education ;  fabrication lab ;  sustainability
"EMERGING TRENDS, APPROACHES AND CHALLENGES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION IN THE UK","Worldwide, engineering educators are searching for approaches, pedagogies and change strategies to develop programmes that will equip their graduates to be successful engineers, effective engineering leaders and catalysts for social development. In the UK, focus largely rests on new pathway initiatives and new Higher Education (HE) institutions. There is little shared understanding of the established sector's evolution from a maths and science heavy curricula to the innovative and world-leading models of engineering education found in the UK HE sector today. This research paper looks at examples of trends that are emerging in engineering education provision in the UK and highlights case-studies of innovative provision and new models in the sector. A mixed-mode approach of desk research, structured survey and case studies were used to collect data. Data analyses show that across the UK there is a complete spectrum of engineering higher education, with the reality of the provision being complex with a broad diversity of educational models on offer. The research reviews current teaching and learning approaches and highlights evidence of innovations in laboratory practical teaching; use of projects; dissertation projects; project-based learning, project-based initiatives and frameworks; and examples of new buildings driving curriculum innovation. In particular, the paper presents and discusses data concerning current teaching and learning approaches (including barriers and impact of the coronavirus on learning approaches and provision of engineering education in the UK), information on innovative elements, and COVID mitigation and engagement with new methods of delivery.","Fowler, S.;Direito, I.;Bellingham, K.;Mitchell, J.

Sustainability and Innovation: Exploring the Relationship between Sustainability and Companies' Engagement in Innovation Ecosystems in German Engineering Industry,"This study identifies sustainable companies in the engineering industry in Germany and investigates their engagement in innovation ecosystems based on varying collaborative formats and transfer pathways. To this end, 200 medium and large companies were interviewed. For the analysis of the data, the study operationalised sustainability and identified sustainable companies based on responses concerning their environmental, social, and economic performance. These results were then cross-referenced with activities within innovation ecosystems. Results are consistent with the state of research and indicate that sustainable companies are more engaged in innovation ecosystems than non-sustainable companies. This suggests that companies considered sustainable are more likely to contribute to solving grand societal challenges through innovations. For engineering educators, it highlights the relevance to promote sustainability and innovation as part of engineering education and prepare students for cooperative and collaborative activities in their careers.","Johannsen, T.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin,Cooperation Formats ;  Engineering Industry Survey ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability
COMICIR- COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE CHALLENGES FROM INDUSTRY AND RESEARCH,"At Linköping university, a model to facilitate impact and bridge the gap between research, education, and business creation, has been developed. It is named “ComICIR”, which stands for Commercialization of Innovative Challenges from Industry and Research. The model allows researchers, firms, and students to work in a co-creation process that are built on the following five steps: (1) research validation, (2) idea generation, (3) idea validation, (4) idea evaluation and, (5) innovation strategy. In the paper, we describe the model and analyse how challenges and ideas could be developed and experientially based pedagogical approaches could be adjusted in order to benefit the regional ecosystem of research, education and industry and contribute to reaching increased impact of innovative ideas and ventures. Our main finding is that CBL is beneficial but requires close cooperation between teachers and innovation support actors. Flexibility is needed to fit the purpose of the course as well as the needs of the challenge providers. Hence, challenges need to be categorized and qualified to take into account the aim and scope of the challenge as well as its degree of development as this affects how the challenges should be written and treated to get the best outcome.","Norrman, C.;Moshfegh, A.;Engzell, Jeanette",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Linköpings Universitet,Challenge-based learning ;  entrepreneurship ;  impact ;  innovation ;  knowledge triangle
INSIDER ACTION RESEARCH ON AI NEEDS WITHIN THE EIT INNOENERGY ECOSYSTEM,"This practice paper describes an ongoing insider action research within the EIT InnoEnergy ecosystem. Its goal is to inspire teaching staff from the seven EIT InnoEnergy double degree Master of Science programmes to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and knowledge into their courses based on joint learning. This insider action research runs from 2023 to the end of 2024. In late 2022, a problem statement of 'AI tools for Education' was identified by EIT InnoEnergy teachers as being crucial for their future learning and teaching processes. To align the needs of teaching staff with the complexity of emerging AI tools, a decision was made to plan a hybrid insider action research method. The outcome of this research will be twofold: one resulting in an AI toolkit covering three teaching staff needs, and two getting a better understanding of the processes involved in taking up a learning innovation at different engineering partner universities spread across Europe within the EIT InnoEnergy ecosystem. This paper shares the first phases of the insider action research and an overview of the individual AI initiatives taken by teaching staff at different partner universities that is the result of a first qualitative data analysis coming from initiatives shared by the insiders (i.e., teaching staff). Action research methodology was chosen to inspire teaching staff to take an investigative and experimental attitude to the new AI technologies while allowing all actors to support each other and grow towards an AI integration in courses and curricula.","de Waard, I.;Gelan, A.;Gonzalez, A.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,EIT InnoEnergy;EIT InnoEnergy;EIT InnoEnergy,action research ;  AI ;  educational innovation ;  sustainable engineering ;  teacher support

ENGINEERING SOCIETY: THE ROLE OF INTERSECTIONAL GENDER AND DIVERSITY STUDIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE TRANSFORMATION ON THE CASE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING EDUCATION,"Technological innovations are impacting societies in manifold ways and can accelerate a transformation toward sustainability. To enable a sustainable transformation through engineering, engineers educated to create technological solutions for global challenges must be educated in sustainability principles as postulated under 'Education for Sustainable Development' (ESD) in the Agenda for Sustainable Development. In technological fields, the ecological, as well as the economical perspective of sustainability, are often addressed, but as recent research has highlighted, sustainability needs to be addressed holistically; this means including the social dimension to a greater degree and applying an intersectional understanding of gender and diversity throughout all spheres of sustainability. It is therefore imperative for engineering students to learn and understand where gender and diversity are necessary for sustainability, how diversity dimensions intersect, and which intersections are particularly relevant for novel technologies and societal development. Accordingly, this paper sketches an interdisciplinary approach for applying intersectional gender and diversity studies in the context of a sustainable transformation of engineering education. We draw on our experience of having educated engineers accordingly for a decade at the GDI (Gender and Diversity in Engineering) at RWTH Aachen University. Selected examples from our teaching practice are presented and six general maxims are deduced that can make engineering education more sustainability-oriented, inclusive, and diverse. As we will conclude, fostering innovative and inclusive engineering education needs interdisciplinary teams adhering to our proposed six maxims to accelerate a gender- and diversity-sensitive sustainable transformation.","Bosen, J.;Bernhard, S.;Fauster, E.;Decker, M.;Lämmerhirt, M.;Leicht-Scholten, C.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,diversity ;  engineering education ;  gender ;  intersectional ;  sustainability
Analyzing the Impact and Prospects of Metaverse in Learning Environments Through Systematic and Case Study Research,"Recent years have witnessed a remarkable technology shift with immersive technology applications like Metaverse across industries and sectors. As 3D-based virtual reality environments, these applications create digital pairs of the physical world and provide an immersive experience to users with technological competencies supporting daily and social activities by means of their virtual avatars and with real-virtual environments and human-machine interactions. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, educational systems are actively engaged in integrating modern and emerging technologies with traditional teaching methods. The pandemic has significantly altered the landscape of education by introducing a new era of virtual environments and interactions, which has placed new demands on learning settings. Immersive technologies have added new dimensions to the learning process. This current study delves into the feasibility of incorporating immersive technologies, such as the Metaverse, into education, and it assesses the overall academic experience for both educators and learners.

Transformation of CRISPR/Cas9 expression construct to enhance saturated fatty acid synthesis in oil palm for biofuel production,"New technology innovations and the utilization of elite varieties are necessary for oil palm intensification to improve productivity. In addition to productivity improvement, oil palm intensification is also directed to improve the quality of crude palm oil (CPO) to be used in biofuel production. The modification of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway through genetic engineering is one of the most promising approaches. The research aims to apply a genetic transformation to oil palm calli and to improve success regeneration of the transformed explants. A CRISPR/Cas9 expression construct to edit the PTE (palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase) gene, which protein is involved in the formation of palmitic acid, was generated in the previous research. In this study, the genetic transformation of the construct into 4month-old oil palm calli was conducted via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The transformed calli were subsequently subcultured into selection media containing 100 ppm of cefotaxime and 50 ppm of kanamycin antibiotics. After several weeks, the transformed calli were transferred into DF10 media without antibiotics. Non-transformed calli were able to grow on the selection media with antibiotics but still in the globular phase. In contrast, the transformed calli on the selection media were able to grow to the scutellar phase with a compact structure in the embryogenic callus development stages. The next step is to optimize the transformation method as well as the regeneration media composition.","Minarsih, H.;Permatasari, G. W.;Setiawati, Y.;Mardhika, L. D.;Saptari, R.

A Novel Personalized Recommendation Model for Computing Advertising Based on User Acceptance Evaluation,"Nowadays, computing advertising has been an intelligent Internet application which provides personalized advertising service to customers. But how to suggest suitable advertising contents to users relies on effective mining of user preference characteristics. Conventionally, machine learning-based methods were most intuitive solutions to predict unknown user features. Nevertheless, such kind of approaches highly relied on massive labelled samples, and also cost much time in algorithm training. In realistic engineering application, running efficiency acts as the top priority. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a novel personalized recommendation model for computing advertising based on user acceptance evaluation. Firstly, the functional requirements in personalized recommendation of computing advertising is analyzed, and the perceived behavior of the algorithm ethical risks generated in computing advertising is analyzed based on collaborative filtering. Then, based on the user experience risks generated in recommendation process, a user acceptance value for personalized recommendation is calculated. We also conduct some experiments on real-world data to make empirical assessment for the proposal. It can be concluded that recommendation effect of the proposal is better than that of machine learning algorithm and ant colony algorithm.","Xie, Yanqiu;Huang, Yanli",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,Central South University of Forestry and Technology,computing advertising ;  Personalized recommendation ;  user acceptance evaluation
Discovering Potential Founders Based on Academic Background,"Technology transfer is central to the development of an iconic entrepreneurial university. Academic science has become increasingly entrepreneurial, not only through industry connections for research support or transfer of technology but also in its inner dynamic. To foster knowledge transfer, many universities undergo a scouting process by their innovation coaches. The goal is to find staff members and students, who have the knowledge, expertise and the potential to found startups by transforming their research results into a product. Since there is no systematic approach to measure the innovation potential of university members based on their academic activities, the scouting process is typically subjective and relies heavily on the experience of the innovation coaches. In this paper, we study the discovery of potential founders to support the scouting process using a data-driven approach. We create a novel data set by integrating the founder profiles with the academic activities from 8 universities across 5 countries. We explain the process of data integration as well as feature engineering. Finally by applying machine learning methods, we investigate the classification accurracy of founders based on their academic background. Our analysis shows that using a Random Forest (RF), it is possible to successfully differentiate founders and non-founders. Additionally, this accuracy of the classification task remains mostly stable when applying a RF trained on one university to another, suggesting the existence of a generic founder profile.","Arzani, Arman;Handte, Marcus;Zella, Matteo;Marrón, Pedro José",Conference Proceeding,"International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management, IC3K - Proceedings",2023-01-01,Hochschule Niederrhein;Universität Duisburg-Essen,Founding Potential ;  Innovation Identification ;  Knowledge Transfer ;  Researcher Profiling
“We Need to Think about Their Real Needs”: Examining the Auxiliary Work of Audience-Oriented Intralopers in News Organizations,"Amid an increasing focus on becoming audience-centric in news organizations, there is growing interest in studying non-journalistic actors, i.e., intralopers; internally hired non-journalistic actors such as technologists and business-people and how they shape news organizations and journalism. Through new job titles and roles, intralopers enter news organizations to help understand, reach and engage audiences. Subsequently, they bring in new practices, values and epistemologies which can challenge, change and conflict with the traditional roles and culture of journalism. Explicating the role and influence of audience-oriented intralopers, the study draws on qualitative interviews with 14 non-journalistic and six journalistic actors across three different news organizations: a public service media, a legacy media and a digital born startup media. The study explicates four defining aspects of audience-oriented intralopers’ work and impact upon journalism: 1) translating what the audience really want, 2) organizationally gatekeeping the audience in innovation processes, 3) engineering audience interaction and 4) shaping the organizational data culture. The study fills a gap by shedding light on a professional group and an emerging modus operandi that is well-researched in creative and production-oriented media research, but, as they operate mainly outside the newsroom, remain largely overlooked in journalism studies.","Vulpius, Julie",Journal,Digital Journalism,2023-01-01,Roskilde Universitet,Audience-centric ;  boundaries ;  core/periphery ;  digital news ;  innovation ;  metrics ;  news organizations ;  role conception
Maturity assessment of software-driven medical technologies: A quantitative score derived from a quality standard for the research phase,"Quantitatively assessing the level of readiness of medical technology improves its chance of successfully transfer from research to industry but remains a challenge. As many innovative medical devices are associated with or incorporate software, this article presents a methodology for evaluating the software maturity of a ""Software-driven Medical Technology""(SdMT) during the research phase. A technological maturity model is developed by methodologically extracting relevant terms from the ISO/IEC 62304 standard, the main industry standard for medical device software, and results in a list of required software engineering artifacts. This list and the relative weight of the artifacts are used to establish a software maturity score for SdMT and the corresponding assessment questionnaire. The consistency of the model is demonstrated by analyzing the obtained score system relatively with the standard. The maturity score of a SdMT can be assessed during the research phase and depends on the number and importance of the artifacts already present at the time of evaluation.Clinical relevance - The proposed quantitative maturity score can help the medical technology innovation actors (clinicians, researchers and industrials) to better identify, improve and fasten the readiness of technology for clinical investigation and technology transfer.","Haberbusch, Jean Loup;Dardenne, Guillaume;Promayon, Emmanuel",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBS",2023-01-01,Laboratoire de Traitement de l'Information Médicale (Latim);Université Grenoble Alpes,
Battery scheduling models in smart buildings: a systematic literature review,"Economic development brings the current scenario closer to the depletion of natural resources. Directly related to this it's the energy consumption and the need to seek sustainable solutions to prevent the harmful consequences of this depletion. Solar energy harnessed through photovoltaic technology is a solution capable of reducing the environmental impact, as it is a resource that is less harmful to the environment. The energy demand is seen as rising worldwide, and strategies must be developed to improve energy efficiency and maintain the balance of the electrical network, considering the comfort of consumers and the minimization of polluting emissions. In this sense, the concept of Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) aims to reduce electricity bills, maintain the efficiency of electronic equipment, and Demand Response, which seeks to change the use of electricity by consumers. Thus, the present study aims to search the literature for different HEMS models, specifically battery scheduling, for the future application of a model for a case study in the laboratory GECAD - Research Group on Intelligent Engineering and Computing for Advanced Innovation and Development.","Spellmeier, Julia Possebon;Brum Rosa, Carmen;Gomes, Luis;Vale, Zita;Alves, Rogerio Moreira",Conference Proceeding,"2023 15th Seminar on Power Electronics and Control, SEPOC 2023",2023-01-01,Grupo de Investigação em Engenharia e Computação Inteligente para a Inovação e o Desenvolvimento;Universidade Federal de Santa Maria;Universidade Federal de Goiás,battery scaling model ;  energy management systems ;  photovoltaic ;  smart building
"Employer activity in public television in the age of automation: employer branding, recruitment channels, selection processes, skills and professional profiles in demand","This research delves into the employment activity carried out by public broadcasters in Europe in the current context of development of generative artificial intelligence, analyzing the recruitment channels used, the selection processes followed, the most demanded professional skills and profiles, current job offers, and the procedures for creating an employer brand. The methodological design to achieve these purposes requires a phased execution based on the application of a methodological triangulation of qualitative techniques. The proposals of 10 European public broadcasters are analyzed, which are complemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with those responsible for innovation or technology on behalf of these corporations. The results reveal that the proliferation of offers for digital positions does not imply a fading of traditional ones, and that these technological employment opportunities are mainly related to data engineering, cybersecurity, big data and cloud management processes, and only in isolated cases. they are tied to specific machine learning or AI functions. The findings also show that interpersonal skills such as adaptability to change prevail over the eminently technical ones, and that broadcasters seek a competitive advantage in the disputed market of talent by building their employer brand and optimizing their recruitment portals.","Ceide, César Fieiras;Ruiz, María José Ufarte;Álvarez, Martín Vaz",Journal,Estudios Sobre el Mensaje Periodistico,2023-01-01,Universidade de Santiago de Compostela;Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,automation ;  Employer branding ;  journalism ;  professional profiles ;  public service media
Discussion and prospects of the development on measurement while drilling technology in oil and gas wells,"MWD and LWD technologies have been widely used in onshore and offshore oil and gas wells, especially in geosteerable and rotary steerable operations, supporting “safe, efficient and productive” drilling. By reviewing the history of MWD technology development of Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Halliburton, analyzing and studying current technologies and products, the development of MWD/LWD technology is divided into three stages: the stage of technological origin and primary development from 1930s to 1970s, the stage of rapid development of technology from 1980s to 1990s, and the stage of deep integration and development of technology from 2000s to the present. And now, they have basically met the conditions for the development of digital and intelligence. At the same time, MWD/LWD technology research started relatively late in our country. After nearly 40 years of development, these technologies have made great progress. But compared with the international advanced level, there is still a big gap. The paper points out that the current MWD/LWD instruments itself has four basic problems: measurement (engineering parameters and geological parameters, etc.), power supply (downhole high-power supply), transmission (high-speed real-time upload) and temperature (resistance to downhole high temperature, ultra-high temperature and extremely high temperature). It is clear that no matter how complete the current instrument measurement function and how complete the tool size is, it needs to be constantly improved and developed in the future. However, for the increasing production needs in the oilfield, if the key technologies involved in the above basic problems cannot be broken through and solved, it will become a bottleneck problem, and ultimately prevent the progress of MWD/LWD instruments. Based on the understanding of the development and current status about MWD/LWD technology, combined with the experience of many years of research on the theory and technology of underground control engineering, focusing on the high-speed transmission and high-temperature resistance technical problems, the paper proposed several solutions and methods and made a brief description. It is hoped that these ideas can inspire scientific research personnels who engaged in research and development of MWD technology independent. Here are the conclusions: ① A basic truth in innovation and development: demand promotes innovation, innovation leads development, and unsatisfaction is demand. ② Closely around the inherent basic problems of technology and for demand-oriented, there are still opportunities to catch up with the international advanced level. ③ The intersection and integration of technologies will inevitably give birth to new downhole instruments and tools.","Su, Yinao;Dou, Xiurong;Gao, Wenkai;Liu, Ke",Journal,Petroleum Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;National Engineering Research Center of Oil & Gas Drilling and Completion Technology,active cooling ;  deep drilling ;  full wellbore temperature control ;  high temperature and ultra-high temperature ;  high-speed transmission ;  logging while drilling ;  measurement while drilling
Spatial Wind Flow Load and Shape Optimization for Folding Grid Shell Buildings,"Wind-related disasters have emerged as a significant natural threat to humanity. This heightened concern necessitates careful consideration of the aerodynamic intricacies inherent in the surface characteristics of foldable reticulated shell houses, with particular attention paid to the substantial influence of wind loads. The objective of this study is to examine the spatial properties of foldable lattice shell houses through the establishment of a numerical wind tunnel model and subsequent simulations. The paper begins with an introduction to the CFD method, outlining its operational procedure. It further deduces the physical conservation principles governing mass and momentum, thereby establishing the relevant control equations. Additionally, the analysis encompasses the application of non-equilibrium wall conditions for the accurate calculation of building surface and ground wall motion and force characteristics. Finally, numerical simulations are performed on the foldable lattice shell house space, offering an effective tool and methodology for investigating wind pressure distribution and its implications. Through comparative analysis, it was determined that the optimized plan 18 with a rise-To-span ratio of 1/3, an end door inclination of 45°, and an end door height of 1/4 had better wind resistance performance. This plan reduced the gap between positive and negative pressure zones, improved the uniformity of surface wind pressure distribution, and weakened the wind loads' impact on the house. The research results indicated that reducing the rise-To-span ratio, end door inclination angle, and end door height can effectively improve the wind resistance performance of foldable lattice shell houses. The research on wind-induced response, numerical wind tunnel simulation, and shape optimization of foldable reticulated shell structures has certain innovation, and has important theoretical significance and engineering application value for the development of new camping foldable reticulated shells and wind resistance design of similar light houses.","Li, Yanhua;Zhao, Hui",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,Taiyuan University of Technology,Computational fluid dynamics ;  folding type lattice shell houses ;  shape optimization ;  spatial wind body ;  wind tunnel

The uberization of the economy on the example of the electrical engineering domain and transport,"Uberization is a new trend in the economy which incorporates phone apps and other media into the activities of different entities, resulting in the introduction of a different way of purchasing or using an item or service. The term “uberization” has emerged in connection with popularisation of the Uber app and has been used in various areas of the economy: banking and finance, hospitality, medical services, as well as in the electrical engineering domain area and of transport. Uberization is a source of various benefits for entities which business model is no different or slightly different from Uber's model. The operation of the entity, taking into account the assumptions of uberization, increases efficiency and reduces operating costs, especially during the COVID-19 period, and thus forces traditional entities to reorganize and change their business model. This leads to so-called creative destruction in the market, based on innovation and competition with the best, but also on the elimination of entities that do not keep up with technological changes or those that implement the traditional business model (non-Internet) regardless of changes in the surrounding economic reality. The work has a theoretical and research character. The methods used in the paper are theoretical and empirical, including causal analysis, abstraction, generalisation, inference, statistical method, comparative case study method and critical analysis of the literature.","Stępnicka, Nina;Kostikov, Eva;Sadowska, Beata;Sitak, Iryna",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE 4th KhPI Week on Advanced Technology, KhPI Week 2023 - Conference Proceedings",2023-01-01,"Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce;National Technical University Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute;University of Finance and Administration;Szczecin Institute of Technology",carpooling ;  electrical engineering domain ;  transport industry ;  uberization

Collaborative government-public efforts in driving green technology innovation for environmental governance in PPP projects: a study based on prospect theory,"Purpose: The paper aims to elucidate effective strategies for promoting the adoption of green technology innovation within the private sector, thereby enhancing the value of public–private partnership (PPP) projects during the operational phase. Design/methodology/approach: Utilizing prospect theory, the paper considers the government and the public as external driving forces. It establishes a tripartite evolutionary game model composed of government regulators, the private sector and the public. The paper uses numerical simulations to explore the evolutionary stable equilibrium strategies and the determinants influencing each stakeholder. Findings: The paper demonstrates that government intervention and public participation substantially promote green technology innovation within the private sector. Major influencing factors encompass the intensity of pollution taxation, governmental information disclosure and public attention. However, an optimal threshold exists for environmental publicity and innovation subsidies, as excessive levels might inhibit technological innovation. Furthermore, within government intervention strategies, compensating the public for their participation costs is essential to circumvent the public's “free-rider” tendencies and encourage active public collaboration in PPP project innovation. Originality/value: By constructing a tripartite evolutionary game model, the paper comprehensively examines the roles of government intervention and public participation in promoting green technology innovation within the private sector, offering fresh perspectives and strategies for the operational phase of PPP projects.","Bu, Zehui;Liu, Jicai;Zhang, Xiaoxue",Journal,Kybernetes,2023-01-01,Southwest Jiaotong University,Evolutionary game ;  PPP project ;  Prospect theory ;  Public participation ;  Technological innovation
Broadening the horizon: potential applications of CAR-T cells beyond current indications,"Engineering immune cells to treat hematological malignancies has been a major focus of research since the first resounding successes of CAR-T-cell therapies in B-ALL. Several diseases can now be treated in highly therapy-refractory or relapsed conditions. Currently, a number of CD19- or BCMA-specific CAR-T-cell therapies are approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), multiple myeloma (MM), and follicular lymphoma (FL). The implementation of these therapies has significantly improved patient outcome and survival even in cases with previously very poor prognosis. In this comprehensive review, we present the current state of research, recent innovations, and the applications of CAR-T-cell therapy in a selected group of hematologic malignancies. We focus on B- and T-cell malignancies, including the entities of cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (T-ALL, PTCL, CTCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), classical Hodgkin-Lymphoma (HL), Burkitt-Lymphoma (BL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM). While these diseases are highly heterogenous, we highlight several similarly used approaches (combination with established therapeutics, target depletion on healthy cells), targets used in multiple diseases (CD30, CD38, TRBC1/2), and unique features that require individualized approaches. Furthermore, we focus on current limitations of CAR-T-cell therapy in individual diseases and entities such as immunocompromising tumor microenvironment (TME), risk of on-target-off-tumor effects, and differences in the occurrence of adverse events. Finally, we present an outlook into novel innovations in CAR-T-cell engineering like the use of artificial intelligence and the future role of CAR-T cells in therapy regimens in everyday clinical practice.","Karsten, Hendrik;Matrisch, Ludwig;Cichutek, Sophia;Fiedler, Walter;Alsdorf, Winfried;Block, Andreas",Journal,Frontiers in Immunology,2023-01-01,Universität Hamburg;Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein Campus Lübeck;Universität zu Lübeck;Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf,AML ;  CAR-T-cell therapy ;  CLL ;  CML ;  hairy cell leukemia ;  lymphoma ;  T-cell malignancies ;  Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia

Africa region: Botswana,"Botswana, a stable sub-Saharan democratic nation of approximately 2.4 million people, got its independence in 1966. Although originally poor, the nation is now considered upper-middle-income. National healthcare expenditure is relatively high, with reasonably developed universal healthcare, and most people live well within reach of a health facility. Notwithstanding Botswana’s progress, a recent United Nations report suggests that the nation has “fallen below expectations,” in part due to an ongoing battle with high rates of HIV/AIDS and noncommunicable diseases and a shortage of rehabilitation services and professionals.Globally, people live longer and thus more live with disability; Botswana has been similarly affected. The increased prevalence of disabilities is due both to communicable and noncommunicable diseases, with the greatest contributors toward disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) being mental disorders (13.7%), HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (13%), musculoskeletal disorders (9.9%), neurological disorders (8.0%), and sense organ diseases (6.2%).During a recent survey of Botswana’s rehabilitation professionals, lack of recognition by the government, severe staff shortage, poor reimbursement by insurers, and absence of local rehabilitation equipment manufacturing were identified as some of the key challenges in rehabilitation. A need for improvement in rehabilitation services and capacity has been proposed, with government prioritization of rehabilitation through increased funding, staff training, better facilities, and the promotion and support of local manufacturing.Multidisciplinary research innovation among engineering, computer science, rehabilitation, medicine, neuropsychology, and others will be essential for advancing robotics and other technology-driven approaches to rehabilitation, especially for patients with cognitive and motor deficits due to HIV, stroke, and other diseases. Leveraging years of a fruitful partnership between the government of Botswana, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Botswana have recently established a multidisciplinary laboratory to develop affordable rehabilitation robotics, prosthetics, and other technologies, while building capacity among faculty and students.","Kebaetse, Maikutlo;Johnson, Michelle J.;Tsima, Billy;Ocampo, Cassandra;Nthitu, Justus Mackenzie;Mogorosi, Ntsatsi;Mbakile-Mahlanza, Lingani;Ndlovu, Kagiso;Kommula, Venkata P.;Jamisola, Rodrigo S.;Dillingham, Timothy",Book,"Rehabilitation Robots for Neurorehabilitation in High-, Low-, and Middle-Income Countries: Current Practice, Barriers, and Future Directions",2023-01-01,Botswana-UPenn Partnership;Botswana International University of Science and Technology;University of Botswana;University of Pennsylvania;Mahalapye District Health Team,Botswana ;  low-middle-income countries ;  Rehabilitation ;  robotics ;  technology
Students' Voices on How to Educate Communities about the Prevention of COVID-19 Using Robotics and Technological Innovation: A Transdisciplinary Research Approach,"Disruptions are costly in higher education.

DESIGN OF AN INNOVATION AGENDA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL PROJECTS WITH CASTOR (RICINUS COMMUNIS L.),"Ruderal plant genetic resources have developed aspects of adaptive specialization to environmental changes. This generates morphobiochemical characters that give rise to variation in populations and may represent new uses in agriculture and industry. Castor castor (Ricinus communis L.) is a plant that has developed variation in Mexico and its common use is to produce oil from the seed. It has not been explored in a bioprospective way, and therefore, it was proposed to take advantage of the biological variation of collections from four provinces of Mexico, designing a methodology to structure agricultural engineering projects and generate an innovation agenda based on simple questions, research questions. and fast operation. Lines of research (Linv), objectives, goals, times and expected results were designed, with emphasis on R&D projects (research + development) in response to agricultural crop problems in a territory. The above in order to rescue, preserve the variation as a germplasm collection, revalue, reorient and innovate its current use. Five Linv are in operation, a germplasm collection, a genetic improvement program (pure lines and hybridization), development of agricultural pesticide compositions, registration of varieties, and development of patents for biological activity in insects of economic interest.","Cedillo González, Karen Nayeli;Cadena Iñiguez, Jorge",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings from the International Congress on Project Management and Engineering,2023-01-01,Colegio de Postgraduados,Bioprospecting ;  incremental innovation ;  local resource ;  research and development
CLASSIFICATION OF END-OF-YEAR PROJECTS ACCORDING TO THE EU STRATEGY OF SMART SPECIALIZATION IN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (RIS3),"The objective of this article is to classify the end-of-course projects developed by Industrial and Systems Engineering students and identify the gaps presented, taking as a reference the regional agenda of a region in northern Peru prepared for the years 2018 to 2032 according to the smart specialization strategy in research and innovation (RIS3) whose guidelines are supported by the European Commission. The analysis methodology is mixed (qualitative and quantitative). For the qualitative analysis, the content analysis of the reports of the end-of-course projects was used, identifying the categories related to the proposals in the regional agenda. After carrying out this analysis, the results are contrasted and quantified based on the opportunities for improvement proposed by the regional agenda, according to each economic sector. This makes it possible to detect sectors that have not been addressed or that have been little addressed, in which it would be recommended to develop end-of-course projects in future editions, to cover the gaps detected. The data provided from the analysis are valuable to complement the training of the future engineer and contribute to the development of the region.","Guerrero Chanduví, Dante A.;Barreto-Pérez, María Del Carmen;Valderrama García, Alejandra;Risco Moreno, Diego",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings from the International Congress on Project Management and Engineering,2023-01-01,Universidad de Piura,content analysis ;  educational innovation ;  initial professional training ;  projects ;  RIS3

Revitalizing small centers in French rural and montain area: urban projects depending on rural context? The Livradois-Forez case,"Local authorities' actions in rural municipalities have particular characteristics considering landuse and planning: lack of finances and engineering, social and spatial proximity between local authorities and inhabitants. Our research focus on characteristics of urban projects with the case of Livradois Forez: a French rural and mountain area localized in center of France where the Regional Natural Park developed a process of revitalizing small centers. In this article, we show that particularities in rural context led to new and shared methodology and to innovative system of actors contrasted with urban realities. This network becomes local development authority who manage the development and realization of revitalizing projects. Furthermore, we show that these innovations are the result of ten years with local experimentations without State's support but are fragilized by nowadays austerity strategies and new national (top down) programs with rural considerations.","Miot, Yoan;Dubeaux, Sarah",Journal,Territoire en Mouvement,2023-01-01,Université Gustave Eiffel,Livradois Forez ;  revitalization ;  rural planning ;  small rural centres ;  urban development project
Current Situation and Development of Causes of Secondary Lining Crack in Loess Tunnel and Countermeasures,"In this study, the current research shortcomings and future development of causes of secondary lining cracks in loess tunnels and countermeasures are discussed from three aspects: research methods, crack causes, and treatment measures. The main conclusions are drawn as follows. (1) The research methods of loess tunnel lining cracks mainly include investigation and analysis, numerical simulation, monitoring and measurement, theoretical analysis, model test, and field test. The investigation, analysis, monitoring, and measurement methods are usually used in the construction stage, the numerical analysis method is usually used in the operation stage, and theoretical analysis, model test, and field test are typically used as the extension of research depth. (2) The secondary lining cracks are classified. The secondary lining cracks in loess tunnels are mainly distributed at tunnel arches and sidewalls. The cracks on arches are mostly longitudinal, while those on sidewalls are mainly longitudinal, circumferential, and oblique. (3) Lining cracks are caused by five factors, i.e., engineering geological conditions, surrounding rock environment deterioration, improper design and construction, structural material deterioration, and natural (man-made) destruction. The structure and engineering characteristics of loess are the internal causes of lining cracks, and the water′s role is the key factor and the main external cause. (4) At present, crack treatment mainly includes two types: cause treatment and reinforcement. The keys to cause treatment are water control and performance improvement of surrounding rock to reduce the lining stress. Reinforcement measures mostly adopted measures such as internal grouting and external steel plate. Finally, some shortcomings are pointed out from the aspects of mechanism research, crack classification, and crack treatment technology of the secondary lining cracks of loess tunnels. A more comprehensive tunnel lining health monitoring system and theoretical model should be established in the future. The fine modeling analysis should be conducted to establish the intuitive relationship between crack morphology and causes. Attention should be paid to the innovation of crack treatment materials and means.","Qiao, Xiong;Yang, Xin",Journal,Tunnel Construction,2023-01-01,Lanzhou University of Technology,cause analysis ;  countermeasures ;  loess tunnel ;  secondary lining cracks
PIXEL: Challenges of Designing a Professional Board Game for Astronomy Education,"PIXEL - Picture (of) the Universe is a board game developed by INAF - Italian National Institute for Astrophysics in collaboration with GAME Science Research Center. The game simulates the astrophysics research environment, particularly emphasising the observation and study of cosmic bodies at different resolutions. Image resolution is a crucial element in astrophysics, but the intrinsic complexity and challenges of making high-resolution images of the distant Universe are not easily and generally perceivable. We envisioned PIXEL driven by this challenge. Games intended to engage students with science either concentrate on the contents to foster the learning process or focus on life skills solicited by scientific practices. Game mechanics are then either a leverage of scientific knowledge or a science-like behavioural model, depending on the expected outcome of the game-based learning process. In addition to that, game-based learning in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) generally is designed by science practitioners and science communication and education experts. The design process of PIXEL has been a novel joint effort between scientists, science communicators, professional game designers, and game-market and award advisors. We produced a game in which the mechanics are the core of scientific learning, implicitly telling about science while making the player experience it. The innovation of this process is to obtain a game that encountered positive feedback both from the community of game experts and the educational context. The final output is a professional board game suitable for STEM education that promotes scientific citizenship in the audience. In this work, we discuss the game design process and describe how we included our scientific educational messages of image resolution and research dynamics as processes within the game mechanics without making them explicit during the gameplay. We also present a preliminary engagement evaluation of PIXEL and its efficacy in delivering implicit scientific messages through its mechanics.","Inchingolo, Giannandrea;Toniolo, Rachele;Varano, Stefania;Ligabue, Andrea;Ricciardi, Sara",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning,2023-01-01,"Istituto Nazionale Di Astrofisica, Rome;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;Osservatorio Astrofisico Di Arcetri;Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia;GAME Science Research Center",Astrophysics ;  Game design ;  Game-based learning ;  High school education ;  Intersection of professionalisms

Overview of green railway engineering and discrimination of its key issues for development,"Through literature review, this paper sorted out the research status and deficiencies in the field of green railway engineering, and pointed out the key issues for developing green railway engineering and the research framework for improving green railway construction capacity. Based on China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) and Web of Science, the bibliometric analysis method is developed to analyze the number of documents and keywords using the knowledge mapping software CiteSpace. The results are as follows. In terms of green railway engineering, the research topics in China are concentrated at different stages. The project practice results are rich, and part of the evaluation index systems are formed based on relevant laws and policies. The research topics abroad are relatively scattered. The environmental protection measures are highly operable, but the evaluation criteria are lack of pertinence. Generally, there is a good understanding foundation at home and abroad, but the systematic understanding is insufficient. There is a good practical basis and a common policy basis, but a systematic evaluation system has not been formed and the evaluation indicators lack the characteristics of railway engineering. In terms of green construction capacity, the existing green construction technologies are maturing, but a standardized system has not been formed, especially in the railway field. The existing green construction capacity research is more targeted at manufacturing enterprises and construction enterprises, which is less instructive to railway engineering enterprises, and there is a gap in the research of green railway construction capacity. The key issues for the development of green railway engineering are refined and their interrelationships are discussed, which include development and promotion of evaluation standards for green railway engineering, classification and innovation of green railway construction technology, identification and construction of green railway construction capacity. Finally, a research framework for the improvement of green railway construction capacity is given. The results can provide ideas and directions for future research and ultimately promote the sustainable development of green railway engineering.","Wang, Qinge;Cheng, Yating;Tang, Juanjuan;Wang, Mengjun",Journal,Journal of Railway Science and Engineering,2023-01-01,Central South University,green railway construction capacity ;  green railway engineering ;  identification of the basic problems ;  literature review ;  research framework
DeepNet: Dynamic Detection of Malwares Using Deep Learning Techniques,"The innovation of technologies has become ubiquitous and imperative in day-today lives. Consequently, there has been a massive upsurge in malware evolution, which generates a substantial security hazard to organizations and individuals. This advancement in the competencies of malware opens new cybersecurity research dimensions in malware detection. It is quite impossible for anti-virus applications using traditional signature-based methods to find novel malware that incurs high overhead with respect to memory and time. This is because malware developers explore new methodologies to avoid these traditional malware defense approaches. To solve the problem, machine learning algorithms are used to learn the distinctions between malware and benign apps automatically. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning approaches that are constructed on handmade features are rather ineffective against these elusive practices and need more efforts owing to feature-engineering. To overcome such limitations, this work proposes a well-defined malware detection system called DeepNet based on deep learning techniques. In this work, we focus on the application of deep learning frameworks for malware detection by evaluating their effectiveness when malware is represented by high-level and low-level features, respectively. In this paper, two deep learning models, Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) are utilized to extract better features. SoftMax and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) classifiers are utilized in the malware discovery and classification. Comprehensive experiments are achieved on four benchmark malware datasets namely, Malimg dataset, BIG 2015 dataset, MaleVis dataset, and Malicia dataset. The outcomes implies that the proposed hybrid architecture can sense new malware trials with improved correctness and minimal false positive rates in comparison with the conservative malware prediction systems while preserving least computational time. The proposed hybrid framework is also unfailing and operative against complication outbreaks in malware recognition.","Nivaashini, M.;Soundariya, R. S.;Vishnupriya, B.;Tharsanee, R.

NATURE VERSUS NURTURE: THE INFLUENCE OF CLASSROOM CREATIVE CLIMATE ON RISK-TAKING PREFERENCES OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS,"Engineering companies are increasingly placing more value on creativity and innovation as they are the key to solving wicked problems. However, engineers often avoid taking the risks that are necessary for innovation to occur due to the uncertainty associated with creative ideas. As design researchers and educators, it is crucial that we identify ways to foster creativity and innovation in engineering education and examine how our classroom practices may either restrict or encourage students' willingness to take risks. This study makes a first attempt at answering these questions by investigating the role of creative climate in engineering education by exploring the relationship between individual preferences for creative risk-taking and perception of creative climate in the classroom, as well as the link between creative climate perception and individual creative-risk taking actions. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between creative climate and creative risk-taking in other fields, but this study expands on those findings by examining this relationship in engineering classrooms. The results indicate a positive relationship between willingness to take risks and perception of creative climate, with creative climate influencing concept screening preferences. Class type and level were also shown to influence this relationship. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the need for establishing a creative climate in engineering classrooms to support innovation.","Peng, Aoran;Menold, Jessica;Miller, Scarlett R.",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2023-01-01,Pennsylvania State University,design decision making ;  design education ;  design methodology ;  design theory and methodology ;  risk-taking

Some Aspects of the Necessity of Studying the Concept of the “Household” in the Conditions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"The research aims to substantiate the need for studying the concepts of “household” and “household finance.” The research argues that there is no universal and universally accepted definition of the household in economic science. There are disputes about the possibility of considering household (population) finance as an independent scientific category. Simultaneously, the need for a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of household activities is substantiated. This paper provides the rationale for studying the concept of “household.” Innovation (in the case of its development and implementation) in relation to this concept can be understood as an implemented management method in organizing planning or a significantly improved process that increases the effectiveness of studying the household’s functioning. In this case, innovation corresponds to the current socio-economic needs of society. This innovation can be attributed to the so-called process innovations, meaning new approaches in various areas of human activity: educational activities, management systems, mass services, etc. Thus, households shape the demand and supply of goods and services. In this regard, on the one hand, marketing activity calls for the use of the principle to produce the product that will be demanded in a given period. On the other hand, this activity also involves predicting a potential consumer’s future demand for a particular product. In the era of market relations, universities of many humanitarian fields (especially economic profiles), as well as engineering and technical universities, must meet the spirit of the times to become centers of growth of economic knowledge. Universities are a good environment for creating innovation.","Dautov, Yalkun U.",Book Series,Environmental Footprints and Eco-Design of Products and Processes,2023-01-01,Bishkek State University named after Academician Kusein Karasaev,Deposits ;  Expenses ;  Household ;  Innovation ;  Property ;  Research University ;  Revenues ;  Savings ;  Transformation ;  Universities ;  University 4.0
The Technopreneurial Hub: An Innovative Entrepreneurial Approach to Minimise Clothing and Textile Waste,"The clothing and textile industry contribute over all 4% share of global greenhouse gas emissions that starts from initial raw material extraction up until the end-of-use disposal. The root cause being mass-produced fast fashion that is easily and cheaply replaced thus resulting in very large volumes of unwanted clothing that has to be dealt with effectively including the leftover fabrics and offcuts. The ""Sustainability Clothing and Textile Project"" took shape in 2019 where the students from a University of Technology based in South Africa were tasked to use off cut (leftover fabric edges and trims) fabrics from finished garments in the laboratory that would have otherwise been thrown away as waste and ended on the landfill sites. The project objectives were for the learners to 'think out of the box', be innovative and use critical thinking skills to create meaningful products while introducing the concept of sustainability and technopreneurial skills. Technopreneurship refers to the practice of combining technology and entrepreneurship, where individuals or organizations leverage technological innovations and advancements to create, develop, and manage new ventures or business opportunities. Technopreneurs are individuals who identify and capitalize on technology-based business ideas, utilizing their entrepreneurial skills to bring these ideas to fruition. Through this research we focus on providing an entrepreneurial support, addressing job creation and curriculum development. The research will also address the societal challenges in South Africa for the vulnerable sections of the society for whom these opportunities are limited and at the same time generating new entrepreneurs or increasing accessibility to the job market, creating hope for the future.","Patnaik, Sweta",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2023-01-01,CPUT,curriculum delivery ;  engineering education ;  entrepreneurship ;  technopreneurship ;  waste management

Key papers, theories, findings, and conclusions in the field are discussed in this review. The review revealed that innovation adoption has been extensively studied in multiple disciplines over decades. However, most empirical research and theory development has taken place in the context of information technologies (IT) and their adoption in various industries and sectors. Research has mainly focused on individual acceptance and adoption of technology, which is less appropriate in healthcare due to its complex organizational structures, processes, and highly skilled workforce with significant social influence. Research into organizational adoption of innovation has been conducted, but these models have generally been utilized less in research and practice, both in general and specifically in healthcare. Within healthcare literature, innovation adoption has been recognized as a complex and challenging issue with multiple factors influencing success. However, research and theory development have generally been more limited in this setting. The review concludes with suggestions to bring learning from disciplines with stronger theory development to the healthcare setting. A novel conceptual model specific to healthcare is posited, accounting for the complexity of the system and understanding the process through a holistic approach. This model should be useful to and useable by any healthcare innovation stakeholder, from clinicians, to industry, to policy makers, as well as by researchers in this field.","Bell, Harry;Rees, Daniel;Huxtable-Thomas, Louisa;Rich, Nicholas;Miller, Edward;Thomas, Roderick",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2023-01-01,Swansea University,Acceptance ;  Adoption ;  Healthcare ;  Innovation ;  Technology
Entrepreneurship Education in Engineering Courses: Critical Success Factors,"The teaching of entrepreneurship in engineering study programs is an understudied area of research. In an ever-changing economy where continuous innovation (much of it originating from engineering) is a prerequisite for a country's competitiveness and business growth, a purely technical education for engineers appears insufficient to provide organizations with a comprehensive contribution. The growing recognition of this contribution has led higher education institutions (HEIs) offering engineering study programs, which did not previously include entrepreneurship modules in their curricula, to introduce curricular units (CU) to fill this gap and encourage their students to explore the commercial potential of their research/technologies. This study reflects on various aspects related to the introduction of CU about entrepreneurship in the curricula of engineering courses through a literature review supplemented by observations resulting from participation in processes leading to the incorporation of CU entrepreneurship in engineering courses. We identified several factors that can contribute to the success of entrepreneurship in these study programs: (i) the emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship policies in society; (ii) the involvement of the institution and its leaders in the curricula change; (iii) the presence of teaching staff with a profile suitable for teaching entrepreneurship; (iv) students' favorable attitude towards entrepreneurship. Additionally, our reflection suggests that defining the objectives of the curricular unit should consider the specificities of engineering courses. Furthermore, the selection of content should take into account the students' need to develop the essential skills required for creating a business. The study concludes that adopting a more practical approach oriented towards creating new enterprises, involving entrepreneurs in teaching, and providing facilitating conditions for the development of business ideas within the institution are essential. By identifying various factors that can contribute to the success of introducing entrepreneurship subjects in engineering courses, the paper offers valuable insights for educational institutions to understand and address potential obstacles during the implementation process. The paper also contributes to the debate and sharing of best practices among educators and researchers.","Bilau, José Jacinto;Santos, Maria Teresa",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2023-01-01,Instituto Politécnico de Beja,Engineering Education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Entrepreneurship Education

Research progress and prospects of standardized testing and assessment for nanobiomaterials,"Nanobiomaterials, as nanotechnology-derived biomaterials, are referred to those biomaterials whose structures or components exhibit novel and significantly changed properties when their dimensions are at the nanoscale (1–100 nm). Hence, due to the unique features, nanobiomaterials have been extensively applied to targeted drug delivery, medical imaging, tissue engineering, biosensing as well as cosmetics over the past few decades. Meanwhile, the new characteristics of nanobiomaterials can also bring potential risks in biological safety together with performance. Currently, China has played a large role in the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology in the world in quite a lot of benefits related fields since there are the most abundant nano-related publications. Additionally, since National Technical Committee 279 on Nanotechnology of Standardization Administration of China was founded in 2005, China has released more than 100 national standards in the field of nanobiomaterials and over 30 related national standard plans are under development. Moreover, the industry standards for medical devices containing nanomaterials in China have been vigorously pushed forward. In the past China tended to publish scientific papers for original research, but now analytic data have shown an exponential growth in the nanobiomaterials related patents, about more than 1700 cases. However, nanotechnology translation is far behind in our country. There are very few real nano-products in the biomedical field. As for the translation from nanobiomaterials to biomedical applications, there are still so many critical issues which need to be addressed urgently, mainly including quality control and biosafety evaluation. The major challenges consist in the accurate measurement of physicochemical properties for nanobiomaterials and the setup of nano-biosafety knowledge system. Although some advanced techniques can give a valuable understanding of nanobiomaterials, especially for some special scenarios involving the presence of nanobiomaterials in complex matrices to confirm nano-content labeling as well as nanobiomaterial release from medical devices and so on. The repeatability and applicability of these measurements based on advanced techniques are still limited so far, which can be improved by standardized testing. In addition, there is still a lack of standardized biological assays as well as experimental animal models for biosafety evaluation. Standardization is the bridge of innovation-driven development as an indispensable way to achieving the repeatability and reproducibility of new technologies and large-scale production. It can also push the marketization and internationalization of these new advanced technologies and be very helpful to promote China transformation from “Made in China” to “Chinese Standards”. Therefore, the standardized testing will definitely provide much more accurate and reliable information regarding the characterization of physicochemical properties and risk-benefit evaluation of nanobiomaterials. In order to offer a strong support and reference for nanobiomaterial development and nanotechnology translation in our country, this review summarizes the current situation of standardized testing, existing issues and development trend of physicochemical characterization and biosafety evaluation for nanobiomaterials as well as the related products. As new strategic and cutting-edge materials around the world, the development and application of nanobiomaterials will be bound to further improve the overall medical efficiency and support the national strategy of healthy in China in the future.","Liu, Ying;Wu, Meiyu;Liu, Yi;Gao, Jie;Wang, Xiaoping;Chen, Kuan;Wen, Hairuo;Chen, Liang;Shao, Anliang;Xiao, Baiquan;Ge, Guanglu;Xie, Liming",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,National Medical Products Administration;National Institutes for Food and Drug Control;National Center for Nanoscience and Technology Beijing;GBA Research Innovation Institute for Nanotechnology,biosafety evaluation ;  conversion ;  nanobiomaterials ;  physicochemical characterization ;  standard

Education in the conditions of war: advantages and disadvantages,"The research aims to study the peculiarities of education in wartime. Despite many challenges that have arisen as a result of Russian aggression against Ukraine, the modern higher education system has development opportunities. The first of these is international academic mobility, which provides opportunities for teachers and students to attend leading European universities. The second is the intensive introduction of information technology into the educational process and the professionalization of teachers. The third is the use of flexible learning technologies, and the fourth is a cooperation between Ukrainian and foreign higher education institutions. The fifth possibility is the introduction of the ""lifelong learning"" model, and the sixth is distance learning, which can be a full-fledged form of education in some specialties. For students, this form of education allows them to study and gain practical experience at the same time, and for teachers to work in education and other fields, passing on practical experience to students. The seventh possibility is to improve the territorial organization of higher education in Ukraine, in particular, to relocate higher education institutions from areas where active hostilities are taking place to large cities. Improving the territorial organization of higher education in Ukraine (relocation of higher education institutions to large cities from areas where active hostilities are taking place) is worthy of attention. Finally, the ability to identify hidden problems in the higher education system and work on solving their causes. The key is to identify threats timely and develop mechanisms to mitigate their impact. Each opportunity should be realized to the fullest extent possible. All these points should be considered in the operational plans for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Higher Education in Ukraine for 2022-2032. It is concluded that technological influences are used in modern life to achieve various goals, including obtaining confidential information. User training and increased technical protection are the best defenses against social engineering attacks. To reduce the occurrence of social engineering attacks, technical protection is needed to help prevent such attacks.","Khrapatyi, Serhii;Levchenko, Anton;Venhrynovych, Andrii;Ponomarenko, Natalia;Shyian, Oksana",Journal,Multidisciplinary Science Journal,2023-01-01,European University;Mykolayiv National Agrarian University;Interregional Academy of Personnel Management;Zhytomyr Polytechnic State University;Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University,distance learning ;  education reforms ;  higher education ;  innovation potential ;  martial law ;  state engineering
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE BUILDING DATA WAREHOUSE (BDW) LINE TO ENSURE QUALITY AND PROCESS CONTROL IN CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE,"This paper focuses on introducing new procedures for control processes in the area of quality monitoring and the progress of the construction of linear structures, such as roads, railways, or engineering networks. It emphasizes automation and streamlining of processes, which includes efforts to reduce manual labor and increase efficiency through digitization. Digitization is a key element of this approach, as it allows for easier transfer and analysis of data, leading to progress and more accurate evaluation of outputs. This process is important in the context of dynamic development and growing service requirements in the field of surveying and geodetic work in the construction sector. The development of legislation and the goal of digitizing public administration are the main factors determining the need for these new procedures. The digitization of public administration aims to improve the efficiency and transparency of public services, which aligns with the objectives of this article. The result of these innovative procedures should not only be a reduction in costs for human activity and manual labor but also an increase in the accuracy and reliability of evaluated outputs. This should lead to better decision-making and planning in the construction sector, potentially bringing significant time and resource savings.

University-Industry Technology Transfer and Coproduction: A Case Study,"Universities can promote entrepreneurship and innovation both by training professionals and by offering knowledge resulting from their research. Traditionally, industrial development has benefited from technology transfer (TT) from universities. Although the TT is very known and used, co-ownership and economic exploitation after a TT process remain a challenge to formal University-Industry agreements. In this study we discuss the notion of university-industry coproduction as a means to address formal agreement after TT. The case study is a Brazilian national Program, called CEURS - “Training and Studies for Urban and Regional Sustainability”. The main goal of CEURS is to provide practical training to individuals and teams on sustainability matters, focused on how to fulfill the UN’s SDG 2030 Agenda locally (i.e., how to empower projects that are already at the community level so that they can become city programs). To do so, CEURS project was led by an academic network, sponsored by national government agencies. The project was developed at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) by academics and students of the Graduate Program in Engineering and Knowledge Management, from the research group on Co-production in Digital Commons, in Brazil. CEURS team has developed CEURS Platform, a digital education platform, currently in the process of being publicly transferred to be augmented and operated at a national level. In this article, we analyze the institutional technology transfer agreements available to CEURS regarding the need to meet project demands for technology licensing, technology transfer, open innovation, and joint patents. We offer a critical analysis of a current regulatory process in technology transfer in an academic project that combines education, development, and social demand fulfillment. We conclude that a technology transfer licensing agreement can include principles that may fulfill CEURS project needs for nationalization through university-industry co-production. This study contributes to academics, innovation offices, policymakers, and university managers in formulating diligent and fast processes and strategies through technology transfers.","Guimarães, Fernanda;dos Santos Pacheco, Roberto Carlos;Carneiro, Mônica Ramos;Gauthier, Fernando Alvaro Ostuni",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2023-01-01,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,CEURS Platform ;  Coproduction ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge transfer ;  Technology transfer ;  University-Company
Decision Making for Knowledge Management in the Tequila Sector: A Fuzzy Logic Model,"Knowledge management creates value for organizations, allowing them to be more innovative, productive, and competitive if that knowledge is used appropriately. Through this management, vital information is created and disseminated systematically and efficiently, and at the same time, knowledge learning is adopted, transformed, shared, and applied. This research analyzes decision-making for knowledge management in a mature low-tech sector, such as Tequila in Mexico. At the same time, it generates a predictive model of knowledge management that allows innovation in this sector by combining knowledge of modern technologies and ancestral knowledge in manufacturing the product, along with providing support to public policymakers and decision-makers to support small producers and rural communities. The methodological strategy used is an expert system through fuzzy logic, starting from a data set based on the patterns found in a Bayes network. The results show that the most relevant variables in decision-making for knowledge management in the Tequila sector are modern technologies, ancestral knowledge, and the Denomination of Origin. Under the above, it could be inferred that the ancestral knowledge variable is the most influential in achieving high values in managing knowledge management -the output variable preserving the value of a product with a designation of origin.","Martínez-Velasco, Antonieta;Terán-Bustamante, Antonia",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2023-01-01,Universidad Panamericana,Bayes network ;  Decision making ;  Fuzzy logic model ;  Knowledge management ;  Low tech ;  Machine learning ;  México ;  Tequila sector
"Knowledge creation, knowledge impact and knowledge diffusion: how do they connect with higher education?","Knowledge-based economy causes changes in the higher education system: university graduates must have the ability to constantly learn and improve their skills, generate and disseminate new knowledge, form and multiply the knowledge capital of business. This paper aims to investigate a pairwise interconnection between higher education indicators and sets of parameters characterizing knowledge creation, impact, and diffusion. The following higher education indicators are used: expenditure on education, tertiary enrollment, graduates in science and engineering, tertiary inbound mobility, researcher, gross expenditure on R&D, top 3 global corporate R&D investors, top 3QS university ranking. Knowledge creation indicators are patents by origin, PCT patents by origin, utility models by origin, scientific and technical articles, citable documents, H-index. Knowledge impact is characterized through labor productivity growth, new businesses, software spending, ISO 9001 quality certificates, high-tech manufacturing. Knowledge diffusion parameters include intellectual property receipts, production and export complexity, high-tech exports, ICT services exports. The information base of the study is the data of the Global Innovation Index Report from the World Intellectual Property Organization for 40 European countries (selected depending on the availability of statistics) for 2022, research method – Canonical Correlation Analysis. The strongest positive correlation was found between higher education indicators and knowledge creation parameters. The second position takes connection between higher education indicators and knowledge diffusion parameters, the third – between higher education indicators and knowledge impact indicators.

"Technological Tools, KM and Innovation in SMEs","Knowledge management has emerged over the past decade as one of the key issues at the heart of modern organisations. Knowledge management as a process that supports an organisation in finding, selecting, organising and disseminating relevant information and expertise, essential for activities such as problem solving, learning, strategic planning and decision making. Knowledge management is an emergent system of organisational design and operational principles, processes, organisational structures, applications and technologies that help knowledge workers increase their creativity and ability to deliver commercial value. The issue of knowledge management is primarily considered in the context of large organisations. In contrast, relatively little attention has been paid in the literature to the specifics of knowledge management in small and medium-sized enterprises. The focus of researchers attention on large enterprises is partly due to the fact that the larger the enterprise, the greater the challenges regarding key knowledge management processes, including, for example, knowledge dissemination. Awareness of the organisation's knowledge is higher in SMEs than in large organisations. Due to their size, SMEs do not have the same problems in communicating and disseminating knowledge within the organisation as large enterprises, so formal knowledge dissemination activities and processes are less frequently implemented. In addition, formal approaches to knowledge management use IT systems, which are costly and mostly designed for large organisations. Financial barriers and the different needs of SMEs therefore mean that formal knowledge management may not be fully implemented in SMEs. Therefore, it becomes important to examine the use of technological tools in knowledge management and their impact on the innovativeness of a company from the SMEs. The main research objective of the article is to analyse the use of technological tools for knowledge management in companies operating in the Polish SME market and their impact on innovation. Specific research objectives included assessing the level of ICT use in SMEs, identifying the level of employment of ICT specialists by SMEs, identifying the use of websites, social media and cloud computing by SMEs, identifying technological tools supporting knowledge management in SMEs, assessing the impact of technological knowledge management tools on innovation in SMEs. The research was conducted in 2022 using the CATI method among 600 randomly selected SMEs operating on the Polish market. The majority of SMEs do not employ employees with specialised digital competences. Such people are employed by less than 8% of small and 30% of medium-sized companies. The situation is completely different in large companies - almost 3/4 of them employ ICT specialists. Employers have a problem recruiting digitally competent employees. For this reason, outsourcing IT services is becoming increasingly popular, especially among small and medium-sized companies. Companies that use technological knowledge management tools are more innovative.","Wielgórka, Dariusz",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2023-01-01,Częstochowa University Of Technology,Innovation ;  Knowledge management KM ;  SME ;  Technological tools KM
Exploring Knowledge Management From a Software Engineering Perspective,"Context: The knowledge domain of software engineering (SE) gradually expands due to fast emerging technologies and complex organisational processes. The software industry represents a special focus of interest from a Knowledge Management (KM) perspective, as it is characterized by high employee turnover, a high level of outsourced projects, and an accelerated pace of technology innovations. Knowledge management can substantially influence SE knowledge's life cycle, contributing to better structuring of organisational processes of knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, and knowledge sharing. Reflecting on the trends for SE automation with artificial intelligence tools, KM approaches can enable companies and professionals to reconsider the future of SE work. Purpose: The present research aims to identify and investigate how implementing knowledge management principles and processes within the software engineering domain can facilitate the future transformation of software-related jobs. Based on a conceptual model, built upon the literature review, the paper analyses the quantitative data, collected from 91 software experts. Evaluating the impact of both organizational and domain types of SE knowledge, the discussion evaluates the unique value-adding SE processes along with models of how to explore AI applications to automate the SE domain. Results: The outcomes of the analysis identify the models of structuring knowledge management processes in SE both within the technological domain and organisational layers. The discussion section establishes suitable KM methods and approaches for supporting SE job transformation. It identifies the main knowledge management integration practices, demonstrating how combining KM with AI-based innovations may change the SE knowledge flow, improving substantially SE activities like onboarding new team members, monitoring software documentation, version control, and error tracking.","Georgiev, Dilyan",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM",2023-01-01,Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski,AI ;  Knowledge management ;  Knowledge sharing ;  Software engineering ;  software industry ;  Software process improvement

Improved Path Testing Using Multi-Verse Optimization Algorithm and the Integration of Test Path Distance,"Emerging technologies in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced optimization methodologies have opened up a new frontier in the field of software engineering. Among these methodologies, optimization algorithms such as the multi-verse optimizer (MVO) provide a compelling and structured technique for identifying software vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing software robustness and reliability. This research investigates the feasibility and efficacy of applying an augmented version of this technique, known as the test path distance multiverse optimization (TPDMVO) algorithm, for comprehensive path coverage testing, which is an indispensable aspect of software validation. The algorithm’s versatility and robustness are examined through its application to a wide range of case studies with varying degrees of complexity. These case studies include rudimentary functions like maximum and middle value extraction, as well as more sophisticated data structures such as binary search trees and AVL trees. A notable innovation in this research is the introduction of a customized fitness function, carefully designed to guide TPDMVO towards traversing all possible execution paths in a program, thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage. To further enhance the comprehensiveness of the test, a metric called ‘test path distance’ (TPD) is utilized. This metric is designed to guide TPDMVO towards paths that have not been explored before. The findings confirm the superior performance of the TPDMVO algorithm, which achieves complete path coverage in all test scenarios. This demonstrates its robustness and adaptability in handling different program complexities.","Fakhouri, Hussam N.;Al Hwaitat, Ahmad K.;Ryalat, Mohammad;Hamad, Faten;Zraqou, Jamal;Maaita, Adi;Alkalaileh, Mohannad;Sirhan, Najem N.",Journal,International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies,2023-01-01,Middle East University Jordan;Al Ain University;Sultan Qaboos University;The University of Jordan;Al-Balqa Applied University;University of Petra,artificial intelligence (AI) ;  multiverse optimizer ;  optimization ;  path testing
"A perspective for identifying intersections among the social, engineering, and geosciences to address water crises","Reliable access to safe water is essential for health, wellbeing, and the livelihoods of people. However, water security innovations benefit when engineering and geoscience decisions consider systemic human, social, and organizational realities, needs, and goals. Indeed, true innovation that leads to water security requires intensively inclusive and iterative processes to occur at multiple scales of analysis across diverse sciences—for this, expertise and knowledge across the varied sciences is essential to facilitate such convergent, transdisciplinary research. Here, we articulate our perspective for identifying points of intersection and working across disciplinary boundaries to address water crises. Our perspective takes a multidimensional view of community, organization, family, and individual resilience in the face of natural and human hazards. It builds upon previous models of cumulative water related risk by nuancing the relationships amongst levels of analysis, and expanding the idea of cumulative impacts to include interactive impacts (e.g., buffering, enhancing, effects and other moderators), mediated effects (i.e., mechanisms of impact), as well as additive and suppressive linkages amongst risk and protective factors.","Weems, Carl F.;Poleacovschi, Cristina;Ikuma, Kaoru",Journal,Frontiers in Water,2023-01-01,College of Engineering;Iowa State University,contextual ;  crises ;  disasters ;  integrative ;  natural hazards ;  resilience ;  traumatic ;  water

Blockchain Technology for Traceability and Transparency in the Onion Industry of the Philippines,"The global food supply chain has various obstacles, such as guaranteeing food safety, combatting fraud, and satisfying consumer needs for openness and sustainability. Traceability and openness have emerged as essential components for accomplishing these objectives. Traceability and transparency concerns harm customer trust and the livelihood of smallholder farmers in the Philippines onion sector. This study investigates the possibility of blockchain technology as a solution to these issues. This research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to evaluate the current traceability and transparency measures in the onion business. The results indicate that stakeholders throughout the sector consider the present methods less than sufficient, with perceptions varying within stakeholder groups. These results are consistent with the literature on the global agri-food supply chain that emphasizes the lack of openness. In order to assess the potential effect of blockchain technology, a meta-analysis of current studies demonstrates its potential for boosting traceability and transparency in diverse agricultural situations. The blockchain's unique characteristics, like decentralization and immutability, can potentially transform the onion business. For effective adoption, however, certain obstacles, such as scalability concerns and regulatory compliance, must be solved. This research presents strategic approaches to overcome identified hurdles based on their identification. Enhancing technology infrastructure, resolving regulatory compliance, and increasing stakeholder involvement are the focal points of the strategies. To overcome these obstacles and realize the revolutionary potential of blockchain technology, collaboration among industry participants, governments, and technology suppliers is crucial. This research adds to the knowledge of adopting blockchain technology in the agriculture sector. It serves as a helpful case study for nations wishing to harness blockchain technology in their agricultural businesses. By adopting these tactics, the onion sector may place itself at the forefront of technical innovations, supporting sustainable growth and a transparent and efficient supply chain.","Armas, Kenneth L.;Jacoba, Feliciana P.;Hipolito, Marilene C.",Journal,International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology,2023-01-01,Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology (NEUST),Agricultural engineering ;  Agricultural sustainability ;  Blockchain technology ;  Supply chain management ;  Supply chain transparency ;  traceability
Application of a Neural Network-based Visual Question Answering System in Preschool Language Education,"The continuous progress of modern science and technology has led to comprehensive innovations in education, and the use of information technology for teaching has become the mainstream in the current education field. For children’s preschool language education, the application of a visual question answering (VQA) system has gradually become a new development power. This research uses a Recurrent Neural Network and a VGGNet-16 network to extract features from text and images, respectively, and applies a Hierarchical Joint Attention (HJA) model to the whole VQA system. Experiment results demonstrate that the HJA model reaches the target accuracy after 125 iterations, and convergence performance is good.

INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY THINKING IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS – EXPERIENCES FROM AN ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE COURSE,"The rapid changes in the environment and our societies have raised the importance of incorporating Sustainability Thinking in all our courses. However, this is more challenging for some subject areas than others. Although Sustainability Thinking has long been a tradition in some of the engineering subjects, this is a far greater challenge for students of more abstract subjects such as Computer Science and Information Systems. The challenges in understanding sustainability are not only for our students; it is also hard for teachers to conceive how Information Systems could impact the UN SDGs in positive and negative ways. The question that many Information Systems teachers are asking is how we could incorporate Sustainability Thinking into the courses. This paper is aimed at sharing experiences from an Information Systems course on Enterprise Architecture for Enterprise Innovation, where we have integrated the ideas of Sustainability Thinking and sustainable innovation in enterprises. We have taken a step-by-step approach to introduce the basic ideas of Sustainability Thinking and to integrate them into the learning activities. The main research question addressed in this paper is how to integrate Sustainability Thinking into a course on Enterprise Architecture and Enterprise Innovation. The approach that we have taken is to integrate Sustainability Thinking as a part of the contents and activities in the course rather than enhance the syllabus by adding sustainability related content as an additional subject. The paper describes the course and how Sustainability Thinking has been integrated into the curriculum and the learning activities. An assessment of students’ awareness of sustainability and their attitudes to applying the ideas in their future work in designing IS are also presented.","Petersen, Sobah Abbas",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2023-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,CDIO Optional Standard 1 ;  Education ;  Enterprise Architecture ;  Information Systems ;  Sustainability Thinking
ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY STUDENTS’ SELF-REGULATION: A BASELINE,"Technology is evolving at a very rapid rate in today’s society. Even though engineering students get acquainted with state-of-the-art technological advancements, these often get outdated during the engineers’ careers. It is therefore of major importance that engineers learn to learn for a lifetime, in order to train their personal competencies and to keep up with technological innovations. Currently, there is no framework that defines the umbrella competency lifelong learning (LLL). It is certain, however, that self-regulation is a core and malleable competency for LLL. This research presents Flemish engineering students’ self-regulation levels, measured using the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS). The SRIS consists of three subscales: engagement in self-reflection, need for self-reflection, and insight. The scores are looked at from different angles, such as across study phases and by taking into account background variables like secondary education (SE) type and sex. In general, master students report the highest level of self-regulation. Most notably, students with a more technical SE-background report higher levels of self-regulation in the master year than in the bachelor years, whereas students with a more general SE-background do not. Male and female students’ self-regulation is at roughly the same level, but influenced by the underlying subscales.","Tuyaerts, Shan;De Laet, Tinne;Van Den Broeck, Lynn;Langie, Greet",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2023-01-01,KU Leuven,"Engineering Education ;  Lifelong Learning ;  Self-Regulation ;  Standards: 2, 3"
Developing incentive mechanisms for long-term and short-term technological innovation in major engineering projects using principal-agent theory,"Purpose: Promoting technological innovation is important to address the complexity of major engineering challenges. Technological innovations include short-term innovations at the project level and long-term innovations that can enhance competitive advantages. The purpose of this study is to develop an incentive mechanism for the public sector that considers short-term and long-term efforts from the private sector, aiming to promote technological innovation in major engineering projects. Design/methodology/approach: This study constructs an incentive model considering the differences in short-term and long-term innovation efforts from the private sector. This model emphasizes the spillover effect of long-term efforts on current projects and the cost synergy effect between short-term and long-term efforts. It also explores the factors influencing the optimal incentive strategies for the public sector and innovation strategies for the private sector. Findings: The results indicate that increasing the output coefficient of short-term and long-term efforts and reducing the cost coefficient not only enhance the innovation efforts of the private sector but also prompt the public sector to increase the incentive coefficient. The spillover effect of long-term innovation efforts and the synergy effect of the two efforts are positively related to the incentive coefficient for the public sector. Originality/value: This research addresses the existing gap in understanding how the public sector should devise incentive mechanisms for technological innovation when contractors acting as the private sector are responsible for construction within a public-private partnership (PPP) model. In constructing the incentive mechanism model, this study incorporates the private sector's short-term efforts at the project level and their long-term efforts for sustained corporate development, thus adding considerable practical significance.","Zhu, Jianbo;Chen, Jialong;Jin, Wenliang;Li, Qiming",Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2023-01-01,Southeast University;Shen-Zhong Link Administration Center,Incentive mechanisms ;  Major engineering projects ;  PPP model ;  Technological innovation
Sister-cousin TF model based on the influence of work preparedness and learning outcome,"This study analyzes how the Teaching Factory (TF) instructional model and industry relationships affect East Java Vocational School (VS) students' learning and employment preparation. The paper proposes the “sister-cousin” paradigm to improve TF quality by encouraging collaboration amongst schools with similar and distinct academic concentrations. Mixtures of observations, questionnaires, and in-depth interviews were used, with strong psychometric features of the survey tools. Eight public and private VS in six cities implemented the TF approach. The study examined the TF's infrastructure, management, soft skills, and learning implementation and found significant heterogeneity. Industry-school collaboration lagged behind TFs. Industry collaboration considerably affected the TF and joint impacts on learning outcomes, according to structural equation modeling (SEM-PLS). Learning outcomes were strongly linked to work preparation. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is changing manufacturing education, according to the report. Due to industry demands, reskilling and upskilling are urgently needed. Teaching Factories, a project-based learning method, can close the skills gap and prepare students for modern industrial jobs. The TF model in engineering education must overcome high operational expenses, infrastructure issues, and a shortage of instructors and industrial partners to be sustainable and effective. This study concludes that industrial collaboration, educational innovation, and the “sister cousin” model improve the TF learning paradigm. Vocational schools can better prepare students for the Fourth Industrial Revolution's changing labor market by addressing the listed difficulties and using the TF model. This research offers useful advice: (1) encourage regulatory oversight by the Directorate of VS or local governments to optimize TF management and make it more industry-oriented; (2) increase industry collaboration to support TF development; (3) improve curriculum relevance for prospective vocational teachers in higher education; and (4) improve vocational teachers' dual competency in subject matter expertise and industry knowledge.","Isnandar, ;Ichwanto, Muhammad Aris;Ansyorie, Mohammad Musthofa Al",Journal,Social Sciences and Humanities Open,2023-01-01,Universitas Negeri Malang,Industry collaboration ;  Learning outcome ;  Sister-cousin model ;  Teaching factory learning model ;  Work preparedness
Ex Factor: Is Leveraging Mentoring & Sponsorship to Fast Track Diverse Leadership Pipelines Underestimated in Employee Experience (EX)?,"Ever heard of the term, ""glass ceiling""? It refers to barriers women and minorities face in the workplace. Corporations around the world have tried to find solutions, to diminish advancement barriers, yet for many women, people with disabilities and young employees it seems the glass ceiling has hardened to concrete. Research shows that having a diverse workforce and leaders increases revenue and innovation. Therefore businesses must leverage an employee centric mindset to understand from their employees how to create positive employee experiences and an inclusive work environment to remain competitive in the marketplace. This paradigm shift in organisations' people management practices, benefits the whole business ecosystem. By focusing on the whole person, you are then able to create a powerful employee experience. ""Employee Experience is about creating a great work environment for people. It involves understanding the role that trust plays in the employment relationship and making sure people are listened to and have a voice in issues that impact"" (CIPD, 2020). Employees are becoming ""the consumers of the workplace,"" (Balasubramanian M, 2022) which means to unlock business performance, organisations must study the uniqueness of being human, and purposefully design work experiences from the viewpoint of employees to create a truly engaged workforce. It is well documented that minorities experience a more difficult time building support networks inside their firm, have fewer mentors, and are neglected by high-status groups, which impact their chances of moving up the leadership ladder (Ely & Thomas 2020). This article addresses diversity from the perspective of how mentoring and sponsorship facilitates psychological safety, and can be tailored to promoting more minorities in leadership positions, and at the same time enhancing the employee experience. Opening the line of communication between talented minorities and power holders through strategic partnerships is imperative for companies to thrive in the future.","Gustave, N. W.;Chapa, K.

An evolutionary game study of three parties for promoting green technology innovation in the new energy vehicle industry,"This paper focuses on how to promote green technology innovation among new energy vehicle manufacturers and the strategic changes among the government, manufacturers, and consumers in the context of green technology innovation. From the perspective of an evolutionary game, a three-party evolutionary game model is established to analyse the influence of key factors on the strategies of three parties in the case of government subsidies withdrawal, and the main results are as follows: (1) Government subsidies to manufacturers are more conducive to the development of green technology innovation. (2) Higher prices of new energy vehicles are not encouraging for manufacturers to participate in green technology innovation and for consumers to choose new energy vehicles that have adopted green innovation technology. (3) The increase of consumers' green consumption preference will reduce the government's willingness to subsidize, but it will increase the manufacturer's willingness to participate in green technology innovation. Therefore, promoting green technology innovation in the new energy vehicle industry requires strategic adjustments by the government, new energy vehicle manufacturers and consumers in different situations.","Mao, Yafei;Li, Peisi;Li, Yi",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023-01-01,University of South China,Evolutionary game ;  Green technology innovation ;  New energy vehicle

Overcoming System Complexity using Models and Knowledge Structures. Editorial Introduction to Issue 36 of CSIMQ,"Models allow us to simplify reality and give advantages to both decomposition and abstraction. Models can have various forms from textual, tabular, mathematical, and graphical to a combination of these formats. Formal models can be processed, or even executed, by machines. An engineering model must satisfy such characteristics as abstraction, understandability, accuracy, predictiveness, and inexpensiveness. Models explicitly represent knowledge of the modeled domain in a form suitable for reasoning about them and learning. Knowledge may be descriptive, structural, procedural, meta-, or heuristic. Focus on one type of knowledge during the analysis may ignore the other one. Moreover, analysis and reasoning also rely on data representation forms which may lose accuracy due to simplification and different assumptions. Therefore, completeness, correctness, and adequacy of knowledge as well as particularities of the representing structure may affect the results of knowledge processing and decision making. Therefore, the capability of models (and other structures) to represent knowledge completely, adequately, and accurately is still a matter of various research activities. This issue of CSIMQ is devoted to this matter.","Nazaruka, Erika;Robal, Tarmo",Journal,Complex Systems Informatics and Modeling Quarterly,2023-01-01,Riga Technical University;Tallinna Tehnikaülikool,Low-Code Development ;  Agent-Based Model ;  Capability ;  Design Science Research ;  Enterprise Modeling ;  Fractal Enterprise Modeling ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge Graph ;  Land Use Modeling ;  Metamodel

Research on pure mathematical problems in mining engineering and their applications,"Herein, we present some pure mathematical problems associated with mining engineering and the engineering applications of their solutions. Mining engineering, geodynamic division theory, and pure mathematics are combined to create a model of the complicated geological dynamic system of mines. Motivated by the urgent need for dynamic disaster management in the mining industry, we consider the inverse problem of the petal theorem. We address the issue and suggest an early-warning criterion for the stability of rocks around the mining tunnels. Concerning the redistribution of mine stope pressure, we established a limit theorem of peak points of ground pressure. The theorem explains the mathematical principles of some prevailing techniques in mining engineering, such as roof-cutting and mining height and speed control. Furthermore, we establish a series of mining techniques, including a novel end-mining method and a comprehensive system for dynamic disaster early warning, governance, and prevention. This research encourages the innovation of the principle of relevant mining technical methods.","Qiao, Jian Yong",Journal,Zhongguo Kexue Jishu Kexue/Scientia Sinica Technologica,2023-01-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications",coal face ;  complex dynamic system ;  conformal mapping ;  dynamic disaster ;  mining tunnel

Pushing the boundaries of innovation: the potential of ex vivo organ perfusion from an interdisciplinary point of view,"Ex vivo machine perfusion (EVMP) is an emerging technique for preserving explanted solid organs with primary application in allogeneic organ transplantation. EVMP has been established as an alternative to the standard of care static-cold preservation, allowing for prolonged preservation and real-time monitoring of organ quality while reducing/preventing ischemia–reperfusion injury. Moreover, it has paved the way to involve expanded criteria donors, e.g., after circulatory death, thus expanding the donor organ pool. Ongoing improvements in EVMP protocols, especially expanding the duration of preservation, paved the way for its broader application, in particular for reconditioning and modification of diseased organs and tumor and infection therapies and regenerative approaches. Moreover, implementing EVMP for in vivo-like preclinical studies improving disease modeling raises significant interest, while providing an ideal interface for bioengineering and genetic manipulation. These approaches can be applied not only in an allogeneic and xenogeneic transplant setting but also in an autologous setting, where patients can be on temporary organ support while the diseased organs are treated ex vivo, followed by reimplantation of the cured organ. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the differences and similarities in abdominal (kidney and liver) and thoracic (lung and heart) EVMP, focusing on the organ-specific components and preservation techniques, specifically on the composition of perfusion solutions and their supplements and perfusion temperatures and flow conditions. Novel treatment opportunities beyond organ transplantation and limitations of abdominal and thoracic EVMP are delineated to identify complementary interdisciplinary approaches for the application and development of this technique.","Iske, Jasper;Schroeter, Andreas;Knoedler, Samuel;Nazari-Shafti, Timo Z.;Wert, Leonard;Roesel, Maximilian J.;Hennig, Felix;Niehaus, Adelheid;Kuehn, Christian;Ius, Fabio;Falk, Volkmar;Schmelzle, Moritz;Ruhparwar, Arjang;Haverich, Axel;Knosalla, Christoph;Tullius, Stefan G.;Vondran, Florian W.R.;Wiegmann, Bettina",Journal,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,2023-01-01,Deutsches Zentrum für Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung e.

Innovations in a Modern Engineering Enterprise in the Context of Industry 4.0 Strategy,"Innovations are an essential part of business management in modern society. In addition to large enterprises and research and development centers, small and medium-sized enterprises also hide great innovative potential. Moreover, it is precisely the innovations that lead businesses to permanent growth and prosperity. In addition, from the point of view of Industry 4.0, innovation must be considered as an essential part of the functioning of a modern enterprise, regardless of its size. The article compares statistical indicators that capture enterprises’ innovative activity or inactivity in the Slovak Republic. Enterprises that want to define themselves as innovative should have a suitably prepared and functioning environment, while internal and external conditions are essential. However, it turns out that Slovakian companies have not created suitable conditions for innovation, and in the long term, their interest in innovation is declining. At the same time, because of the industrial revolution, many professions are also changing, and the demands for specific knowledge are not only growing for the newly created ones, but they will also require an active approach to changes, i.e., innovations. Companies must introduce an innovative approach in the education process itself, and as it shows, it will not be possible without a systemic approach.","Hricova, R.;Madzinova, R.",Journal,Journal of Engineering Sciences (Ukraine),2023-01-01,Technická Univerzita v Košiciach;Slovak Business Agency,education ;  Industry 4.0 ;  process innovation ;  product ;  small-scale enterprise

Collaborative Layout Optimization for Ship Pipes Based on Spatial Vector Coding Technique,"Ship Pipe Route Design (SPRD) has always been a challenging and critical aspect in the detailed design for various types of ships. However, existing layout methods are inefficient, existing algorithms lack consideration for collaborative layouts in practical engineering, true intelligent design has not yet been achieved, and the issue of collaborative layout of pipes has been insufficiently researched. Based on the aforementioned research status, this paper proposes a novel collaborative pipe layout method. Firstly, a high-dimensional vector encoding technique to innovate the underlying mathematical representation of pipes is proposed, breaking free from traditional constraints. Secondly, a powerful and engineering-applicable hybrid AA-SPOP algorithm is incorporated, which is based on the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithm known as Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), exhibits advantages such as high global optimization efficiency and strong adaptability. To mitigate potential issues like suboptimal local optimization and high sensitivity, this paper proposes a parameter adaptive equation and a series of optimization adjustment. Thirdly, a collaborative pipe layout method that considers support equipment is proposed. This paper effectively addresses the lack of research in this area by introducing branch pipe collaboration methods and energy zone guidance methods. Finally, through engineering simulation experiments, the paper demonstrates the efficiency, feasibility, and cutting-edge nature of the proposed collaborative layout optimization method.","Zhang, Hongshuo;Yang, Mingjun;Yang, Yuansong;Liu, Haiyang;Lin, Yan",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,"Dalian University of Technology;China Nuclear Industry 23 Construction Co., Ltd.",Heuristic hybrid algorithm ;  ship pipe and equipment collaborative layout optimization ;  ship pipe route design (SPRD) ;  vector encoding technique
What Affects the Efficiency of Science and Technology Output and Transformation in Universities?-Evidence from Chinese Universities,"Using 57 universities directly under the Ministry of Education of China from 2009 to 2017 as the research samples, the overall efficiency, technology research efficiency, result transformation efficiency and efficiency influencing factors of the transformation of scientific research results in universities were explored using the leader-follower model in two-stage network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Tobit regression model, respectively. It is found that: firstly, the overall low efficiency of the scientific research results is primarily caused by the low efficiency of the transformation stage, which is on a downward trend and has lower average efficiency than the technology research stage. The efficiency of the technology research stage is on an upward trend, while the efficiency of the transformation stage is on a downward trend. Secondly, the number of universities reaching DEA effective in results transformation stage is more than that of technology R&D stage; Thirdly, the overall efficiency and result transformation efficiency of '985' universities are better than those of non-'985' universities, but the efficiency of technology R&D is lower than that of non-'985' universities; Fourthly, regional economic strength, government's financial investment, the quality of patents, the number of papers, and the other eight factors all have an impact on efficiency.","Guo, Jinzhong;Liu, Jianan;Liao, Xueqin;Liu, Xiaoling",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,Xinjiang University of Finance and Economics,China ;  efficiency ;  efficiency influencing factors ;  Tobit ;  Transformation of scientific research results ;  two-stage network DEA model ;  university
Interdisciplinary education in the context of protection of water resources: A case study in Vietnam,"The incorporation of interdisciplinary education, a topic of significant global interest, is increasingly being recognized as a key aspect of educational innovation in Vietnam. This recognition extends to several fields, including STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education.This research aims to design and implement a STEM situation associated with the context of water protection in Vietnam for 10th-grade students in which students mobilize the knowledge of Physics (specific gravity, Archimedes' principle) and Mathematics (volume) to design a salinometer. This device measures the salinity of the water. The research methodology is based on the observed increase in saline levels in the coastal regions of Vietnam in recent years, which has had a substantial impact on agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of people. This methodology aims to provide realistic scenarios for students to address and resolve these problems. A total of forty students in the 10th grade were involved in a teaching situation that consisted of five distinct phases. Forty 10th-grade students participated in a teaching situation conducted in five phases. The results showed that the situation helped students strengthen and connect their physics and mathematics knowledge, create a vibrant learning atmosphere, enhance communication, and develop problem-solving competency. Furthermore, the teaching situation also needs to be revised regarding the measurement practices of Vietnamese students. The situation contributes to educating students' awareness of current events, protecting Vietnamese water resources, and the importance of sustainable development. In addition, we can use the same teaching process as in this research to develop other STEM teaching situations.","Dung, Tang Minh;Nga, Nguyen Thi;Thanh, Lam Thien",Journal,Journal of Education and e-Learning Research,2023-01-01,Ho Chi Minh City University of Education;Ben Tre High School for Gifted Students,Archimedes’ principle ;  Education for sustainable development ;  Interdisciplinary education ;  STEM education ;  Volume ;  Water resources
Research Progress on Performance Optimization of Micro-arc Oxidation Films on Magnesium Alloys,"Magnesium alloy is an important engineering material with many excellent physical and chemical properties, which has broad application prospects in the fields of aerospace, transportation, electronic communications, biomedicine, energy, etc. However, the application of magnesium alloy is limited by its high chemical activity, so surface treatment is required to avoid corrosion. Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) leads the working area from the Faraday area to the high-voltage discharge area, which overcomes the defects of anodic oxidation and greatly improves the overall properties of magnesium alloys. Based on the research status in China and abroad, the effects of electrolyte, particle additives and electrical parameters (current mode, voltage, current density, duty cycle, frequency and oxidation time) on the corrosion resistance, wear resistance and biological properties of the films were introduced emphatically. Then, key issues such as regulation orientation, ceramic film toughening, performance matching optimization and energy utilization were proposed. In addition, the solutions adopted by the researchers to the above problems were discussed, and the rationality was analyzed accordingly. Finally, in view of the existing problems, the future development of MAO technology of magnesium alloys was discussed. MAO films are known for higher thickness, dense structure and ceramic phase, which usually shows excellent corrosion resistance and wear resistance compared to other types of films. However, due to the film-forming characteristics of MAO process, there is inevitably a certain porosity in the ceramic films. To increase film density, researchers have explored the use of nanoparticles in the electrolyte, which can be deposited onto the film by electrophoretic adsorption or electromigration under a strong electric field. In fact, ceramic films can be brittle and prone to fatigue and peel off during wear. To address this issue, increasing the toughness can enhance the energy absorption capacity of the films and prevent the rapid crack propagation. At present, there has been little research on the toughening of magnesium alloy ceramic films, which can be deepened in the future. Studies were also made to introduce a lubricating phase, such as graphite, to enhance anti-friction performance of the films. It has been found that the single factor experiment may not accurately capture the influence of process parameters on films, which is due to the interaction between variables. Therefore, the relationship between the process parameters and the film properties is nonlinear, and when a certain critical value is exceeded, the film properties will deteriorate. In addition, magnesium alloys are commonly used in biological applications, where there are also checks and balances between biological properties, such as degradation rates and bacterial inhibition. Therefore, optimizing the matching between properties is key to improving the overall performance of the films. Due to the complexity of MAO process, there is no complete explanation of the film formation mechanism. Thus, basic research should be further strengthened to explore the thermodynamics and kinetics of film formation. In recent years, the research direction tends to solidify, and there is little research with substantial innovation. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a richer and more scientific research system on the basis of the previous work. Last but not least, energy consumption is also an important factor that can hardly be ignored in future industrialization. Reducing energy consumption without sacrificing the quality of the film will both reduce costs and uphold the concept of sustainable development.","Zhang, Xiang;Zhou, Liang;Jia, Hong Yao;Feng, Yan Rong;Zhao, Li Bin;Fang, Da Qing",Journal,Surface Technology,2023-01-01,Chang'an University;Xi'an Jiaotong University;Ltd,biological properties ;  corrosion resistance ;  magnesium alloy ;  micro-arc oxidation ;  wear resistance

Research Progress and Application of Fe-based Amorphous Coatings,"Fe-based amorphous alloys have exceptional properties, such as high strength, high hardness, good wear resistance, and corrosion resistance, and have important applications in the fields of tribology and corrosion resistance. However, the relatively poor glass-forming ability of Fe-based amorphous alloys and their inability to be prepared in large blocks at room temperature due to their brittleness greatly limit their application as bulk materials. To effectively address this problem, the excellent properties of Fe-based amorphous alloys can be demonstrated in the form of coatings. The Fe-based amorphous coating can overcome the restrictions of size and room temperature brittleness, and its excellent properties such as high wear resistance and high corrosion resistance will be well utilized. This will improve the surface properties of the matrix material and significantly widen the range of applications for Fe-based amorphous alloys. This paper summarized the design criteria for amorphous alloy components and coating material systems in a more systematic way. The influence mechanism of thermal spraying and laser cladding technology on the properties of Fe-based amorphous coatings was analyzed, and the progress of research and application of wear resistance and corrosion resistance of Fe-based amorphous coatings were reviewed. The prospect of Fe-based amorphous coatings with high wear and corrosion resistance for application on aircraft carrier flight deck and other engineering was also discussed. In addition, the current application status and problems with Fe-based amorphous coatings were introduced, and it is predicted where they will go in terms of future development. An amorphous alloy is a type of metastable material that is extremely sensitive to composition. A slight variation in composition can result in a significant difference in glass-forming ability. Various compositional design criteria for amorphous alloys have been proposed and applied to improve the glass-forming ability. The incorporation of multiple metallic elements can improve the Fe-based amorphous formation ability due to their size differences and different negative mixing enthalpies, resulting in an increase in the entropy and long-range disorder of the system, which improves the amorphous formation ability. There are various factors affecting the wear and corrosion resistance of the coatings, such as the preparation process, elemental composition, amorphous content, porosity, surface roughness, hardness, and subsequent treatment of the coatings. The SAM series of Fe-based amorphous coatings has been developed abroad. On this basis, the non-skid deck coating for the warship has been developed. Due to the innovation in the spraying method, the surface of the coating after spraying has a special texture, and the coating has a high coefficient of friction, high abrasion resistance, impact resistance and corrosion resistance that are all superior to the existing organic non-skid coating. The high coefficient of friction is necessary to ensure that employees can perform their jobs on the deck normally. The main challenge to breaking through the technical blockade is the development and preparation of more Fe-based amorphous coating systems with high wear resistance and corrosion resistance, given the current state of domestic research. In China, the plungers of water injection pumps have already been coated with Fe-based amorphous materials by businesses, and the wear resistance is still strong even in extremely corrosive conditions. By applying the same Fe-based amorphous coating to boiler water-cooled wall panels, the equipment can have a 10-fold increase in service life. Currently, Fe-based amorphous coatings are used in the military, aerospace, marine protection, nuclear industry, storage and combustion, tunnel boring machines, boiler wall protection, and other fields.","Gao, Peng Fei;Chen, Yong Jun;Wang, Zeng Rui;Xie, Zhi Wen;Cong, Jie;Liu, Peng;Zhao, Ling;Xiong, Yun Long",Journal,Surface Technology,2023-01-01,University of Science and Technology Liaoning;Shenyang Research Institute of Foundry;Ltd,application ;  fabrication technology ;  Fe-based amorphous coating ;  properties

DevOps Pragmatic Practices and Potential Perils in Scientific Software Development,"The DevOps movement, which aims to accelerate the continuous delivery of high-quality software, has taken a leading role in reshaping the software industry. Likewise, there is growing interest in applying DevOps tools and practices in the domains of computational science and engineering (CSE) to meet the ever-growing demand for scalable simulation and analysis. Translating insights from industry to research computing, however, remains an ongoing challenge; DevOps for science and engineering demands adaptation and innovation in those tools and practices. There is a need to better understand the challenges faced by DevOps practitioners in CSE contexts in bridging this divide. To that end, we conducted a participatory action research study to collect and analyze the experiences of DevOps practitioners at a major US national laboratory through the use of storytelling techniques. We share lessons learned and present opportunities for future investigation into DevOps practice in the CSE domain.","Milewicz, Reed;Bisila, Jonathan;Mundt, Miranda;Bernard, Sylvain;Buche, Michael Robert;Gates, Jason M.;Grayson, Samuel Andrew;Harvey, Evan;Jaeger, Alexander;Landin, Kirk Timothy;Negus, Mitchell;Nicholson, Bethany L.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,"Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico",DevOps ;  Research software engineering ;  Scientific software development

Improving Product Ideation Among Engineering Undergraduates Using TRIZ and Design Thinking,"Design methodologies like the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) enable engineers to conceptualize diverse solution ideas. However, TRIZ needs to be more effective in selecting the right product or design problem to start off with. Design Thinking can complement by encouraging the development of empathy with the product users to better understand their problems. Existing research on the integration of TRIZ and Design Thinking are limited in terms of the general coverage of only the basic tools and are specific to only certain types of products. This research aims to address these limitations by proposing a TRIZ and Design Thinking (TDT) Framework that integrates most of the fundamental tools of TRIZ and are easily learnt and applied to ideate across diverse product types by even undergraduate university students with limited technical knowledge. To achieve this, Design Thinking and TRIZ was embedded into a unit taught at Monash University Malaysia. Gerontechnology-themed case studies were developed by the unit's 224 students. Over 320 diverse ideas before conceptualized by the students before converging into 32 product concepts. The TDT Frameworks has led the students to conceptualize solutions that improve the product main functions as well as supporting functions which are desired by the targeted users.","Sheng, Issac Lim Sing",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE 12th International Conference on Engineering Education, ICEED 2023",2023-01-01,Monash University Malaysia,Design Thinking ;  Product Innovation ;  TRIZ

Education 5.0: Design Thinking Goes ICT,"In Education 5.0, students are protagonists rather than passive listeners. Classes are more collaborative, individualized, and focused on developing hard and soft skills. New technologies are used to provide instruction that focuses on the student, not the technology. Digital devices, infrastructure, and platforms remain critical, but they are tools that should support learning. Design thinking is a method and process for finding solutions to complex problems. This publication presents a project funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency as part of the Innovation Labs for Education program. The focus is on the design projects of students in the field of information and communication technology. It presents the newly developed approach of the project, in which the students apply the Design Thinking process from Stanford University to their design projects, mostly in the areas of social media, web design, audio and video editing, and animation.","Oberer, Birgit;Erkollar, Alptekin",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,ETCOP Institute for Interdisciplinary Research;International Society for Engineering Education,Creativity ;  Design thinking ;  Education 5.0
Stock Market Activity and Financing Decisions in the Technology Industry: Does Upstream-Downstream Innovation Matter?,"Although technological innovation’s impact on society is well-known, the stylized facts of financing decisions in the technology sector are yet to be established. The present paper contributes towards bridging this knowledge gap. The study investigates the combined effect of stock market activity and vertical integration of upstream-downstream innovation on financing decisions of the technology industry. The study applies an econometrics-validated random effects model and a carefully screened panel dataset of 11 stock exchange-listed firms over twenty years. The study results are enlightening for this emerging market technology sector of South Africa. First, variation in vertical integration affects changes in leverage. Second, stock market activity affects leverage, but upstream-downstream innovation does matter.

The Design of Digital Platform Ecosystem Supporting Circular Economy,"Circular Economy business models rely on complex data exchange between organizations, which require a supporting digital infrastructure facilitating the circularity-related processes. In a digital platform context, value is generated not by the underlying technologies but by its allied ecosystem: community, users, developers, and integrated applications. These ecosystems come with an intrinsically complex interorganisational structure often overlooked during the development phase, leading to low platform adoption and obsolete platforms in the mid to long-term. Developed through a combined action-research and design science research approach, we propose a framework to support the design and deployment of circular economy ecosystems from a sociotechnical perspective, including practices from the requirements engineering, circular innovation ecosystems and digital platforms literature.","Marantes, Gonçalo;Soares, António Lucas;Silva, Henrique Diogo",Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2023-01-01,"Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science;Universidade do Porto",Circular Ecosystems ;  Design Science Research ;  Digital Platform Ecosystems ;  Sociotechnical Systems Design
Towards Digital Immersive Experiences for Collaborative Value Co-creation in Design,"The metaverse, which is often described as featuring a range of technologies for Extended Reality (XR) to consume and digest information from large and complex Digital Twins (DTs), is often discussed as one of the pillars of Industry 5.0 transformation.

The Application of Kansei Engineering System for Vehicle Interior Color Design,"Product innovation design is a classic problem in industry. Traditionally in the manufacture of vehicle, the focus has always been maker-centric design. The next decade is likely to witness a considerate rise in human-center-design. Especially, previous studies in vehicle interior have not dealt with the meaning of color. This paper tries to build an expert system, which is named as Kansei engineering system with qualitative and quantitative measurements which is used for vehicle interior color design. The Kansei engineering system (KES) has two kinds of operation, called Kansei engineering extraction system and Kansei engineering evaluation system. The former applies optimization to output the suitable design, and the latter is used to do semantic prediction. However, the similar system has already been existed in different fields, but the KES in vehicle interior color research is still limited. In optimization step, this study utilized genetic algorithm-backpropagation neural network to do design selection which might replace supervisors' work. Evaluations were built by training BPNN, GA-BPNN, SVM and GA-SVM to prediction the image ranking. A case about vehicle interior was provided to complete the computation. Results showed that these methods could be inspired to designers facing huge workloads not only automatic color design but other product elements as well. It is evidently clear from the findings that artificial intelligence might replace designer to make decision in conceptual or other design processes.","Li, Xin;Luh, Ding Bang;Chen, Zihao",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing and Computer Applications, ICIPCA 2023",2023-01-01,Guangdong University of Technology,color design ;  design optimization ;  kansei engineering system ;  kansei evaluation ;  machine learning ;  Vehicle interior
Construction of Electrical Automation Control System for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Based on AI Algorithm,"With the continuous innovation and development of artificial intelligence(AI) technology, it is widely used in electrical automation engineering, and the construction of electrical automation control system has become very important. As we all know, large and heavy mechanical and electrical equipment has the disadvantages of huge volume, expensive price, complicated design and operation, and harsh production environment. It is very difficult to carry such equipment at will, and it is not allowed to run and operate these equipment at will, which also requires high professional quality of designers. With the help of the highly interactive and realistic three-dimensional virtual space environment provided by this system, the seamless link between classroom theoretical study and factory field practice can be realized. Using this system, we have successfully developed the simulation training system of automobile driving, the simulation simulation of spring sorter, the simulation training system of laparoscopic surgery, the simulation program of vise clamp and rolling clamp. Therefore, it is necessary to combine AI technology to realize the reasonable construction of the system. This paper studies the development of computer and AI technology, and puts forward the application of AI technology in the field of mine electrical automation control, expounds the design idea of the system, and provides reference for research and practice.","Duan, Liying;Ma, Jinjie;Cao, Pengpeng;Wu, Jiang",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing and Computer Applications, ICIPCA 2023",2023-01-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Lanzhou University of Technology;Hubei Three Gorges Polytechnic;China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd.",Artificial intelligence algorithm ;  Electrical automation ;  Electromechanical equipment ;  System construction

The impact of political competition on low-carbon technology innovation: From the perspective of officials’ personal characteristics,"Political competition is reflected in the strategic interaction of regional government's behavioral motivation driven by “official tournament.” Especially since environmental protection was officially included in the official performance appraisal system in 2005, the interactive trend of local governments’ economic development and environmental protection is more obvious. The policy uncertainty caused by this interaction is a major challenge for the government to promote regional sustainable development. Different from previous studies that only focus on the impact of political competition on environmental governance, this paper studies the impact of political competition on the low-carbon technology innovation from the perspective of sustainable development. Combined with the characteristics of Provincial Party Secretaries and Provincial Governors, the influence mechanism of political competition on low-carbon technology innovation is analyzed based on the method of spatial dubin model. Firstly, it finds that political competition has a significant negative impact on low-carbon technology innovation in the region and its adjacent regions, which is mainly caused by the political competition of Provincial Governors, while the political competition of Provincial Party Secretaries has no significant impact on low-carbon technology innovation. Secondly, the results of the mediation effect test show that reducing the intensity of environmental regulation in exchange for economic growth and political promotion opportunities is one of the reasons why the political competition of Provincial Governors inhibits low-carbon technology innovation. Thirdly, the results of the heterogeneity test of official characteristics show that the age of Provincial Governors is less and the tenure is longer, the stronger the inhibiting effect of Provincial Governors’ political competition on low-carbon technology innovation is. These conclusions provide policy suggestions for enterprises to make environmental investment decisions under different political environments.","Deng, Yaling;Wang, Jingjing;Xia, De;Xu, Lulu",Journal,Energy and Environment,2023-01-01,Hunan University of Finance and Economics;Wuhan University of Technology,environmental regulation ;  low-carbon technology innovation ;  Official political competition ;  personal characteristics of officials ;  spatial dubin model
The expectations of generation Z regarding the university educational act in Romania: optimizing the didactic process by providing feedback,"In the university education system, the evaluation and provision of two-way teacher–student feedback are tools within the control function of educational management. Feedback can be defined as the process that takes place in the context of teacher–student interaction during university courses, both individually and in groups, for the development and achievement of the performance of the two actors involved through evaluation, appreciation, support, perception, and teaching. The research aims to develop an innovative feedback tool for the higher education engineering sector to support the improvement of learning outcome-oriented curricula and teaching activities to better meet the learning needs of Gen Z students while being relevant to the labor market and to society in general. The research had a number of subjects: 246 students (67.5% women, 32.5% men) and 7 teachers to whom two feedback instruments were applied (the SKS instrument and the standard instrument of Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu). After testing the four hypotheses, it was observed that the feedback provided by Gen Z is focused on four areas of competence: psychological, pedagogical, education management, and general impression.

Formulation of zinc foliar sprays for wheat grain biofortification: a review of current applications and future perspectives,"Agronomic biofortification of wheat grain with zinc can improve the condition of about one billion people suffering from zinc (Zn) deficiency. However, with the challenge of cultivating high-yielding wheat varieties in Zn-deficient soils and the global need to produce higher-quality food that nourishes the growing population, innovation in the strategies to deliver Zn directly to plants will come into play. Consequently, existing foliar formulations will need further refinement to maintain the high agronomic productivity required in competitive global grain markets while meeting the dietary Zn intake levels recommended for humans. A new generation of foliar fertilisers that increase the amount of Zn assimilated in wheat plants and the translocation efficiency of Zn from leaves to grains can be a promising solution. Research on the efficacy of adjuvants and emerging nano-transporters relative to conventional Zn forms applied as foliar fertilisers to wheat has expanded rapidly in recent years. This review scopes the range of evidence available in the literature regarding the biofortification of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) resulting from foliar applications of conventional Zn forms, Zn nanoparticles and novel Zn-foliar formulations. We examine the foliar application strategies and the attained final concentration of grain Zn. We propose a conceptual model for the response of grain Zn biofortification of wheat to foliar Zn application rates. This review discusses some physiological aspects of transportation of foliarly applied Zn that need further investigation. Finally, we explore the prospects of engineering foliar nano-formulations that could effectively overcome the physicochemical barrier to delivering Zn to wheat grains.","Sánchez-Palacios, José Tonatiuh;Henry, David;Penrose, Beth;Bell, Richard",Journal,Frontiers in Plant Science,2023-01-01,Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture;Murdoch University;Charles Darwin University,agronomic biofortification ;  foliar fertilizer ;  nanoparticles ;  silicon nanostructures ;  surfactants ;  wheat ;  zinc

From eScience to Impact on the Economy and Society,"eScience has had a major impact on science, engineering, healthcare and (increasingly) the humanities. However, there is enormous, largely untapped, potential to use the skills and expertise of eScience researchers to have a major impact on the economy and society. All organisations are drowning in data, but most lack the skills to extract value from it to gain insights into their work, to improve productivity and to create new profitable data-driven products and services. In contrast, eScience researchers have highly relevant experience in solving real-world problems by unlocking the value held in data. In this paper we suggest why this potential has not been fully realised and describe our efforts to address this through the creation of the UK's National Innovation Centre for Data. We draw on our experiences based on discussions with over 160 organisations, and of running 80 collaborative projects with businesses and governmental organisations over the past 4 years. Our vision for the future of eScience is of a field that is not only driving innovative research, but is also having a major, positive impact on the economy and society.","Watson, Paul;Hodgson, Barry",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings 2023 IEEE 19th International Conference on e-Science, e-Science 2023",2023-01-01,Newcastle University,Data Science ;  eScience ;  Innovation

Chemical Sustainability for a Nontoxic Environment – A Healthy Future,"Chemicals are a necessary part of everyday life. These chemicals comprise a large group; they may be antibiotics, drugs, processed foods, fortified supplements, pesticides, fertilizers, various pollutants, and many more. Humans are widely exposed to chemicals in domestic, environmental, and occupational settings. This exposure may be of the acute, brief-duration type, or it may be persistent. People engaged in various occupations such as those related to the asbestos industry, battery-recycling plants, tanneries, lead smelting, and paint factories are more likely to be exposed to hazardous chemicals in occupational settings. Cottage industries are also common in developing nations like India; the amount of metalworking, bangle manufacturing, leather production, bidi making, etc. is detrimental to health. Chemical sustainability, also known as sustainable chemistry, refers to the efficient addition of novel chemicals, practices, and products while maintaining environmental and public health protection. This scientific phrase is based on the idea of the three R's. The OECD is particularly concerned about these global challenges and assists nations by enacting policies that promote economic growth and the effective and efficient use of resources. More inclination toward renewable resources can offer an opportunity to switch off the dependency on fossil resources; promoting biomass use in energy is also one of the avenues. Advancements in enzyme technology using protein engineering and bioremediation technology have also been very fruitful in mitigating urban waste management. Although completely eradicating pollutants from the food chain is impossible, mechanistic approaches and strategies are needed to minimize the health hazards.

Surface defects detection in metal materials repaired by laser surfacing of seal welds,"Laser surfacing repair technology for sealing welds is widely used in metal repair. Due to welding technology and usage scenarios, process defects on the metal surface are inevitable. Therefore, ultrasonic surface wave technology is used to analyze the surface defects of metal materials. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the main defect signals on the metal surface, and synthetic aperture focusing technology is used to reduce imaging errors. Considering the lack of PCA in imaging defects, wavelet domain hidden Markov models (WHMM) are combined to optimize the signal, thereby improving the inspection effect of metal defects. In the test results of the relationship between the propagation distance of 316 L steel and the defect echo signal, the echo signal gradually fitted as the propagation distance increased. When the propagation distance was greater than 10 mm, the image acquisition defect signal had significant noise points. Various techniques were used to process the original echo signals of metal surface defects. The improved PCA-WHMM algorithm had significant advantages with the SNR value of the defect image increased by 13.65 % compared to PCA-WHMM. At the same time, the surface repair effects of laser surfacing 316 L metal before and after optimization were compared. The hardness, toughness, and corrosion resistance of the optimized metal were significantly improved. The proposed technological innovation combines traditional laser surfacing repair with deep learning fault diagnosis, which not only greatly improves the efficiency of fault diagnosis, but also proves that this research can effectively avoid common focus issues of laser surfacing repair technology, providing important technical reference for the application of ultrasonic technology in metal defect detection.","Wang, Weiyong",Journal,Journal of Measurements in Engineering,2023-01-01,Jiangxi Science and Technology Information Research Institute;Jiangxi Technical College of Manufacturing,defect detection ;  laser surfacing ;  PCA ;  ultrasonic surface wave ;  WHMM model
Secondary optimization design method of screw rotor forming grinding wheel installation parameters based on cutting performance,"Traditional research on the screw rotor forming grinding wheel mainly focuses on improving the profile accuracy of the forming grinding wheel.The coupling relationship between the cutting performance of the forming grinding wheel and the installation parameters of the forming grinding wheel has not received enough attention,leading to the unsatisfying cutting performance of the designed screw rotor forming grinding wheel,further deteriorating the surface quality and machining efficiency of the screw rotor.A novel secondary optimization design method for the installation parameters of the screw rotor forming grinding wheel was proposed based on the cutting performance.In this method,an optimization design program was designed to obtain the parameters range of the screw rotor forming wheel installation without interference based on the spatial meshing principle.The contact characteristics of the forming grinding wheel and the screw profile under different installation parameters,as well as the profile characteristics and cutting characteristics of the forming grinding wheel under different installation parameters were systematically analyzed,obtaining the installation parameter selection strategy of the screw rotor forming grinding wheel.The method was validated with a male rotor of three-screw pump as an example.The results demonstrated that the proposed method could significantly reduce the precision grinding cost of screw rotor as well as guaranteeing the grinding quality,and had good theoretical innovation and engineering application value.","Liu, Zongmin;Wang, Jirui;Li, Zufeng;Ao, Wengang;Tang, Qian;Xing, Bin",Journal,"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong/Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, CIMS",2023-01-01,Chongqing University;Chongqing Technology and Business University;Ltd.,cutting performance ;  forming grinding wheel ;  optimization design method ;  screw rotor
Dynamics and Effects of Science Technology Translation: Case of Blockchain Technology,"Considering the academic and industrial needs, it is necessary to examine the dynamics and effects of science and technology translation, especially the indirect ones. This study proposes a framework for identifying the levels of translation, called translational generation, and measuring their translational effects. An empirical analysis is carried out in the field of blockchain. The results provide evidence supporting the strength of direct translation and the growth of indirect translation. Firstly, the amount of S&T translation has increased and the amount of indirect translation has grown up to almost three times that of direct ones. Secondly, direct translation has better effects than all levels of indirect groups. However, the advantage of direct translation is not stable. It decreases in the translation intensity dimension and increases in the translation speed dimension. These findings have important implications for S&T innovation and source-allocated policy making.","Shi, Jing;Wang, Jiajie;Sun, Jianjun",Journal,Journal of Global Information Management,2023-01-01,Nanjing University,Blockchain ;  S-T Translation ;  Technology Innovation ;  Text Mining
Exploring the synergy of blockchain technology and low-carbon innovation for enterprise sustainability for unlocking a sustainable energy,"Along with further implementation of the policy strategy of carbon peaking and carbon neutralization in our country, the development idea of realizing the “dual carbon” goal with emphasis on environmental protection and low-carbon technology development has been preliminary established. At present, Chinese energy enterprises urgently need to break the dilemma between system and efficiency through technological innovation, so as to achieve the goal of sustainable development. Based on the legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory, this paper discusses the internal mechanism and boundary conditions of low-carbon technology innovation affecting the sustainable development of energy enterprises. Based on the data of listed Chinese energy companies from 2015 to 2021, the empirical study found that the level of low-carbon technology innovation of energy enterprises has an inverted U-shaped positive impact on their sustainable development performance, and the dual legitimacy (political legitimacy, market legitimacy) plays a part of the intermediary role. The degree of market competition positively moderates the relationship between low-carbon technology innovation and political legitimacy, and positively moderates the mediating effect of political legitimacy between low-carbon technology innovation and sustainable development performance. However, the degree of market competition has no significant moderating effect on the relationship between low-carbon technology innovation and market legitimacy, nor can it significantly regulate the mediating effect of market legitimacy. The constraint strength of “dual carbon” targets positively moderates the relationship between low-carbon technology innovation and political legitimacy, and positively moderates the mediating effect of market legitimacy between low-carbon technology innovation and sustainable development performance. On the contrary, the “dual carbon” target constraint intensity negatively moderates the relationship between low-carbon technology innovation and market legitimacy, and negatively moderates the mediating effect of market legitimacy. This article not only provides a new perspective for the integration of low-carbon innovation and legitimacy theory, but also provides theoretical reference and guidance for the practice of low-carbon technology innovation in energy enterprises.","ZiYa, A.;Guo, Xiao Chuan",Journal,Frontiers in Energy Research,2023-01-01,Inner Mongolia University China;Shanghai University,low-carbon technology innovation ;  market legitimacy ;  political legitimacy ;  sustainable development performance ;  the “dual carbon” goal
Simulation of the influence of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area financial agglomeration on the technological innovation efficiency of high-Tech enterprises based on SDM model,"How to build a collaborative mechanism of scientific and technological innovation and development in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (abbreviation: The Greater Bay Area(GBA)) is undoubtedly an important link in building a world-class scientific and technological innovation center. Based on the panel data of 11 cities in GBA from 2012 to 2020, this paper empirically tests the influence of GBA financial agglomeration on the technological innovation efficiency of high-Tech enterprises by using SDM(Spatial Dubin Model) model, starting from the innovative effect of financial agglomeration and considering two weight matrices of geographical distance and economic distance. The research results show that the regression results of GBA's SDM model show that the autocorrelation coefficients under 0-1 adjacency weight matrix and geo-economic distance weight matrix both exceed the significance levels of 1% and 10%, which shows that there is obvious correlation between the technical development efficiency of GBA's high-Tech industries, but they are not independent of each other. The level of economic development in different regions and stages is quite different. The results show that, at the significant level of 1%, financial agglomeration has a greater role in promoting the efficiency of technological innovation.","Wang, Shaoguang;Feng, Xi;Fang, Lijun",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023-01-01,Guangdong Construction Vocational Technology Institute,Financial agglomeration ;  Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area ;  SDM model ;  Technological innovation efficiency
Damage Mechanisms of Multilayer Axisymmetric Shells Obtained by the FDM Method,"The emergence and development of additive technologies (in particular, fused deposition modeling, FDM) determine the intensification of research in this area, given that there is currently a transition from applied and artistic applications to the use of FDM in solving engineering problems. The paper analyzes the behavior of thin-walled shells obtained by FDM (tanks of various technological purposes) under internal thermobaric loading. The damage and destruction of the tanks were simulated. The mechanism of damage development was checked experimentally. It was concluded that an essential physical and mechanical characteristic is the product’s crack resistance, characterized by the stress intensity factor (SIF) and differs between the initial filament and the finished product. The SIF value depends on the existing defects and leaks in the formed body of the product. It is also determined by both the material used and the printing modes. It is shown that applying thin sealing films and various printing techniques can improve the mechanical characteristics of the product as a whole.","Salenko, Olexandr;Dzhulii, Dmytro;Drahobetskyi, Volodymyr;Symonova, Anastasiia;Moloshtan, Dmytro",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,2023-01-01,Kremenchuk Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi National University;National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”,3D Printing ;  Crack Resistance ;  Fracture ;  Product Innovation ;  Serviceability Prediction ;  Strength

Chapter 15: To Be or Not to Be: Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Creation as a Way to Innovate in Life Sciences,"New market opportunities in the life sciences will emerge in the next few years, thanks to scientific advancements and the need for entrepreneurs who can address these opportunities is following such a trend. The role of companies, in particular of innovative start-ups in contributing to the development and economic growth of society and in the development of healthcare-related solutions, has been extensively studied. Unfortunately it has been clear since at least a decade that there is a profound mismatch between the traditional role of doctoral education in preparing young researchers for an academic career. Particularly in life sciences the existence of pure scientific results, however excellent they may be, does not automatically entail their transformation into innovative activities. This is the reason why the role of the researcher within the entrepreneurial process of a high-tech start-up—particularly in the field of biotechnology—is fundamental, especially in the initial stages. Examples of focused training and supporting solutions are existing but still not standardised. On the other hand, the need to maximise the impact of scientific research on society requires curricula, particularly for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) students, which will explicitly include entrepreneurial and innovation management components as transformative tools to maximise their contribution to society.","Cahill, Brian;Conicella, Fabrizio;Galligan, Eoin;Györff, Miklós",Book,Career Options in the Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Industry: An Insider’s Guide,2023-01-01,Eötvös Loránd Research Network (ELKH);Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB);Aarhus Universitet;Life Science District Srl,Doctoral programmes ;  Employability ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Life sciences ;  Start-up ;  STEM ;  Technology transfer
ANALYZING CHANGING PATTERNS OF EXTERNAL REFERENCE USE FROM INFORMAL LAB GROUP PRESENTATIONS TO FORMAL COLLOQUIA,"A frequently debated question in research on scientific discovery, engineering innovation, and creativity research relates to what kinds of inspirations are most impactful. In particular, often using historical evidence, some researchers argue that building upon ideas from a distant domain is particularly important. By contrast, other researchers use observations of scientific reasoning unfolding in real time to argue that only ideas from very closely related topics are useful to scientific discovery. We propose that scientists will often make mention of distant domains to explain discoveries after they are made and represent them more persuasively, but that the influence of those distant domains in inspiring discovery remains in question. To test this hypothesis, we compared the frequencies and kinds of external references made in lab group presentations and in colloquium presentations. In support of our hypothesis, colloquia presentations are much more likely to make references to distant domains than are lab group presentations. This difference is carried in the talk of the presenter, rather than the audience members, in references that are explained as opposed to being simply mentioned. It is also unrelated to the maturity of the research being presented (within the lab group presentations).","Schunn, Christian D.;Saner, Lelyn D.;Paletz, Susannah B.F.",Book,The Routledge International Handbook of Creative Cognition,2023-01-01,"Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.;University of Maryland, College Park;University of Pittsburgh;Learning Research and Development Center",
Progress in technology for the development of continental shale oil and thoughts on the development of scale benefits and strategies,"There are abundant continental shale oil resources in China, and the production rate reached 340×104 t in 2022 which marks the initial development of the shale oil industry in China. In contrast to marine shale oil in North America, China̍s continental shale oil presents a more diverse range of types, greater burial depths, more micro and nano scale pores, worse physical properties, and more complex development mechanisms and laws, which bring great challenges to its large-scale effective development. This paper systematically summarizes the important progress made in the development theory and main technologies of different types of continental shale oil in China in recent years, elaborates on the main development mechanisms, preliminary technical systems / development methods, and practical effects of various types of shale oil, deeply analyzes the problems and challenges in the large-scale effective development, especially in improving oil recovery, and proposes ideas and countermeasures to significantly improve the scale and benefits of continental shale oil development. It is recommended to conduct a classification and grading evaluation of China̍s shale oil, clarify the potential scale, succession pathways, and sustainability of recoverable reserves contributed by artificial transformation of each shale oil reservoir, deeply reveal the structure, lithological characteristics, occurrence status, and flow mechanism of different types of shale oil reservoirs, and tackle the creation of high-quality "" artificial reservoirs"" and key technologies for large-scale development, especially the research and optimization of reservoir transformation methods to improve the effective fracture network sweep volume and to maximize reserve utilization / recovery degree. It is necessary to accelerate the industrial test of platform / block three-dimensional development, upgrade and form a benefit exploitation mode and supporting technology system that can be popularized on a large scale, establish a large-scale development mode of block replacement and overall optimization, accelerate the research and test of supplementing formation energy in the early stage, form a multi-medium technology to greatly improve shale oil recovery and apply it as soon as possible. What̍s more, it is suggested to comprehensively promote the innovation of management modes and the application of intelligent technologies such as lifecycle, geology-engineering integration and engineering marketization, so as to greatly improve the efficiency of exploitation, and promote the large-scale benefit exploitation of shale oil and the high-quality development of shale oil industry.","Yuan, Shiyi;Lei, Zhengdong;Li, Junshi;Han, Haishui",Journal,Zhongguo Shiyou Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of China University of Petroleum (Edition of Natural Science),2023-01-01,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;China National Petroleum Corporation,benefit exploitation ;  continental shale oil ;  development mode ;  enhanced oil recovery ;  flow mechanism

Open Innovation Cultures,"Multiple sectors are experiencing high uncertainty in terms of disruptive technologies and market changes. Continuous uncertainty in business evolution is triggering the need for concepts that explore distributed and open innovation, networking effects, and ambidexterity approaches. Therefore, open innovation, a term that is used to promote a mindset toward innovation that runs against the silo mentality and closed innovation of traditional corporates, is used frequently in multiple research areas. Nevertheless, these different research areas identify and specify open innovation in different ways. Therefore, this paper will concentrate on open innovation effects and implications from the different research perspectives of (a) the societal level, (b) the organizational level, (c) the human resource and (informal) leadership level, and (d) the engineering technology level perspective. The work establishes a basic mutual understanding of insights into open innovation from different research focuses.","Macher, Georg;Narayan, Rumy;Dragicevic, Nikolina;Leino, Tiina;Veledar, Omar",Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2023-01-01,Technische Universitat Graz;University of Zagreb;Vaasan Yliopisto;Beevadoo,human resource management ;  open innovation ;  socio technology impact

Current Situation and Prospect of Research on Male Sterility of Tomato,"Tomato is an important vegetable crop in China, and its yield ranks the top among vegetables in the world. It has important nutritional value, with rich and varied tastes. Plant male sterility is caused by the abnormal development of stamens, which cannot produce pollen with normal function, while pistils develop normally and can be fertilized by foreign normal pollen. Tomato is a typical self-pollinated plant with obvious heterosis and strong disease resistance and stress resistance. At present, the production of tomato F1 hybrid seeds in China basically depends on artificial emasculation and pollination, therefore, a lot of manpower and material resources are needed in the process of seed production. In the use of tomato male sterile seed production, the seed production process can be simplified, costs be greatly reduced and and seed purity be improved, in this case, tomato yield and quality will be increased significantly. Therefore, the research and utilization of tomato male sterility is of great practical significance to tomato genetic breeding, and has always been an important research topic for the domestic and foreign scholars. This paper mainly outlines the current situation of male sterility of tomato in recent years, summarizes the types of tomato male sterility, the application of genetic engineering technology of tomato male sterility, the fine positioning and functional study of tomato male sterility gene, and the analysis of cell biological mechanism of tomato male sterility. The effect of temperature on tomato male sterility is expounded from the perspective of genetics, and the physiological and biochemical mechanism and the gene function and regulation mechanism in response temperature changes are discussed. Then, the heterosis of tomato male sterility and its utilization value in production and application are analyzed. On this basis, the problems existing in the current research work are put forward, and the innovation and basic research of tomato male sterility technology in the future are prospected.","Li, Xiang;Li, Tao;Gong, Chao;Li, Zhenxing;Sun, Guangwen",Journal,Guangdong Agricultural Sciences,2023-01-01,Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences;South China Agricultural University,functional verification ;  genetic engineering ;  heterosis ;  male sterility ;  molecular marker ;  tomato

Classification of Nature-Inspired Inventive Principles for Eco-innovation and Their Assignment to Environmental Problems in Chemical Industry,"Eco-innovations in chemical processes should be designed to use raw materials, energy and water as efficiently and economically as possible to avoid the generation of hazardous waste and to conserve raw material reserves. Applying inventive principles identified in natural systems to chemical process design can help avoid secondary problems. However, the selection of nature-inspired principles to improve technological or environmental problems is very time-consuming. In addition, it is necessary to match the strongest principles with the problems to be solved. Therefore, the research paper proposes a classification and assignment of nature-inspired inventive principles to eco-parameters, eco-engineering contradictions and eco-innovation domains, taking into account environmental, technological and economic requirements. This classification will help to identify suitable principles quickly and also to realize rapid innovation. In addition, to validate the proposed classification approach, the study is illustrated with the application of nature-inspired invention principles for the development of a sustainable process design for the extraction of high-purity silicon dioxide from pyrophyllite ores. Finally, the paper defines a future research agenda in the field of nature-inspired eco-engineering in the context of AI-assisted invention and innovation.","Mas’udah, ;Livotov, Pavel;Santosa, Sandra;Suryadi, Akhmad",Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2023-01-01,State Polytechnic of Malang;University of Applied Sciences Offenburg,AI-Aided Innovation ;  Chemical Engineering ;  Eco-innovation ;  Eco-inventive Principles ;  Process Design

Capturing User Experience of Customer-Centric Software Process through Requirement Process: Systematic Review,"Agile and User Experience have become popular for decades due to the ability to understand customer needs. However, both methods have different perspectives on the point of view, value, and quality. Moreover, user research in UX is usually conducted in the long term. The human aspect is a critical thing in Agile, the purpose of this aspect is to understand the value and need of the product, and with the user stories, several developers try to understand the human aspect of customers. In the elicitation process of the UX, developers used user stories to capture customer personality. One important factor is emotion; UX researchers measure emotions from the product journey, but it is unpleasant when the customer finds out the product does not meet expectations. This study aims to research the implementation of capturing emotion in user experience among Agile software development activities from several perspectives. In addition, Limited resources in software projects require innovation that can guarantee the sustainability and quality of the product.

Approach for collaboration in value network-centric innovation processes of smart products,"The transformation of traditional mechatronic products to smart, interdisciplinary products leads to increased complexity in all processes along the product lifecycle. In order to be able to drive innovations forward sufficiently quickly in this context, efficient collaboration is required in the innovation phase that extends across all disciplines involved at all innovation partners concerned (manufacturers, suppliers, research partners). The approach presented in this paper aims at supporting a model-based innovation development of smart products within value networks. A central component of the approach is a collaborative knowledge base that can support the innovation process in this environment, or which requirements for this arise from the framework conditions mentioned. Concrete approaches for a corresponding technical implementation are shown. A graph-oriented data model and the use of a multi-level tagging system enable an efficient networking of the knowledge of all partners involved. The functionality of the approach is validated by means of an industrial application example.","Mollahassani, Damun;Juresa, Yannick;Eickhoff, Thomas;Göbel, Jens C.",Conference Proceeding,Stuttgarter Symposium fur Produktentwicklung,2023-01-01,Rheinland-Pfälzische Technische Universität Kaiserslautern-Landau,Innovation Management ;  Innovation process ;  Knowledge base ;  Model-Based Systems Engineering ;  Process Models
Common skills in projects from different areas of knowledge: Developing the professional profile,"The undergraduate programs in Brazil follow national guidelines in which are stated the competences that need to be developed along the course by students. Schools may include other specific competencies in order to meet their own demands. To achieve an integrative approach between the Engineering, Design and Administration programs, interacting in multidisciplinary projects, one institution proposed a list of convergent competencies based on the tripod of innovation aimed at empowering its students for a global scenario. In this work is presented the process of building this list of competencies for the training of professionals in these three areas, with an updated and innovative profile. The research method was at first step, the documental analysis, that allowed to identify a convergent list of competences. From this list it was possible to build the questionnaire to survey the competences that was indicated by instructor in their projects and, that will be used too to gather perceived by students after to fulfill the projects, and to evaluate how close are the perception of students with stated by instructors.","Neto, Octavio Mattasoglio;Palu, Matheus Ferreira;Da Matta, Eduardo Nadaleto;De Souza Matumoto, Pedro Henrique;Da Costa, Marcello Nitz",Conference Proceeding,"2023 5th International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education, CISPEE 2023",2023-01-01,Instituto Maua de Tecnologia,Competences ;  Innovation tripod ;  Multidisciplinary projects ;  Problem Based Learning ;  Soft skills
LIMBERLOST PLACE: A 10-STOREY SLAB-BANDED STRUCTURE,"The $150M Limberlost Place (previously known as ""The Arbour"") is a 10-storey, 16,250 m2, exposed tall wood building located on George Brown College's waterfront campus in Toronto, Canada. This project will serve as an educational hub for George Brown College, housing the Tall Wood Research Institute, a childcare centre in addition to a significant amount of teaching and social spaces for their architectural program.

The impact of subjective and objective inconsistencies in scientific and technological innovation attributes on the listing of enterprises on the Science and Technology Innovation Board,"The attribute of high-tech innovation is the most essential characteristic that distinguishes enterprises on the Science and Technology Innovation Board (STAR) Market from other stock markets. In this paper, we aim to examine the impact of consistency in information disclosure of subjective and objective tech-attributes of enterprises on their success of the application on this board. We construct a science and technology innovation dictionary by Word2vec, and calculate the subjective tech-attributes degree of the enterprise registration statements; Based on the official listing standards document for tech-attributes, we select 7 objective scientific and technological innovation indicators and calculate the enterprises' objective tech-attributes degree via the principal component analysis, and construct the consistency indicator for the two tech-attributes. In the empirical analysis, we collected the registration statement of 708 companies that applied for listing from 2019 to 2022 and studied the inconsistencies between the subjective tech-attributes of the text of the enterprise registration statements and their objective tech-attributes innovation evaluation indicators, and found the factors that affected the successful listing. The results show that both subjective and objective scientific innovation are positively correlated with the successful listing, and the consistency indicator is significantly negatively correlated with the successful listing. When the degree of inconsistency between the subjective and objective tech-attributes is greater, the lower the probability of passing the review and listing of the STAR Market is.","Chen, Nan;Han, Chen;Wei, Lu",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2023-01-01,Central University of Finance and Economics,IPO ;  principal component analysis ;  science and technology innovation ;  STAR Market ;  text analysis
Reforming Doctoral Education through Immersive Ph.D. Training Weeks,"Ph.D.Training worldwide, including Doctoral education in Engineering fields, has been in trouble for some time [1]. These last turbulent times (Pandemic, energy, inflation, and war crises) have only increased the problems previously reported by the 3rd cycle students and early career researchers, including chronic lack of support and poor-quality supervision, with senior researchers rarely trained in mentorship [2]. It is also reported that Ph.D. candidates are inadequately prepared for the cross-disciplinary working and large teams that characterize cutting-edge science today. In the last two decades, opposite decisions took place in Europe concerning the curricula of Doctoral programs. In the years 2010s, a large number of classes was added to the Ph.D.s, contributing to almost residual time for thesis research in the first year of the programmes. However, ten years later, an abrupt change took place and almost all classes were removed from the Ph.D. curricula, creating a void in (hard and soft skills) training and leaving all the responsibility of training to the supervisor. Ph.D. students reported guidance and isolation issues in the first year. Moreover, today's little Ph.D.Training is fully dedicated to the obtention of their Ph.D. and not to their role in society after the Ph.D. defense [3].This work discusses a new approach to doctoral STEAM education in the actual doctoral programs' framework, where few classes take place. This approach considers a novel Ph.D.Training, both hard and soft skills development, through special intensive weeks, called Immersive Weeks. In these, distributed during the first year, Ph.D. students exclusively participate in several workshops, acquiring the tools for accomplishing both a successful Ph.D. and a future job. Pilots of this approach took place at the University of Aveiro with large success, while some improvement suggestions have also been pointed out by students.","Andrade-Campos, Antonio;Saur-Amaral, Irina;Gabriel, Barbara;Figueiredo, Claudia;Valente, Robertt;Dias-De-Oliveira, J.

Intergovernmental environmental affairs division and environmental public services supply: Evidence from 289 cities in China,"The reasonable division of intergovernmental environmental affairs is the institutional basis for solving environmental pollution problems. This paper conducts an empirical test using panel data from cities in China. We find that: (a) environmental decentralization significantly improves the supply efficiency of environmental public services (ESE). It's mainly because of the increased capacity for green technology innovation and urban environmental infrastructure development brought about by environmental decentralization. (b) Environmental decentralization will improve the ESE more effectively in regions with the central government acting as a binding force, high environmental preferences, governance capacity of local governments, and pollutant emission intensity. (c) Higher promotion incentives for officials may distort the pollution control effect of environmental decentralization and inhibit the ESE. Appropriate central government transfer payments can better utilize the positive role of environmental decentralization.","Li, Guoxiang;Zong, Qingqing;Chen, Xueli;Song, Malin",Journal,Energy and Environment,2023-01-01,Adnan Kassar School of Business;Anhui University of Finance and Economics;Chinese Academy of Social Sciences;Shanghai University of Finance and Economics;Nanjing Normal University,Environmental decentralization ;  environmental preferences ;  public service ;  technology innovation
"A Study on the Coupling and Coordination Relationship of Science and Technology Innovation, Higher Education, and Clean Energy Based on the Entropy Weight and Gray Correlation Analysis Method","Clean energy is the core element of China's energy low-carbon transition strategy, and its development degree is closely link with science and technology innovation and higher education. Based on studying relevant research and analyzing data and information, we selected 11 primary indicators, such as investment in education, transformation of scientific research results, and clean energy development, and 30 secondary indicators, such as R&D investment intensity, number of patents granted for inventions, clean energy power generation, clean energy installed capacity, and clean energy consumption share, to construct an indicator evaluation system. Based on the actual data of three systems from periods 2010 to 2020, we try to use entropy weight method to calculate index weights, use coupled coordination model to calculate coupling coordination degree of three systems, and use gray correlation analysis method to in-depth analysis interaction relationships between three systems. Based on the research, we try to propose 3 countermeasures and recommendations. We hope that the research results of this paper will provide a new research method and ideas for related studies and make positive contributions to the high-quality development of China's economy and the realization of the energy transition strategy.","Yang, Ning;Lv, Tao;Cui, Hua",Journal,International Journal of Energy Research,2023-01-01,Yellow River Conservancy Technical Institute;China University of Mining and Technology,
Differential Game Study of Competitive Green Supply Chain Based on Green Public Technology Innovation and Product Greenness,"Green public technological innovation is regarded as an indispensable tool for realizing sustainable development and coping with global challenges, and the major social challenges and global problems faced by mankind nowadays have put forward higher requirements for green technological innovation in the public sector. This paper considers the dynamic process of technological innovation, constructs a green public technology innovation supply chain consisting of the government and two competing manufacturers, uses a stochastic stopping model to portray the impact of the dynamic process of technological innovation on the green technology innovation supply chain, and studies the equilibrium strategies of green technology innovation under three models of decentralized decision-making, centralized decision-making, and government subsidy decision-making between the government and the manufacturers based on a differential game model. It is found that: 1) Higher probability of successful technological innovation and product greenness enhancement can effectively incentivize the government and manufacturers to increase R&D investment in green technological innovation before successful technological innovation; 2) Supply chain members will consider the marginal profit after technological innovation when deciding the R&D investment before technological innovation success; 3) Manufacturers' competition is beneficial to increase manufacturers' investment in technological innovation, but it will lead to a decrease in the rate of government subsidy. Government subsidies help to increase both parties' technological innovation investment and product greenness and achieve higher supply chain profits; 4) The centralized decision-making model can achieve the optimal green technology innovation strategy, product greenness, and supply chain profits compared with the decentralized decision-making model.","Liang, Yunjuan;Liang, Xin;Wei, Hua",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,Naval University of Engineering,differential games ;  Green public technology innovation ;  manufacturer competition ;  product greenness

Experimental teaching design and practice of human factors engineering for biomedical engineering,"Human factor engineering experiment is an indispensable part of biomedical engineering course, which builds the link between textbook knowledge and practical ability and covers the field of engineering, physiology, psychology, and mechanical technology, etc. In order to improve students’ engineering practice ability, combined with current situation of the training of biomedical engineering professionals, the design and practice of human factors engineering experiment teaching were carried out in this study. The teaching experiment platforms were constructed including environment, physiology, and interaction intelligence sub-platforms. According to the platform and theoretical course, three experiment courses were designed to consolidate and mastery the textbook knowledge. 20 opening advanced human factor engineering experiment involving living space, medical equipment, and military installations were selected. The various teaching methods such as case study-based learning (CBL) teaching, flipped classroom, cross linkage, and case iteration were adopted to improve the taste of the course. Through this study, many students’ self-designed experimental designs were revised and submitted to “Ergonomics” and other professional journals and public accounts, and their theoretical and practical skills were improved to a certain extent. The course necessity and satisfaction reached 100%, while the teaching quality satisfaction was 93.9% (31/33). Through teaching innovation, highlighting the “combination” features of military, medicine, and engineering, the experimental content could reflect the characteristics of the course and complement the theoretical content.

Social Representations on Lithuanian Women Leaders in the STEAM Fields: A Critical Discourse Analysis,"Science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) are fields substantially crucial for innovation and development. Nevertheless, the gender gap in these areas is significant also in European countries. Considering the underrepresentation of STEAM women's leadership, we provide insight into the common characteristics that led Lithuanian women to become referents in their fields. We identify elements of leadership in discursive social representations, professional ideologies, gender identity and role congruency in connection to power structures from a gender perspective within organisations, considering the mediations of the social context. We conducted the research in two phases: an online questionnaire and in-depth interviews. We performed a critical discourse analysis of Lithuanian Women's testimonies to understand gender social representations. Parenthood highly influences building leadership and choosing STEAM careers, whereas self-efficacy and creativity are essential elements. High co-responsibility at home confirms that family context is vital. In STEAM careers, a male-centric perspective still constrains female leadership. There is still work to be done regarding active politics, programs, and law enforcement to create equity and social justice relationships between men and females, especially in STEAM areas.","Buelvas-Baldiris, Tatiana;Rubira-García, Rainer;Pocevičienė, Rasa",Journal,Information and Media,2023-01-01,Universidad Rey Juan Carlos;Šiauliai State University of Applied Sciences,Gender studies ;  Lithuania ;  Social Representations ;  STEAM ;  Women leadership
Text Mining-Based Patent Analysis for Automated Rule Checking in AEC,"Automated rule checking (ARC), which is expected to promote the efficiency of the compliance checking process in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, is gaining increasing attention. Throwing light on the ARC application hotspots and forecasting its trends are useful to the related research and drive innovations. Therefore, this study takes the patents from the database of the Derwent Innovations Index database (DII) and China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI) as data sources and then carried out a three-step analysis including (1) quantitative characteristics (i.e., annual distribution analysis) of patents, (2) identification of ARC topics using a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and, (3) SNA-based co-occurrence analysis of ARC topics. The results show that the research hotspots and trends of Chinese and English patents are different. The contributions of this study have three aspects: (1) an approach to a comprehensive analysis of patents by integrating multiple text mining methods (i.e., SNA and LDA) is introduced; (2) the application hotspots and development trends of ARC are reviewed based on patent analysis; and (3) a signpost for technological development and innovation of ARC is provided.","Zheng, Zhe;Kang, Bo Rui;Yuan, Qi Tian;Zhou, Yu Cheng;Lu, Xin Zheng;Lin, Jia Rui",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2023-01-01,Tsinghua University,Application hotspots and future trends ;  Automated Rule Checking (ARC) ;  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ;  Patent analysis ;  Social Network Analysis (SNA) ;  Text mining

Changing Hearts and Minds: The Role of Cybersecurity Champion Programs in Cybersecurity Culture,"Humans have often been written off as the weakest link in the cybersecurity industry. This paper looks at the human factor from a different perspective, seeking ways to leverage the human element to improve cybersecurity. The human element and its importance in cybersecurity defense and security incidents have been widely studied. The relationship between organizational cybersecurity culture and cybersecurity posture has also been examined in the literature. What is lacking is the examination of how an organization could improve its cybersecurity culture. Accordingly, we explore the possibility of cybersecurity champions to impact organizational cybersecurity culture, thereby improving the organization’s cybersecurity posture. The option of leveraging cybersecurity champions to impact culture is proposed, and existing theoretical bases of Champion Theory and Promotor Theory in innovation management are explored to support the implementation of cybersecurity champions. These theories are then applied to existing cybersecurity culture research. Innovation champions exhibit transformational leadership characteristics to inspire innovation; four types of promotors (expert promotors, power promotors, process promotors and relationship promotors) use their various sources of power to remove barriers to innovation. Eight hypotheses are developed about the possible effect of the presence of cybersecurity innovation champions and cybersecurity promotors on four factors which have been found to have significant impact on information security culture in previous research (Tejay & Mohammed, 2022): group cohesiveness or alignment, professional codes (codes of ethics or conduct), informal work practices, and cybersecurity awareness.","Granova, Victoria;Mashatan, Atefeh;Turetken, Ozgur",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2023-01-01,Toronto Metropolitan University,Culture Change ;  Cybersecurity ;  Cybersecurity Champions ;  Cybersecurity Culture ;  Innovation
Research on STEAM Maker Education Mode to Improve Children’s Innovation Ability in Shenzhen,"Since entering the 21st century, innovation has become the development tendency, the emergence of the term “Maker” has led the development of the global maker movement. The original meaning of the word “maker” is “creator”. While nowadays, “Makers” put more emphasis on interest-based practices that can be turned into products but are not for-profit. “Maker” education is a new education model based on innovation and entrepreneurship education which can improve students’ creative thinking, cultivate their hands-on ability and practical spirit. STEAM education model is short for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics, which was first put forward in the United States in 1980. From the practical perspective, many researchers suggest that the STRAM education model is benefit for improving the national competencies, improving the science awareness in the whole society, and making students to get higher income and greater job security. Shenzhen has firmly grasped the opportunity of maker education and issued several policies and regulations, but it also needs to be further improved. By reviewing the existing literature, this paper suggests that for the construction of maker education in Shenzhen, they should construct systematics curriculum, make full use of “5E” model, establish a sound evaluation system, and focus on cultivating comprehensive ability.","Xia, Cai",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2023-01-01,Bangkokthonburi University;Beijing Institute of Technology,Innovation Ability ;  Maker Education ;  STEAM model
The Search for Multi-Functional Composite Material and Structure,"The utilization of composite materials is growing rapidly. The sporting goods industry, automotive, energy, infrastructure, aerospace, especially the rapidly growing E-VTOL market, are all increasing the utilization of composite materials. In today’s competitive market engineering teams must develop new designs that are lighter, cost effective, easy to manufacture while also being multifunctional, integrating thermal, electrical, and sometimes chemical properties to meet very tough requirements. This paper will explore the benefits of adding NAWAStitch to a composite material to develop a material that can deliver multifunctionality to composite structures. NAWAStitch is a new composite innovation where a vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) forest is located between plies of a laminate composite resulting in improved mechanical properties as well as other multifunctional properties such as thermal and electrical conductivity. With the addition of NAWAStitch the engineer can change the behavior of the composite material to deliver a true multifunctional structure. NAWAStitch changes the composite structure’s properties in the Z direction or through plane direction and increases the ply to ply and intra-ply properties of the composite. NAWA has collaborated with the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI) to develop multi-functional composite structures for anti-icing/deicing, resistive heating, and structural health monitoring applications while improving the mechanical properties of the composite structure.","Retz, Kevin;Sanderson, Ian;Boulanger, Pascal;Goislard, Thomas;Kladitis, Paul;Rice, Brian;Armstrong, Michael",Conference Proceeding,International SAMPE Technical Conference,2023-01-01,University of Dayton Research Institute;NAWA America,NAWA Technologies application of VACNT’s to a composite material Multifunctional ;  NAWAStitch ;  Vertically Aligned Carbon nano tubes (VACNT’s)
The men who feed the world? Putting masculinities on the agenda for crop breeding research for development,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields that are dominated by men and masculine have historically been shown to lead to poor representation and discrimination of women and gender diverse scientists, managers, and leaders. This in turn negatively impacts inclusive innovation processes and outcomes. We claim that crop breeding is one such field that is undeniably dominated by men, and even masculine, and could therefore harbor the very same dynamics of exclusion. Yet there is a dearth of research systematically investigating how masculinities are performed in the institutions, organizations, cultures, discourses, and practices of crop breeding. In this Perspective piece, we present a theoretically informed hypothesis of crop breeding organizations as representing spaces where masculinities associated with rurality, management, and science and technology come together in ways that may marginalize women and gender diverse individuals, including in intersection with sexuality, race, ethnicity, and disability. In developing this hypothesis, we draw upon theoretical and empirical insights from masculinity studies in rural sociology, management and organization studies, and feminist technoscience studies. We demonstrate how critical men and masculinities studies can help expose masculinities in crop breeding to investigation, discussion, criticism, and change. As we seek to advance equality in and through crop breeding organizations, this framing helps to guide future research with potential to positively impact the culture of crop breeding research.","Tarjem, Ida Arff;Tufan, Hale Ann",Journal,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2023-01-01,Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences,crop breeding ;  feminist technoscience studies ;  gender ;  management and organization studies ;  masculinities ;  rural sociology
Educative performance transitions in engineering students through the COVID-19 pandemic,"Higher education is a multivariable system by nature; thus, it is a complex task to maintain consistent academic success for students. This is a key factor to understand the positive and negative effects generated by the COVID-19 lockdown, particularly during the current stage of the “New Normal” period. The research presented herein considers a set of variables corresponding to students and faculty as causal factors to track, analyze, and assess the impact on the academic performance of engineering students in an urban Mexican university in both periods: online teaching during lockdown, and returning to face-to-face learning during the “New Normal.” Through a hybrid survey, looking for representative learning styles, academic personality traits, and technology competencies, academic performance in both periods has been recorded along with each student's learning preference. The suggested analysis model sought correlations in the stated causal factors to find valuable behavioral patterns. The outcomes show that good students in both models have attained a high level of adaptation and feel competitive in them. On the contrary, students with lower adaptation have shown poor academic performance in both models, but they perceived the online model as the less effective learning environment. Particularly, personality traits appoint on a notable impact on performance. In addition, learning styles are not significant. Still, it has been suggested this situation could be due to a greater diversity of teaching approaches established by the faculty to take care of student performance.","Vázquez-Sánchez, Agustín;Delgado, Francisco",Journal,Frontiers in Education,2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,academic performance ;  adaptation ;  COVID-19 transitions ;  educational innovation ;  engineering education ;  higher education ;  inclusivity

Out of the 219 Engineering programs offered by public institutions in Minas Gerais, according to the e-MEC platform, 8 institutions presented a relevant position because they mention a considerable quantity of ALS terms in their curriculum planning. An analysis of the pedagogical projects of engineering programs offered by these institutions was made, using the same Keywords mentioned by the Active Learning Working Group in Engineering Education, a precursor research group that has relevant work in Brazil. The prominent institutions and the number of Keywords mentioned by them were: Federal University of Itajubá (392), Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Minas Gerais (136), Federal University of Uberlândia (110), Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of the South of Minas Gerais (103), State University of Minas Gerais (94), Federal University of Ouro Preto (78) and Federal Center for Technological Education of Minas Gerais (70). The most frequent Keywords were Games; Interdisciplinary Project; Problem or Project based Learning (PBL); Integrator Project; Active Methodology; Active Learning; Flipped Classroom and Project-Based Learning. Future steps of this research will identify how these practices are used, with the purpose of confirming the evidence raised in this preliminary study. It is one of the following steps of this research that has the support of the Research Supporting Foundation of Minas Gerais State.","Campos, Lílian Barros Pereira;Izeki, Claudia Akemi;Figueiredo, Vitor Guilherme Carneiro;Duarte, Jéssyca Laryssa Galvão;Nagai, Walter Aoiama",Conference Proceeding,International Symposium on Project Approaches in Engineering Education,2023-01-01,Universidade Federal de Itajubá,Active Learning Strategies ;  Engineering Education ;  Innovation in Engineering Education
ASSESSING THE EFFICIENCY OF APPLICATION OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT IN THE FIELD OF ENGINEERING OF INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENTS,"This paper investigates the peculiarities and effectiveness of using project management in the field of engineering of innovative developments. The relevance of the topic relates to the fact that the process of innovative development is characterized by its duration and the uncertainty of the probability of obtaining specific results. Such a feature determines the need to build such a project management system for the engineering of innovative developments, which would ensure the definition of sub-stages of this process, the assessment of the degree of their implementation, and the determination of the results of these stages. The object of this study is the project management system of the engineering projects of innovative developments of the company Hokord Ltd. The research used methods of statistical analysis with the distribution of data into control and test groups. This distribution made it possible to reveal the impact of the implementation of project management on the effectiveness of project management. The study solves the problem of determining the effectiveness of project management in comparison with traditional approaches to project management. The results of the study show that the implementation of project management in the field of engineering of innovative developments has led to the improvement of project management and an increase in their efficiency. Implementation of project management made it possible to establish new project statuses and reduce the share of canceled or closed projects, while the share of successfully completed projects increased. Unlike other studies, quantitative indicators of the effectiveness of project management were established – the duration of project implementation was reduced by an average of 11 %. The implementation of project management also improved the assessment and allocation of project priorities, a decrease in the share of projects with high priority, and an increase in the share of projects with low and uncertain priority was revealed.","Myronenko, Oleksii",Journal,Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,2023-01-01,Interregional Academy of Personnel Management,flexible management ;  innovation engineering ;  management efficiency ;  project management ;  project management
Innovating the Teaching of Basic Concepts of Chemical Kinetics Through Analogies,"An educational qualitative research project using analogies related to economic aspects of any person receiving a periodic salary and making payments for various reasons, such as acquiring goods, was conducted so students could conceptualize the parameters that determine a kinetic study, such as the initial concentration and the half-life, and understand that its management is experimental. The analogies were applied in samples of students from different disciplinary areas of engineering, and through problem-solving, the efficiency of the analogies used was evaluated with good results, given that they were based on constructivism.","Angulo, Javier Ramírez;Reyna, Josefina Castillo;Pineda, Margarita Portilla;Cortez, María del Carmen González",Conference Proceeding,International Symposium on Project Approaches in Engineering Education,2023-01-01,Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana;Tecnológico de Monterrey,educational innovation ;  half-life ;  higher education ;  order and reaction constant ;  Speed
Photonic systems integration for postgraduate students in the Centre for Doctoral Training in Applied Photonics,"Photonics is a broad research area that underpins many different areas of science and engineering. The future of the United Kingdom (UK) photonics industry depends on training the next generation of photonic engineers and scientists to lead research and innovation across a wide range of industrial applications. In 2018, the UK government invested £446 million through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in 75 Centres for Doctoral Training (CDT), of which one is focused on industry inspired Photonics, Imaging, Sensing and Analysis (CDT in Applied Photonics). A key element of these CDTs is the increase in formal taught components to enhance technical interdisciplinary knowledge and broaden the postgraduate research student's skills and knowledge base. This paper presents the development, implementation and evaluation of a new taught course for the CDT in Applied Photonics to broaden the skills of photonics researchers to integrate analogue and programmable digital electronics in to photonic systems. The course builds fundamental theoretical knowledge in digital and analogue electronics and provides practical laboratories using accessible programmable digital hardware. It also provides the opportunity to apply this knowledge through a practical group project developing an integrated photonic system, culminating in an assessed practical presentation and demonstration of the working systems. The course uses National Instrument's myRIO, designed to allow access to industry-grade embedded system technology combining LabVIEW's graphical programming environment with a processor, reconfigurable field programmable gate array (FPGA) and convenient hardware interfaces. This facilitates access to the technology for postgraduate students from a range of undergraduate backgrounds, yet also provides a pathway to develop similar technology used in industrial photonic research.","Flockhart, Gordon M.H.;Bauer, Ralf;Lengden, Michael",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023-01-01,University of Strathclyde,Centre for Doctoral Training ;  myRIO ;  photonics ;  postgraduate training ;  systems engineering
Healthcare Technology and Innovation Management Methods: Theoretical Interpretation,"Today, the concept of technology and innovation management in healthcare is prevalent in the literature. Managers who interpret technology from a management perspective, interpret it as a significant factor in determining the starting point for an analogous investigation. However, if we consider that technology and innovation management is essential to business success and competitive advantage, one may wonder why the evaluation of technology and innovation management in healthcare organizations is still considered problematic. What makes this singular focus so elusive to define and measure? We consider the significance of technology and innovation management in a business context, and we debate a metaphysical perspective that is contrary to prevailing knowledge, but is associated with healthcare. To identify suggestions for helpful recommendations that advocate current routines and systems, we reflect on epistemic states and draw on descriptions of conditional doxastic maps that are natural extensions of parallelism between agents who believe propositions (managers) and the formal system that generates the proposition (NHS). We propose a proposition that differentiates “technology and innovation management”; this proposition is based on the comparison of knowledge that is epistemically different from a innovation decision. We believe that perspectives that are recognized, rather than implied, have a definable knowledge point of view that can be described as a specific form of technology within innovation management, which can help healthcare organizations save money and increase efficiency, productivity and patient satisfaction.","Fascia, Michael;Koseda, Ellie;McIntosh, Bryan",Book Series,Internet of Things,2023-01-01,Brunel University London;Nottingham Trent University;Universidad de Edinburgh Napier,Healthcare technology ;  Innovation management ;  Iot
"Quantum Mechanics in a quicker, more intuitive, and accessible way","Quantum Mechanics in the headlines today captures the imagination of the public, deep wallets of investors and industries, and prioritizes academic and national research programs throughout the world. It all begins with superposition and entanglement. Canonical educational approaches, however, may not build the intuitive or the computational ability required of practitioners where quantum is center-stage. An APS News front-page article by Meredith Fore details and explores the current situation: ""The Newest Frontier: Building a Skilled workforce. Education in Quantum Mechanics has lagged for years. Experts are trying to change this.""1 Here we highlight innovations and experiences coupling our curriculum, advanced labs, and undergraduate research to best address these educational questions and skills-based needs. Our approaches are based on ready-available two-state, two-particle entangled light source table-top experiments and finite-dimensioned (familiar) vector spaces as opposed to infinitely dimensioned function-space solutions to differential equations with little intuitive connection and/or easy access to experimental experience. Our Physics and Photonics and Optical Engineering Quantum I course has migrated from a traditional text to one espousing these new directions (M. Beck. Quantum Mechanics, Theory and Experiment)2 and our experiments are centered around a commercially available educational entanglement source (Quantum Design, quTool's quED)3 with avalanche single-photon detectors, coincidence electronics, with standard and add-on experiments that are in step with the text but, as a kit, come more student-ready. This approach may better promote quantum technologies, prepare scientists, technicians, and engineers, and offer deeper insight to what quantum is really telling us.","Deveney, Edward;Demirbas, Elif;Serna, Samuel",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023-01-01,Bridgewater State University,Entangled pair sources for education ;  Qiskit ;  Quantum Education ;  Quantum workforce ;  quTools
Educating decision makers on resource allocations for quantum technologies,"While quantum science occupies a deserved place in STEM curricula, new learning trajectories are also suggested for those seeking to generate value in emerging product and service settings. Harnessing quantum technologies for commercial purposes invites innovative curricula that guides both industry and government players in making promising use of their resources. Strategic resource allocation demands an underlying innovation thesis by which to diagnose value propositions with a guiding set of value principles. These tools then deliver cohesive actions that realise a quantum strategy to unlock value. Given this imperative, a key question arises: ""How can we best educate a distributed skilled workforce to deliver and capture value from quantum innovations?"". This distributed learning challenge suggests a massive open online course (MOOC) to align quantum science with quantum strategy. We have recently built such a MOOC and have tracked its development arc as we tested our pedagogy, leading us to some interesting delineations. Firstly, those with existing products and services adopting particular quantum technologies to improve performance require tools to cut through the quantum hype in distilling value opportunities such technologies are uniquely positioned to deliver. Secondly, those already immersed in the technology need guiding frameworks to distil and propagate their value proposition aligned with end-user needs, thereby connecting technology advances with market expectations. We draw on our experience to note distinctive successes and learning boundaries enabled by MOOC platforms to allow both learning scale and geographic dispersion. We suggest future research and pedagogical development pathways.","Manfield, Russell;Harvey, Michael;White, Andrew",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023-01-01,The University of Queensland Business School;The University of Queensland,innovation thesis ;  massive open online course ;  MOOC ;  QTechX ;  quantum strategy ;  quantum technologies ;  resource allocation ;  routine dynamics
Process innovation and sustainable production: the role of methods engineering in exporting companies,"Nowadays, the implementation of methods engineering is fundamental, as it allows the identification of unnecessary processes and the design of new methods that make better use of resources. Therefore, a method engineering model is proposed to improve the productivity of exporting companies in Cañete. The research is applied, with a quantitative approach and experimental design. A questionnaire addressed to 389 employees was used with regard to the methods engineering variable and the productivity variable. The results show that 44.73% of the employees state that the level of methods engineering is poor, 48.59% state that the level of time engineering is poor and 52.96% state that the level of production is poor. These results reflect that a method engineering model should be proposed to promote process innovation with a sustainable production approach that increases resource efficiency.","Pacheco, Alex;Vegas-Gallo, Edwin;Pariona-Luque, Rosario;Añaños-Bedriñana, Marco A.;Marín, Wilson;Franco-Medina, Jorge;Pacheco-Pumaleque, Liz",Journal,Progress in Industrial Ecology,2023-01-01,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Huanta;Universidad Nacional de Cañete;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Chota;Universidad César Vallejo;Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas;Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos,methods engineering ;  process innovation ;  productivity ;  quality ;  study of methods ;  use of resources
Research on the Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Education and Teaching System,"The world has seen a significant transformation over the last ten years due to the steady advancement of innovation, which has also reduced processing power in many facets of everyday life. Understanding physical intelligence in all of its manifestations was one of computer science's major goals. Conventional teaching approaches that rely on lectures or include passive learning styles for the student are ineffective. Technology in higher education encourages interactive education, where the student's motivation increases and becomes the primary performer in his education. Artificial intelligence, a rapidly developing field of intelligence, can analyze vast amounts of data effectively and quickly, significantly enhancing the educational field. As a result, a smart education management framework employing artificial intelligence has been suggested. The framework is established inside a Hadoop-controlled storage group, which serves as the environment's server cluster. The associated facilities for education administration, learning platforms, and virtual teaching have been established in the framework. As a dataset, students were utilized. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to assess the use of AI in education. The test outcomes were assessed using several criteria and contrasted using different technologies. The test results demonstrate that AI has a beneficial effect on educational and instructional systems.","Gupta, Tannmay",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Edge Computing and Applications, ICECAA 2023",2023-01-01,"Chitkara University, Punjab",Analysis of variance (ANOVA) ;  artificial intelligence (AI) ;  Education ;  Hadoop ;  teaching system ;  virtual learning
The Requirements for Heutagogical Attunement within STEAM Education,"As we launch into an era marked by rapid technological advancements, education is experiencing disruptive transformations. Central to this shift is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), predictive hybrid cloud strategies, and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. As technology, AI becomes increasingly central to education; this paper explores the evolution of pedagogy in response to these changes, with a focus on the horizon. This investigation delves into the challenges and opportunities arising from the integration of AI, predictive hybrid cloud strategies, and LLMs into education, especially in the context of self-determined learning or heutagogy. The research looks into the role of collaboration, innovation, and adaptability in shaping curricula that prepare students for the fast-paced and dynamic landscape of the future, supported by AI, autonomous systems, and high-performance computing. The significance of problem-or project-based learning and cross-disciplinary collaboration is addressed, as this paper underscores the potential for preparing someone capable of future careers across various sectors. By integrating technology into education, the vision is of a globally connected, skilled, and innovative workforce ready to navigate a rapidly evolving world. Future research in this area might illuminate the potential of collaboration networks to drive sustainable improvements in learning and well-being.","Heilala, Janne;Shibani, Antonette;de Freitas, Adriano Gomes",Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2023-01-01,University of Technology Sydney;Monash University;Tampere University;Turun yliopisto;Universidade Federal do ABC,artificial intelligence (AI) ;  cross-disciplinary collaboration ;  education ;  future-ready learning ;  project-based learning
Research on the Generation of Patented Technology Points in New Energy Based on Deep Learning,"Effective extraction of patent technology points in new energy fields is profitable, which motivates technological innovation and facilitates patent transformation and application. However, since patent data exists the ununiform distribution of technology points information, long length of term, and long sentences, technology point extraction faces the dilemmas of poor readability and logic confusion. To mitigate these problems, the article proposes a method to generate patent technology points called IGPTP-a two-stage strategy, which fuses the advantage of extractive and generative ways. IGPTP utilizes the RoBERTa+CNN model to obtain the key sentences of text and takes the output as input of UNILM (unified pre-trained language model). Simultaneously, it takes a multi-strategies integration technique to enhance the quality of patent technology points by combining the copy mechanism and external knowledge guidance model. Substantial experimental results manifest that IGPTP outperforms the current mainstream models, which can generate more coherent and richer text.","Yang, Haixiang;You, Xindong;Lv, Xueqiang;Xu, Ge",Journal,International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems,2023-01-01,Beijing Information Science & Technology University;Minjiang University,RoBERTa ;  Text Extraction ;  Text Generation
Program and Project Management of Publicly Funded Research and Development: A Structural Viewpoint,"To accelerate innovation, forming consortia for collaborative research and development (R&D) is encouraged. Therefore, the government has funded some programs for large-scale R&D projects. The present study investigates the program and project structures to promote collaborative R&D across multiple disciplines and sectors. As a case for empirical study, the Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology (FIRST) in Japan was selected. A series of analyses at the program level (n=30 projects) show that factors that promote academic outcomes (e.g., scientific publications) and facilitate activities toward industrialization (e.g., creating intellectual property) are separated. Moreover, the results suggest that the number of researchers explains the number of publications, whereas the number of patent applications does not justify the number of registrations. An analysis at the project level (i.e., one of the projects subsidized by the FIRST Program) was performed as a case study. The results of the case study imply that a strong relationship between actors accelerates the R&D cycle by sharing common knowledge, while a weak relationship ensures trans-disciplinarity or sectoral diversity by transferring domain-specific knowledge. Further, these results indicate that different mechanisms could exist at the program and project levels.","Miyashita, Shuto;Katoh, Shogo;Anzai, Tomohiro;Sengoku, Shintaro",Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2023 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Managing Technology, Engineering and Manufacturing for a Sustainable World, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Institute of Science Tokyo;Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion,
Does the carbon emissions trading scheme improve the corporate environmental information disclosure level? Evidence from China,"Recently, a great deal of literature has discussed the effects of the carbon emissions trading scheme (CETS) and the factors that affect the corporate environmental information disclosure (CEID) level. However, no researchers have studied how CETS affects the CEID level. Based on a difference-in-difference-in-differences model, we discover that CETS can improve the CEID level. The findings are robust and persistent even after testing for time lags and leads effects, changing the measure of the dependent variable, testing for enterprise relocation, adjusting the fixed effect method, testing for concurrent policies, and performing placebo tests. The reason is that CETS can encourage corporate green technology innovation and environmental protection investment, thus improving the CEID level. Further investigation reveals that the impact of CETS on promoting the CEID level is more significant when the following conditions are met: the enterprises are in provinces and cities in the east and northeast; they are state-owned; and they have strong political connections. This paper expands on the current field of research on the influence effects of CETS, broadens the understanding of the factors influencing the CEID level, and investigates the mechanism by which CETS improves the CEID level.","Li, Peilun;Zhang, Huilin;Yang, Caiting;Zhang, Jiafeng",Journal,Energy and Environment,2023-01-01,The Graduate Center;Lanzhou University;South China University of Technology;The University of Hong Kong,carbon emissions trading scheme ;  difference-in-difference-in-differences model ;  environmental protection investment ;  green technology innovation ;  heterogeneity test

Evaluation of Agility in Innovative Projects in the Manufacturing Industry,"Studies confirm that companies in sectors that produce physical products when developing innovative projects, seek agility by adopting methods and practices from agile project management (APM) theory. The APM, designed by the software industry, recognized the power to bring rapid results to projects performed in environments with high volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, typical of innovative challenge tasks. In this context, studies carried out in the region with a diversified manufacturing park would benefit from understanding how to make its creative projects agile. Besides, this region is a representative sample to confirm the assumption that the combination of administrative aspects and practices can lead to greater agility. The research aims to evaluate the agile practices, the organizational factors, and their contribution to agility performance in the innovation projects of the manufacturing industry. Developed several methods to evaluate the agility in project management, so performed a systematic bibliometrics review was performed. The results analysis involved the use of the quantitative approach. Expect to have results highlighting the favorable aspects and barriers to implementing agility in this sector, besides reinforcing the assumption of the interdependence mentioned above between practices, context, and project performance.","Nascimento, Gustavo Lage;Oliveira, Marco Antonio;Futami, Andre Hideto;Hatakeyama, Kazuo",Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2023 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Managing Technology, Engineering and Manufacturing for a Sustainable World, Proceedings",2023-01-01,Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina;Polytechnic Institute of Bahia;Catholic University of Santa Catarina,
Optimization design of the load-bearing structure of press frame based on minimum flexibility,"In order to improve the stiffness and the accuracy of the press structure at work, this paper takes JH31-250 press as the research object and carries out the optimized structural design of the internal support frame in the walls of the press. The press frame model is established in SolidWorks and analyzed numerically in Abaqus for its mechanical properties under work conditions. We found out that the first-order inherent frequency of the press is much higher than the frequency of the excitations at work according to the finite element modal analysis results, so the press action load can be simplified as a static load. Therefore, static numerical analysis of the structure is carried out to assay the stress and the displacement distribution of the structure at work, and the variable density structural topology optimization technique with minimum flexibility as the goal is introduced to find the innovation configuration of the sidewalls. Then, we regularized the design domain of the topology optimization result. After these works, the optimal design of the structure is finally realized. The comparison between the original structure and the optimized structure shows that the low-order frequencies of the structure are changed slightly, but the relative deformation of the optimized structure is largely reduced by 12.4%. Considering the frequencies of various excitation sources during the operation of the press, it can be seen that the optimized structure meets the requirements of use and will not resonate, but the stiffness and accuracy have been greatly improved. The study of this demonstration can be a reference of structural optimization for similar products.","Shen, Cheng;Ding, Mingming;Tong, Zeqi;Liu, Jian;Zhang, Chenyang",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023-01-01,Zhejiang University of Water Resources and Electric Power,geometry regularize ;  JH31-250 press ;  modal analysis ;  static analysis ;  topology optimization ;  variable density method

Digital Twins of Complex Projects,"The Digital Twin (DT) concept has rapidly gained acceptance. More recently it has become clear that just as a DTs support product, they can also represent the activities needed to design, execute, and manage projects. DTs bring a remarkable potential to bring complex projects to market successfully and to support after-market phases including training, maintenance, repair and retirement. Project Design is a method that brings DTs to project management based on realistic and reliable project models, forecasts, and ongoing instrumentation. In Project Design, the digital twin represents not only the products, services, and processes being created, but also the project teams and their activities. In other words, the project itself is recognized as a system. Digital models are extended to include people and organization in addition to product and process. Feedback and feedforward with automated flows are a critical characteristic of DTs leading to better attention, decisions, and actions by teams. Three cases are shown which demonstrate Project Design with digital models, digital projections, and digital shadows of complex projects. These cases show a collaborative environment in which teams build models which capture the project as a sociotechnical system. The models integrate three fundamental contributing architectures: products, processes, and organization (PPO). While building the model, a view emerges of the relationships amongst these three which, in turn, promotes shared awareness of the project across teams. The model-building likewise shapes mental models as teams explore the impact of changes, variation in assumptions, architectural options, and other real-world execution parameters. An analytics engine, in this case an agent-based simulator, generates project forecasts which act as digital projections. The forecasts are more realistic than classic methods, as the simulations include the project’s uncertain demands, behaviors, feasibility, and coordination in dynamic interaction. A wide range of feasible project variants with schedules, costs, quality, and utilization are generated by simulation and compared to targets. Teams rapidly assess trade-offs, risks, what-if scenarios and contingencies. The model is adjusted: teams expanded or reduced, dependencies changed, activities added or removed, roles and responsibilities tuned, concurrency increased, worksites changed, etc. The project teams learn quickly how changes in their own roles, commitments, and priorities systemically impact the project results. As the project proceeds, estimates to completion including alternate paths forward are rapidly and easily analyzed. A long-lasting benefit of Project Design is that the DT is used over the project lifetime. A digital shadow evolves with the actual project as refinements and contingencies arise, immediately yielding new forecasts of quality, schedule and cost. Instrumentation of scope, interfaces, and teamwork brings significant new feedback to maintain alignment of the project model with the actual project. The model also acts as digital thread across the model’s connected PPO and across changes in the project over time, promoting persistence for practical leverage of information in future projects. Recent research advances in instrumentation and analytics, including placement of non-intrusive sensors across project elements and teamwork, rapidly reveal the health of the project and chances for success. Taking advantage of these techniques, new insights are yielded on teamwork as innovation and complex problem-solving across various industrial and government project domains.","Moser, Bryan R.;Grossmann, William",Book,The Digital Twin,2023-01-01,Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Global Project Design,Agent-based simulation ;  Digital Twin ;  Instrumented engineering teamwork ;  Model-based project management ;  Project design
"Human Factors, Innovation and Technology, and Cluster Strategies as Triggers of New Product Development","This paper reports the results of a cross-sectional investigation into the organizational factors that influence the development of new products in Mexican organizations. We examine the degrees of complexity to determine the influence of three organizational levels, divided into four variables, on New Product Development (NPD) activities. The first level is related to Human Factors (HF), which focuses on the internal members involved in the NPD activities and their functions. The second level is related to Innovation (Inn) and Technology (Tec), which corresponds to the level of processes established in the organization and during NPD. The final level corresponds to the Cluster Strategies (QS) employed by the organizations, which focuses on their ability to work collaboratively with other organizations outside of their current internal boundaries. The influences of the proposed variables are then analyzed with results showing that QS, Inn, Tec, and HF explain, in a range of 58.8%, the emergence of successful NPD based on R2. The study's findings provide a basis for future research through advanced statistical methods.","Ahumada-Tello, Eduardo;Evans, Richard",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2023-01-01,Dalhousie University;Universidad Autónoma de Baja California,Cluster strategies ;  human factors ;  new product development ;  technology and innovation
Knowledge Collaboration Approach in Smart Product Innovation Networks,"Due to the transformation of traditional domain specific products to smart, connected and interdisciplinary products that are increasingly developed within value creation networks, an exchange of innovation-relevant knowledge in early engineering phases is required, covering interdependencies of several technical systems. Knowledge-based collaboration within a value creation network could enable an acceleration during the innovation development of smart products. Discipline- and stakeholder-specific knowledge, e.g. semiconductor research and production knowledge along the product lifecycle must be prepared for the usage within innovation development. This paper introduces a conceptual approach of a knowledge base to support the collaboration during innovation processes within value creation networks for smart products. The main focus is the sharing of relevant knowledge from different stakeholders within the innovation value creation network. Through knowledge networking, decentrally collected initial knowledge is centralized, made explorable and realized through a three-stage tagging architecture similar to an ontology. The collaboration of different stakeholders is enabled through mutual knowledge interests and automated suggestions independent from their respective IT ecosystems. The presented approach is instantiated and validated by considering the function to charge mobile phones wirelessly while car driving. Prerequisites for the presented approach are discussed.","Mollahassani, Damun;Eickhoff, Thomas;Juresa, Yannick;Göbel, Jens C.",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2023-01-01,Rheinland-Pfälzische Technische Universität Kaiserslautern-Landau,Innovation Networks ;  Innovation Processes ;  Knowledge Base ;  Knowledge Collaboration ;  Smart Products ;  Value Creation Networks
Integrated technologies of an animal-robot mixed society: A systematic review,"Robots are being developed by researchers to be integrated into an animal group to form an animal-robot mixed society. In such a mixed society, the robots are expected to be able to manipulate and control the animal group through their taking part in the group’s self-organized behaviors and decision-making processes. The animal-robot mixed societies offer a powerful tool to advance the research of collective behaviors and their evolution. They can also be explored to manage domestic animals and wildlife, such as guiding them to specific places or away from danger. Due to their potential applications, the development of animal-robot mixed societies has recently elicited great interest in both the scientific and technological communities. However, to successfully integrate robots into an animal group faces many tougher challenges. One of the major challenges is how to enable the integrated robots to be accepted by animals as their group members to work with. In this review, we focus on the issue of the robots accepted by animals and provide a systematical review on the current state of the art of biomimetic robot designs and their integration ways, which are the two key aspects of creating an animal-robot mixed society. First, we take, for instance, the interactions between the specifically designed robots and one group of a single animal species, and point out that the bionic designs of robots exhibiting life-like appearance are less likely to promote the animals to accept and follow them because of animals’ kin recognition, by which group members may be identified. Secondly, we provide an in-depth discussion of the successful integration of robots into an animal group based on the imprint learning, a form of learning in which a very young animal fixes its attention on the first object and thereafter follows that object, and highlight the significance of social interaction rules in reinforcing animal-robot interactions. Finally, we propose that the future endeavors should focus on the social interaction rules-based technological innovation of creating an animal-robot society, including: (1) The animal-to-robot social attachment, which can be achieved by integrating robots into the group of young animals that their imprinting memories are not fully consolidated, and (2) the robust animal-robot interactions, which may rely on the development of the machine-learned or self-adaptive robots that are expected to automatically learn and dynamically adapt or respond to social interaction partners in real-time, and the enough number or amount of the integrated robots, estimated on the basis of the group’s decision-making that follows a probabilistic rule. To summarize, the animal-robot hybrid system represents a new multidisciplinary field of science, engineering and technology. Despite the many challengers faced, we believe that the social mechanisms or rules of animal groups will be greatly exploited to develop such hybridsystems that have more advanced intelligent than the systems we have now.","Liu, Fanglin;Jiang, Xueli;Di, Nayan",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,"University of Science and Technology of China;Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences",animal-robot interactions ;  biomimetic robots ;  group decision-making ;  imprint learning ;  kin recognition ;  self-organization
4-Dimensional printing: exploring current and future capabilities in biomedical and healthcare systems—a Concise review,"4-Dimensional Printing (4DP) is the latest concept in the pharmacy and biomedical segment with enormous potential in dosage from personalization and medication designing, which adopts time as the fourth dimension, giving printed structures the flexibility to modify their morphology. It can be defined as the fabrication in morphology with the help of smart/intelligent materials like polymers that permit the final object to alter its properties, shape, or function in response to external stimuli such as heat, light, pH, and moisture. The applications of 4DP in biomedicines and healthcare are explored with a focus on tissue engineering, artificial organs, drug delivery, pharmaceutical and biomedical field, etc. In the medical treatments and pharmaceutical field 4DP is paving the way with unlimited potential applications; however, its mainstream use in healthcare and medical treatments is highly dependent on future developments and thorough research findings. Therefore, previous innovations with smart materials are likely to act as precursors of 4DP in many industries. This review highlights the most recent applications of 4DP technology and smart materials in biomedical and healthcare fields which can show a better perspective of 4DP applications in the future. However, in view of the existing limitations, major challenges of this technology must be addressed along with some suggestions for future research. We believe that the application of proper regulatory constraints with 4DP technology would pave the way for the next technological revolution in the biomedical and healthcare sectors.","Agarwal, Neha;Solanki, Vijendra Singh;Ameta, Keshav Lalit;Yadav, Virendra Kumar;Gupta, Premlata;Wanale, Shivraj Gangadhar;Shrivastava, Ruchi;Soni, Anjali;Sahoo, Dipak Kumar;Patel, Ashish",Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2023-01-01,Medi-Caps University;Central University of Gujarat;Shail Group;Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University;Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University;Iowa State University;University of Lucknow,4-Dimensional Printing ;  4D bioprinting ;  biomedical application ;  healthcare ;  pharmaceutical applications ;  smart materials ;  sustainability
Application of Model-Based Systems Engineering for the Integration of Electric Engines in Electrified Aircraft,"The objective of green, carbon-neutral flights is propelling the innovation of newer propulsion systems. With this increased development of an interdisciplinary form of propulsion for aircraft, the integration burdens and efforts intensify. In literature, it is estimated that it takes 10-15 years to design and develop an aircraft. The expected date of entry for any hybrid electric aircraft is 2035-2040. Any innovation and effort to cut this time by any degree should be explored and analysed. One of the techniques that have the potential to help fast-track the research and development of interdisciplinary systems is Model-based System Engineering (MBSE). Various studies have shown the benefit of employing a model-based design strategy. The focus case study relates to the integration of the electric machine and the propeller, along with related sub-systems. For Hybrid Electric Propulsion (HEP), the electric machine and propeller need to be integrated and their interaction to be analysed. MBSE is proposed as a methodology that would help streamline the process of design and integration of the two systems. This study documents the exploration of connecting MBSE with current simulation and modelling of sub-systems in order to ensure the fulfilment of stakeholder needs and full system effectiveness. This paper establishes the research problem, and the approach to be pursued, and gives notice of first developments and expected follow-up work.","Kiran, Abhishek;Zaghari, Bahareh;Kipouros, Timoleon;Reis, Ricardo Jose Nunes Dos",Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2023-01-01,Cranfield University;AIRHOLDING S.A.,
"A perspective: Regeneration of soft and hard tissues in the oral cavity, from research to clinical practice","Regenerative medicine has gained much attention and has been a hot topic in all medical fields since its inception, and dentistry is no exception. However, innovations and developments in basic research are sometimes disconnected from daily clinical practice. This existing gap between basic research and clinical practice can only be addressed with improved communication between clinicians, academicians, industry, and researchers to facilitate the advance of evidence-based therapies and procedures and to direct research to areas of clinical need. In this perspective, six participants with strong clinical and research interests debated five previously conceived questions. These questions covered current methods and procedures for soft and hard tissue regeneration in the oral cavity with predictable outcomes, limitations of their respective protocols, and needs for future development of regenerative materials and technologies.","Puterman, Israel;Fien, Matthew J.;Mesquida, Juan;Ginebreda, Ignacio;Bauza, Guillermo;Somerman, Martha",Journal,Frontiers in Dental Medicine,2023-01-01,Swansea University Medical School;National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR);Private Practitioner;Private Practitioner;International Dentistry Research Group,dental implants ;  growth factors ;  guided tissue regeneration ;  oral soft tissues ;  periodontal disease ;  periodontal regeneration ;  scaffolds ;  tissue engineering
'Accelerating Engineering Education and Workforce Development in Automation & Control for the Semiconductor Industry Based on Cognitive Neuroscience',"The rapid development of the semiconductor industry represents a global challenge to meet the needs of Science, Technology, and Innovation in the 21st century. Advancements in semiconductors optimize computer technology with innovations, among others, in nanotechnology, quantum technology, cognitive computing, Cyber-Physical Human Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics. The rapid development of semiconductors demands an imperative acceleration of training and the development of a highly skilled workforce. There is a gap between the knowledge and skills of students in the current education system and the fast development of new knowledge. To accelerate comprehensive training in the semiconductor workforce we must start at an early stage, this paper proposes that STEM education must be pedagogically grounded in the advances of cognitive neuroscience and learning. By understanding how the brain functions and how it learns, the process can be enhanced, the education of an Integral Engineer needs to be addressed by forming professionals equipped with adaptability, complex problem-solving, assertive communication, emotional intelligence, interdisciplinary teamwork skills, systems, analytical and critical thinking.This paper proposes curricular transformation processes, ethical formation, pedagogical foundations of interdisciplinary research laboratories, enhanced by an international network of remote laboratories, and a TRUE system of cultural transformation.","Cruz, Luis Fernando;Luis Miguel Quevedo, M.;Moreno, Wilfrido Alejandro",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE Latin American Electron Devices Conference, LAEDC 2023",2023-01-01,"Universidad Manuela Beltrán;University of South Florida, Tampa;JWG S.A.S",controls systems ;  integral engineer ;  neuroscience ;  semiconductors industry ;  workforce
Video quality of video professionals for Video Assisted Referee (VAR),"Changes in the footballing world's approach to technology and innovation contributed to the decision by the International Football Association Board to introduce Video Assistant Referees (VAR). The change meant that under strict protocols referees could use video replays to review decisions in the event of a ""clear and obvious error"" or a ""serious missed incident"". This led to the need by Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) to develop methods for quality control of the VAR-systems, which was done in collaboration with RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB. One of the important aspects is the video quality. The novelty of this study is that it has performed a user study specifically targeting video experts i.e., to measure the perceived quality of video professionals working with video production as their main occupation. An experiment was performed involving 25 video experts. In addition, six video quality models have been benchmarked against the user data and evaluated to show which of the models could provide the best predictions of perceived quality for this application. Video Quality Metric for variable frame delay (VQM_VFD) had the best performance for both formats, followed by Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) and VQM General model.","Brunnström, Kjell;Djupsjöbacka, Anders;Billingham, Johsan;Wistel, Katharina;Andrén, Börje;Ozolinš, Oskars;Evans, Nicolas",Conference Proceeding,IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,2023-01-01,"Fédération Internationale de Football Association;RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB;Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)",
Research on Simulation Technology of Intelligent Manufacturing Scene Operation Mechanism Based on Evolutionary Game Theory,"Intelligent manufacturing is a continuously evolving and iteratively improving system engineering that requires long-term adherence and step-by-step implementation. The continuous process changes during scenario iteration have stimulated the demand for process simulation tools in intelligent manufacturing management processes. However, currently, existing tools mostly simulate process coherence and rarely simulate and verify the stability of the process. Accordingly, the article proposes a construction idea for an intelligent manufacturing scenario iteration management platform and combines the analysis of scenario innovation entities and strategies to innovate the simulation method of scenario innovation operation mechanism based on evolutionary game models, improve the comprehensiveness of simulation, and support the continuous iteration of intelligent manufacturing scenarios.","Men, Feng;Wang, Mian;Dong, Fangqia",Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2023-01-01,Catarc Automotive Industry Engineering,

6G Network Security Technology Based on Artificial Intelligence,"In the future, human society will enter the era of intelligence, and 6G will also achieve cross integration with information technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). 6G uses primitive artificial intelligence to continuously empower the whole society in the future and realize true universal intelligence. How to use 6G native AI to intelligently manage and control the future network resources and wireless resources, and how to use 6G network security technology are both hot research directions and key directions of future communication networks. Artificial intelligence technology has created new opportunities for innovation and business model driven by machine learning technology in 6G network. The end-to-end network automation of the future communication requires the system to actively discover dangers and threats, apply intelligent mitigation technology, and ensure the self sustainment of the 6G network. But in fact, the alliance between 6G and AI is also a double-edged sword. In most cases, AI technology can protect the security and privacy of the network, and may be used by criminals to violate information security and privacy. This paper analyzes the role of AI in 6G network security, analyzes the challenges that AI technology may encounter in 6G security, and proposes solutions.","Li, Xinlu;Ling, Canquan;Xu, Zhenyu",Book Series,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",2023-01-01,Huizhou Engineering Vocational College,6G ;  Artificial intelligence ;  Network security
A Roadmap for Technological Innovation in Multimodal Communication Research,"Multimodal communication research focuses on how different means of signalling coordinate to communicate effectively. This line of research is traditionally influenced by fields such as cognitive and neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and linguistics. With new technologies becoming available in fields such as natural language processing and computer vision, the field can increasingly avail itself of new ways of analyzing and understanding multimodal communication. As a result, there is a general hope that multimodal research may be at the “precipice of greatness” due to technological advances in computer science and resulting extended empirical coverage. However, for this to come about there must be sufficient guidance on key (theoretical) needs of innovation in the field of multimodal communication. Absent such guidance, the research focus of computer scientists might increasingly diverge from crucial issues in multimodal communication. With this paper, we want to further promote interaction between these fields, which may enormously benefit both communities. The multimodal research community (represented here by a consortium of researchers from the Visual Communication [ViCom] Priority Programme) can engage in the innovation by clearly stating which technological tools are needed to make progress in the field of multimodal communication. In this article, we try to facilitate the establishment of a much needed common ground on feasible expectations (e.g., in terms of terminology and measures to be able to train machine learning algorithms) and to critically reflect possibly idle hopes for technical advances, informed by recent successes and challenges in computer science, social signal processing, and related domains.","Gregori, Alina;Amici, Federica;Brilmayer, Ingmar;Ćwiek, Aleksandra;Fritzsche, Lennart;Fuchs, Susanne;Henlein, Alexander;Herbort, Oliver;Kügler, Frank;Lemanski, Jens;Liebal, Katja;Lücking, Andy;Mehler, Alexander;Nguyen, Kim Tien;Pouw, Wim;Prieto, Pilar;Rohrer, Patrick Louis;Sánchez-Ramón, Paula G.;Schulte-Rüther, Martin;Schumacher, Petra B.;Schweinberger, Stefan R.;Struckmeier, Volker;Trettenbrein, Patrick C.;von Eiff, Celina I.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2023-01-01,"Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics;Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour;Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona;Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats;Nantes Université;Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena;Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences;Universität zu Köln;Universitätsmedizin Göttingen;FernUniversität in Hagen;Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg;Universität Leipzig;Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main;University of Münster",Multimodal communication ;  Natural language processing ;  Technical innovation
Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Intensive Care in the Hospital: Opportunities and Challenges,"Innovative technologies promise to substantially transform clinical health care. In particular, applications of artificial intelligence are currently emerging as part of medical devices. Clinical intensive care in the hospital has traditionally been a setting in which health care professionals are extensively supported by technical products. Post-operative care after cardiac surgery constitutes a highly relevant realm for evaluating novel approaches with medical devices. Technological innovations may include probability estimates for diagnosis and prognosis by an artificial intelligence analysis of data combinations from different sources, voice and gesture control, remote assessment of skin perfusion, as well as optimized representation and visualization of clinical data. A requirements analysis, using empirical methods of social science research, was conducted in order to include stakeholders’ perspectives.

The ‘Three Creative’ Talent Characteristics Model,"With the development of China economy, talents have become core element of development. Nowadays, the transformation of national industrial technology innovation is imminent. More and more national-level strategies have put emphasis on the training of students from universities. The three-creative talents in colleges and universities specifically refer to innovation, creation, and entrepreneurial talents. From the perspective of experience of technological innovation, innovation and creation is the foundation of entrepreneurship, but few studies have explored the experience relationship between the three creative and student entrepreneurial characteristics. Hence, this paper aims to explore the potential ‘Three Creative’ talent characteristics experience model in relation with entrepreneurial characteristics and experiences of the university students, which investigates potential influence of three creativity experience in university students' characteristics (background, personality, and entrepreneurial traits) regarding innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial potential, and establishes the relationship between them. This paper sums up the relevant traits that affect the performance of university students in the field of entrepreneurship (abbreviated to entrepreneurial traits), the evaluation index of university students in the field of entrepreneurship, such as entrepreneurial willingness, entrepreneurial potential, and entrepreneurial success rate, and the evaluation mechanism of the relationship between students' traits and the field of entrepreneurship, which is what methods are used to learn from university students. As such, the relationship between the quality of students and the evaluation indexes in the field of entrepreneurship can be established. Subsequently, the paper puts forward the mechanism of association of innovation, which connects the personality and background traits of university students with the entrepreneurial potential.","Liu, Zhen;Yang, Jinze;Chen, Yali;Cui, Jia",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2023-01-01,South China University of Technology,Background ;  Creativity Experience ;  Entrepreneurial Potential ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Model ;  Personality ;  Student Characteristics ;  Three Creative
A novel role for enhancing nurse-technology interfaces and medical device advancements for patient care,"To instruct a new generation of professional, this paper will highlight two innovative nursing and health technology collaborations and produce cutting-edge research and breakthroughs. A highly competent response, including teams of experts from several disciplines, is required for complex health concerns. Opportunities for improved technology-nurse interaction and consequent innovation arise if the clinical perspective of nursing is included while viewing medical engineering through a wider lens. The finest training-seeking experienced nurse specialists who can be cutting-edge and bring unique suggestions to enhance patient care and results are found in double nursing engineering degree programs. The background in innovations and engineering in nursing is included in this examination, along with the justification for creating two state-of-the-art joint majors and information about those courses. This innovative program will advance healthcare-related technology and enhance the nursing profession’s capacity for innovation in both design and execution. Additionally, by providing interdisciplinary training and encounters with college students pursuing medical specialists or bachelor’s degrees in nursing, they can improve their knowledge and abilities. Even though nurses are not participating in designing and creating patient care devices, significant patient care improvement possibilities are lost. Creative nurse and engineer cooperation is required to capitalize on nurse creativity and develop patient care improvements.","Mudhol, Basavaraj;Krishna, Meena;Kademane, Asha",Journal,"Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia",2023-01-01,"ATLAS SkillTech University;Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad;JAIN (Deemed-to-be University)",Healthcare Systems ;  Medical Device Advancements ;  Nurse-Technology Interfaces ;  Patient Care

Constructing Cultural Branding for Sustainability: A Case Study of Designing ‘Traditional Circular’ into ‘Modern Product’,"The fusion of creativity and cultural elements is one of the topics that researchers have discussed for a long time. In addition to being able to integrate with innovation, the cultural elements are not only a carrier that highlights local culture and global design value, but also the basis for shaping cultural brands. This research takes cultural element “Circular” as the starting point, combined with corresponding academic theories, and explores the value of transforming “cultural elements” into “commercial connotation”. Finally, taking the wedding custom of “Ten-Mile Red Dowry” in eastern Zhejiang of China as a research case, the paper is to analyze the reasons for the emergence and decline of the concept of “Circle” in traditional wedding custom relics. Continuing, the concept of interaction between culture and human factors engineering is used to carry out innovative design practice and build a model of sustainable development of cultural elements. It is hoped that this research will respond to the sustainable development of cultural elements through design practice and show the value of cultural and creative industries.","Cao, Jing;Lin, Po Hsien;Lin, Rungtai",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2023-01-01,National Taiwan University of Arts;Hangzhou Dianzi University,Creative product ;  Cultural branding ;  Cultural elements ;  Designing “Circular” ;  Sustainability
Research and Practice of Outcome-Oriented Innovative Talent Training System of Material Specialty,"In the context of emerging engineering, the new education model based on outcome is the direction of teaching reform. Traditional training systems of material professionals can no longer meet the needs of the current society and industry. Thus, it is necessary to reform training systems to promote the balanced development of students’ professional competency, engineering literacy and development ability. Aiming at material specialty, this paper analyzes the problems existing in traditional talent training system, and studies the latest talent needs in society by tracking and investigating graduates and employers. Based on the above analysis and research, a new talent training course system, teaching system and evaluation system are constructed. After the implementation of this talent training system, students’ participation in innovation and entrepreneurship training, competitions and other extracurricular activities has increased significantly. Meanwhile, students’ non-technical ability has also been significantly improved. The acceptance rate of graduate students has reached more than 50%, and 73.97% of graduates are still engaged in material-related work.","Yang, Hu;Cao, Qian",Book Series,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2023-01-01,Wuhan University of Technology,Emerging engineering ;  Material specialty ;  Non-technical ability evaluation ;  Outcome-based education ;  Talent training system

MEASUREMENT OF WATER MATRIIAL POTENTIAL IN THE SOIL THROUGH INSTRUMENTED TENSIOMETERS WITH PRESSURE SENSORS AND PUNCTURE DEVICE,"Objective: The search for a practical and accessible solution for measuring water tension in the soil using tensiometers is fundamental for irrigation management, efficient use of water and increased profitability of irrigated crops. The objective of this study was to propose a technique based on the instrumentation of a tensiometer with a pressure sensor and a device for reading the sensor's response. Theoretical Frame: This study used the following main quotes as a theoretical basis: Freescale and NPX Semiconductors manufacturers of pressure sensors, Azevedo & Silva for the soil water tension correction methodology and Van Genuchten to describe the relationship between soil water content and suction. Method: Pressure transducers with a range of 0-50 and 0-100 kPa were used, with an analog signal varying between 200 and 4700 mV, whose response was measured by a digital multimeter with the scale adjusted to V or mV. The transducer was adapted by attaching a hypodermic needle Nº7/30 to the vacuum measurement inlet, leaving the other inlet free for the atmosphere. The transducer was powered by a 9 Vcc battery with rectified voltage to 5 Vcc through a specific integrated circuit for this function. The conversion of the transducer response signal in mV to voltage in kPa was performed using the response function informed by the manufacturer, reversing the order of the variables so that the voltage could be measured as a function of the output signal in mV. The system was used to measure the water tension in the soil of tensiometers installed in an area cultivated with tomatoes in a greenhouse during a complete cycle, functioning satisfactorily. Results and conclusions: During the experimental period, the water tension in the soil observed with the new tensiometer with pressure sensor and sensor response reading device ranged from 0.00 kPa (minimum tension) to 53.33 kPa (maximum tension) in the two soil layers. analyzed soil, while the average tension was 23.64 kPa in the 0-20 cm soil layer and 21.38 kPa in the 20-40 cm layer. Soil moisture obtained from soil water tension and soil water retention curve ranged from 0.11 (minimum) to 0.50 m3 m-3 (maximum) in both studied soil layers, while that the average soil moisture in the depth from 0 to 20 cm was 0.21 m3 m-3 and from 20 to 40 cm was 0.20 m3 m-3. The instrumented tensiometer with pressure sensor and sensor response reading device makes it possible to satisfactorily determine the matrix potential of water in the soil. The matriial tension data obtained with the new pressure sensor are consistent with reports in the literature as adequate to provide higher yields in tomato cultivation. The technique and instrumentation proposed in this study allows measuring the water tension in the soil, knowing the soil moisture and carrying out irrigation management, applying an irrigation depth according to the needs of the plants, making a more efficient use of water and providing water and electricity savings. Implications of the research: This study qualifies as being of great relevance for the purposes of the Department of Agronomic Engineering at the Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso, Nova Mutum Campus, as well as for the entire academic and scientific community and rural producers interested in tensiometers to carry out a management of water from the soil and farm sustainably. Originality and value: The study sought to present to the academic, scientific and rural producers community a practical and accessible solution for measuring the water tension in the soil through tensiometers, thus providing current information on a new instrument for irrigation management, which makes it possible to carry out a more efficient use of water and increase the profitability of irrigated crops.","de Queiroz, Tadeu Miranda;de Matos, Rigoberto Moreira;Júnior, Santino Seabra;Vieira, Carlos Luiz;Fagundes, Minéia Cappellari",Journal,Revista de Gestao Social e Ambiental,2023-01-01,Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso,Innovation ;  Irrigation ;  Moisture ;  Sustainable Agriculture ;  Tension
The Role of Competencies in the Educational Process of Training Future Specialists in the “Labour Training and Technologies” Speciality,"From a theoretical point of view, Ukrainian education for teachers of the ""Labour training and technologies"" specialty is in the process of searching for effective methods that would ensure the future education of schoolchildren through the transfer of relevant competencies, which are regulated by education standards. Such competencies have been analyzed in the present research. In addition, the theoretical developments of both domestic and foreign teachers, in particular, of Scandinavian countries, are taken into account in the formation of labor education for schoolchildren. The present research pays particular attention to the newest standpoint in the assessment of the perception of competencies and their understanding by students of the ""Labour Training and Technologies"" specialty. The academic paper represents the results of acquiring the competencies by students of the ""Labour training and technologies"" specialty at the Central Ukrainian State Pedagogical University named after Volodymyr Vynnychenko. The main revealed regularities indicate the fact that students of the corresponding specialty quite superficially understand the role and significance of mastering the competencies defined by the standard of Ukrainian education. A characteristic feature of acquiring the competencies by students is their awareness of civic and social competencies. Competencies in the field of natural sciences, engineering and technology, and innovation are perceived by them to a lower rank. The research has identified the most painful problems regarding competencies that are not perceived by students, namely: creative activity, information, a communication component, and culture. Insufficient attention is paid to mathematical competence, financial literacy, and the environmental component. The results of the present research have indicated the need for additional discussions on the methods of perception of competencies by students to improve the educational process and curricula towards increasing learning efficiency. The research results obtained create opportunities for a more flexible expansion of applying existing digital systems in the formation of competencies according to educational standards and the implementation of a motivational approach in increasing the level of self-development of students and teachers of the ""Labour Training and Technologies"" specialty.","Debre, Oleksii;Vakulenko, Nadiia;Savchenko, Anastasiia;Lysenko, Larysa;Kondor, Marianna;Kis, Alla",Journal,Journal of Curriculum and Teaching,2023-01-01,Poltava V.G.

Nature-Based Solutions to Address the Plastics Problem: Biomimicry,"The challenge of plastic is complex and multidimensional. When coupled with ambitious environmental policies and climate targets, it is imperative to explore advanced sustainable strategies, continuously evolving regenerative paradigms, and solutions that radically improve the previously affected social and planetary health. Efforts and effective strategies for plastic source reduction are essential in the long term. Yet, there are various high-risk applications made possible by the unique features of plastic that cannot be simply reduced. Integrating a science-based system level methodology into design practices increases the ability of global market to capitalize on opportunities that promote environmentally responsible design, research, and development practices. Biomimicry is a nature inspired design methodology that not only can advance Zero Plastic Waste strategies but also facilitates the move towards achieving the Paris goals globally. This chapter looks at the opportunities and barriers for enabling the necessary paradigm shift for system-level transformative innovation at the intersection of science, engineering, and policy to proactively respond to the increasingly destructive impacts of plastic.","Ficzkowski, Negin;Krantzberg, Gail",Book,Plastic Pollution: Nature Based Solutions and Effective Governance,2023-01-01,McMaster University,
The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Engineering,"Engineering education has had a rich tradition of educational innovation, but until the 1980s, assessment of innovation was typically of the “the authors tried it and liked it and so did the students” variety. This situation began to change in the 1980s, when substantial support for scholarship in engineering education became available through the NSF Division of Undergraduate Education and the NSF-sponsored Engineering Education Coalitions program. A large part of the challenge of legitimizing the scholarship of teaching in engineering education involves overcoming this skepticism. The qualitative research methods used widely in the social sciences are gradually percolating into the engineering education literature, although few engineering professors are familiar with them. Although the scholarship of teaching and learning is starting to have an impact on engineering education, formidable barriers to its acceptance remain, the most critical of which are the reward structure in colleges of engineering and engineering professors own lack of pedagogical knowledge.","Wankat, Phillip C.;Felder, Richard M.;Smith, Karl A.;Oreovicz, Frank S.",Book,Disciplinary Styles in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning: Exploring Common Ground,2023-01-01,College of Engineering;University of Minnesota Twin Cities;Purdue University;SUCCEED Engineering Education Coalition,

A Study on the Impact of Digital Finance on Green Technology Innovation,"This study uses panel data from Chinese cities to research the impact of digital finance on green technology innovation. The empirical results show that digital finance helps to enhance green technology innovation and has a greater effect on green technology innovation activities in small and medium-sized cities, which is because digital finance can use the new generation of information technology to overcome the “siphoning effect” of large cities and enhances the inclusive ability of “diffusion effect” to green technology innovation. The findings of the text can provide empirical evidence and policy implications for how to use digital finance to drive green technology innovation.","Wang, Wei;Bian, Xiaohu",Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2023-01-01,Harbin University of Commerce,Digital finance ;  Green technology innovation ;  Inclusive functionality

Frontiers of Implantable Multimodal Neural Interfaces,"Significance The nervous system is composed of different types of neurons connected in a network. Neurons communicate with each other through electrochemical signals, and this dynamic interaction of neurons is the internal driving force of human perception, cognition, and behavior. Deciphering and understanding the meaning of various complex neural activities is of great significance in the frontiers of neurological disease diagnosis and treatment, neurological rehabilitation, fundamental brain science, and several brain-computer interface applications. To achieve this, it is critical to develop advanced neural interfaces capable of interacting with the dynamic neural activities and nervous system. Fundamental research in this field has rapidly increased over the past few decades as a result of advancements in neuroscience and neurotechnology. This research includes the development of innovative neural recording and modulation tools that have provided researchers with an early glimpse into previously unanswerable questions, such as determining how the mind works, or which have been recognized and funded by a host of initiatives. In recent years, the United States, European countries, Japan, and China have launched their own brain initiatives to support this emerging field. In the future, in order to completely understand the complex structural and functional nervous system, more powerful tools must be developed to record, transmit, and modulate signals using multiple approaches. These tools must have the ability to manipulate neuron cell types specifically while minimizing side effects such as“the observer effect.” Neurological disorders affect more than one billion people worldwide, accounting for 7% of the total global disease burden, and this number is expected to increase substantially as human life expectancy increases and with increased population aging. This is largely due to neuropsychiatric diseases (including Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson s disease, epilepsy, and so on) and cerebrovascular diseases, which impose a heavy burden on society and individuals, while also promoting advances and developments in neuroengineering, biomedical science, and technology. Currently, the treatment of these diseases relies primarily on drug therapy or implantable electrical stimulation devices, such as injecting current into the target tissue through metal electrodes to activate or suppress the action potential of neurons, as well as to achieve therapeutic purposes, including using cochlear implants, deep brain stimulators, spinal cord electrical stimulation, and visual prostheses to reduce symptoms or restore nerve functions. Progress With the enrichment of multiple neural modalities, neural technologies and tools have been increasingly augmented, and have been widely used to collect neuron activities in vivo from individual neurons to neuron populations in different brain areas, with a variety of signal recording and modulation manners (Fig. 1). In addition, advances in genetic engineering, especially optogenetics, allow us to continuously control specific types of neurons with high accuracy and fidelity over a short period. The rapid development of genetically encoded neural probes provides new avenues for real-time and high-speed neural recording. Various optical, electrical, and chemical tools have been developed to record and modulate neural activities. Currently, the monolithic integration of multiple functional features has become a pressing demand and challenge in neural engineering, while flexible neural implants are expected to establish seamless integration with the soft biological tissue and achieve a high-bandwidth close-loop interaction with the nervous system. It will provide a powerful tool for identifying complex neural circuits, as well as diagnosing and treating neurological diseases. In order to more accurately understand the brain neural network and its working mechanism, and to treat neurological diseases with high selectivity, it is necessary to simultaneously monitor neural activities with high spatial and temporal resolution. The combination of electrophysiological and optical methods (for example, two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recording) can maximize the synergistic effect of the two methods, making up for the shortcomings of each method. Implantable multimodal neural interfaces integrate these approaches by maximizing their benefits and efficacy, providing neuroscientists with new access to the brain and revolutionizing applications such as the treatment and rehabilitation of neurological diseases. In order to achieve this, we need to understand the various neurotechnologies individually, how they function, as well as how they work together. Implantable neural interfaces have already been successfully employed in the long-term stable interrogation of large-scale neural activities and clinically restoring sensorimotor function in disabilities. However, they are limited in the long run by poor biocompatibility, mechanical mismatches between the device and neural tissue, and the risk of chronic inflammatory reactions after implantation. In addition, traditional neural probes are limited by spatial and temporal resolution and scalabilities, and still face challenges in the study of large-scale neural networks in situ (Fig. 1). To this end, long-term stability is achieved by matching the mechanical properties of the implanted device with those of the internal biological tissue. High spatial and temporal resolution and even specificity can be obtained by reducing the feature size of implants and mimicking the structural morphology of neurons. Multimodal neural interfaces are currently emerging, in particular, a variety of clinical multimodal implantable devices have been developed to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s disease, epilepsy, and depression. However, traditional device designs, such as electrophysiological readout, fluorescence cell imaging, and the structural dynamics of the brain, may conflict with each other during different data acquisition processes. Severe electrophysiological signal contamination caused by photoelectric (magnetic) artifacts can also occur. Over the past decade, there have been efforts to address these challenges, and many excellent results have emerged regarding the latest advances in neural technologies and applications. Conclusions and Prospects With the development of neural probe structures and materials, as well as the innovation of synthetic technologies for nanoparticles, dye molecules, and genetically encoded proteins, it is expected that neural technology will continue to be developed toward the limits of the lifetime, localization and specificity of neural recording and stimulation, and will eventually blur the boundary between living biological tissue and physical equipment and tools. These cutting-edge neural technologies, which combine advanced optical and nanoelectronic technologies, optogenetics, genetically encoded indicators, and acoustic and magnetic tools, provide us with unprecedented opportunities for new multimodal neural information interactions, with which powerful paradigms for multimodal inquiry of brain activity will be foreseen, and will even fundamentally alter how brain activity maps to the physical world.","Xu, Mingliang;Li, Fangyuan;Liu, Yueqi;Zhang, Jinhui;Shi, Yazhou;He, Fei",Journal,Zhongguo Jiguang/Chinese Journal of Lasers,2023-01-01,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;University of Science and Technology of China;Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences;Zhangjiang Laboratory,biomedical imaging ;  cerebral hemodynamics ;  implantable devices ;  medical optics ;  micro/nano-fabrication ;  neural interfaces ;  optoelectronics ;  optogenetics

Legal environmental regulation and green technology innovation of energy enterprises: based on panel threshold regression,"Legal environmental regulation is not only an important tool for green technology innovation and energy efficiency improvement, but also a key measure for enterprise upgrading and high-quality economic development. Based on the panel data of China’s listed energy companies from 2010 to 2020, this paper finds that legal environmental regulation has a significant positive impact on enterprise green technological innovation by using SYS-GMM. And the threshold regression model is used to examine the nonlinear impact of legal environmental regulation on green technology innovation in this paper. The results show that the positive impact of legal environmental regulation on green output of energy enterprises is more prominent than that of non-R&D investment. In addition, the impact of legal environmental regulation on green technology innovation of energy enterprises has a threshold effect. That is, the loose legal environmental regulation (LER ≤ 399.656) has a negative impact on the green output of energy enterprises, while the impact of strict legal environmental regulation (LER > 399.656) is the opposite. Meanwhile, the loose legal environmental regulation (LER ≤ 491.291) and strict legal environmental regulation (LER > 491.291) have a negative impact on the non-R&D investment of energy enterprises. Finally, there are huge differences in green technology innovation capabilities of energy enterprises.","Xu, Didong;Chen, Yadi;Wang, Jia;Huang, Xiaoyue",Journal,Frontiers in Energy Research,2023-01-01,Nanning Normal University;School of Business;Zhejiang University of Water Resources and Electric Power,energy enterprises ;  green output ;  green technology innovation ;  legal environmental regulation ;  non-R&D investment ;  panel threshold regression

Developing an interactive pile training module for construction risk management and gaging users’ intentions,"Purpose: This study aims to develop a novel theoretical model for predicting the users’ intention to use virtual tools designed for construction risk evaluation. Risk evaluation is a vital objective for construction managers. This paper intends to examine critical factors such as potential benefits, motivation, performance expectancy and rich sources of information that may affect users’ intention to use virtual technology. Design/methodology/approach: A pile training module (PTM) was developed in a virtual environment to analyze the proposed virtual reality-technology acceptance model (VR-TAM) factors. Further, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the participation of 102 construction professionals in China to validate the proposed VR-TAM model and PTM tool. The retrieved data was computed to test the proposed model by using partial least squares structural equation modeling and the significance of the PTM tool in a virtual environment. Findings: The results of this study reveal that high-significance paths represent five relationships between crucial factors affecting users’ intention to use a selected virtual reality (VR) module. Five of seven hypothesis paths were significant with acceptable t-values. By quantitative measurement of high-significance paths, this research has found that each factor under VR-TAM has received significant loadings, with many above the 0.7 threshold mark and others around 0.6. The top factors include “motivation” and “benefits” and have multiplier effects on “intention to use” as the source factors. Practical implications: The finding of this study presents crucial factors for VR adoption, and the proposed VR-TAM model contributes to the body of knowledge toward managing construction risk using pre-optimization and understanding in a virtual environment. This study supports Chinese construction company managers in effectively using VR technology in their construction projects for risk assessment and management. Originality/value: This study offered the development of a novel VR-TAM integrated with risk assessment techniques for piling processes. Further, the developed model was analyzed by using a survey of Chinese construction professionals to collect perceptions about the modified theoretical model of VR-TAM.","Du, Wei;Sepasgozar, Samad M.E.;Khan, Ayaz;Shirowzhan, Sara;Garzon Romero, Juan",Journal,Construction Innovation,2023-01-01,University of South Australia;UNSW Sydney,BIM ;  Building ;  Chinese construction industry ;  Construction ;  Construction engineering management ;  Construction technology ;  Innovation ;  Pile training module ;  PLS-SEM method ;  Risk management ;  Virtual reality

It is expected to improve the effectiveness of industrial generic technology innovation.","Long, Yue;Zeng, Qinzhou;Chen, Qihao",Journal,Engineering Letters,2023-01-01,Chongqing Technology and Business University,Industrial Generic Technology Innovation ;  Knowledge Ecology ;  Knowledge Interaction ;  Subsidy
Research on the impact of green technology innovation on enterprise financial information management based on compound neural network,"To enhance the early warning level of financial risks in enterprises, mitigate the financial risks arising from diverse adversities, and drive green technological innovation and sustainable development, this study proposes a financial risk prediction model (MS-BGRU) that amalgamates multi-scale convolution and two-way GRU. Firstly, a multi-scale feature extraction module is devised that assimilates financial information from various scales by leveraging hole convolution with distinct expansion rates. This assimilated information is then fused to obtain richer context information. Secondly, the BGRU network is employed to discern the sequence characteristics and time information of financial indicators. The empirical results showcase that the model proposed in this paper exhibits a high identification accuracy, surging up to 98.03%, which surpasses other benchmark models. The model can accurately prophesize the financial risk of enterprises and offer guidance to management decision-makers in averting financial risk.","Sun, Si;Zhang, Xuandong;Dong, Li;Fan, Lu;Liu, Xiaojing",Journal,Journal of Organizational and End User Computing,2023-01-01,Henan Polytechnic University;Dankook University;Silla University,BGRU ;  Financial Risk Prediction ;  Green Technology Innovation ;  Neural Network
Research on enterprise digital agility based on machine learning: An evaluation of green financial technology,"To help enterprises quickly adapt to the environment of green finance, a technology innovation performance prediction method based on machine learning is proposed to improve digital convenience. Firstly, by analyzing scientific and technological innovation, the authors design four characteristics: The number of theses, the quantity and quality of projects, the level of technology transformation, and the value of commercialization. Then, according to the above features, a feature processing method based on improved attention mechanism is proposed to deeply explore the internal relationship between the four features. Finally, a performance evaluation method is used based on the temporal convolution network (TCN) that can predict the performance of scientific and technological innovation by inputting enhanced features. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed method can reach 0.846, 0.869, and 0.851 in terms of the precision, recall, and H value, respectively, which can help enterprises predict the performance and improve the electronic convenience of enterprises.","Zhang, Ying;Chen, Hong;Ju, Keyi",Journal,Journal of Global Information Management,2023-01-01,Jiangsu University of Science and Technology;Yangtze University;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,Digital management ;  Green finance ;  Improved attention ;  Scientific and technological innovation
Let's Not Forget our VTOL Forebears and Historical Aircraft,"Going back to the days of Leonardo DaVinci, and perhaps earlier, there has been significant interest in being able to fly vertically and hover. These tasks require innovation, engineering, and scientific knowhow in many disciplines and then blending them together to create a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) flying machine. Vertical flight enthusiasts recognize just a few of the names of great inventors that set the foundation for our great VTOL industry today. However, there are many individuals whose names are either forgotten or were never in the limelight of VTOL aircraft developed over the past 80 years. A VTOL machine is an ingenious contraption of innovation in mechanical systems, materials, aerodynamics, flight controls, and structures. Over time add to these inventions the advancements in integrated modular avionics, electronics, electro-mechanical actuators, computers, mathematics, vibration suppression, and fiber optics to name a few. However, the most important contribution to our VTOL advancements is from people. Not just technically trained people, but inventors, pilots, managers, professors and the investors willing to direct personal, public, and corporate funds to the Research, Development, Testing & Engineering necessary to build a VTOL aircraft. Over 20 years ago, the Vertical Flight Society started Vertipedia which is an initiative to capture the many names of not only our VTOL forebears, but also to identify the many diverse and wonderful VTOL aircraft that were built. This historical work provides valuable and interesting information about our glorious past but is incomplete and not well-known enough to be used as a handy reference for students, enthusiasts, and the burgeoning list of newcomers to our industry. Also, the historical database program was started at a time when Information Technologies (IT) systems were not as robust as they are today. The rapid developments in technology are spawning all-electric and hybrid fuel cell VTOL multi-copters and unique configurations at an unprecedented pace. These transformative air vehicles are encouraging a new wave of VTOL enthusiasts, many whom have not had the traditional aeronautical and aviation background that would have exposed them to our VTOL forefathers and aircraft history. Cultivating VTOL history plays an important part in helping future generations of VTOL developers to avoid mistakes and learn from the work of others, both failures and successes. Our VTOL heritage is rapidly losing access to our forebears and the lessons learned they can teach all of us. Knowing our history makes our VTOL future better. The time is now to revisit the VFS historical database for correctness and completeness. However, we can do more. By leveraging social media and crowdsourcing, we have an opportunity to document untold stories from our living and deceased forebears and their co-workers, friends, and generational family members. An online infomediary that collects crowdsourced information can not only fill in gaps in the VTOL history, but it can add insight to challenges, decision-making, alternate ideas, and many other untold and undocumented history that is both colorful and educational. Crowd-sourced commentary not only adds colorful insight for our VTOL community, but it can invigorate our current and next generation of people that will continue to push our VTOL developments to yet un-known areas! This paper provides examples of crowd-sourced design requirements and examples of stories from the authors personal histories. The intention to light a spark in others to do the same and create an historical infomediary that can be embraced by the global VTOL community.","Stanzione, Kaydon A.;Schrage, Daniel P.",Conference Proceeding,FORUM 2023 - Vertical Flight Society 79th Annual Forum and Technology Display,2023-01-01,College of Engineering,
Social workers' socio-occupational insertion in Chile's Ministry of Housing and Urbanism,"Introduction. The present study focused on the socio-occupational insertion of social workers in Chile's Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (MINVU). The exploratory results of the analysis contribute to the debate on the place of social work inside the MINVU and the functions of social work in this intervention area. Based on a historic-critical social work approach, the theoretical debate can be linked to the ethical-political dimension of the profession. The profession can also be understood to mediate social class interests and struggles, and that social workers are equally working class. In addition, from a critical spatial perspective, space was understood not merely from a physical viewpoint but also as a product of social struggles. We addressed the following research questions: What are the objective labour conditions of MINVU social workers? And how is the social worker's position considered inside the MINVU in terms of role legitimation, challenges, as well as the scope and limits of their professional action? Methodology. A mixed methods study was conducted, differentiating the objects of quantitative analysis (objective aspects) and qualitative analysis (subjective aspects). In the quantitative analysis, a descriptive analysis was conducted based on an official state database on the number of employees at the MINVU (N=5.569) and labour conditions. The qualitative analysis centred on ten semi-structured interviews with social workers who had working experience within the MINVU. Results. Regarding material socio-occupational insertion conditions, social workers represented 11% of the MINVU labour force, i.e., more than other social science professions. Nevertheless, social workers had a lower average salary and were less represented in management positions. Their functions were related to informal settlements, neighbourhoods, urban development, and housing, as well as establishing bridges between engineering and architecture and the users' communities. The qualitative analysis showed a gradual profession insertion and legitimation process within the MINVU, affected by a gendered institutional structure and gender prejudices. Interdisciplinary dialogues were growing, especially with architects. However, undergraduate education on spatial issues among the professionals was scarce or inexistent. For this reason, the theory was not valued by practitioners, though the latter did recognise the need for methodological innovation. Discussion. Understanding individual trajectories was found to be a relevant means of expression of collective professional trajectories. In the present case, such trajectories were affected by gender inequalities and prejudices. Moreover, several opportunities for critical interventions were detected. Conclusions. Social work practitioners and scholars are facing a number of theoretical, methodological, and political challenges. It is necessary to acknowledge the new academic field of social intervention spatiality and territorial social work as a professional speciality. In this way, adopting a historic-critical perspective in social work would contribute to socio-spatial transformation processes.","Cortés, Felipe Saravia;Bravo, Víctor Orellana;Torres, Francisca Díaz",Journal,Alternativas,2023-01-01,Universidad del Bio Bio;Universidad de Chile,social work education ;  social workers ;  socio-occupational insertion ;  State ;  territory ;  urbanism

Advances and Innovations in Shelters to Cover Needs in Emergency Housing Situations,"Throughout the history of humanity, housing emergencies have frequently occurred due to war conflicts, migratory events, natural disasters, etc. In this sense, technological advances have given rise to new solutions to resolve these situations. Therefore, the objective of the research will focus on the study of the emergency shelter in the reception phase, since it is the most emergency situation, to determine how related technologies have been developed in the last decade (2012–2022). Regarding the methodology, it will focus on the analysis and evaluation of scientific publications and patents, as well as on the location of commercial solutions for humanitarian distribution, beyond the tents, as well as some experimental designs and initiatives, collecting data on the characteristics of said technological advances and to what extent they resolve the corresponding situation. The results indicate that, in the last decade, the growth in the number of investigations and patents has been very pronounced with the technological hegemony of certain countries, concluding that significant progress has been made, although there is still a long way to go, especially to guarantee that these advances reach the people who need it.","Marín-García, David;Andrade-Maeso, Juan Antonio;Bienvenido-Huertas, David;Moyano, Juan",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2023-01-01,Universidad de Sevilla;Universidad de Granada,Housing emergencies ;  Humanitarian architecture and engineering ;  Shelters
Digitally enhancing interior architecture education: Case of online building surveying class,"Interior architecture has a key role in the sustainability agenda of the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, being directly related to adaptive reuse projects. As adaptive reuse projects rely on the analysis of the existing building and its environment, building surveying (BS) has significant importance for the profession. While the BS practice has significantly evolved through the use of new technology encompassing digital photogrammetry, BS education seems lagging behind. Despite the presence of promising computer-assisted learning prototypes for decades, these methods are far from being implemented broadly into the curriculum. However, this reluctance is challenged by the emergency situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the need for new digital teaching methods became apparent. This paper describes the development of a digital practice module for BS education for interior architecture students. In an experimental practice based on action research, interior architecture students are introduced to a digital surveying application. After a brief introduction by an expert, students are directed to research sources and third-party video tutorials. They are asked to collaborate in groups to solve how to use the software application themselves. Following the research period, students completed two sets of practices. Although the research period was kept short, the progress of the students’ performance between these two practices, and the results indicate interest in digital practices. The outcomes of the research are promising for implementing digital technologies into the interior architecture department’s BS course curriculum.","İlter, A.

The evolution of technical prerequisites and local boundary conditions for optimization of mitral valve interventions—Emphasis on skills development and institutional risk performance,"This viewpoint report describes how the evolution of transcatheter mitral valve intervention (TMVI) is influenced by lessons learned from three evolutionary tracks: (1) the development of treatment from mitral valve surgery (MVS) to transcutaneous procedures; (2) the evolution of biomedical engineering for research and development resulting in predictable and safe clinical use; (3) the adaptation to local conditions, impact of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) experience and creation of infrastructure for skills development and risk management. Thanks to developments in computer science and biostatistics, an increasing number of reports regarding clinical safety and effectiveness is generated. A full toolbox of techniques, devices and support technology is now available, especially in surgery. There is no doubt that the injury associated with a minimally invasive access reduces perioperative risks, but it may affect the effectiveness of the treatment due to incomplete correction. Based on literature, solutions and performance standards are formulated with an emphasis in technology and positive outcome. Despite references to Heart Team decision making, boundary conditions such as hospital infrastructure, caseload, skills training and perioperative risk management remain underexposed. The role of Biomedical Engineering is exclusively defined by the Research and Development (R&D) cycle including the impact of human factor engineering (HFE). Feasibility studies generate estimations of strengths and safety limitations. Usability testing reveals user friendliness and safety margins of clinical use. Apart from a certification requirement, this information should have an impact on the definition of necessary skills levels and consequent required training. Physicians Preference Testing (PPT) and use of a biosimulator are recommended. The example of the interaction between two Amsterdam heart centers describes the evolution of a professional ecosystem that can facilitate innovation. Adaptation to local conditions in terms of infrastructure, referrals and reimbursement, appears essential for the evolution of a complete mitral valve disease management program. Efficacy of institutional risk management performance (IRMP) and sufficient team skills should be embedded in an appropriate infrastructure that enables scale and offers complete and safe solutions for mitral valve disease. The longstanding evolution of mitral valve therapies is the result of working devices embedded in an ecosystem focused on developing skills and effective risk management actions.","Cocchieri, Riccardo;van de Wetering, Bertus;Baan, Jan;Driessen, Antoine;Riezebos, Robert;van Tuijl, Sjoerd;de Mol, Bas",Journal,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,2023-01-01,OLVG;Universiteit van Amsterdam;LifeTec Group BV,invasive ;  MIMVS ;  minimally ;  mitral ;  percutaneous ;  reduction ;  risk ;  TMVR

Billions of blue blistering barnacles! What we can learn from comics about the visualization of complex ideas : Educational methods and innovations in engineering education,"Science education is both a science and an art; Getting the message across to groups of laymen requires a lot of thought. Some comics, such as the French Asterix, the American XKCD, or the Dutch Fokke & Sukke, have mastered the art of making people both laugh and think. Supporting learning with laughter could provide a powerful tool to enhance educational messages one is trying to get across, as multiple researches have shown that the use of humor helps students to e.g., remember material better. Furthermore, the image-based nature of comics greatly helps to visualize complex concepts. For instance, some comics use characterization and/or simplification to detach from reality, which is an interesting concept if you are treating heavy or complex subjects. Additionally, the use of stories rather than dry text helps to capture and retain the attention of the audience.However, not every style is equally suited for every topic. The level of detail, color scheme, and drawing style radiate an atmosphere that can either make or break the message you are sending. Still, if used with care, comic-like illustrations and storytelling can greatly support any educational strategy. This paper highlights different visualization styles and choices, and what messages they subtly tell. Choices such as realistic versus caricaturistic, the level of detail, and the use of color are discussed. Furthermore, the effect of different styles of humor and some storytelling tricks are detailed.","Raaijmakers, Elles A.L.;Van Berlo, Zeph M.C.",Conference Proceeding,EAEEIE 2023 - Proceedings of the 2023 32nd Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering,2023-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Universiteit van Amsterdam,comics ;  science communication ;  Science education
A bibliometric analysis on the relevancies of artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques in offshore engineering,"Recently, the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) in the offshore exploration and production industry to optimize decision-making and reduce costs and non-productive time have been increasing. Despite this trend, there have been only 11 reviews of ANN in offshore engineering published on the Scopus database. Therefore, this article aims to provide an update on the relevance of ANN in offshore engineering over the past 18 years (2005–2023) through a bibliometric analysis using Excel and VOS Viewer software. This analysis highlights the yearly increase in publications related to ANN implementations in offshore engineering and identifies the most cited publications, citation network analysis, authors, keywords, journals, institutions, and leading countries. The objective of this bibliometric analysis is to assist subsequent research and collaboration in this field by shedding light on ANN’s potential and identifying areas for further application. The identified cluster area publications encompass a range of topics, including drilling systems and the assessment of pipes. Furthermore, the significant fourfold increase in publications since 2005 indicates a growing interest among researchers in adapting ANN for various applications within this field. This could lead to further advancements, innovations, and improved solutions to promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing among researchers in this domain.","Abdul Shahid, Muhammad Daniel;Mohd Hashim, Mohd Hisbany;Mohd Fadzil, Najwa;Ahmad Rushdi, Muhd Hariz;Al-Fakih, Amin;Muda, Mohd Fakri",Journal,Cogent Engineering,2023-01-01,Universiti Malaysia Terengganu;King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals;Universiti Teknologi MARA,artificial neural network ;  bibliometric ;  offshore ;  VOS Viewer
Why microelectronic education becomes a global priority ?,"Since 2005, digital technology has been processing an exponentially increasing amount of data, resulting in an equally exponential increase in the amount of electrical energy consumed (doubling every three years). If this trend does not slow down, by 2030, the world's electrical energy production will be entirely absorbed by digital technology. All equipment is based on microelectronic components and systems. The solution is to divide their consumption by a factor of at least 10 thanks to new skills in training and research involving existing solutions. To achieve this, we need to develop know-how, the attractiveness of the sector, and educational innovation linked to research and industrial production. The approach of the French microelectronics education network in this sense will be presented.","Bonnaud, Olivier",Conference Proceeding,EAEEIE 2023 - Proceedings of the 2023 32nd Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering,2023-01-01,Université de Rennes,Development of digital world ;  Engineering education ;  Jobs in shortage ;  Microelectronics ;  Pedagogical innovation
"Resource dependence, government integrity and green technology innovation-Evidence from resource-based cities in China","Based on the panel data of resource-based cities in China from 2000 to 2017, this paper empirically analyzed the impact of resource dependence on green technology innovation in resource-based cities and its mechanism by using a variety of econometric analysis methods, such as fixed effect model, intermediary effect model, regulatory effect model and instrumental variable method. The result showed that resource dependence significantly inhibited the green technology innovation of resource-based cities, which was still valid after a series of robustness tests and control of endogenous problems. Mechanism analysis showed that there was a partial intermediary effect with the level of government integrity as the intermediary variable. Heterogeneity analysis showed that there were significant regional differences in the indirect inhibition of green technology innovation by reducing the level of government integrity. The crowding out effect of resource dependence was only significant in highly corrupt cities, highly resource dependent cities, small and medium-sized cities and traditional mining cities. The intermediary mechanism of government integrity has played a more significant role in expanding resource-based cities. However, the industrial structure of renewable resource-based cities was diversified, and resource dependence was positively affecting green technology innovation. While the government size was too large to reduce the level of government integrity, it played a negative role in regulating the impact of resource dependence on green technology innovation.","Qin, Bing Tao;Peng, Cen;Ge, Li Ming;Yu, Yong Wei",Journal,Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science,2023-01-01,Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy;Shanghai University of Finance and Economics;Fudan University;University of Shanghai for Science and Technology,government integrity ;  green technology innovation ;  resource dependence ;  resource-based city

EvoLP.jl: A playground for Evolutionary Computation in Julia,"Optimisation is highly relevant in many problems in artificial intelligence, machine learning, engineering and statistics. In these situations, optimisation by means of evolutionary computation becomes especially relevant as it makes few assumptions (such as differentiability) about the objective function. Problems such as these represent various research opportunities, both in the Norwegian and European contexts. In this work we present an open-source software framework, EvoLP.jl, as an effort to support the research in this niche. EvoLP.jl is a Julia package that implements reusable pieces of code for experimenting with single-objective evolutionary computation algorithms and its components. The framework is composed of blocks that span the separate phases of the evolutionary process: population initialisation, selection, crossover, and mutation. These blocks can be put together to create a modular solver, where each of the components can easily be swapped for testing. In addition, we provide some built-in algorithms and a few optional utilities for analysis (like benchmark test functions, result reporting and statistics logging). EvoLP.jl is an effort of the Norwegian Open Artificial Intelligence Lab and strives to comply with the guidelines of the Julia scientific community. It is well-tested, provides extensive documentation and is free—available for everyone to use under an open-source license. It is our intention that EvoLP.jl becomes a useful tool not only for research in evolutionary computation but also in the education and innovation scenarios.","Sánchez-Díaz, Xavier F.C.;Mengshoel, Ole Jakob",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2023-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Evolutionary Algorithms ;  Evolutionary Computation Software Tools ;  Genetic Algorithms ;  Particle Swarm Optimisation
Complexity in the delivery of product passports: A system of systems approach to passport lifecycles,"Product passports are an emerging data innovation positioned as an information tool to enable sustainable and circular futures, where such futures are delivered through increased and more precise information about resources, products, and processes across the 'product lifecycle'. But this is a complex problem space where traditional linear product lifecycles do not reflect the nature and lifespan of articulated passport information types. This is because passports are not records of products per se (as the name would suggest) but descriptions of the lifecycle activities associated with those individual product assets, collating data points throughout engineering, use, re-use, and end-of-life processes. Unfortunately, this distinction is often overlooked, given the limited attention to the life of a product passport after manufacture and the differences between product passports and product passport systems. This paper presents a generic 'lifecycle model for a passport' as an information system of systems comprised of nine constituent lifecycle viewpoints. It builds upon recent research developing the idea of a digital product passport 'ecosystem', focusing on the specific application of the battery passport. Each lifecycle viewpoint is framed as a distinct 'information system of systems' within a broader information ecosystem. Established concepts within the systems discipline are used to show inherent differences in each viewpoint's spatial and temporal focus and explain the relationships between each lifecycle viewpoint, thus articulating the parent-child relationships of different datasets and the necessary interoperability between information domains and engineering activities. The resultant model highlights the likely evolution of data requirements over an individual passport's lifespan, thus contributing to a possible future vision for an interoperable battery passport ecosystem. Furthermore, it is suggested that this lifecycle model can inform the evaluation and discussion of 'completeness' for any passport-type system, given its adoption of interdisciplinary systems domain techniques and concepts, helping shape future exploration of the circular economy capability space.","Timms, Paul D.;King, Melanie R.N.",Conference Proceeding,"2023 18th Annual System of Systems Engineering Conference, SoSe 2023",2023-01-01,Loughborough University,battery passports ;  digital product passport ecosystems ;  system of systems
Reconceptualizing ChatGPT and generative AI as a student-driven innovation in higher education,"Higher education is poised at the precipice of the changes and challenges brought about by ChatGPT. This paper addresses some of the most fundamental questions about the role, position, and implications of ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools amidst the evolving landscape of higher education and modern society. By linking technological affordances with educational needs, we conceptualize ChatGPT as a student-driven innovation with rich potential to empower students and enhance their educational experiences and resources. However, this empowerment comes at a price. It requires collaborative efforts among the stakeholders to address the new and emerging challenges regarding student training, higher education curricula and assessment, and technology development and governance. It also implies new directions for educational research and theories.","Dai, Yun;Liu, Ang;Lim, Cher Ping",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2023-01-01,UNSW Sydney;The Education University of Hong Kong;Chinese University of Hong Kong,ChatGPT ;  engineering education ;  generative AI ;  higher education ;  learning analytics ;  personalized learning

Calculation of Rock Pressure in Loess Tunnels Based on Limit Equilibrium Theory and Analysis of Influencing Factors,"The research on the calculation method of tunnel envelope pressure is a key issue in the design of tunnel engineering support structure. Based on the limit equilibrium theory, this paper proposes a method to calculate the surrounding rock pressure in shallow buried loess tunnels. Firstly, based on the investigation of the damage mode of the loess tunnel surrounding rock and the field measurement results of the surrounding rock pressure, the damage mode of the loess tunnel is proposed, and then a method of calculating the surrounding rock pressure applicable to the shallow buried loess tunnel is derived according to the limit equilibrium condition of the tunnel square soil body and the side wedge; the basic mechanical parameters are known in this method, so only the rupture angle ft needs to be determined, and the rupture angle calculation model in the shallow buried loess tunnel is proposed Three assumptions are made in the rupture angle calculation model, and the rupture angle calculation formula is derived according to the stress slate on the slip surface of the surrounding rock; the pressure of the surrounding rock in the loess tunnel obtained by this method is compared with four methods, namely, the pressure theory of the surrounding rock in the existing loose body of Taishaki, the pressure formula of the deeply buried surrounding rock in the railroad tunnel design code, the Beer Baumann method, and the Xie Jiayi method, in order to verify the correctness and validity of the calculation method used, and to analyze the influence of different parameters on the surrounding rock pressure. The innovation of this paper lies in the derivation of a method for calculating the pressure in the surrounding rock of a shallow buried loess tunnel using the limit equilibrium theory, and also further proposes a formula for calculating the rupture angle. The pressure of surrounding rock decreases with the increase of static earth pressure coefficient, lateral pressure coefficient, friction angle and cohesion in soil, but the static earth pressure coefficient has a greater influence on the surrounding rock pressure. With the increase of sagittal span ratio, tunnel burial depth and soil weight, the surrounding rock pressure peaked with the increase of tunnel burial depth, and the surrounding rock pressure curve increased first and then decreased.","Danjiang, Cheng;Junfeng, Hua;Jianguo, Zhu;Yang, Ji;Zhaoguang, Hu",Journal,European Journal of Computational Mechanics,2023-01-01,Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics;Ltd.;Ltd.,damage mode ;  limiting equilibrium theory ;  rupture angle ;  shallow buried loess tunnel ;  Surrounding rock pressure
Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Variation Character of Climate Risks of Wind and Solar Resources in China,"The proportion of renewable energy (represented by wind and solar energy) in the future energy structure of China should be substantially increased to achieve the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality. However, wind and solar power generation is largely affected by local climate conditions, with intermittent and volatile characteristics. In recent years, extreme weather and climate events have become more frequent and stronger and have shown concurrency, which seriously restricts the effective utilization of wind and solar resources. Therefore, the research on climate risks of wind and solar resources is of great theoretical and practical significance for improving the utilization of wind and solar resources and reducing the risks of renewable energy. This study quantitatively analyzes the spatial and temporal characteristics of scarce wind and light scenarios in China on the basis of a high-resolution database of wind and solar resources from 2007 to 2014. The analysis is based on aspects such as the degree, range, duration, and frequency of inefficient wind and solar output. The results show that the current distribution of scarce wind and light scenarios demonstrates prominent seasonal and regional differences. The climate risk of solar and wind resources mainly occurs in autumn and winter. The frequent scarce wind and light scenarios mainly occur in Xinjiang, Sichuan, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. This study could provide a scientific basis for future site selection of wind and solar power stations and regional renewable energy planning in China.

Towards Improving Green Technologies Education: The Role of the ACM/IEEE/AAAI Model Curricula,"In Spring 2021, the joint work of the ACM, IEEE Computer Society, and AAAI started the effort to revise undergraduate Computer Science curricular guidelines issued once every ten years, currently referred to as CS2023. Significant updates to the new version of the CS curricula have been proposed, particularly the infusion of Society, Ethics, and Professionalism (SEP) into all the 18 knowledge areas (KA) of the curricular recommendation. Additionally, due to new and rapidly emerging computing areas, the number of platforms has increased considerably in Mobile, Web, Game Computing, and Embedded and Industrial Robotics. The Specialized Platform Development (SPD) KA proposes a shift from ""elective""to ""core""knowledge units. Because of the rapid research development in Green Technologies (GT), we recognize that the pedagogical and the SEP components shall be infused in the design and development of such technologies to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. In this paper, we recognized several KAs that can influence computing curricula, particularly the ones that reference industrial and GT. Additionally, the authors of this paper recommend the SEP considerations in the development of technologies that will influence the next decade of research and industry implementations.","Servin, Christian;Becker, Brett A.",Conference Proceeding,IEEE Green Technologies Conference,2023-01-01,El Paso County Community College;University College Dublin,ACM/IEEE/AAAI. green technologies ;  Computer Science ;  CS2023 ;  education ;  Ethics ;  Professionalism ;  SEP ;  Society ;  Specialized Platform Development
GLOBAL RESEARCH INNOVATION: A Case of Evolving the Mid-Career Faculty Research Portfolio,"The landscape of knowledge generation and innovation in higher education features a distinctive component of global engagement among faculty affiliated with research-intensive institutions. This chapter examines the paradoxical problems of delayed faculty retirement, the empowerment of mid-career faculty taking on a global research agenda, and the challenge of enculturating early career faculty in a global research-intensive university. Each year, AGE personnel work with college leaders to select a cohort of 10 fellows (5 from each college). Interested faculty submit an application that includes a personal statement as well as a research project idea that they plan to work on during their fellowship year. In the development phase of AGE, the leaders of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the College of Engineering spent time reflecting on the culture and the performance expectations of MSU faculty to gain a sense of what type of programming would have the most impact on faculty vitality.","Neisler, Gretchen",Book,Success After Tenure: Supporting Mid-Career Faculty,2023-01-01,University of Tennessee,
Supporting virtual student research opportunities: the Holistic Foundry Undergraduate Engaged Learners program experience,"The COVID pandemic has necessitated a new way of thinking and delivery of inclusive learning environments. The purpose of this contribution is to highlight the Holistic Foundry Undergraduate Engaged Learners (FUEL) program as a virtual learning experience that can be adopted as an innovative approach beyond the pandemic that employs the use of digital learning paired with an innovation-driven learning platform. The underlying objective of the Holistic FUEL program sought to recruit underrepresented students studying in science, technology, engineering, and math fields to become part of one of five research groups on campus tasked in developing a prototype of innovative technology that was socially impactful. Specifically, the design and implementation of the Holistic FUEL program incorporated the use of virtual platforms and digital learning aspects that students could utilize to explore different avenues of research, engage with relevant resources, and make connections to their own research interests. The program examples and student data from the evaluative aspects of this program offered insight regarding the effectiveness of hybrid, virtual, extracurricular research programs for undergraduate students. Lessons learned from this program include how best practices in digital technology can help enhance the interaction of faculty and students within an extracurricular research experience, the benefits related to more exposure to online digital resources and their applications, as well as the learning processes associated with using this technology in tandem with the Foundry.","Arce-Trigatti, Andrea;Sandoval, Steffano Oyanader;Arce, Pedro E.;Sanders, J.

"Creativity in organizations macro perspectives: Leadership, interventions, and applications","The intent of the second volume is to bring together organizational and interventional focused research and theory that bears importance for creativity and innovation. The chapters in this section explore four macro phenomena: leadership, organization, interventions, and fields. Leadership theories, such as transformational, shared, and CIP, are examined as unique approaches to leading for creative and innovative efforts. Also illustrated in this volume is the central role organizations play in creative output. Specifically, phenomena such as change, culture, obstacles to innovation, and constraints to creative performance. To sustain creative performance, authors explore interventions like motivation, training, and best practices for identifying and selecting creative talent. The role of organizational creativity in niche fields, such as marketing, engineering, and education, are examined, as there is a sizable research gap in these areas. Finally, the closing chapter of this volume provides a substantive summary of the progress made in the study of organizational creativity and offers recommendations for the future.","Hunter, Sam;d’Amato, Alexis L.;Linnell, Averie E.;Reiter-Palmon, Roni",Book,"Handbook of Organizational Creativity: Leadership, Interventions, and Macro Level Issues, Second Edition",2023-01-01,University of Nebraska Omaha,Applications ;  Creativity ;  Innovation ;  Interventions ;  Leadership
Potential Contributions of Artificial Intelligence in Crowd Engineering,"Opening up product development in companies to external interdisciplinary participants offers the opportunity to develop products faster and more cost-effectively. An early integration of potential customers in the product development process enables a stronger focus on their needs and thus facilitates customised product development. A lack of suitable tools and rigid processes within companies, however, make this integration unpractical in many cases. In this context, Crowd Engineering allows the involvement of an engineering community, with community members being integrated in such a way that they can participate actively and in a distributed manner in product development using a central internet platform. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods and approaches are becoming more sophisticated and acquire more importance in various aspects of private life and business context by providing new solutions to topics which formerly were not solvable or only with high efforts. This paper analyses how artificial intelligence can support product development, especially in the context of Crowd Engineering. It thereby provides an overview of how artificial intelligence already supports development processes today and which potentials arise from this. Furthermore, an analysis of the collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence is carried out in the context of Crowd Engineering. The main research questions are how artificial intelligence can support in collaboration and how the role of humans is being shaped and transformed. Another key question is how collaboration can be achieved in the context of Crowd Engineering—hence this paper proposes collaboration modes that vary according to three dimensions of collaboration: degree of AI-assistance, degree of task complexity and the degree of AI-autonomy.","Schuseil, Frauke;Lentes, Joachim;Hertwig, Michael;Barwasser, Adrian",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Production Engineering,2023-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO;Universität Stuttgart,Artificial intelligence application ;  Collaboration ;  Crowd engineering ;  Open Innovation ;  Product development
Using an Actual Design Method for the Design of Research Methodologies: Case of the Dichotomy Exploration and Exploitation in Context of Innovation Management,"Whereas scholarly studies often elaborate on the design of the method for empirical data collection and analysis, surprisingly, the actual use of design principles taken from the domain of design and engineering of products has not come into the picture, yet; the stance of this paper is that the use of design principles taken from this domain may be beneficial for making choices and detailing research design. The application is demonstrated through showcasing the research design process of a doctoral study. The topic explored in this doctoral study concerns the theoretical concepts of exploration and exploitation, especially focused on their implication in managerial practices of managing innovation. In addition, both theoretical and empirical validity of view exploration and exploitation as a dichotomy was questioned; this was done through challenging the domain assumptions sustaining these notions. In order to tackle this rather complex research problem, the study adopted Pugh’s ‘controlled convergence method’ to have a more systematic approach in setting the final research methods.","Dekkers, Rob;Zhou, Qijun",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Production Engineering,2023-01-01,University of Greenwich;University of Glasgow,Controlled convergence method ;  Design and engineering ;  Research methodology
The impact of government intervention on innovation efficiency of green technology—a threshold effect analysis based on environmental taxation and government subsidies,"Research and promotion of green technology can improve energy efficiency and help to optimize energy structure, which are key considerations in achieving the “dual carbon” goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Owing to the “dual externality” arising from green technology innovation (GTI), government policies have an important impact on this area. Environmental taxes and government subsidies are important means for governments to improve GTI and optimize energy utilization, with different environmental taxes and subsidies having different impacts. This study evaluates the impact of environmental taxes and government subsidies in China from 2009 to 2019, and assesses how these policies interacted with each other to determine China’s efficiency in GTI over this period. The study’s findings based on analysis of 30 provinces and cities in China indicate that environmental taxes have a threshold effect on the development of green technologies, and that the current level of taxation is insufficient to encourage optimized development in this area. Government subsidies can also help to reduce the negative effects arising from the current environmental tax burden. To optimize government policy implementation in this area, improve the level of GTI, and improve energy use efficiency, this study proposes countermeasures based on differentiated policies, including gradually increasing the rate and scope of environmental taxation, and strengthening the supervision of government subsidies.","Li, Liqin;Rao, Minye",Journal,Frontiers in Energy Research,2023-01-01,Fujian Jiangxia University;Fujian Normal University,energy efficiency ;  environmental tax ;  government intervention ;  government subsidies ;  green technology innovation ;  threshold effect

The Challenges of In-House Service Design in Organizational Transformation: A Case Study of a Multinational Manufacturing Corporation,"As a human- and customer-centric methodology and development practice, service design inevitably starts affecting service systems and organizations (Yu and Sangiorgi, J Serv Res 21(1):40–58, 2018). It can catalyse organizational transformation (Yu and Sangiorgi, J Serv Res 21(1):40–58, 2018) by changing existing organizational practices, behaviour, and decision-making, by bringing in iterative and co-creative outside-in development strategies, to support multidisciplinary innovation (Andreassen et al., J Serv Manag 27(1):21–29, 2016; Junginger, Des Issues 24(1):26–35, 2008). However, the academic conversation does not sufficiently bring forward the organizational challenges that appear, when in-house service design is included in the organization’s research and development (R&D) activities. Such understanding is crucial since it provides knowledge on what areas to develop internally, to enhance organizational efficiency in support of transformation towards human- and customer-centric working cultures. Therefore, this qualitative research brings to attention organizational challenges from the perspective of in-house service design. The research is a case study conducted by the author, within a multinational manufacturing corporation. Conventional content analysis is used as the data analysis method. The results of this study present the qualitative internal organizational challenges from five perspectives, which occur when in-house service design is brought into an engineering-based organization. Specifically, where expert-driven and technology-oriented cultures drive development.","Korpikoski, Krista",Book Series,Springer Series in Design and Innovation,2023-01-01,Lapin Yliopisto,Organizational transformation ;  Service design ;  Transformation design ;  Transformational change
Innovation on Mutual Cooperation Culture (Gotong Royong) Implementation for House Development,"The Gotong Royong culture, which is the hallmark of the Bajo community, continues to experience changes due to interactions with mainland people. As a result, the cultural values of Gotong Royong have been abandoned. Efforts to restore local wisdom, such as the Gotong Royong culture, are urgently needed in this era. This research aims to innovate by reintroducing this culture, particularly in housing and housing development cooperation. The reapplication of local wisdom (Gotong Royong culture) in this study is intended to ensure that the characteristics and identities of the Bajo people remain the basis for building their social capital. The researcher used a qualitative descriptive method with inductive and deductive approaches, along with a Value Engineering approach. This research was conducted within the Bajo Tribe's location, situated in Kabalutan Village, Tojo Una Una Regency, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. The results of the study found that the application of the Gotong Royong culture to the Bajo community in building houses and housing produced efficiency and effectiveness. It was efficient because it reduced development costs and effective because it took advantage of free time to construct houses, fostering a sense of togetherness among fellow Bajo tribespeople and strengthening cooperation. Thus, Gotong Royong activities serve as a means of building effective social networks that can reduce the cost of constructing houses and revive the culture of Gotong Royong.","Siradjuddin, Zaenal",Journal,International Review for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development,2023-01-01,Universitas Tadulako,Bajo Community ;  Collaborative Culture ;  Effectiveness ;  Efficiency ;  Innovation

Network political education optimization based on heterogeneous cellular networks and deep learning,"In order to meet the needs of wireless communications for higher data rates and wider coverage, this article has specially formulated a third-generation partnership plan. This plan involves key technologies such as carrier aggregation, multi-point coordination, relay, and heterogeneous cellular networks, and has conducted extensive research on them. Among them, heterogeneous cellular networks increase system capacity and coverage by increasing the use of small cell base stations within the coverage of traditional macro base stations. With the vigorous development of 5G mobile communications, the emergence of heterogeneous networks and ultra-dense networks have effectively increased the original throughput of the system, and the introduction of distributed caches has also reduced backhaul traffic and reduced system load. The emergence of these technologies not only improves the user experience, but also poses a major challenge to mobility management algorithms. For ultra-dense networks, the possibility of handovers on mobile devices has increased dramatically, and the management of the entire network has become more complicated. This paper argues that with the rapid development of new technology, college online classroom has undergone earth-shaking changes, while traditional online teaching has many problems and deficiencies. These problems can be solved by improving the quality of user experience and improving the availability of innovation. In this paper, by studying the objective law of network development, the establishment of network ideological and political education innovation system. The system can adapt to the new situation, new laws and new requirements of network political education, and promote the network innovation of network political education.","Jing, Chen",Journal,International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management,2023-01-01,Sichuan College of Architectural Technology,5G network innovation ;  Heterogeneous cellular network ;  Online classroom ;  Political teaching
Smart Meter Application Analysis using PLS-SEM Deep Neural Network: A Case Study,"Smart meters measure, control, analyze, and predict the amount of electricity, water, and gas used. In developing countries, where there is no consensus to accept the use of smart meters, there are many possible risks when using smart meters. However, there are also many benefits of smart meters. This study conducts an overall assessment of the demand and impact of the smart meter in the southern region of Vietnam through a survey of 500 samples. This article examines information technology system (IS) related factors and engineering model-related factors according to technical readiness such as optimism, innovation, insecurity, and discomfort. Accompanying that is the expectation of smart meters, for Vietnamese people's intention to constantly use smart meters. Most of the previous studies on smart meter systems have focused on analyzing the impact of factors affecting the application using single-step structural equation modeling (SEM). In this study, it is proposed to use a 2-layer model between the research model of the multi-analysis method by combining the Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model was performed for additional analysis for the results of PLS-SEM, and ANN has higher predictive accuracy than PLS-SEM because ANN has the ability to perform well for both linear relational model and linear relationship model and non-linear with high prediction. First, the PLS-SEM model evaluates the factors affecting the intention to use the smart meter system. Second, the ANN ranks the impact factors of the critical predictors from the PLS-SEM model, and the Critical Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) analyzes the exact results for the critical performance of the variables elements. The results of this study show that the quality of information and quality of system factors of the IS model have a negative impact on users' intention to use smart meters. At the same time, factors of Optimization and innovation have a strong positive impact on users' intention to use smart meters.","Thao, Nguyen Thi Phuong;Duc, Minh Ly;Bilik, Petr",Journal,Journal of Engineering Science and Technology Review,2023-01-01,Van Lang University;Ton-Duc-Thang University;VSB – Technical University of Ostrava,ANN ;  Artificial Neural Networks ;  IPMA ;  Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling ;  PLS-SEM ;  Smart Meter

ACCESSIBLE SOLAR ENERGY TECHNOLOGY FOR DOMESTIC APPLICATIONS IN THE UK: EDGE SOLAR,"Renewable energy is increasingly used and promoted. In the UK, for example, large scale renewable energy farms have been used to supply electricity with great effect. Given the large number of homes, there is considerable impact to be made by small scale residential renewable energy systems. Despite solar panels being the most common form of residential renewable energy technology, only 4% of buildings in the UK support solar technology of any kind. For direct electricity generation, silicon-based photovoltaic (PV) arrays are the most utilised, and when used in a residential setting, they are typically mounted on the sloped roofs. This is where the problem lies. The technology comes with a high cost, and there is further financial burden of installation and maintenance, making solar energy inaccessible for many UK homeowners. This paper presents a research and design innovation project to make PV technology more accessible in the UK.

THE DESIGN MINDSET INVENTORY (D-MINDSET0): A PRELIMINARY INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING DESIGN MINDSET,"Mindset has been identified as an essential aspect of design and innovation, impacting both behaviours and performance. However, the concept of design mindset is elusive. Often design mindset is used indistinguishably from design behaviour, diminishing the complexity of the mechanisms and cognitive processes underlying design behaviour. As the initial step in researching these mechanisms, we operationalise the concept of design mindset and present the design mindset inventory (D-Mindset0) to measure it. The initial inventory centered around 16 agreement-to-value statements related to design practice. To analyse the inventory, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis based on 473 master students from different engineering disciplines participating in a course on innovation in engineering. The analysis revealed a four-factor structure with 11 final items. The four factors align with the concepts of 'conversation with the situation,' 'iteration,' 'co-evolution of problem-solution,' and 'imagination.'","Lavrsen, Jakob Clemen;Daalhuizen, Jaap;Carbon, Claus Christian",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society,2023-01-01,Technical University of Denmark;Universität Bamberg,Design cognition ;  Design mindset ;  Design theory ;  Psychometrics ;  Research methodologies and methods
Low-carbon biosynthesis: Opportunities and challenges,"Low-carbon biosynthesis, using renewable carbon resources such as CO2 or lignocellulose biomass as feedstock and engineered biological systems as biotools for material processing and manufacturing, is a sustainable route for replacing fossil feedstock, a new mode of low-carbon production of chemical and agricultural products, and a new path for industrial carbon sinks for the efficient conversion and utilization of CO2. At present, the route of low-carbon biosynthesis cannot compete with the traditional chemical synthesis route with respect to industrial influence and technical economy, etc. The industrial applicability and conversion efficiency of CO2 and other renewable carbon resources, and industrial capacity of low-carbon biosynthesis are still the significant challenges, which should be solved as soon as possible through the great efforts of many parties. The emerging engineering biology is a new and important research field in which the structure and function of the biological systems could be reprogrammed and needed. Engineering biology could be promoting a new paradigm of designing and building the biological systems, and will fundamentally improve the ability and efficiency of biological systems to convert CO2 and other renewable carbon resources into bio-based products, and trigger a disruptive breakthrough in the bioindustry. Firstly, we analyze the development opportunities of low-carbon biosynthesis and confirm that the development of low-carbon biosynthesis is an important route to achieve the goal of “carbon peak and carbon neutrality”, will bring significant environmental, economical and social benefits, and is a strategic battleground for China’s bio-economy. Then, we summarize the current scientific and technological advances and trends of low-carbon biosynthesis at home and abroad. Currently, main developed countries, including US, UK, Germany, Australia, Japan and Korea, etc., enact and issue many strategies and action plans to accelerate the development of global sci-tech innovation for low-carbon biosynthesis, and major scientific breakthroughs in the field of low-carbon biosynthesis has made continuously achieved. More and more biobased products could be efficiently manufactured by low-carbon biosynthesis. Further, we discuss the scientific and technological challenges and key directions of low-carbon biosynthesis. Low-carbon biosynthesis have developed rapidly in recent years, however, the performance and efficiency of natural biological systems cannot be fully compared with chemical catalysts and it is still difficult for low-carbon biosynthesis to fully compete with chemical synthesis. The key scientific and technological barriers that need to be solved urgently in the development of low-carbon biosynthesis are how to design and build the high-performance synthetic biological systems with predictable, reconstructed and adjustable functions, which significantly improve the efficiency of renewable carbon source conversion and utilization, and create a new mode of material bioprocessing and biomanufacturing. Hence, it is necessary to focus on the layout of CO2 bioconversion and C1 biochemical engineering, biomass metabolic conversion as well as manufacturing of biobased products, so as to provide scientific and technological basis for enhancing the core competitiveness of low-carbon manufacturing innovation and China’s green bioeconomy. Finally, we put forward relevant opinions and suggestions for future development, and think it is necessary to strengthen the layout of cutting-edge basic research and fund major projects in the field low-carbon biosynthesis, and it is also indispensable to rebuild the institutional systems and promote scientific and technological innovation and the healthy development of bioindustry.","Wang, Qinhong;Zhang, Yiheng;Tian, Chaoguang;Sun, Zhoutong;Ma, Yanhe",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology;National Technology Innovation Center of Synthetic Biology,carbon dioxide ;  carbon neutrality ;  carbon peak ;  engineering biology ;  low-carbon biosynthesis ;  renewable feedstock
TECH TO MARKET. FINDING AND DESIGNING SUITABLE TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS WITH DESIGN THINKING,"Although it's human centered focus, design thinking has proven to be effective also in technology-driven projects, both in education and business. Yet, scant research has investigated whether and how design thinking might be leveraged to find new opportunities based on emerging technologies and design new innovation concepts accordingly. To address this gap, we employed an Action Innovation Management Research framework and co-designed a program called Tech to Market with Oper.Space, the design factory for Open Innovation of the University of Bologna. We ran 5 iterations of the program from October 2018 to December 2022, in which we conducted 52 interviews, observed 10 presentations, and held 10 meetings with the main stakeholders involved. Our results show how to apply design thinking to find and design a suitable application for a given technology, contributing to the ongoing conversation about the implementation of design thinking in technology-driven projects.","Cocchi, Nicolò;Dosi, Clio;Vignoli, Matteo",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society,2023-01-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,Design management ;  Design methods ;  Design thinking ;  Innovation ;  Technology management
Modeling the pulling and pushing power in medical research: Unmet health needs and unsettled scientific questions,"At present, medical research has become one of the most active fields of science and technology innovation in the world, and our country attaches great importance to the scientific and technological innovation oriented to health. The advancement of medical science and technology is propelled by two factors: Scientific and technological innovation and management. In the meanwhile, two forces—Free exploration and demand-oriented innovation—Drive scientific and technical advancement. This article proposed a “three-force” model of medical science and technology innovation, namely pulling, pushing and protecting forces. The protecting force of science and technology management places a strong emphasis on resource allocation (e.g., strategic planning for diseases with high burden and scientific conundrum) and risk management (e.g., ethics governance). The pushing and pulling forces could contribute to a better understanding of innovation process. Unmet health needs, the pulling force, focus more on the health-research priorities for lowering burden of diseases. In particular, unmet health need is also the fundamental motivation for the development of diagnostics, medications, vaccinations, and other health-related treatments. Exploration of the unknown, the pushing power, addresses the existing scientific problems and explores the scientific unknowns. This paper divided knowledge states into four categories, which are known knowns, known unknowns, unknown knowns and unknown unknowns. Through the interpretation of four knowledge states, this paper provides a thorough discussion on how scientific unknowns drive scientific and technological innovation. The approach of big-data analysis provides the methodological basis for further structural optimization of the research landscape based on the pulling and pushing power model. Hence, on the basis of constructing the “three-force” model from the theoretical conceptual level, this paper further proposes that the pulling and pushing force model can be built in a quantitative approach with big data analysis. To be specific, three research objects, namely, health needs, scientific problems and science and technology innovation, could be quantified using various indicators and methods. In terms of measuring health needs, morbidity, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) are the widely used and universal quantitative indicators, which can be applied in the “three-force” model. As for the identification of scientific unknowns, we argue that using big data analysis and computational linguistics to identify research topics that are “controversial, conflicting, unverified, unsolved” can reflect scientific problems that are oriented to the scientific frontier and focus on major needs and challenges. For example, terms like “unknown, suspect, unclear, unusual, controversial, consensus, incomplete, conflicting, contrary, debatable, etc”. can be employed as trigger words, and sentences containing such triggers words can be extracted to represent medical claim with uncertainty. In terms of disease mapping, natural language processing tools (such as Medical Text Indexer) can be used to extract Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) involved in various scientific research texts to represent the main content. With the construction of “MeSH-Diseases” concordance table, the mapping of multi-types of scientific research data and disease can be realized. Such research could assist scientific policy in the identification of major scientific issues, the allocation of scientific resources, and the encouragement of coordinated, multidisciplinary research.","Du, Jian;Zhao, Wenjing;Guo, Xin;Dong, Erdan",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences;Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College;Peking University Third Hospital;Peking University;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China;Haihe Laboratory of Cell Ecosystem,big data analysis ;  disease burden ;  ethical governance ;  medical research ;  scientific problems
DESIGN METHODS FOR DIAGNOSING AND LOCATING ENTANGLED TECHNICAL DEBT IN DEVOPS FRAMEWORKS,"In the IT landscape, DevOps is the preferred approach for developing and maintaining rapidly evolving systems that require continuous improvements. Yet, DevOps frameworks do not entirely prevent the accumulation of Technical Debt (TD), and under certain circumstances DevOps can even contribute to generating TD. This paper focuses on a specific type of TD, Entangled Technical Debt (ETD), that corresponds to the implicit complexification of a system's design and the appearance of unintentional couplings in its architecture over time. Our work seeks to inform methods for Diagnosing and Locating ETD in DevOps frameworks. Through a research partnership with Ubisoft's IT branch, an experimental case-study was conducted. It takes the form of an assessment of 6 innovative IT projects and a subsequent in-depth architecture analysis of an individual IT system, which enabled the characterization of the mechanisms linking DevOps to ETD. This allowed us to develop and test practical methods for diagnosing and locating ETD in IT systems.","Bonet Faus, Jose;Le Masson, Pascal;Pelissier, Ugo;Jibet, Nafissa;Bordas, Antoine;Pajot, Sebastien",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society,2023-01-01,Mines Paris - PSL;Ubisoft,Design theory ;  DevOps ;  Innovation ;  Systems Engineering (SE) ;  Technical Debt
A DESIGNER'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAKER MOVEMENT,"The maker movement has garnered interest from many disparate fields, from engineering to business management, to behavioural science, to city planning.

FUNCTION-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEX MECHATRONIC PRODUCTS FROM AN HTO PERSPECTIVE: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,"A component-orientated approach is commonplace in the automotive industry where the development focus lies on components. However, current challenges in the industry necessitates a mindset change in the development. Shifting the perspective from the components to functions can help with changing requirements, manage increasing complexity, support cross-disciplinary development, and foster innovation. To successfully implement this approach, it is essential to address not only the technical aspects of the solution, but also the human and organizational aspects affecting the process for its long-term success. This paper investigates the function-oriented development methods of complex mechatronic products. A systematic literature review is conducted to analyse the current state of research. The existing function-oriented development approaches are summarized, the technological, human, and organizational perspectives are analysed, and the research gaps are highlighted. It is concluded that while function-orientation gains significance in industry and academia, and the importance of human and organizational factors are highlighted in the literature, they are not yet widely considered within the current function-oriented approaches.","Uhri, Ekin;Isenhardt, Ingrid",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society,2023-01-01,Bavarian Motor Works Group;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Design methodology ;  Function-oriented development ;  Model-based systems engineering ;  Multi- / Cross- / Trans-disciplinary processes ;  User centred design
PROPOSAL OF CLUSTER ANALYSIS METHOD FOR PRODUCTS CONSIDERING EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,"It is important for organizations to balance exploration and exploitation in order to respond quickly and sustainably to the needs of society and users in a rapidly changing business environment. However, there is insufficient research on design methods to balance exploration and exploitation in product design, and a method to objectively identify the product groups to be balanced has not yet been established. In this paper, on the basis of the characteristics of exploration and exploitation in design, a cluster analysis using functional and attribute distances between products is proposed. To validate the proposed method, it was applied to past product cases in which the relationship between exploration and exploitation was known. The results showed that in the cases of cameras, in addition to known product groups forming large clusters, reasonable minor classifications that had not been identified were also obtained. This indicates that the proposed method is capable of analyzing reasonable clusters in the cases and is potentially effective in identifying product groups taking into consideration the relationship between exploration and exploitation.","Okamoto, Masahiro;Murakami, Tamotsu",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Design Society,2023-01-01,The University of Tokyo,Design methods ;  Exploration and exploitation ;  Innovation ;  New product development ;  Semantic data processing

"Regulation and regulatory science for biosynthetic science, technology and applications","Biosynthesis, as one of the major connotations of biotechnology, is the process of producing chemicals from feedstocks through enzymatic reactions either in vitro as cell-free systems or in vivo employing living organisms carrying corresponding enzymes. Biosynthesis is featured with its high transformation efficiency under normal temperature and pressure, and that has been continuously enhanced ever since the transition of biotechnology from traditional to modern, directory revolutionized the food, medicine, chemical and ecological industries. Synthetic Biology was emerged in the 2000s, integrating engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science and other disciplines into biology. Its multi-dimensional convergence character and groundbreaking “bottom-up” engineering concept revolutionized the biological science with the Design-Build-Test-Learn Paradigm. It also accelerates the “disruptive” innovation not only in biosynthesis technology but also in the development of an enabling chain for the related industries and diverse products. Due to the disruptive and complex nature of biosynthesis enabled by synthetic biology, significant challenges have arisen for the current regulatory system, especially concerning human health and societal safety. Establishing scientific and effective regulations has become an unavoidable and urgent issue. This will enable the establishment of an innovative ecosystem that ensures timely technological advancements and industrial transformation, benefiting people’s health, protecting the environment, and maintaining social stability. In this paper, we firstly reviewed the regulatory history of biosynthesis. In the traditional stage, the so-called regulation was primitive, empirical-based and mainly focused on discerning false/fake from genuine. When biotechnology entered its science and technology (S&T)-based modern stage started in the 19th century, regulations upon biosynthesis were truly established mainly focusing on food and drug R&D and commercialization. Since the molecular biology era of middle 20th century, development of genetic manipulation, molecular cloning, genome editing and synthetic biology has been quickly bringing biosynthesis into today’s contemporary stage. During this period, lessons learned from a series of biosafety and/or biosecurity incidents attributed to the evolving of the biosynthetic governance system and the emergence and development of Regulatory Science of biotechnology. Next, we analyzed several cases in four typical scenarios of biosynthesis R&D and applications to reveal the regulatory challenges brought by the emergence of new technologies and the experiences in answering questions of ‘why’, ‘what’, ‘how’ and ‘who’ for the corresponding regulatory systems. It is obvious, as the vital part of the technology R&D and application ecosystem, regulatory science has to be developed alongside or even ahead of the corresponding technology to ensure the regulations may comprehensively coordinates with S&T and ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI). Thus, several applicable strategies are proposed. Firstly, effective connection of currently implemented policies under the principle of prudential supervision can be applied widely for the R&D and manufacturing/application of majority of the pure chemical-based products, including pharmaceuticals; and even for proper and necessary research practice employing human embryo. Secondly, adaptive adjustment of some imperfect regulations in China taking international practices as reference such as in case of dual-use research or of some missing connections in regulations for Chinese herbal medicine versus biological products/chemical drugs employing the newly developed technology for natural product production. Finally, breakthrough change of some currently applied regulations that apparently hindered the transformation of some technology critical for social development, such as GMO, or innovative reestablishment of some unavailable regulations to smoothen the transformation of novo products, such as cell and gene therapy, need to be seriously concerned. To prioritize regulatory policies categorized into connection, adjustment, breakthrough, or innovation, the corresponding regulatory technologies, evaluation standards and methods, and regulatory systems have to be developed or improved accordingly to meet the needs of expanding fields and scenarios of supervision. Meanwhile, the regulatory concept of combining industry, academia, research, application, and public participation has to be strengthened to establish a scientific, effective and safe ecosystem.","Chen, Daming;Zhu, Chengshu;Wang, Zhe;Li, Demao;You, Xiaoyan;Xiong, Yan;Zhao, Guoping",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health;Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology;Henan University of Science and Technology;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences,biosynthesis ;  governance system ;  regulatory science ;  synthetic biology

How Difficult are Simple Electrical Circuit Conceptions? New Findings,"Research on conceptual understanding is one of the first steps in designing materials to improve learning. Literature reports that students have difficulties analyzing and describing phenomena in electric circuits. This report contributes to students' conceptual difficulties regarding simple electrical circuits by systematically analyzing an open conceptual test answered by 531 first-year engineering students. We found students' reasoning that has not yet been reported in the literature as misconceptions or difficulties. To deepen our understanding of students' difficulties, we chose five students by convenience to interview. We present evidence that there are two main contributions to the taxonomy in this study: the Series Circuit Misconception, which is when students convey that the current through bulbs is the same because they are in series, using that as a mnemonic ignoring any change in the circuit; and the Inverse Parallel Circuit Misconception, that is when students mention that the resistance of the circuit decreases when disconnecting bulbs in parallel, neither are reported in the literature.

Development of Innovative Competence Model and Its Testing in the Course “Techno-Startup”,"Introduction. Innovative evolution of the country requires preparing students for innovative activity and developing their innovative competence. But there is still no clear understanding as to how to effectively form and measure it. This article offers a model of innovation competence in the area of techno-innovation, which is based on the analysis of existing summarized models of innovation competence and consists of cognitive and non-cognitive components, each of which already has diagnostic tools. The purpose of the article is to describe the results of testing the proposed model of innovation competence in the process of specially organized training, as well as to identify effective teaching methods and tools for assessing innovation competence in higher engineering education. Materials and Methods. The article describes a comprehensive toolkit for assessing the changing of each component of innovation competence in the area of techno-innovation. It was used to identify the teaching methods most effective for the developing innovative competence in the process of teaching future techno-innovators at university. A quasi-experimental plan of research was used with the participation of 521 HSE students, who during a semester learned a specially created training course “Techno-Startup”. 58 trackers participated in the data collection. The results were subjected to statistical analysis: mean values, standard deviation values were calculated, linear regression model was applied. Results. It is found that the proposed toolkit has reliability and validity. On average, statistically significant improvement of student's innovative competence in the focused learning of the course “Techno-Startup” was recorded relative to the control group. However, in 11-13% of students, motivation and personal attitudes decreased. It has been revealed that individual methods of teaching don't significantly influence the development of innovative competence of students, and it is necessary to use different methods in combination, each of which influences a specific component of competence. In the process of studying, the components of competence develop differently: the most noticeable growth of knowledge and skills, while personal attitudes and qualities practically does not change. Discussion and Conclusion. The obtained results contribute to the development of ideas about innovation competence, which can be useful in creating training programs for engineers and entrepreneurs in the technological sphere. Practical value has recommendations on the construction and content of the course, in the scope of which innovation competence is purposefully forms on the example of the discipline “Techno-Startup”.","Solodikhina, A.

"Individual-level perception of research, development and innovation in the life of Hungarian enterprises","In today's fast-changing world, innovation is essential for organisations to thrive and to meet the challenges of the new age. However, innovation initiatives have a huge uncertainty factor that is difficult to manage. It is therefore important that all innovation initiatives are managed with a project approach, supported from the project management side. However, the link between innovation and project management is not yet clear. Both fields are understood as separate disciplines, and innovation is often seen as an elusive concept. The aim of this paper is to show the outcome and success factors of innovation initiatives, linking them to the doctrines of project management. The aim of this paper is to show the views on research, development and innovation projects from the perspective of project management and deliverables, and to explore the relationship between the views of different organisational managers.

Moreover, this multiple-case project aims at understanding the feasibility, costs, and benefits of circularity strategies, such as deconstruction and reuse of wood in new projects or renovations. The learning processes draw upon explorative desktop-based research, interviews with key informants, and our own experiments and experiences with various cases of barns. The scope of this paper is the reuse of wood from barns that is deemed ineligible for renovation. This paper describes low-and high-Tech methods for surveying redundant buildings to applying extracted components in new designs.

To be or not to be digital? A bibliometric analysis of adoption of eHealth services,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to introduce new tools to develop a more precise and focused bibliometric analysis on the field of digitalization in healthcare management. Furthermore, this study aims to provide an overview of the existing resources in healthcare management and education and other developing interdisciplinary fields. Design/methodology/approach: This work uses bibliometric analysis to conduct a comprehensive review to map the use of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) research models in healthcare academic studies. Bibliometric studies are considered an important tool to evaluate research studies and to gain a comprehensive view of the state of the art. Findings: Although UTAUT dates to 2003, our bibliometric analysis reveals that only since 2016 has the model, together with UTAUT2 (2012), had relevant application in the literature. Nonetheless, studies have shown that UTAUT and UTAUT2 are particularly suitable for understanding the reasons that underlie the adoption and non-adoption choices of eHealth services. Further, this study highlights the lack of a multidisciplinary approach in the implementation of eHealth services. Equally significant is the fact that many studies have focused on the acceptance and the adoption of eHealth services by end users, whereas very few have focused on the level of acceptance of healthcare professionals. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a bibliometric analysis of technology acceptance and adoption by using advanced tools that were conceived specifically for this purpose. In addition, the examination was not limited to a certain era and aimed to give a worldwide overview of eHealth service acceptance and adoption.","Cobelli, Nicola;Blasioli, Emanuele",Journal,TQM Journal,2023-01-01,DeGroote School of Business;Università degli Studi di Verona,Health care ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation ;  Management systems ;  Service quality ;  Technological innovation

The future of clinical trials and drug development: 2050,"A workshop held at the 18th Annual Conference of the Pharmaceutical Contract Management Group in Krakow on 9 September 2022 asked over 200 delegates what the clinical trial landscape would look like in 2050. Issues considered included who will be running the pharmaceutical industry in 2050; how ‘health chips’, wearables and diagnostics will impact on finding the right patients to study; how will artificial intelligence be designing and controlling clinical trials; and what will the role of the Clinical Research Associate, the critical observer, documenter and conductor of a clinical trial need to look like by 2050. The consensus was that, by 2050, if you are working in clinical trials, you will be a data scientist. We can expect to see an increasing role of new technologies and a new three-phase registration model for novel therapies. The first phase will involve an aspect of quality evaluation and biological proof-of-concept probably involving more preclinical modelling and engineered human cell lines and fewer animal studies than currently used. Once registered, new products will enter a period of adaptive clinical development (delivered as a single study) intended to establish safety. This phase will most likely take around 1–2 years and explore tailored options for administration. Investigations will most likely be conducted in patients, possibly in a ‘patient-in-a-box’ setting (hospital or healthcare centre, virtual or microsite). On completion of safety licencing, drugs will begin an assessment of efficacy in partnership with those responsible for reimbursement – testing will be performed in patients, possibly where individual patient involvement in safety testing will offer some reimbursement deal for future treatment. Change is coming, though its precise form will likely depend on the creativity and vision of sponsors, regulators and payers.","Hardman, Timothy C.;Aitchison, Rob;Scaife, Richard;Edwards, Jean;Slater, Gill",Journal,Drugs in Context,2023-01-01,Vecti Bio AG;Leo Pharma;4C Associates Ltd.;Niche Science & Technology Ltd.;Devizes,artificial intelligence ;  clinical trials ;  innovation ;  regulatory framework ;  trial data

Teaching reform and practice of Introduction to Oil Processing course,"Introduction to Oil Processing is a core course of the National First-Class Undergraduate program in Food Science and Technology of Jiangnan University. This course aims to develop students' professional knowledge of oil processing and focuses on improving their engineering practice and their ability to analyze and solve practical problems. However, the current teaching has problems such as teaching content emphasizes on theory but not practice; teaching methods emphasize on explanation but not inspiration; knowledge application emphasizes on imitation but not innovation; faculty focuses on research but not teaching. Based on the above problems, the direction of teaching reform of Introduction to Oil Processing is to train students' practical ability by the integration of theory and practice in knowledge structure, to stimulate students' learning interest by the combination of multiple teaching methods in classroom teaching, to train students' operational and innovative ability by the integration of classroom teaching and extra-curricular extension in talent training mode, and to strengthen teachers' construction by simultaneously improving teachers' scientific research and teaching level. In this way, the objectives of Introduction to Oil Processing course can be better achieved, and the organic unity of knowledge transfer and competence training for students can be realized. After the teaching update, student evaluation and supervisor evaluation of this course have improved significantly, and the overall teaching quality ranking of Introduction to Oil Processing in 2020 and 2021 was ranked in the top 2% of all courses at School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University. In addition, students have won numerous awards at top national subject competitions and have received many honors at school and provincial level. This demonstrates a significant increase in students' knowledge and innovation, and provides a highly qualified and professional workforce for the sustainable development of the lipids industry.","Wang, Xiaosan;Gu, Yuxing;Liu, Yuanfa;Chang, Ming",Journal,Food and Fermentation Industries,2023-01-01,Jiangnan University,Introduction to Oil Processing ;  knowledge structure ;  practical teaching ;  teaching quality ;  teaching reform
How Does Global Value Chain Embedding Affect Corporate Green Technological Innovation,"This article uses Chinese provincial panel data from 2000 to 2019, and uses empirical methods to investigate the factors affecting corporate green technology innovation. The study concluded that: under the background of the division of labor in the global value chain, corporate green technology innovation is facing path dependence and low-end lock-in dilemmas. High energy consumption mode and resource mismatch are important factors that restrict the development of corporate green transformation. At the same time, the concentration of innovative elements and the strengthening of environmental regulations can effectively improve the quality of green technology innovation. Further analysis of heterogeneity shows that the rise in the ranking of industrial structure and value chain is helpful to increase the level of green development in participating in international value chain division and cooperation.","Li, Zhiyu;Wang, Tianzun;Lv, Pengjuan",Book Series,Environmental Science and Engineering,2023-01-01,Hebei University of Economics and Business,Global value chain division of labor ;  Green technology ;  Innovation

Biogenic polymer-based patches for congenital cardiac surgery: a feasibility study,"Objective: Currently used patch materials in congenital cardiac surgery do not grow, renew, or remodel. Patch calcification occurs more rapidly in pediatric patients eventually leading to reoperations. Bacterial cellulose (BC) as a biogenic polymer offers high tensile strength, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility. Thus, we further investigated the biomechanical properties of BC for use as patch material. Methods: The BC-producing bacteria Acetobacter xylinum were cultured in different environments to investigate optimal culturing conditions. For mechanical characterization, an established method of inflation for biaxial testing was used. The applied static pressure and deflection height of the BC patch were measured. Furthermore, a displacement and strain distribution analysis was performed and compared to a standard xenograft pericardial patch. Results: The examination of the culturing conditions revealed that the BC became homogenous and stable when cultivated at 29°C, 60% oxygen concentration, and culturing medium exchange every third day for a total culturing period of 12 days. The estimated elastic modulus of the BC patches ranged from 200 to 530 MPa compared to 230 MPa for the pericardial patch. The strain distributions, calculated from preloaded (2 mmHg) to 80 mmHg inflation, show BC patch strains ranging between 0.6% and 4%, which was comparable to the pericardial patch. However, the pressure at rupture and peak deflection height varied greatly, ranging from 67 to around 200 mmHg and 0.96 to 5.28 mm, respectively. The same patch thickness does not automatically result in the same material properties indicating that the manufacturing conditions have a significant impact on durability Conclusions: BC patches can achieve comparable results to pericardial patches in terms of strain behavior as well as in the maximum applied pressure that can be withstood without rupture. Bacterial cellulose patches could be a promising material worth further research.","Richert, Emma;Nienhaus, Andrea;Ekroll Jahren, Silje;Gazdhar, Amiq;Grab, Maximilian;Hörer, Jürgen;Carrel, Thierry;Obrist, Dominik;Heinisch, Paul Philipp",Journal,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,2023-01-01,"Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München;University of Bern, Faculty of Medicine;University of Bern;Technische Universität München;UniversitatsSpital Zurich;Klinikum der Universität München",biogenic polymers ;  biomedical engineering ;  congenital ;  innovation ;  patch
Towards IoT-Big Data architecture for future education,"New technology, through the IoT, Big Data and AI ecosystem, is the foundation on which tomorrow's solutions are created. Improved processes with better decision making are the actors that drive the evolution of tomorrow's services.

System Orientation as an Enabler for Sustainable Frugal Engineering: Insights from Automotive Material Development,"Research about barriers towards green material transition in automotive often points to technical or regulatory barriers. Contrary we emphasize an under-researched inhibitor, namely the underlying innovation assumptions and technical requirements in organizations that define themselves as quality-driven. As sufficiency represents a vital strategy to encounter corporate sustainability, especially Western organizations are forced to rethink their “bigger and better innovation ideologies”. Thus, our research shows that overly high and complex technical requirements that may not be relevant for a specific use case represent a serious barrier for the implementation of often inferior secondary polymer materials. We address the emerging challenges through the theoretical lens of frugal engineering that offers a promising contribution to corporate sustainability due to its focus on core functionalities and optimized performance levels. Using a mixed-method expert interview study as part of an ongoing action research project within a leading German automotive OEM we develop a system-oriented approach for sustainable and frugal engineered polymer materials. The method will support engineers and product developers to overcome overengineering and mitigate requirement-based inhibitors of life cycle engineering. Future research should examine the discussed barrier in other industries and substantiate the applicability of our proposed method with further case studies.","Achtelik, Timo;Herstatt, Cornelius;Tiwari, Rajnish",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2023-01-01,Fachhochschule Münster - Abteilung Steinfurt;Volkswagen AG;Hamburg University of Technology,automotive ;  Frugal engineering ;  frugal innovation ;  frugality ;  material development ;  system engineering
Geospatial visualization of indicators for the dynamics of innovation in an educational institution applying clustering techniques,"The activities of science, technology, and innovation are related to the execution of actions involving research, experimental development, support for education and training, provision of scientific and technological services, administration, and other management activities. In this context, the SENNOVA Research System of Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje of Colombia dedicates human and technological resources to contribute to the country's economic and social growth, looking to answer the need to develop Colombia's productive sector. In turn, these contributions also generate social dynamics in which the activity at the institutional level can be represented as a kind of the complex systems studied by nonlinear Physics. These complex dynamics are suitable for visualization from the stochastic processes that lead to statistical distributions typical of complex systems. A data analytics model for the measurement and visualization of innovation indicators is being developed in the Antioquia regional branch of Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, where the distinct categories of science, technology, and innovation activities are graphically identified to facilitate the analysis of the results obtained from both descriptive statistics and data science. From the perspective of complex systems for representing these institutional social dynamics, clustering processes with techniques such as K-means grouping were implemented. Potential distributions determined by the conglomerates of management processes and productivity of the projects executed in the analyzed institution over a given period are identified as innovation indicators and subsequently classified using principal component analysis. Python Folium was used as a visualization tool to graphically generate comparisons between the different Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje centers of the Antioquia regional branch in each period. The results show greater ease of interpretation and analysis of statistical results and data analytics in measuring indicators of science, technology, and innovation activities through the techniques employed in comparison with traditional data visualization tools.","Buitrago-Cadavid, P.

Cognitive rehabilitation: A comparison model of a digital environment based on serious games and the traditional methods,"Technological innovation contributes to a personalised and integrated approach in education, journalism, communication, management, marketing, and above all, in healthcare. Facing the increasing number of new patients and the shortage of health specialists, the emergence of innovative technologies has brought the fields of health and technology closer together. This research aims to study digital environments in the context of neurocognitive rehabilitation, for the care of patients with deficits in cognitive functions, supported by Serious Games (SG). Typically, neurological patients suffer from cognitive deficits in executive, visuospatial, attention and/or memory functions. In this context, SG prefigure an appropriated tool that combines healthcare and rehabilitation, which allows the connection of healthcare specialists with a platform, as the connection of patients with life and disease companions with potential for collaboration and recording the evolution of the rehabilitation process. Aiming to identify the characteristics and requirements of SG in exposing neurological patients to a safe technological environment that simulates rehabilitation activities supported by SG (developed and oriented to their specificities), but also to make a comparison with traditional methods (TM). A model of comparison between the two paradigms was elaborated, which allowed the collection of requirements and characteristics for future developments. In conclusion, SG are not strictly better than traditional treatment (TT) methods in this context, but the elaborated comparison tends to point out that SG are sovereign to TM in improving training and producing quality data (in safety) for analysis, which allows the total rehabilitation process to be better conducted.","Gonçalves, Helena Isabel Marques;Da Silva, Firmino Oliveira",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2023-01-01,Instituto Politécnico de Gestão e Tecnologia;Escola Superior de Media Artes e Design,Health ;  Neuro-Cognitive Rehabilitation ;  Serious Games ;  Traditional Methods
Practice and reflections on open sharing of marine scientific data,"Marine scientific data have very important use in marine scientific research, engineering construction, resource development, environmental protection, spatial planning, maintenance of rights and interests, national defense security, etc. It is a basic strategic resource in developing China’s ocean affairs, building China into a strong maritime country, and building a marine community with a shared future. Scientific and effective management, as well as proper classification and grading of open sharing, of the marine scientific data can improve the utilization and maximize the effectiveness of the data by avoiding its duplicated use and wastage. A summary of the implementation plan for the “United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030)” (Ocean Decade) was released in 2020, which clearly states that data and information are the key contributors to the outcomes of the Ocean Decade. It also points out that the digitization, conservation, management, and use of the ocean-related data, information, and knowledge will be the foundation for the success of the Ocean Decade as they expand significantly in volume as well as in spatial and temporal perspectives. However, the special geographical environment of the ocean makes the field investigation costly and data resources valuable. At the same time, some portions of the data are related to the national defense security and maintenance of rights and interests, thus making them highly sensitive. Therefore, the open sharing of the marine scientific data faces many problems and challenges. From the perspective of development, the open sharing of scientific data has become a global consensus. Agencies funding for scientific research related activities are the main operators and promoters of the open sharing of scientific data, while international organizations can gather consensus and maximize the value and effectiveness of scientific data by overcoming political, economic, social and institutional barriers. At present, the developed coastal countries and international organizations have developed significantly in open sharing of marine scientific data, established relevant regulations and systems, and built professional marine data centers to guarantee and promote the open sharing of marine scientific data and provide services to the world with data and information related products. Although China is also actively promoting the open sharing of marine scientific data, there are still many problems, such as the management of distributed data, sharing of low level data, weak willingness of owners to share data, inadequate system for classification and grading of data, differences in standards and specifications of data services, and lack of talent in marine information technology. The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Shiptime Sharing Project pilots the open sharing of ocean survey data starting from 2022, which effectively improves the utilization rate and service of the NSFC marine scientific data. It conducts helpful exploration and practice in the system construction, quality management, share content, intellectual property protection, supervision, and management. In order to play further the leading role of NSFC in the national innovation system and to promote the open sharing of marine scientific data with reference to the current development and advanced experience at the international level, this paper puts forward some reflections and suggestions on the open sharing of marine scientific data in China. With the aim of providing recommendations and references to the China’s marine scientific data management and sharing services, and better playing the role of basic resources and innovation engine of marine science data in the implementation of the Marine power and digital China strategy, this paper proposes several aspects, including the improvement and implementation of the institutional system, coordinating the data utilization and security protection, strengthening the quality management of the marine survey data during its whole life cycle, strengthening the construction of scientific data centers, promoting the deep integration of marine and new technologies, and strengthening the international cooperation on marine data.","Leng, Shuying;Su, Tianyun;Zhang, Liang",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,"First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources;National Natural Science Foundation of China",data management ;  data sharing ;  marine science ;  NSFC Shiptime Sharing Project ;  open access

"A SMART decade: outcomes of an integrated, inclusive, first-year college-level STEM curricular innovation","In the early 2000s, our primarily undergraduate, white institution (PUI/PWI), began recruiting and enrolling higher numbers of students of color and first-generation college students. However, like many of our peer institutions, our established pedagogies and mindsets did not provide these students an educational experience to enable them to persist and thrive in STEM. Realizing the need to systematically address our lack of inclusivity in science majors, in 2012 faculty from multiple disciplines developed the Science, Math, and Research Training (SMART) program. Here, we describe an educational innovation, originally funded by a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, designed to support and retain students of color, first generation college students, and other students with marginalized identities in the sciences through a cohort-based, integrated, and inclusive first-year experience focused on community and sense of belonging. The SMART program engages first-year students with semester-long themed courses around “real world” problems of antibiotic resistance and viral infections while integrating the fields of Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and an optional Computer Science component. In the decade since its inception, 97% of SMART students have graduated or are on track to graduate, with 80.9% of these students earning a major in a STEM discipline. Here, we present additional student outcomes since the initiation of this program, results of the student self-evaluative surveys SALG and CURE, and lessons we have learned from a decade of this educational experience.","Jones, Shannon;Blake, Alexis;Corado-Santiago, Lesly;Crenshaw, Jasmine;Goldman, Emma;Gomez, Fernando;Hall, Chelsea;Hoke, Harry;Holmes, Stephen;Kornegay, Benjamin;Kwarteng, Priscilla;Lawson, Barry;Leber, Meghan;Leconte, Georges;Modeste, Erica;Nolin, Kristine;Norris, Michael;Santinni Roma, Jose;Swackhammer, Addison;Torres, Marcella;Wares, Joanna;Williams, Dominique Ebony;Hill, April;Hoke, Kathy;Parish, Carol;Pierce, B.

Research on project-based learning of foreign trade english in speech recognition virtual reality environment,"Foreign trade English learning ability refers to students’ awareness and ability to actively use and adapt to foreign trade English learning strategies, broaden foreign trade English learning channels, and enhance the impact of English learning on foreign trade. Learning ability is the development condition for students to form core literacy. It supports project-based learning of students' ability to learn English in foreign trade. On the basis of reading, students need to complete the project through tasks such as surveys and interviews, information retrieval, exchange reports, and exhibition comments. Specific research, and develop students’ critical thinking skills, collaborative communication skills, knowledge application skills, and innovation skills. With the development of deeper foreign trade, speech recognition has become one of the mainstream methods based on time-delayed neural network learning. However, there are still some problems in the current research process. On the one hand, there is still a lack of in-depth research on TDNN and how to better extract the context features of delayed neural networks on different time scales; on the other hand, end-to-end speech recognition is easy to be used in speech recognition scenarios with resource shortages. Encountered the problem of insufficient data, resulting in performance degradation.

Advancing IS Strategy for Natural History Museums with Method Engineering in the Digital Age,"The evolution of information systems and technologies (IS/IT) has driven a fundamental transformation of services and processes within various types of organizations. Specifically, technologies such as AI, virtual reality, augmented reality, big data, drones, cloud, 3D printers and IoT have originated the phenomenon in literature known as digital transformation. Digital transformation (DT) is a strategic, organization-wide approach that brings together process, technology and people. It is not just a matter of technological investment, but of considering improved ways of implementing the organisation’s mission, rethinking its core functions to benefit from digital. Over the last decades, museums have also been committed to digital innovation, although at a slower pace than other sectors, so that today many museums are still far from reaching a high level of digital maturity. In such circumstances, the strategic planning of DT and the right leadership for deploying digital projects, are crucial to establish guidelines, objectives and strategic projects that support the achievement of museum’s mission and enhance their relevance in today’s society. In order to explore such a strategic approach, the Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona (MCNB) and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) are cooperating in an applied research project, approved and funded by the Industrial Doctorate Programme of the Generalitat de Catalunya, resulting in a method for the strategic planning of DT initiatives in Natural History Museums, as well as the first DT plan for the collections area of the MCNB.","Alvarado Pérez, Cristabel Evelia;Garcia Franquesa, Eulàlia;Pastor Collado, Joan Antoni",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2023-01-01,Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona;Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Cyber Human Systems ;  Digital Museum ;  Digital Transformation ;  IS/IT Strategic Planning ;  Method Design ;  Natural History Museums
Decarbonising Precast Concrete Manufacturing: Implementation of Low-Carbon Concretes,"The greatest challenge of the modern construction industry is posed by the global climate emergency. The shift towards modern methods of construction, adopting an off-site manufacturing approach, and minimising in-situ work can help create a more sustainable future, by improving working conditions, quality, and efficiency. Advances in low-carbon technologies, suitable for precast concrete industry, are crucial for meeting net-zero goals. Aiming to drive innovation in the area, Laing O’Rourke, an international engineering and construction company, led a collaborative project with academic partners, University of Cambridge Centre of Industrial Sustainability and University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre. The Decarbonising Precast Concrete Manufacturing (DPCM) project is a part Innovate UK funded R&D project that aspired to deliver a feasibility study for implementing decarbonisation interventions at Laing O’Rourke’s precast concrete factory. This paper presents part of the findings of the DPCM project focused on the deployment of low-carbon concretes. Technical background review of available and emerging materials informed the selection of geopolymer concrete, alkali-activated cementitious material (AACM), high GGBS replacement mixes, calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement concrete and limestone cement concrete for further testing. All mixes have been subjected to laboratory trials to assess fresh and hardened concrete properties. Out of these, geopolymer concrete, AACM and high GGBS mix were progressed to batching and manufacturing trials at Laing O'Rourke’s precast concrete facility, which included production of full-scale precast concrete units, using the low-carbon mixes. The trials validated feasibility of integrating low-carbon mixes into a precast concrete manufacturing facility and identified the associated challenges, in particular slower strength gain, consistency, and open life. The impact of these properties on production throughput in the precast factory can be significant; thus mix selection, alternative curing and lifting strategies, and simulation-based production planning tools may be needed for use of low-carbon concretes at project or multi-project scale implementation.","Pavlović, Ana;Rust, Glen;Edwards, Harry",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2023-01-01,Laing O’Rourke,AACM ;  Cement Replacements ;  Geopolymer Concrete ;  Low-Carbon Concrete ;  Precast Concrete
A System Development Strategy of a Digital Construction for Building Frames,"The prospect of sustainable and productive construction through efficient material use, freeform capabilities, and industrialising the construction industry have motivated a surge in academic research and industry activity in the field of extrusion-based additive manufacturing of cementitious material or 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP). Recently, residential buildings have been constructed in several countries by incorporating 3DCP in the building method. However, significant innovation and development are required to utilise this digital fabrication method in the construction of multi-storey residential buildings. A construction system that can design and fabricate a structural concrete frame for such buildings while capitalising on the strengths of 3DCP in combination with traditional concrete fabrication methods is desired. Therefore, this paper aims to formulate a development strategy for a digital construction system, consisting of off-site 3DCP and precast concrete construction that can design and fabricate a multi-storey structural building frame. Systems engineering tools are used to formulate this development strategy. An ideal concept system, termed the reference case, is defined. Goals for the construction system are selected, and a system breakdown is performed by identifying tasks and subtasks. Existing technologies and methods that can complete these tasks are identified from the relevant literature and are selected according to the system goals. The failure modes of the selected technologies and the required experimental tests to validate the design of elements are identified. Finally, conceptual drawings of frame elements, a sub-frame, and the on-site assembly of a sub-frame are provided.","Ter Haar, Bjorn;Kruger, Jacques;van Zijl, Gideon",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2023-01-01,Stellenbosch University,3D Concrete Printing ;  Digital Fabrication ;  Off-site Construction Structural Concrete Frame ;  Systems Engineering
A Prosumer Approach for Feeding the Digital Twin. Testing the MUST Application in the Old Harbour Waterfront of Genoa,"Supporting the settlement systems’ life cycle management through synchronisation of the real world with a virtual platform constitutes the horizon for the MUST team research (Maintenance Urban Sharing Tools) with the Departments of Architecture (DiARC) and Structures for engineering and architecture (DiSt) of the University of Naples, Stress Scarl and ETT SpA. Living digital simulation models are based on information analysis and constant data supply. The research identifies the involvement of the settlement systems users through creating collaborative information flows, one of the driving factors of the digital revolution. The paper introduces the connotative aspects of the MUST application (Smau Innovation Award 2019, Campania Start-Up 2020 funded project) to identify the building and urban system loss of functionality.

Promoting active aging through assistive product design innovation: a preference-based integrated design framework,"Background: With the accelerating trend of global aging, over one billion people need to use one or more types of assistive products. However, the high abandonment rate of current assistive products is affecting the quality of life of the older adults, posing challenges to public health. Accurately capturing the preference factors of the older adults in the design process is an important way to improve the acceptance of assistive products. In addition, a systematic approach is needed to translate these preference factors into innovative product solutions. These two issues are less addressed in existing research. Methods: First, the evaluation grid method was used to conduct in-depth interviews with users and extract the structure of preference factors for assistive products. Quantification theory type I was used to calculate the weight of each factor. Secondly, universal design principles, TRIZ theory's contradiction analysis techniques, and invention principles were used to translate the preference factors into design guidelines. Then, finite structure method (FSM), morphological chart, and CAD techniques were used to visualize the design guidelines as alternatives. Finally, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to evaluate and rank the alternatives. Results: A Preference-based Assistive Product Design Model (PAPDM) was proposed. The model includes three stages: definition, ideation, and evaluation. A case study on walking aid demonstrated the execution of PAPDM. The results show that 28 preference factors influence the four psychological needs of the older adults: sense of security, sense of independence, self-esteem, and sense of participation. These psychological needs were reflected in the shape, color, material, universality, user-friendly, reliability, and smart functions of assistive products. The preference factors were transformed into five design guidelines, and three alternatives were generated. Finally, the evaluation concludes that solution C was the optimal solution. Conclusion: The PAPDM framework provides designers with a transparent, progressive approach to designing assistive products that meet unique needs and preferences of older adults. This enhances objectivity and scientific rigor in assistive product development, avoiding blind design and production. By considering the perspective of older adults from the outset, we can avoid high abandonment rates of assistive products and contribute to promoting active aging.","Zhang, Baoyi;Ma, Minyuan;Wang, Zongsheng",Journal,Frontiers in Public Health,2023-01-01,Xiamen University of Technology;National Cheng Kung University,active aging ;  assistive products ;  evaluation grid method (EGM) ;  Miryoku engineering ;  preference-based design ;  TRIZ ;  universal design (UD)

Research on intelligent dual prevention mechanism and intelligent security control platform of coal mine,"At present, China's industrial production is facing intelligent technological innovation, and the coal mining industry is also in the wave of intelligent construction. The technical innovation of coal mine intelligence impels coal mine safety management into intelligence, and intelligent coal mine safety in the direction of intelligent safety risk control is the safety premise and safety guarantee of intelligent coal mine construction. To address the key issues of coal mine production safety risk prevention and control, the basic logic of the dual prevention mechanism and its shortcomings are firstly clarified. Double prevention mechanism is a set of effective safety management methods to prevent and control serious production safety incidents by identifying safety risks in advance, formulating corresponding control measures, and combining with closed-loop treatment procedures for hidden danger investigation. Its shortcoming is that the dynamic change characteristics of risks are not fully considered. Based on the analysis of the shortcomings of the dual prevention mechanism, the logic of the intelligent dual prevention mechanism and its advantages under the requirements of intelligent safety management are systematically elaborated. Based on the inherent risk classification and control, intelligent double prevention realizes dynamic assessment and prediction and early warning of the remaining risks, so that corresponding control measures can be taken to avoid hidden dangers before the risks really get out of control. Based on the management method of double prevention mechanism, the intelligent double prevention mechanism and intelligent safety control platform are proposed, and its system architecture, operation logic and construction basis are discussed. For safety management work, the intelligent safety control platform scientifically answers a series of questions about which person, when, where and what to check. On the basis of regular full-coverage control of each risk, it realizes differentiated resource input for different risk levels and timely and advanced control of hidden dangers, which makes all safety management activities simple while improving safety management performance. On the basis of the control platform, the key technologies required for the platform are discussed. These include digitization, collection and transmission of comprehensive security data, storage and management of comprehensive security data, intelligent algorithm models based on security management scenarios, integration of intelligent hardware with the control platform, and data visualization display and remote interaction technologies based on CPS or digital twin. Based on the double prevention mechanism, the intelligent double prevention mechanism and intelligent safety control platform are proposed. On the basis of lean allocation of safety resources, it realizes the advance control of safety risks, and then fundamentally improves the safety level of the enterprise and realizes the essential safety.","Li, Shuang;He, Chao;Lu, Cheng;Xu, Kun;Xue, Guangzhe",Journal,Meitan Kexue Jishu/Coal Science and Technology (Peking),2023-01-01,China University of Mining and Technology,coal mine ;  coal mine ;  dynamic evaluation ;  intelligent dual prevention ;  safety control

Improving Attitudes of Underrepresented High School Students Toward STEM: A Virtual Summer Program,"The lack of US underrepresented and underserved students seeking professions in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a pressing issue. Unfortunately, below 50% of the students who enter the STEM fields graduate with a STEM-related degree. Hence, the USA must continue to be innovative and take creative steps to compete as a world power and leader in STEM fields. If innovation and creative STEM outreach efforts shift focus from working professionals and begin targeting traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM at the secondary education level, this would increase the technical talent pool. This study examines the attitudes of students toward STEM with a near-peer mentor model and without a near-peer mentor (NPM) in a virtual STEM research-based designed experience. The pilot quantitative study design fostered a supportive, structured virtual environment in which students can gain confidence in their abilities to master STEM subjects and become motivated to strive from internally driven values to achieve. The study's results reveal how student participants experienced near-peer mentoring and non-near-peer mentoring. The study’s findings provide valuable insights for the next steps to address the needs of underrepresented and underserved groups through structuring the near-peer mentoring experience to provide continuity throughout the virtual STEM learning experience.","Lamkin, Darron;Ghosh, Robin;Lobodina, Galina;Dearborn, Katie;Allen, Shonda;Asino, Tutaleni I.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,Arkansas State University;Oklahoma State University;Jackson State University,High school ;  Machine learning ;  Peer-to-near-peer mentoring ;  Secondary education ;  STEM ;  Underrepresented ;  Virtual/remote learning

Blockchain Applications in Higher Education: A Systematic Literature Review,"The widespread usage of the Internet and the abrupt outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic have compelled higher education institutes (HEIs) worldwide to shift their academic and administrative affairs online. These unprecedented changes have caused issues in relation to trust, identity authentication, and stakeholder engagement that cripple HEIs' effective digitalisation of educational practices. Additionally, the ecosystem of HEIs has become more complex because it involves various heterogeneous information systems and the diverse demands of decentralised stakeholders, such as lecturers, students, and alumni. To address these emerging problems, blockchain has become a potentially disruptive technology that can facilitate practical innovation and provide opportunities for the re-engineering of traditional HEIs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to consolidate the fragmented knowledge of blockchain applications in higher education based on the current literature of related research domains, blockchain benefits, and additional challenges for future studies. The paper consists of a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines and an analysis of 79 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2018 and December 2022 by making an extensive literature search of Scopus, Taylor and Francis Online, and Web of Science databases. The results illustrate that blockchain is being explored and utilised to create new interventions to promote the sharing, securing, and management of data and knowledge and to enhance the coordination and trust between internal and external stakeholders of HEIs.

Development of Electrical Cabinet Prototypes Based on Technology of Laminated Conductors,"The traditional technology used in the production of electrical cabinets is generally outdated and complex. Therefore, there is a need for a new production technology that minimises both production time and physical labour. As part of this research, a brand new, patented laminated conductor technology was used to connect electrical cabinet components. The assembly process is based on the alternating layering of conductive and insulating layers. By using laminated conductors with a rectangular cross-section, the main advantage of the implemented technology is the possibility to connect the components in a fully automated production process. Other advantages include reduced size as well as simpler installation and use. The basis of this technology is the web application used to upload circuit diagrams and configure the electrical cabinet. Before prototyping the electrical cabinet, a digital twin is created based on the previously collected plans. For research purposes, two prototypes were built, one with a AC power supply and the other with a DC power supply.

An exploratory study on the significance and challenges of aircraft base maintenance engineering in the aviation industry,"An aircraft is considered one of the most sophisticated combinations of complex technologies and is known as the safest and fastest mode of transportation. The aviation industry reached such a safety level by implementing continuous innovation and improvement in flying technologies embedded during aircraft production. Along with production, the aircraft manufacturer's team also establishes aircraft maintenance requirements to keep the aircraft airworthy during its life span. Soon after the aircraft's delivery to its owner or operator worldwide, the owners'/operators' responsibility is to maintain the aircraft and ensure airworthiness by performing the maintenance work at predefined intervals. Such maintenance activities are defined in two categories and performed by aircraft engineers under the Part-145 framework and aircraft maintenance organizational setup. The first category is line maintenance, which is comparatively light regarding the nature of work, and the second is base maintenance, which takes all the major work needed on the aircraft.

Mechatronics Education-Current and Future Trends,"Mechatronics for Technologists and Technicians was recognized as an occupation by the U.S. Department of Labor in 2019 and was given the code 49-2094.00. In 2022 the occupation was migrated to the code 17-3024.00 and titled ""Electro-Mechanical and Mechatronics Technologists and Technicians"". Several organizations offer certifications in the mechatronics occupation that we list here. The major challenge that faces mechatronics education is the decline in the job market that is projected to stand at-2 % over the next decade for holders of bachelor's or lower degrees. This is attributed to the post-pandemic remote work trend and the hard-hit manufacturing industry during the pandemic. This decline is coupled with an aggressive growth in the job market for holders of graduate degrees (standing at over 11% growth) due to the growing demand in research and innovation and engineering training.","Tantawi, Khalid;Nasab, Ahad;Potter, Lyn;Tantawi, Omar;Wilson, Nancy;Henrie, Alisa;Sirinterlikci, Arif;Kaplanoglu, Erkan",Conference Proceeding,ISDFS 2023 - 11th International Symposium on Digital Forensics and Security,2023-01-01,College of Engineering and Computer Science;The University of Alabama in Huntsville;Robert Morris University;Lawson State Community College;Motlow State Community College,Education ;  Engineering Technology ;  Mechatronics

Learning interference between electricity and magnetism? Analysis of patterns and consistency,"Due to the similarities between Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws, students can present cognitive interference when learning these laws in the introductory physics course. This study aims to analyze the interference patterns that emerge in students’ answers when solving problems that involve Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws and related concepts (e.g., electric flux and magnetic circulation). We conducted a study of 322 engineering students attending a private Mexican university. We applied two open-ended questionnaires with questions that prompted using Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws. We analyzed students’ answers to identify whether they presented some word or element of an equation from the opposite context and coded them into coding families. We analyzed the consistency of interference by counting the times each student presented some interference in general and by coding family. The results indicated that the interferences related to the shape of the Gaussian surface or Amperian trajectory and field-related concepts are shared among contexts. However, the interference related to the source of the field (charge or current) is predominant in magnetism. In contrast, the interference related to using elements from the opposite context in an equation predominates in electricity. In other words, students referred to currents as charges and wrote equations that contained B (for magnetic field) or other similar elements in Gauss’s law. The general consistency analysis revealed that around half the students presented at least one interference in both contexts. We recommend that the interference between electricity and magnetism in Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws must not be overlooked. This study’s findings can guide introductory and intermediate electricity and magnetism instructors to address this interference phenomenon.","Campos, Esmeralda;Hernández, Eder;Barniol, Pablo;Zavala, Genaro",Journal,"Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,educational innovation ;  electricity and magnetism ;  higher education ;  introductory physics ;  physics education research ;  STEM education
"Situation, challenge and future direction of experimental methods for geological evaluation of shale oil","China is rich in lacustrine shale oil resource which has become one of national strategic resource. As a typical representative of self-sourced petroleum resources, shale oil enrichment has the characteristic of in-situ generation and inner-sourced storage. The occurrence and production mechanism of shale oil and gas in micro/nano-scale pore-fracture system is complex. Laboratory-based device innovation and technological revolution are important driving force to promote the theoretical innovation, large-scale exploration, and effective production of lacustrine shale oil. Through summarizing the research progress and main understandings of several hotspots involving the geological evaluation of shale oil such as fine-grained sedimentation and organic matter enrichment, rock structure and mineral composition, micro/nano-scale pore-fracture system, fluid occurrence and movable fluid, and fracability and fracture propagation, it is proposed that the experimental method for geological evaluation of shale oil is changing from source rock to reservoir, from hydrocarbon generation capacity to hydrocarbon storage capacity, and from hydrocarbon expulsion capacity to hydrocarbon production capacity. At present, there are three challenges in the development of experimental techniques for shale oil evaluation. (1) It is difficult to accurately characterize the shale oil reservoirs of different scales due to fine-grained sedimentation and its complex mineral composition. (2) The mechanism of pore evolution and hydrocarbon occurrence is complex under the combined action of organic and inorganic materials so that it is very difficult to evaluate the hydrocarbon mobility. (3) It is difficult to completely reproduce the real geological conditions at the laboratory, and the accuracy of laboratory-based evaluation needs to be further improved. The future experimental method for the geological evaluation of shale oil should focus on strengthening the research of the in-situ, refined, multi-scale experimental devices and evaluation methods, the dynamic evaluation of key shale reservoir attributes, as well as the construction of field laboratory and integration of geological and engineering technology, so as to improve the accuracy of reservoir characterization and prediction based on experimental technology, as well as the application of field laboratory. The relevant research and understanding are expected to provide the technical support for the geological evaluation of lacustrine shale oil, and a reference for the research on both enrichment theory and technological innovation of mobility evaluation.","Hou, Lianhua;Wu, Songtao;Jiang, Xiaohua;Tian, Hua;Yu, Zhichao;Li, Yafeng;Liao, Fengrong;Wang, Chanfei;Shen, Yue;Li, Mengying;Hua, Ganlin;Zhou, Chuanmin;Li, Hua",Journal,Shiyou Xuebao/Acta Petrolei Sinica,2023-01-01,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;China University of Petroleum-Beijing;China National Petroleum Corporation;National Energy Tight Oil and Gas R&D Center;PetroChina Qinghai Oilfield Company,integration of geology and engineering ;  mobility ;  nano pore ;  sweet-spot evaluation ;  unconventional oil and gas
Challenge-Based Learning applied to engineering modelling classes using dynamic systems,"In this article, we present the results of a study carried out in Engineering modeling through a dynamic systems class with engineering students from Tecnologico de Monterrey, México, where we applied challenge-based learning for 10 weeks. The implemented methodological process consisted of carrying out 4 laboratory practices and comparing the experimental results obtained regarding the results obtained in terms of the algebraic solution and by numerical methods, as relevant information of this method was the final elaboration of an argumentative text that allowed to arrive at the most objective truth possible. The research design was quasi-experimental, where two different teaching methods were compared using control and experimental groups applied in other groups. The results obtained allowed us to validate that the use of challenge-based learning in engineering modeling classes using dynamic systems (mathematics) made it possible to eliminate the difficulties presented by students both to understand the need for demonstrations in mathematics and to perform them. Challenge-based learning made it possible to avoid the trend of algorithmic mathematics in the classroom, avoiding the mechanical knowledge of formulas and their routine application, allowing students to solve problems of different levels of complexity, evaluate various technologies, and, above all, with openness in the search and implementation of relevant alternatives in the transformation of professional practice.","Nieto-Jalil, Jose M.;Seuret-Jimenez, Diego;Gutierrez-Cruz, Ivan;Tec-Chim, Adrian I.;Kinto-Ramirez, Hector",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2023-01-01,Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Challenge-based learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Professional education ;  Tec 21 Model

Emotional Tool Design: A Perspective on How to Generate Empathy in Higher Education Students,"Empathy is an ability that should be put on practice by higher education students. The way of practicing empathy is a research field in which the best pedagogical tools are to be discovered. Empathy can be considered a competence or skill that should be considered in training students to focus on problem-solving. The Emotional Tool Design (ETD) implementation can help to create dynamics that improve the ability to empathize. This paper evaluates seven ETD designed to develop empathy in architecture, design, and engineering students. The tool's function is based on observing and identifying an emotion expressed by a character (emoji/emoticon). Seventy students participated in an online survey where they were asked to observe, identify, and understand the emotions expressed by seven tools based on PrEmo dynamics tool. This survey contained an empathy test (Interpersonal Reactivity Index), having three questions on the perception of the seven tools, and two comparative emotion identification questions at the end of the survey. The results of this study allows to conclude that the surveyed students possessed a low empathy component, but other competencies, such as fantasy and perspective-taking, enhanced the ETDs experience. For the students, emojis/emoticons were acceptable, particularly the non-anthropomorphic type. In addition, the student's profiles did not determine a differential in their way of empathizing; it was not significant for their empathy with the emotions displayed by the ETDs. Finally, the emoji/emoticon quality determines the empathy and emotional tools to work for the students. The ETDs have proven to be tools that can introduce students of any career to experience an empathy process.","Hernandez, Fatima A.;Navarro-Estrella, Mario;Rojas, Juan Carlos;Alvarez, Jaime",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Takushoku University,Educational Innovation ;  Emoji ;  Empathy ;  Engineering Education ;  Higher Education
Male perspective in relation to the gender gap in STEM careers,"In recent years we have enthusiastically seen how the number of efforts to reduce the gender gap has increased. Although there is extensive research confirming the success of initiatives such as mentoring for women in STEM areas, a high percentage of those who take part in leading and managing this type of initiative are women (students, teachers, managers), and only 20% of the participants are male students and teacher, according to records of participation of these initiatives in a private university in Mexico. An anonymous electronic survey applied to male professors and students from the university willing to share with us their opinions. According to the evaluation instrument, the results were divided into the impact that taking part or not in an initiative has had to reduce the gender gap or not with respect to its gender equity perspective. Although positive results of the impact of participating in an initiative that seeks to achieve gender equity in the STEM areas in the School of Engineering and Sciences of Tecnologico de Monterrey are shown in the analyzed sample, there is also information on a small percentage that argues that they are not interested. to participate in this type of initiatives and whose perspective is that currently men and women have the same opportunities. In the same way, a point of attention is that one of the reasons for those who have not participated in any gender equality initiative in STEM areas is because the programs they have known only involve women. The purpose of this research is to measure the impact of gender equity initiatives on the perspective that men have on the issue comparing opinions of those who have had the opportunity to take part with those who have not taken part in any of them.","Burgos-Lopez, María Yolanda;Cantisani, Maria Ileana Ruiz;Forte-Celaya, Maria Rubi;Franco-Alvarez, Karen Yolanda;García-Hernández, Sandra Eugenia;Gutiérrez-Franco, David",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Gender gap ;  Higher Education ;  Male perspective gender equity ;  STEM careers

"Intellectual property rights, regulations, and perspectives on the commercial application of green products","The protections acquired by intellectual property rights encourage activities aimed at creating green products and the development of companies dedicated to the exploitation of these creations. When it comes to food safety technology, given the global regulatory conditions and food biosafety, innovations become the focus of market new strategies. To take knowledge is to be in intellectual possession of a matter; therefore everyone can possess knowledge simply by coming into contact with it. Commercializing knowledge, making it into a product, is the analytical sphere of economics, more specifically of trade policy of intellectual capital. Among the publications that involve green product market regulations and food safety, topics related to organic food, such as health consciousness, planned behavior, and equation modeling, have high relevance and advanced development. However, the themes within the food safety cluster are still under development, especially when it comes to certification schemes and consumer trust.","Faria-Silva, Leonardo;Baião, Kamila G.",Book,Green Products in Food Safety,2023-01-01,Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo;Espirito-Santense Foundation of Technology,agricultural economics ;  analysis of biological materials ;  biotechnology ;  business administration ;  commercial application ;  commercializing ;  consumer behavior ;  consumer goods ;  consumer trust ;  cooperative patent classification ;  copyright ;  eco-friendly ;  eco-products ;  ecological products ;  economic development ;  economic geography ;  economics ;  environmental policy ;  environmental technology ;  European Patent Office ;  finance ;  food chemistry ;  food safety ;  food science ;  general economics ;  geography ;  Green innovation ;  green products ;  industrial organization ;  industrial property ;  information systems ;  Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial ;  intellectual capital ;  intellectual property rights ;  international economics ;  International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ;  international patent classification ;  international trade ;  legal registration ;  management ;  marketing ;  microeconomics ;  operations management ;  organic fine chemistry ;  patents ;  plant science ;  political theory and practice ;  public economics ;  quantitative methods in economics ;  quantitative research method ;  regional science ;  regulations ;  specific industry ;  sustainability engineering ;  sustainable ;  sustainable development ;  technical inventions ;  technological change ;  trade policy ;  United States Patent and Trademark Office ;  World Intellectual Property Organization ;  World Trade Organization

Evaluating the Green Innovation Ability of Engineering Teams in a Hesitation Fuzzy Environment,"Purpose: In this paper, the hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making method is used to present a green innovation ability (GIA) assessment technique for engineering teams. Design/methodology/approach: In the evaluation method, we propose four evaluation indicators for GI input, GI implementation ability, GI development ability, and GI resource integration ability based on the evaluation indicators of GIA proposed by previous scholars, and use hesitant fuzzy sets as the expression tool for evaluation information. Thereafter, by improving the method proposed by Su et al. (2023) for positive and negative ideal points, this paper proposes a new evaluation method. Findings: Through the use of this method, we found that it can fully consider the fuzziness and hesitancy of evaluators in uncertain environments, and express them in the form of fuzzy numbers. This shows that the method is viable, reasonable, and applicable to genuine evaluation procedures. Furthermore, this study provides a theoretical reference for the evaluation of engineering teams and other fields. Originality/value: In this research, a decision-making reference point for the ideal point is proposed using the three-point estimate method, an integrated time estimation approach in the program evaluation and review technique (PERT). The research applies the hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making method to evaluate the green innovation capability of engineering teams by improving it. Further, the decision-making method is extended and applied to make some contributions to decision science.","Nie, Yuhan;Su, Jiafu",Journal,Advances in Decision Sciences,2023-01-01,Krirk University,engineering team ;  evaluation method ;  green innovation ability ;  hesitant fuzzy set ;  multi-attribute decision-making
Independent research and development and innovative applications of high-intensity proton cyclotrons toward serialization,"Cyclotrons are indispensable scientific equipment and platforms for cutting-edge research and are widely applied in nuclear science and life science, as well as the innovative development of nuclear technology. The difficulties and corresponding key technologies of compact high-intensity proton cyclotron research are fourfold: the insufficient axial focusing force of a compact cyclotron frustrates improvements in beam energy and beam intensity; the smelting capacity of large-scale magnets and modern manufacturing restricts magnetic field accuracy, which affects the dynamic performance of high-intensity beams; high-beam dynamic loads and coupling resonance considerably influence the stable operation of cyclotrons; and high-intensity negative hydrogen ion sources, the coupling of multiple physical fields in the narrow space of the central region, and the high-precision six-dimensional matching of beam optics in the extraction region are also great challenges for compact high-intensity cyclotrons. To solve these problems, a strong focusing theory of radially modulated magnetic field gradients was innovatively created by a cyclotron team at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE), and a parallel computing algorithm and software for multi-cluster high-intensity beam dynamics were also invented. These innovations extend the acceleration energy limit of compact cyclotrons and help increase beam intensity substantially under the restriction of space charges. A magnet shimming algorithm for isochronous fields and nonideal harmonic fields, based on the shape function of odd and even triangles, was developed to improve axial focusing effectively and solve problems in magnet engineering. Key RF technologies, such as suppression of “transmission line-resonator” system coupling oscillation and dynamic loading changes, were researched, and then a long-term operation with high stability was achieved for the entire machine. A high-intensity cyclotron prototype with strong focusing was built based on these innovations, effectively promoting the beam intensity of miniaturized cyclotrons from 50–100 μA to 300–500 μA. Subsequently, more than ten high-intensity compact cyclotrons have been developed at the CIAE, and these cyclotrons can provide beam intensity at the mA order after necessary upgrades. The main performance indexes of the cyclotrons, such as intensity, injection efficiency, and extraction efficiency, are world-class. Cyclotron applications are also applied in the projects of the CIAE, National Space Science Center, Irradiation Hardening Application Technology Innovation Center, and Peking University and contribute much to scientific research. We provide proton beams for ~100 units to perform scientific and technological research related to nuclear technology and its applications. The research and applications prompt the development of high-intensity proton cyclotrons.","Zhang, Tianjue;Jia, Xianlu;Song, Guofang;Yin, Zhiguo;Li, Pengzhan;Ji, Bin;Li, Ming;Hou, Shigang;Pan, Gaofeng;Guan, Fengping;Wang, Jingfeng;Zhang, He;Liu, Jingyuan;Xing, Jiansheng;Cai, Hongru",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,China Institute of Atomic Energy,compact ;  cyclotron ;  high intensity ;  proton

Comprehensive Evaluation of Experimental Teaching Quality Using AHP-TOPSIS Technique,"The key of university experimental teaching is to help students gradually perfect from knowledge learning to improvement of actual operational ability through experiments in the teaching and learning process. University experimental teaching is conducive for promoting innovative thinking and ability of practice of university students, and it plays an important role in the entire talent training system. Establishing scientific and reasonable evaluation methods and reflecting shortages in practical experimental teaching are not only keys of evaluation but also important guarantee to improve university experimental teaching quality. In this study, an evaluation index system of experimental teaching quality was constructed by combining analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Weights of indexes were determined. Moreover, a case study based on a comprehensive evaluation of experimental teaching quality of Construction Engineering CAD for civil engineering majors of undergraduates was performed. Results demonstrated that Level 2 indexes about teachers’ good preparation of lessons and complete and standard teaching documents (X-1-3), as well as students’ active thinking and positive participation in classroom learning (X-3-2), had the highest weight. Students’ evaluation ranking results provided quantitative references to more scientific evaluation of experimental teaching. The comprehensive evaluation of experimental teaching quality using AHP-TOPSIS technique solves the mutual dependence and feedback relationship among evaluation indexes effectively, and avoids influences of subjectivity and one-sidedness of artificial weighting. Research conclusions can provide important references to optimize experimental teaching process, train the innovation ability of students, increase the comprehensive quality of students, and deepen reform in experimental teaching.","Wang, Yongqi",Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2023-01-01,Tourism College of Zhejiang,AHP-TOPSIS ;  comprehensive evaluation ;  experimental teaching ;  teaching quality ;  university experiment

Secondary Metabolites and Bioprospecting,"In this decade, the focus of scientific communities is towards novel molecules with tremendous therapeutic benefits. They are raw house of flavors, and fragrances, dyes, and many important drugs which are processed based on them to combat various disorders. So it has attracted the global scientific community as they produce or engineer to innovate novel compounds with least toxicity. Engineering of plant secondary metabolism is viable recently, but it requires the acquaintance of biosynthetic metabolic routes responsible for their synthesis. To enhance their production, various protocols need to be followed substantially such as plummeting the flux through competitive routes, overexpression of regulatory genes, and decreasing catabolism overcoming rate-limiting steps. For this purpose different genes from plants can be isolated and overexpressed, including microflora diversity which has rich potential of different phytochemicals. Overexpression of plant genes in microorganisms is another approach, which requires keen research for the transformation of voluntarily obtainable precursors into valuable natural products. Scarce information about metabolic routes for the synthesis of bioactive compounds and the genes involved is one of the main barriers. Since there is a lot of complicity about chemical structures and these metabolic routes, bioactive compounds have been globally professed as therapeutically nonpotent, and limited attention has been devoted by scientific communities. Further, plant tissue cultures are another route of huge deposits of treasured bioactive compounds recommended in assisting in food nutrition, nutraceuticals, and in drug delivery. The amalgamation of natural products by in vitro values as compared to in vivo is devoid of physicochemical circumstances and eminence vacillations. Sometimes the synthesis of phytochemicals by chemical route is typical and requires extreme expertise. Therefore, the normal food condiments are appreciated and adapted by local communities in contrast to chemically synthesized drugs. Extensive research on natural products enthused innovation of the parting tools, spectroscopic tactics to detailed analyses of structure, and artificial tools which make the basis of current carbon-based studies involved in chemistry.","Sharma, Megha;Bhardwaj, Richa;Saran, Mukesh;Prajapat, Rakesh Kumar;Sharma, Deepak;Mathur, Manas",Book,Plant Growth Promoting Microorganisms of Arid Region,2023-01-01,Jaipur National University;IIS (Deemed to be University);Suresh Gyan Vihar University;Manipal University Jaipur;University of Rajasthan,Overexpression of genes ;  Phytochemicals ;  Plant cell cultures ;  Secondary metabolites

"Research, Development and Analysis for Solar Power Gathering Instruments","There has been a dramatic increase in the development of electronic devices made from bonded organic compounds due to their unique electrical behaviour and photonics propensity, as well as the favourable conditions for their processing and low production costs. Beginning with large band gap polymers, this dissertation delves into the photo physics of an all polymeric system. Optical, electrical, and morphological analyses, among others, were used to better understand the working phenomenon of the nanostructure that was created to maximise efficiency through interfacial engineering. Then, utilising spray coating techniques, the devices were framed in non-fullerene topologies; this architecture improved device efficiency and kept air stable for up to 72 days without the need for encapsulation. A PCE of around 7.52 % has been achieved, which is the uppermost PCE recorded to time for the donor and acceptor used in this study. The fabrication process was carried out using a small-molecule architecture that proved effective and was constructed using a bulk-heterojunction design. Solvent engineering principles were used to design the active layer configurations by combining several solvents and applying them using the spray coating method. With 8.25% efficiency, small molecule-based donors are now competitive with their polymeric analogues.

Visual Data Science for Industrial Applications,"Advances in sensor and data acquisition technology and in methods of data analysis pose many research challenges but also promising application opportunities in many domains. The need to cope with and leverage large sensor data streams is particularly urgent for industrial applications due to strong business competition and innovation pressure. In maintenance, for example, sensor readings of machinery or products may allow to predict at which point in time maintenance will be required and allow to schedule service operations respectively. Another application is the discovery of the relationships between production input parameters on the quality of the output products. Analysis of respective industrial data typically cannot be done in an out-of-the-box manner but requires to incorporate background knowledge from fields such as engineering, operation research, and business to be effective. Hence, approaches for interactive and visual data analysis can be particularly useful for analyzing complex industrial data, combining the advantages of modern automatic data analysis with domain knowledge and hypothesis generation capabilities of domain experts. In this chapter, we introduce some of the main principles of visual data analysis. We discuss how techniques for data visualization, data analysis, and user interaction can be combined to analyze data, generate and verify hypotheses about patterns in data, and present the findings. We discuss this in the light of important requirements and applications in the analysis of industrial data and based on current research in the area.

Identifying Integration Readiness Levels oriented work packages to establish Earned Readiness Management,"The dynamics of innovation in complex products and systems (CoPS) differs from the mass production industries. Integration Readiness Levels (IRL) represent technology maturity related to the integration of two or more technological elements in a system, addressing Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) application challenges. Earned readiness management (ERM) is a method for scheduling, monitoring, and evaluating the development of complex product systems. ERM could incorporate IRL advances, practitioners are adopting IRL and understanding its differences from TRL, and it is relevant to approach technology development projects in a system for value delivery in CoPS. The objective is to identify IRL-oriented work packages to establish ERM for space systems aiming at the application of ERM in CoPS technology development projects. This paper used NASA WBS standards for space flight and for research and technology projects to identify which work package elements could relate to IRL and compose ERM, and used ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 life cycle process definitions to support the analysis.

Barriers of Mathematical Language Representation of College Students Based on Data Mining,"With the innovation and development of computer application technology, colleges have further accelerated the process of information construction, and data mining has gradually become one of the most active research fields in education and teaching big data analysis. As a public basic course, college mathematics has many problems, such as a large number of students, high learning failure rate, and many learning disabilities. Stolyar, a famous mathematical educator of the former Soviet Union, said that mathematical teaching is also the teaching of mathematical language. Therefore, it plays a significant role in mathematics teaching to train students to skillfully use mathematical language to represent mathematical problems and enhance the students’ ability of solving problems with mathematical methods. Based on the existing circumstances of students’ mathematical language representation obstacles, this thesis deeply discusses the influencing factors of students’ performance, constructs a decision tree model of the main factors affecting students’ performance according to the decision tree arithmetic in data mining technology, and predicts the level of curriculum obstacles according to the model, so as to help teachers adjust teaching reasonably, and guide students to overcome the obstacles of mathematical language representation.","Wu, Haiyan",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2023-01-01,Hubei University,Data Mining ;  Mathematical Language ;  Representation Barrier
Challenges in Materials Integration,"Materials Integration is the concept of accelerating materials development by linking processing, structure, property, and performance (PSPP) on a computer using any types of models such as theoretical, empirical, numerical-simulation, and machine learning models. In the first and second phases of Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program in Cabinet Office, Japan, we have developed a system called MInt (Materials Integration for Network Technology), which links PSPP with computational workflows that combine modules implemented, in order to realize the concept of Materials Integration. MInt is equipped with an application programming interface (API) that can be called from various algorithms in the artificial intelligence (AI) field and one can use MInt-API together with the AI algorithms to inversely design materials and processes from desired performance. The target material systems have expanded to steel, aluminum alloys, nickel alloys, and titanium alloys, and the target processes have also expanded to welding, heat treatment, 3D additive manufacturing, and powder metallurgy. MInt is more than just software for materials design; it is designed to serve as a digital platform for industry-academia collaboration. The Materials Integration Consortium has been established with MInt as its core technology, based on the philosophy of sharing tools such as modules and workflows, while competing on how to use them. In materials research and development, which has traditionally been regarded as a competitive area, we hope that a digital collaborative area will be formed and that investment efficiency will be drastically improved.","Demura, Masahiko",Journal,Tetsu-To-Hagane/Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute of Japan,2023-01-01,National Institute for Materials Science,digital platform for industry-academia collaboration ;  integrated computational materials engineering ;  inverse design problem ;  materials integration ;  processing-structure-property-performance linkage ;  structural materials
Entrepreneurship Platform Under Virtual Reality Technology (VRT),"With the economic development and the enrollment expansion of colleges and universities, the function of universities has changed from “elite education” to “mass education”, and improving the innovation and entrepreneurship service of colleges and universities has become an important task. At present, the entrepreneurship support platform has the following problems: the single support mode is difficult to make up for the short board of College Students’ entrepreneurship; The platform technology lags behind and cannot well adapt to the mobile Internet; The lack of support services can not meet the diversified needs of entrepreneurial college students. Therefore, it is a good choice to apply VRT to the entrepreneurial platform. This paper studies the application of VRT in the entrepreneurial platform, discusses the VRT and its characteristics, the subsystem design of the entrepreneurial platform and the application of VRT in the entrepreneurial platform, tests and analyzes the experience of students and trainers in the application of VRT in entrepreneurship through the index evaluation of the application of virtual technology in the entrepreneurial platform, And test the entrepreneurship under virtual technology and the entrepreneurship effect under the traditional mode. Under different modes, the proportion of entrepreneurship “always adhere to”, “stop halfway”, “entrepreneurial success”, “entrepreneurial failure” and “always develop” is. Teachers and students in the entrepreneurship platform under VRT said that they had a good experience, which significantly improved their interest in learning and success rate. Under the VRT, 86% of them can always insist on entrepreneurship, of which 55% are successful, and 43% of them have been developing and operating; In contrast, only 31% of entrepreneurs under the traditional mode can always adhere to entrepreneurship, only 23% succeed in entrepreneurship, and 21% of companies have been operating and developing. It can be seen that the application of VRT in Entrepreneurship improves students’ learning initiative, enhances real experience, and plays an important role in the success of entrepreneurship and the operation and development of the company.","Wang, Lili",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2023-01-01,Mudanjiang Normal University,Application Research ;  Entrepreneurship Platform ;  Virtual Reality Technology ;  Virtual Technology
Taxonomy for Biological Transformation Principles in the Manufacturing Industry,"Industry and research are seeking answers to current demands in industrial value creation, like resilience of production, sufficient product quality and sustainability of products and processes. A novel line of thought, seeking the accomplishment of those is the Biological Transformation (BT). BT describes the interweaving of biological modes of action, materials and organisms with engineering and information sciences. The conflation of disciplines from natural, technical and social sciences yields in a heterogeneous field of activities with ambiguous technical terms. An ascertainment of principles of BT is required to classify yet undifferentiated patterns in nature-based production, facilitating their systematic implementation in aiming for sustained solutions on current challenges. With increasing research in biomimetic, attempts arise to capture nature‑based activities in manufacturing through schematic classifications. Yet, basic semantics representing the effective principles of BT in the manufacturing industry is lacking. The goal of this publication is to introduce a taxonomy of Biological Transformation in manufacturing based on its core principles Bio Inspiration, Bio Integration and Bio Interaction. Within the research project BioFusion 4.0, the taxonomy was developed and applied to classify technology innovations. The paper presents the taxonomy, its development and application in use cases.","Berkhahn, Magda;Kremer, Gerald;Riedelsheimer, Theresa;Lindow, Kai;Stark, Rainer",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,2023-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin;Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK,Biological transformation ;  Biomimicry ;  Manufacturing ;  Sustainability ;  Taxonomy ;  Use cases
Exploration of Professional English Teaching for Electrical Engineering Under the Dual Carbon Goal,"The “dual carbon” strategy to accelerate energy conservation and emission reduction is conducive to guiding green technology innovation, which is in line with the development direction of the future power system. Under this trend, China continues to promote the adjustment of industrial structure and energy structure, but there is no doubt that there is still a certain gap between China and experienced European and American countries in terms of technology. Therefore, it is necessary to perfect the teaching of English for electrical engineering majors and guide Chinese students to master electrical related professional English knowledge, and strengthen scientific research communication and study with other countries in the world. This paper aims at the professional English teaching mode research for electrical engineering under the background of “carbon peak and carbon neutrality”. Through teaching contents and methods, new teaching normal and other aspects of analysis and optimization, strengthen the combination of “dual carbon” knowledge and professional English, to lay the teaching theoretical basis for low carbon power industry of our country.","Wang, Haibing;Zhao, Anjie;Zheng, Tianhang;Sun, Weiqing",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2023-01-01,University of Shanghai for Science and Technology,ADDIE ;  Dual carbon ;  Electrical Engineering ;  Teaching exploration
Simulation study on influencing factors of green railway construction capacity of enterprise,"With the proposal of “carbon peak” and “carbon neutral” in China, the green development of railway industry is imperative. As an important participant in the development of the industry, railway engineering enterprises should strengthen the understanding and practice of green railway, and strengthen the green railway construction capacity. Therefore, from the characteristics of green railway construction capacity of enterprises based on literature research, the influencing factors of green railway construction capacity of enterprises were identified. Based on this, the system dynamics method was used to build a simulation model of the green railway construction capacity of enterprises. The sensitivity test of the key variables of the model was carried out to reveal the law of influence factors on the green railway construction capacity of enterprises. The simulation result basically matches with the actual situation of 2015～2020 national railway unit comprehensive energy consumption, verifying the effectiveness of the simulation method. Under the guidance of the model simulation results, effective suggestions for improving the green railway construction capacity of enterprises are put forward. The results show that the energy conservation and environmental protection technology innovation, policy support and personnel training level are three key factors of the green railway construction capacity of enterprises. Those have great positive effects on the construction ability of green railway enterprises from four aspects of technology, system, resource, and culture. Therefore, the research results can help enterprises strengthen their scientific understanding of green railway construction capacity, provide theoretical basis and reference for enterprises to improve their capacity of green railway construction and make corresponding plans.","Guo, Feng;Luo, Li;Gu, Jianglin",Journal,Journal of Railway Science and Engineering,2023-01-01,Central South University,green construction capability ;  green railway ;  railway engineering enterprise ;  simulation ;  system dynamics
Implications of Strategic Orientation on Sustainable Performance and Organizational Innovation: A Case of Manufacturing SMEs in Sub-Saharan Africa,"The ability of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt sustainability is predicated on several criteria, including purchasing and developing specialized resources. SMEs in emerging economies have great potential, and in terms of intensifying business performance, it is important to focus on strategic orientation. The influence of four strategic orientations on firm performance is examined in this study. The role of learning, entrepreneurial, technological, and environmental orientations within proactive strategic orientations in the manufacturing sector have been investigated. This study uses a survey questionnaire to collect data from four hundred and sixty-five sub-Saharan African manufacturing SMEs. The proactive strategic orientations were advantageous for organizational innovation (OI) and sustainable performance (SP); OI improves SP, and SP catalyzes OI, based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. This research provides information that may be utilized to advance conceptual and practical debates on manufacturing SMEs to be innovative and improve their sustainability performance to contribute to society, the environment, and the economy.","Onu, Peter;Pradhan, Anup;Mbohwa, Charles",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,2023-01-01,University of Johannesburg,Manufacturing SMEs ;  Proactiveness ;  Strategic orientations

Impact of Technological System’s Characteristics on the Machining Accuracy of Bearing Rings,"The article shows the influence of the technological system of an automated lathe, in particular cam chucks, on the accuracy of machining bearing rings for production conditions. The value of the deformation during machining, i.e., the non-circularity of the ring of a single row tapered roller bearing 32017X in outer diameter, was investigated. For the study, samples were selected that were processed under the same conditions directly in the production unit of PJSC “SKF Ukraine” without interference with the technological process. The use of replaceable floating cams in the chuck design was proposed to increase the accuracy and productivity of machining. Experimental studies have shown that the machined surface’s ovality depends on the chuck cams’ clamping force. The effectiveness of computer processing of statistical data on the accuracy control of engineering products was shown. Implementing machining accuracy control in production using the Minitab computer program was presented. It was proven that the quality of products is formed under the influence of the use of modern computer technologies at all stages of manufacturing and control of parts, which ensures research in a wide range of changes in technological parameters and comparison of individual studies with actual machining conditions on the machine, with the results of a sufficient level of reliability.","Halchuk, T.

Research on the Resilience Enhancement Path of Technology-Based SMEs Using Dynamic Fuzzy Cognitive Maps - Organizational Context and the Employee Loyalty Perspective,"Technology-based small and medium enterprises (SMEs) represent an important organizational aspect of technological innovation and economic growth. The complex and turbulent operating environment resulting from COVID-19 is a fatal threat to the survival and growth of technology-based SMEs. Based on the Wuli-Shili-Renli (WSR) methodology, this research uses dynamic fuzzy cognitive maps to analyze the mechanisms underlying the interactions among organizational context, employee loyalty and organizational resilience in the context of technology-based SMEs. The study also includes a sensitivity analysis, and the results of these analyses are mutually corroborated. The study finds that organizational context, employee loyalty and organizational resilience are correlated to varying degrees but also that organizational learning and sustained loyalty are weak, while normative organizational loyalty is relatively weak. This study enriches the research concerning organizational resilience and has practical value with regard to improving the organizational resilience of technology-based SMEs.","Ma, Teng;Zhao, Kexin",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,Hebei University of Science and Technology,dynamic fuzzy cognitive map ;  employee loyalty ;  organizational context ;  organizational resilience ;  Technology-based SMEs ;  Wuli-Shili-Renli system approach

Study on Key Technical Issues of Marine Environmental Safety Assessment of the Floating Nuclear Power Plant,"As a civil nuclear facility combining the organic innovation of marine engineering and nuclear engineering, the Floating Nuclear Power Plant (FNPP) is significantly different from the existing land-based fixed Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) because of the particularity of its shipborne platform and marine operating environment, although it has the general nuclear characteristics of the Small Modular Reactor (SMR). The existing national nuclear safety regulations and regulatory requirements are mainly based on onshore NPPs, so the applicability for the environmental safety assessment of the FNPP is limited. In this paper, through the study of the FNPP on the applicability of environmental safety supervision regulations and assessment requirements, the marine environmental characteristics and site suitability, the feasibility of radioactive waste treatment and discharge, the rationality of environmental monitoring scheme and implementation, the accident consequences and risk controllability, and the key technical issues of the marine environmental safety assessment of the FNPP are proposed, which can provide references for the environmental safety research and supervision of the FNPP.","Xu, Yueping;Liu, Lianghui;Zhang, Xiaofeng;Tao, Naigui",Conference Proceeding,Springer Proceedings in Physics,2023-01-01,Suzhou Nuclear Power Research Institute,Accident risk ;  FNPP ;  Marine environmental impact ;  Radioactive effluent ;  Transportable characteristics

Effective Feature Engineering Technique for Heart Disease Prediction With Machine Learning,"Heart failure is a chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. An efficient machine learning-based technique is needed to predict heart failure health status early and take necessary actions to overcome this worldwide issue. While medication is the primary treatment, exercise is increasingly recognized as an effective adjunct therapy in managing heart failure. In this study, we developed an approach to enhance heart failure detection based on patient health parameter data involving machine learning. Our study helps improve heart failure detection at its early stages to save patients' lives. We employed nine machine learning-based algorithms for comparison and proposed a novel Principal Component Heart Failure (PCHF) feature engineering technique to select the most prominent features to enhance performance. We optimized the proposed PCHF mechanism by creating a new feature set as an innovation to achieve the highest accuracy scores. The newly created dataset is based on the eight best-fit features. We conducted extensive experiments to assess the efficiency of several algorithms. The proposed decision tree method outperformed the applied machine learning models and other state-of-the-art studies, achieving a high accuracy score of 100%, which is admirable. All applied methods were successfully validated using the cross-validation technique.

Examining governance of post-earthquake reconstruction planning from an evolutionary resilience perspective,"Purpose: The politically laden nature of postdisaster recovery calls for more research on its governance, especially at the micro-scale. Apart from engineering-oriented frameworks, researchers need new theoretical underpinnings. This paper aims to review the development of the evolutionary resilience theory and use it as an analytical framework to evaluate the governance of post-earthquake reconstruction planning in China. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines how reconstruction planning is governed in the epicenter town of the 2008 Great Sichuan Earthquake, highlighting three key qualities of evolutionary resilience. The authors draw on site investigations, semistructured interviews and analysis of official and unpublished documents from various sources. Findings: This paper finds that despite the absence of specific resilience statements in reconstruction plans of the time, qualities of evolutionary resilience, including social connectedness, flexibility and innovation, were evident in a hybrid and contradictory reconstruction planning system. In this respect, resilience thinking appears in Chinese planning earlier than generally assumed. This paper suggests that this manifestation of resilience was the result of an instrumental utility in addressing socioeconomic uncertainties in the postdisaster environment and, thus, may not be systematic. Originality/value: This work enriches the understanding of recovery governance from an evolutionary resilience perspective where existing research is insufficient. It also offers ample practical guidance for similar cases in China and elsewhere.","Shao, Yiwen;Sun, Yao",Journal,International Journal of Disaster Resilience in the Built Environment,2023-01-01,Jinan University;Shenzhen University,Capability ;  Earthquakes ;  Evolutionary resilience ;  Governance ;  Local planning ;  Postdisaster reconstruction
Rethinking ‘responsibility’ in precision agriculture innovation: lessons from an interdisciplinary research team,"We examine the interactions, decisions, and evaluations of an interdisciplinary team of researchers tasked with developing an artificial intelligence-based agricultural decision support system that can provide farmers site-specific information about managing nutrients on their land. We answer the following research questions: (1) How does a relational perspective help an interdisciplinary team conceptualize ‘responsibility' in a project that develops precision agriculture (PA)? and (2) What are some lessons for a research team embarking on a similar interdisciplinary technology development project? We show that how RI is materialized in practice within an interdisciplinary research team can produce different understandings of responsibility, notions of measurement of ‘matter,’ and metrics of success. Future interdisciplinary projects should (1) create mechanisms for project members to see how power and privilege are exercised in the design of new technology and (2) harness social sciences as a bridge between natural sciences and engineering for organic and equitable collaborations.","Prutzer, Edward;Gardezi, Maaz;Rizzo, Donna M.;Emery, Mary;Merrill, Scott;Ryan, Benjamin E.K.;Oikonomou, Panagiotis D.;Alvez, Juan P.;Adereti, Damilola T.;Anjum, Rubaina;Badireddy, Appala R.;Bhattarai, Dwarika;Brugler, Skye;Cheney, Nicholas;Clay, David;Clay, Sharon;Dadkhah, Ali;Faulkner, Joshua W.;Joshi, Deepak R.;Koliba, Christopher;McMaine, John;Michael, Semhar;Musayev, Sardorbek;O’Neil-Dunne, Jarlath;Pinder, George;Ricketts, Taylor;Schroth, Andrew W.;Turnbull, Scott;Zia, Asim",Journal,Journal of Responsible Innovation,2023-01-01,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;University of Nebraska–Lincoln;South Dakota State University;The University of Vermont,artificial intelligence ;  interdisciplinary ;  precision agriculture ;  Responsible innovation

Translating computational innovations into reality: focus on the users!,"Computer-aided/AI-driven tools are increasing being developed for use with digital pathology images. Whether a given scheme makes it into clinical use depends on a multitude of factors, perhaps most importantly whether it has an impact on a clinician's decision-making process thus on patient care and outcomes. To have a positive impact, clinical decision support tools must be well-integrated into routine clinical workflows and thus require assessment from a human factors perspective that includes attention to ways these tools impact users' perceptual and cognitive information processing mechanisms. Methods from implementation sciences (the scientific study of methods to promote systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services) can also be used to prepare users for and then assess the impact of introducing these tools into the clinical workflow.

Experiences and Observations for Technology Transition in the USSF,"The pace of innovation in the space community is accelerating. Even with limited resources and more complex, disaggregated missions on the horizon, the opportunity for technology development continues to grow exponentially. This gives an opportunity for the Space Force to accelerate the transformation of the overall architecture-which will require equally rapid technology transition from Research and Development (R&D) to production and operations. R&D organizations are often chartered to perform revolutionary research (as opposed to evolutionary research) meaning there isn't always the key advocate/warfighter or program for transition identified upfront. Unfortunately, this often results in the 'technology transition valley of death' where innovative minimally mature systems aren't adopted into the future enterprise and those potential capabilities are lost. Successful transition of a new technology or new capability to acquisition and operations requires warfighter demand, building partnerships, and securing funding. In addition, other key enablers to rapid transition include rapid prototyping and development, ridesharing, and improved systems integrations processes. To bridge the valley of death, we'll need to rely on these enablers prove the 'art of the possible' to potential stakeholders. This paper will address both successes and challenges of technology and capability transition from R&D organizations, using real-world examples of lessons learned. One such example is the ongoing evolution of the AFRL built EAGLE program to Space Systems Command Innovation and Prototyping Acquisition Delta's Long Duration Propulsive ESPA program, both of which are flown by the DoD Space Test Program. It will discuss the importance of not only looking at the systems engineering of the space vehicle, but system integration with ground systems and how other rideshare payloads play a critical role to the success of not just a single mission, but the collective missions that will build our future architecture.","Straight, Stanley D.;O'Donnell, Kara;Herrin, Sabrina",Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2023-01-01,"Aerospace Corporation, USA;USSF Space Systems Command",
"New Information Model MGRM (1,n) Based on Vector Continued Fractions and Reciprocal Accumulation Generation Operation","In engineering applications and scientific research, the parameters of multivariable research systems affect and restrict each other, resulting in inaccurate descriptions of the established analysis models and low accuracy of analysis data. Based on vector continued fraction theory and reciprocal accumulation generation, a multivariable grey MGRM (1, n) model is established in this paper. The model uses extrapolation and the trapezoidal formula of rational interpolation and numerical integration to construct the background value of the model. A component of the variable data generated by reciprocal accumulation is taken as the initial value of the solution of the grey differential equation. Through experimental analysis and comparative research, the results show that the non-equidistant multivariable innovation model MGRM (1, n) based on vector continued fraction theory and reciprocal accumulation has the characteristics of high accuracy and ease of use. The model does not need to consider the monotonicity of the data sequence, which has significant application prospects and is of theoretical value to the scientific and engineering fields","Yang, Xiaogao;Ding, Deqiong;Zhang, Xiaozhong",Journal,IAENG International Journal of Applied Mathematics,2023-01-01,Hunan University of Finance and Economics;Hunan University of Arts and Science,Innovation model ;  Multivariable grey model ;  Reciprocal accumulation generation ;  Vector continued fractions

Database Architecture Design of Precious Metal Materials for Material Genetic Engineering,"There are eight elements in precious metals, including platinum group, gold and silver. Platinum group contains six elements, namely platinum, palladium, rhodium, osmium, iridium and ruthenium. Precious metals are scarce metals in the earth, especially platinum group metal resources. China is heavily dependent on imports, so its price is not only expensive but also greatly influenced by external factors. Precious metals also have irreplaceable physical and chemical properties, mainly used in large-scale inte-grated circuits, communications, new energy, biomedicine, environmental governance, aerospace, national defense and military and other high-end equipment and high-tech fields, known as the ""first high-tech metal"" and ""industrial vitamin"". It is an indispensable raw material in the field of national defense and high-tech. Therefore, these areas have high requirements for quality levels, performance indicators and batch consistency of precious metal materials, as well as technical research and development capabilities and efficiency of relevant material or product suppliers. At present, the traditional ""empirical"" and ""trial and error"" mode leads to high re-search and development cost and long research and development cycle, which seriously restricts the rapid development of new materials industry. Especially for the precious metal new materials industry, there are not only because of the high price of precious metal raw materials, large consumption, large process loss and ""can not afford to use"", but also because of the high application performance requirements, research and development difficulty, low success rate and ""low efficiency"" dilemma. The Materials Genome Project proposed by America in 2011 and The Chinese version of ""Material Genetic Engineering"" launched in China in 2015 had opened up a for-ward-looking research and development of a new path. Through the combination of computing, experiment, data technology and theory, a new model of ""data-driven"" intelligent prediction of materials research and development was established, and the traditional experimental trial-and-error method was reformed. Finally, the strategic goal of ""double halving"" was achieved, which was to shorten the research and development cycle by half and reduce the research and development cost by half. The ""data-driven"" research and development model was completely different from the ""experiment-driven"" or ""computing-driven"" research and development model. Based on a large amount of data, it used machine learning and data mining technology to establish the relationship between ""composition, structure, process and performance"" more quickly, accurately and cheaply. In this way, material properties could be predicted quickly and new materials could be discovered. Therefore, the data-driven model could effectively solve the dilemma of precious metal new material research and development. In 2018, based on the resource endowment and industrial advantages of rare and precious metal materials, Yunnan Province initiated a major scientific and technological project of rare and precious metal materials genetic engineering. Sino-Precious Metal Holding Co., Ltd. combined several units have made progress in building a genetic engineering database platform for rare metal materials, developing big data technology and establishing metadata standards. It was expected that under the new model of ""data-driven"" research and development, the key materials and technologies of precious metals would get rapid breakthrough and innovation, so as to provide important support for the rapid development of the precious metal new materials industry.","Zhang, Aimin;Wang, Zhuo;Liu, Yiqin;Lu, Yongchao;Chong, Xiaoyu;Chen, Li",Journal,Xiyou Jinshu/Chinese Journal of Rare Metals,2023-01-01,"Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Kunming University of Science and Technology;Central South University;Kunming Precious Materials & Technology Co.

Conductive microfibers from microfluidics for flexible electronics,"Flexible electronics are one newly-developing electronic technology, which are also known as elastic electronics or soft electronics. The main feature of flexible electronics is that they can maintain circuit function under bending or stretching conditions. Since the first flexible electronic device was the patterned copper with polyimide base in 1960s, the flexible electronic technology has emerged. Later, with the development of electronic material researches, flexible electronics have gradually become one of the hot spots in the interdisciplinary field. From 1970s to 1990s, soft and flexible electronic skins and low-cost printable sensors were extensively developed, expanding the definition of flexible electronics. Nowadays, flexible electronics have made great progress in the next generation of electronic devices with high electrical properties and elastic mechanical response, and have demonstrated unique advantages in portability, wearability, flexibility and mechanical stability. Over the past few decades, flexible electronics have shown great potential in a variety of applications, including flexible health monitors, smart chemical and biological sensors, flexible energy storage/collection devices, wearable electronics, etc. Fiber materials are commonly basic components of flexible electronic systems, which are usually defined as continuous filaments or elongated objects. Fibers are common in nature, for example, spider web is composed of filament-like fibers, and silkworm cocoon is composed of silk fibers. Some other fibrous substances, such as blood vessels and nerve bundles in human body, as well as plant rhizomes and vines, have been playing their respective functions in specific fields. These naturally occurring fibrous materials have greatly inspired researchers’ interest in developing artificial fibers. With the appearance of man-made fibers derived from cotton and lignocellulose, the demand for fibrous materials from the public is increasing day by day. Nowadays, to realize the popular value of multifunctional fibrous materials in industries, a variety of methods have been proposed to achieve the mass production of microfibers, including electrospinning, melt spinning, dry spinning, wet spinning, microfluidic spinning, etc. Among them, microfluidic spinning technology is the most representative preparation method, because it can realize the precise control of the fiber component and structure. Through microfluidic spinning technology, fibers with diverse morphologies, structures and composition have been developed, including helix, Janus, core-shell, multicomponent, spindle-knott, etc. Benefitting from the advantages of light weight, remarkable flexibility and strong weaving ability from these fiber materials, they have been widely applied in fields with great application prospects ranging from traditional textile industry to biomedical industry, including tissue engineering, sensor detection, bioelectronics, bionic water collection, etc. In recent years, with the deepening of theoretical research and technological innovation, microfluidic spinning technology has been successfully combined with conductive materials, and is regarded as an economical and powerful tool to manufacture flexible conductive microfibers. A series of conductive microfibers with various structures have been developed by adjusting the relevant parameters of microfluidic chips, thus promoting the application of conductive microfibers in the field of flexible electronics. This review summarizes the research progress of microfluidic spinning technology in the fabrication of conductive microfibers and its application in flexible electronics. First, the research progress of microfluidic spinning technology in the field of conductive microfiber preparation was summarized, including solid structures, core-shell structures, and multi-component structures. Then, applications in flexible electronics covering from sensing, energy storage to tissue engineering were summarized. Last but not least, the challenges and development directions of conductive microfibers from microfluidics for flexible electronics in the future were also discussed.","Guo, Jiahui;Wang, Yu;Xu, Dongyu;Zhao, Yuanjin",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics;Medical School of Nanjing University,electrical conductivity ;  flexible electronics ;  micro/nano structures ;  microfiber ;  microfluidic spinning
Designing of a Flipped STEM Classroom Engineering-Based Module: Fuzzy Delphi Approach,"The National Innovation System found that research in Jordan did not contribute sufficiently to economic growth and to solving real-world challenges, particularly those related to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). This was attributed to several reasons, including the inability of educational curricula to guide students in dealing with real-world issues. In addition, education in Jordan is content-intensive and primary school children lack the time to build functional competencies such as problem-solving. Therefore, it was necessary to adopt an approach allowing students to learn the theoretical content on their own while allocating class time to practice problemsolving activities with their teacher and peers. To address this gap, this study aimed at designing an engineering-based module for a flipped STEM classroom to aid grade seven students in developing their problem-solving abilities based on Merrill’s first principles of instruction as an instructional design model. To generate the module components and aspects, semi-structured interviews were performed with 9 subject matter experts. Then, 29 experts responded and offered a consensus on what was reached in the previous interview. A total of 36 items were discussed by the expert panel using the Likert 7-point scale in the fuzzy Delphi approach. The five-module aspects namely; the form of STEM integration, the assessment, the resources, and the pre-class and in-class instructional activities, were determined. This research will usher in a new era for the Ministry of Education. in planning and teaching integrated STEM disciplines in line with Jordan’s vision 2025 to equip all learners with 21stcentury skills such as problem-solving to enhance education standards to international levels.","Naser, Khadijeh;Alamassi, Sherin;Shana, Zuhrieh;Yousef, Jihan;Halili, Siti Hajar",Journal,International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies,2023-01-01,Al Ain University;Universiti Malaya,flipped classroom ;  Fuzzy Delphi method ;  Merrill’s first principles of instruction ;  primary students ;  problem-solving skills
"Understanding Frugal Engineering Process for Frugal Innovations: Socially Conscious Designs for Homeless Individuals, A Case Study","This paper presents the results of a case study regarding understanding frugal engineering design and process methodology through the fabrication of wearable tent-jackets for the protection of homeless individuals. Frugal innovations are being investigated for socially conscious products, but an understanding of frugal engineering methodology remains unexplored and is the focus of this research. Multiple socio-economic drivers are resulting in a lack of access to basic human needs such as housing, healthcare, etc. across the globe. Frugal engineering presents an equitable and practical engineering approach to address these challenges and merits exploring a methodology for innovations. In this paper, an origami-based design approach was employed to create a functional prototype of a tent for shelter that can be morphed into a wearable weather protection jacket. We call it a “wearable tent”. The prototype was successfully fabricated using a reusable material that is used abundantly in the construction industry. The functional prototype was tested for its efficacy and effectiveness in terms of weight, strength, and ease of switching between the two configurations. The results suggest a potential model that could be explored and applied for socially conscious engineering design solutions for such severely resource-constrained cases for disadvantaged communities with future potential for digitally disadvantaged enterprises.","Bapat, Salil;Fischer, Lukas;Digwa, Christoph;Malshe, Ajay P.",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2023-01-01,Purdue University;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover,design methodology ;  Frugal engineering ;  manufacturing ;  socially conscious designs
"Innovation, Finance, and Tech Competition","The focus of competitions among big countries is the economic one, while the focus of economic competition is tech competition, and the focus of technological competition is the market share and innova-tion ability. Over the past 40 years, experience has shown that China’s innovation relies heavily on reform and opening up. Since the reform and opening up, China’s scientific and technological innovation is more embodied in customer-centered innovation and efficiency-driven inno-vation. Compared with the United States, Europe, and other Western countries, China has made relatively less achievements in engineering technology innovation and scientific research-based innovation. For this, the following three points should be considered to deal with the tech-nological competition and cooperation between China and the United States: First, we should shift the focus of our scientific and technolog-ical innovation and establish an independent and controllable innovation system to ensure national security. Second, more policies should be adopted to encourage more enterprises and countries to cooperate with China and enhance its independent innovation capacity. Third, while promoting China’s competitive enterprises to go global and foreign advanced technologies to be imported, we should ensure the domestic market share of Chinese technologies and provide necessary market demand so as to stimulate original technological progress.","Huang, Qifan;Zhang, Xiaohui;Xue, Lan;Peng, Wensheng;Ju, Jiandong",Book,Tsinghua PBCSF Chief Economists Forum: Turbulent 2022,2023-01-01,Tsinghua University;China International Capital Corporation Limited,Cooperation ;  Economic competition ;  Innovation ;  Technological competition

Best Practices in Construction 4.0 - Catalysts for digital Innovations (Part I),"Digital transformation in the AEC industry (Ar-chitecture, Engineering and Construction) is a key driver to en-hance technical innovation in the branch and adds dynamic to all work processes and methods. A more differentiated under-standing of the responsible use of innovative technologies aims not only towards increased sustainability and more efficient building life cycles but also recognizing the unintended effects such as artificial intelligence (AI). The study is part of a larger primary research on Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) in Construction 4.0; it identifies, analyses, and systema-tically evaluates key factors of a sustainable digital transfor-mation, especially in the traditionally small-scale construction industry - one in which there can be no standardized procedu-re. The study uses interdisciplinary literature and data research and expert interviews. The qualitative method enables a criti-cal-reflexive analysis of the key factors of a meaningful and sustainable implementation of innovative technologies in con-struction. Application examples show possible approaches - some of which are implemented as prototypes - and provide guidance for small to medium-sized companies. The study out-lines the necessary steps for companies to define their own potential fields of application and find suitable methods. Anot-her aim of the study is to take stock of the acceptance of new technologies by comparing different perspectives from ex-perts. The study results show new perspectives in the transformation of the construction industry. They show that digital transformation in construction 4.0 has great potential for an economical, efficient construction life cycle, but requires the responsible, sensible use of innovative technologies.","Weber-Lewerenz, Bianca;Traverso, Marzia",Trade Journal,Bauingenieur,2023-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,

Using an open-ended socio-technical design challenge for entrepreneurship education in a first-year engineering course,"Engineering graduates must be prepared with sound technical knowledge and a range of 21st century competencies and professional skills such as creativity, interdisciplinary collaboration, communication, and innovation to successfully solve today’s complex, global problems. Equally important is a deep appreciation of the degree to which technological solutions are situated within the context of human and natural environments. Despite calls from the National Academy of Engineering and several professional organizations to broaden engineering education to embrace these skills, most engineering programs persistently focus on the importance of technical skills. This paper describes an open-ended team-based design challenge that integrates entrepreneurial-minded (EM) skill development into an interdisciplinary first-year engineering course that approaches engineering from a socio-technical perspective. The challenge was implemented in two simultaneous first-year classes (n = 49), with the goal of fostering students’ broad professional skills and their appreciation of the links between engineering technologies and societal context. The action research study used a quasi-experimental design with convenience sampling and no control group to explore students’ self-perceived entrepreneurial-minded (EM) skills development. Data were collected with a retrospective questionnaire comprised of a series of 5-point Likert-type questions that asked students to assess the development of their EM skills in all three areas of the EM framework: Exhibit Curiosity, Establish Connections, and Create Value (the “3C” framework). Results indicate that students felt they developed EM skills in all three areas of the 3C Framework, with more fully developed skills in the Establish Connections and Create Value categories. Overall, this study suggests the effectiveness of using open-ended, socio-technical engineering design challenges for developing skills that will better prepare students to work collaboratively on complex and interdisciplinary problems they will face in their professional careers.","DeWaters, Jan;Kotla, Bhavana",Journal,Frontiers in Education,2023-01-01,Clarkson University;Purdue Polytechnic Institute,design thinking ;  entrepreneurial minded learning ;  first-year engineering ;  interdisciplinary-academia ;  open-ended problem solving ;  pedagogical innovation ;  socio-technical
Text mining-based patent analysis on informatization for construction management of hydraulic engineering projects,"[Objective] With the rapid economic and technological development in China, information technologies, such as big data and cloud computing, are being employed for the construction management of hydraulic engineering projects. However, the unbalanced technological development and the disconnection between information technology and the actual construction process still exist. Thus, exploring the research and development in the technological field is crucial. Previous studies have examined the development status of specific information technology in hydraulic engineering informatization. However, research and development status were not systematically demonstrated using quantitative analysis. Patents are critical technological achievements for hydraulic engineering informatization, providing comprehensive technical information for technological exchange and innovation. This research aims to reveal the technology layout and prospects in hydraulic engineering informatization from the patent analysis perspective. [Method] This study proposes a text mining-based patent analysis method to examine the patents on hydraulic engineering informatization collected from the IncoPat global patent database. Initially, the patent application trend, application regions, applicants, and international patent classification (IPC) codes were explored through descriptive statistical analysis. Subsequently, a word frequency analysis was conducted on patents' titles and technical efficacy, and word clouds were drawn to preliminarily observe their primary themes and functions. Furthermore, text mining was utilized for clustering patent topics. The topic intensity and evolution characteristics of different categories of patents were analyzed based on the clustering results. [Results] Results show that China has entered a period of technological development since 2013, and the number of patents has increased rapidly since 2019. The patent applicants are mainly in provinces where enterprises, universities, and research institutes are concentrated. Enterprises and individuals apply for 77.8% of the patents and emphasize the application value of technology, whereas universities and scientific research institutes contribute to 24.2% of the patents and place great importance on technological innovation. The IPC codes of these patents mainly include hydraulic engineering (E02B), data processing system or method (G06Q), electronic digital processing technology (G06F), and hydrological information monitoring (G01F), revealing interdisciplinary characteristics. The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model divides the patents into nine technical topics corresponding to four application categories. Among these categories, the number of patents for ""equipment and hardware"" is the largest and rapidly increasing, indicating promising development prospects for related technologies. Next, the ""comprehensive management system"" serves as a crucial integrated application, with steadily improving research and development in recent years. In addition, patent applications for ""information monitoring"" show an increasing trend overall, but few aim to monitor the construction process, indicating that construction monitoring should be considered an important direction in future research. Moreover, the number of patents for ""data analysis"" has been low for a long time, reflecting the urgency to improve the data analysis ability of construction management in hydraulic engineering projects. [Conclusions] These findings systematically reveal the technology layout, development status, and application prospects of hydraulic engineering informatization in China, providing research method support and empirical reference for future technology development and patent application. This study also recommends improving the capability of construction monitoring for realizing the overall perception system, promoting the application of big data analysis in the construction management of hydraulic engineering projects, and encouraging industry-university-institute collaboration.","Xiong, Qian;Tang, Wenzhe",Journal,Qinghua Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Tsinghua University,2023-01-01,State Key Laboratory of Hydro Science and Engineering,construction management ;  hydraulic engineering ;  informatization ;  latent Dirichlet allocation ;  patent analysis ;  technology layout ;  text mining

Current Trends in Attrition Considerations of Graduate Engineering Students in the United States,"Available attrition statistics for graduate engineering students do not adequately inform current attrition research because they focus on degree completion rather than attrition or early departure; aggregate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students; and reflect out-of-date data. While recently some work has begun to explore doctoral attrition qualitatively, the purpose of this study is to describe current trends in graduate engineering students' consideration of departure from their programs of study by capturing current numerical data specific to engineering about students' recent attrition considerations. This is important because, since the last studies were conducted, higher education systems have experienced a global pandemic, economic downturn, and sociopolitical turmoil in the United States. Graduate students (n = 2204) in the U.S. completed a survey. The sample includes master's (n = 535) and doctorate (n = 1646) degree-seeking students from 27 engineering disciplines and includes U.S. domestic and international populations. A majority of students considered leaving their degree program in the month before they took the survey: nearly 70% of Ph.D. and 39% of master's students, while 31% of Ph.D. and 16% of master's students seriously considered leaving their program without their degree. Descriptive statistics provide early departure considerations by engineering discipline, gender identity, race/ethnicity, nationality, and year in program by degree sought. Comparisons between groups are presented for gender, nationality, and career stage. It is essential to have an updated and discipline-specific benchmark of attrition considerations for continued engineering education research purposes, for mentorship, and for administrative purposes. Early departure from graduate school remains a threat to innovation and broadening participation in engineering and the professoriate.","Bahnson, Matthew;Berdanier, Catherine G.P.",Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2023-01-01,Penn State College of Engineering,attrition ;  demographics ;  graduate student ;  Master's ;  PhD
Venom biotechnology: casting light on nature’s deadliest weapons using synthetic biology,"Venoms are complex chemical arsenals that have evolved independently many times in the animal kingdom. Venoms have attracted the interest of researchers because they are an important innovation that has contributed greatly to the evolutionary success of many animals, and their medical relevance offers significant potential for drug discovery. During the last decade, venom research has been revolutionized by the application of systems biology, giving rise to a novel field known as venomics. More recently, biotechnology has also made an increasing impact in this field. Its methods provide the means to disentangle and study venom systems across all levels of biological organization and, given their tremendous impact on the life sciences, these pivotal tools greatly facilitate the coherent understanding of venom system organization, development, biochemistry, and therapeutic activity. Even so, we lack a comprehensive overview of major advances achieved by applying biotechnology to venom systems. This review therefore considers the methods, insights, and potential future developments of biotechnological applications in the field of venom research. We follow the levels of biological organization and structure, starting with the methods used to study the genomic blueprint and genetic machinery of venoms, followed gene products and their functional phenotypes. We argue that biotechnology can answer some of the most urgent questions in venom research, particularly when multiple approaches are combined together, and with other venomics technologies.","Lüddecke, Tim;Paas, Anne;Harris, Richard J.;Talmann, Lea;Kirchhoff, Kim N.;Billion, André;Hardes, Kornelia;Steinbrink, Antje;Gerlach, Doreen;Fry, Bryan G.;Vilcinskas, Andreas",Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2023-01-01,Syngenta Crop Protection AG;The University of Queensland;Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen;Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME;BMBF Junior Research Group in Infection Research “ASCRIBE”;LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics (LOEWE-TBG),biodiscovery ;  biosensors ;  CRISPR ;  functional genomics ;  heterologous expression ;  organoids ;  RNAi ;  synthetic biology

"Research on the Influence of Technology Innovation, Consumption Innovation on Foreign Trade Upgrading Based on VAR Model","In view of the relationship between technology innovation, consumption innovation and foreign trade upgrading, selecting the relevant data from 2000 to 2020，it is found that technological innovation drives consumption innovation by promoting changes in consumption patterns and consumption levels, making consumption more personalized, knowledgeable, intelligent and fast, which is the key and core of driving the upgrading of foreign trade. Through the empirical test of VAR model，it is found that there is a significant positive correlation between China's trade with foreign countries and the consumption level and structure of foreign residents in the long run. But the innovation of my country's high-tech, high-value-added products cannot keep up with the constant changes in foreign consumer demand, which restricts the adjustment and optimization of my country's export product structure, and hinders my country's foreign trade transformation and upgrading.

Detecting Sensor Faults and Outliers in Industrial Internet of Things,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing in nearly every industry. People are adopting and using IoT technology in every facet of their lives, ranging from civilian use (e.g., smart homes, hobbies, fitness, and health monitoring), to military (e.g., battlefield surveillance systems) to industrial (i.e., industrial automation, plant and equipment monitoring) etc. More and more companies are introducing IoT technology innovations to increase efficiency. In the resources industry specifically, IoT can technically be used to imitate human behaviour and separate or even eliminate human and operational equipment interaction, hence keeping people safer. Another vital IoT offering in the mining space is equipment reliability. Maintenance and engineering teams are switching from the traditional time-based maintenance approach to predictive maintenance using IoT. Therefore, a key deliverable from IoT technology in mining is to have accurate and reliable data to assist management with making informed decisions. In the IoT process chain, there are several influences that can cause sensor faults and result in erroneous data. The data can also contain anomalies or outliers.

Intelligent Recording Live Broadcast of Practical Training Based on AI Technology,"At present, the use of artificial intelligence in the front line of teaching has begun to take shape. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has triggered a new wave, and the innovation of science and technology has brought about the diversification of teaching methods. Fragmentary learning is everywhere all the time, online and offline are organically integrated, and knowledge breakpoints inside and outside the classroom are seamlessly linked up. Our classroom is changing with each passing day. This paper introduces AI technology to carry out the research of intelligent recording live broadcast of practical training, aiming at the problem of high picture stutter rate in the current process of recording live broadcast of practical training, which affects the subjective experience. Aiming at the practical training courseware with poor compatibility, the courseware is converted into H5 form courseware. On this basis, the data in the courseware is encoded and decoded. Through the real-time processing of guidance and control, the synchronization of video and audio recording, playing, and switching is realized. By using AI technology, live subtitle bars are automatically output. Through the comparative analysis of the application effect of the new recording live broadcast method, it is concluded that this method can effectively reduce the picture stutter rate and bring a better subjective experience to users.","Yu, Changle;Li, Wenwen;Wan, Jia;Xu, Dahai;Bu, Jin",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023-01-01,Ltd,AI technology ;  Intelligence ;  Live broadcast ;  Practice ;  Recording ;  Training

Comparing the Use of Virtual Models vs. Fieldwork in Developing Geomatics Skills in Undergraduate Engineering Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Undergraduate students enrolled in Civil Engineering, Architecture, and Urban Planning (CAU) must develop competencies in Geomatics and Topography (G&T) as part of their learning process. During this time, theoretical concepts are traditionally taught with field practice using specialized tools such as a theodolite, laser level, and total station. Due to the environmental restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional field practice (TFP) was suspended, preventing access to equipment and study areas. The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Virtual Reality (VR), have been explored in the last decade for educational purposes. This paper studies the benefits of using these tools for developing G&T skills. This research aimed to assess students' learning outcomes using a traditional G&T teaching method and a new methodology based on Virtual Field Practice (VFP) for CAU students. The methodology provides a virtual study area for the CAU student by integrating point clouds derived from photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning. It also assesses their learning results and compares them against a control group using a validated instrument. Findings suggest continuing with fieldwork for a greater understanding and correct application of G&T concepts by students, and using virtual models as an efficient way to complement the acquisition of spatial information in the teaching-learning process. Until the publication of this article, we found no evidence in the literature at the undergraduate level of applying exercises like those proposed.","Yeomans-Galli, Laura M.;Vela-Coiffier, M.

Students' Understanding of the Mean Through Technology-Mediated Analysis of Real-Life Data,"This study conducts cognitive research in digital environments to bridge students' understanding of the mean and the use of technology for data analysis. By activating definitions, properties, arguments, representations, and algorithms of the mean, this study approaches the questions: (1) How does using Microsoft Excel affect the configuration of students' meaning of the mean? (2) What semiotic conflicts are associated with using Microsoft Excel and a real dataset? We applied an open-ended questionnaire to 17 engineering students taking the introductory Probability and Statistics course that integrates Microsoft Excel as a didactic strategy. The data collection used convenience sampling with the students enrolled in the fall of 2022. We found that technology for data analysis is more than a complementary tool for students because it allows them to express their reasoning through virtual representations. The analysis yielded new semiotic conflicts in students' calculation of the mean. The data suggests that the tendency to make calculation errors increases when data analysis involves raw data extracted from real life.","Padilla, Elia;Campos, Esmeralda",Conference Proceeding,"2023 Future of Educational Innovation-Workshop Series Data in Action, FEIWS 2023",2023-01-01,Universidad Anáhuac México;Tecnológico de Monterrey,educational innovation ;  higher education ;  measures of central tendency ;  onto-semiotic approach ;  real-data statistics ;  statistical thinking ;  student understanding
"Facades-as-a-Service: Systemic managerial, financial, and governance innovation to enable a circular economy for buildings. Lessons learnt from a full-scale pilot project in the Netherlands","Introduction: The challenge of the energy transition in the built environment has, in recent years, been exacerbated by rising awareness of the material resource limitations we face on the path towards sustainable development. In this context the concepts of Circular Economy (CE) and Product-Service Systems (PSS) have emerged as potentially complementary industrial and business strategies to overcome the interdependent material resource and clean energy challenges. Research significance: Research in the field of circular and PSS-based construction frequently centres on the design and engineering of products, mainly through technical strategies such as design for disassembly and adaptability, and the use of the different “R’s” (Reuse, Repair, Remanufacturing, etc.) to extend and/or reset the service lives of building materials and components. Such an approach often ignores the fact that these strategies require changes in the management, financing, and governance aspects of products and therefore buildings, throughout their entire service-lives. This paper will focus on the systemic administrative (i.e. management, financing, and governance) challenges of the circular and servitisation transitions in the building and construction sector, to enable products which are “Circular by Design”, to effectively support regenerative processes. Research question: The paper asks how traditional building products’ management, financing, and governance processes prevent or delay the implementation of CE and PSS models. It explores the demand side’s perspective (commissioners, building owners and facility managers), taking a systemic view to the search for new practical, strategic, and scalable administrative models. Methodology: The research method applies the DAS model (De Jonge et al., 2009; Van der Zwart et al., 2009; den Heijer, 2011; den Heijer et al., 2016) to data gathered from focus group discussion and co-design sessions involving multidisciplinary teams of experts from both academy and industry, as well as literature. The research was conducted within the context of the TU Delft Facades-as-a-Service full-scale pilot project. Results: The research has shown that, while PSS models to enable material circularity can be partially implemented within the current managerial, financial, and governance framework, this implementation is not efficient, effective, or scalable. This is because standard modes of operation in these disciplines are misaligned with that goal. The practical barriers resulting from this misalignment increase the complexity, risk perception, and therefore cost of PSS alternatives, and thus prevent their organic adoption despite increasing market interest. Recommendations are made for policymakers, financiers, suppliers, and building owners to overcome these barriers.","Azcárate-Aguerre, Juan F.;den Heijer, Alexandra C.;Arkesteijn, Monique H.;Vergara d’Alençon, Luz María;Klein, Tillmann",Journal,Frontiers in Built Environment,2023-01-01,"Faculteit Bouwkunde van de TU Delft;Afdeling Management in the Built Environment, TU Delft",building envelope ;  circular economy ;  energy retrofit ;  performance contracting ;  product-service systems ;  systemic innovation
Synergies Between Geomatics and Biological Sciences for the Creation of New Virtual Materials for Teaching Taphonomy,"The combined application of photogrammetric and geometric morphometric tools to the study of archaeological remains is not usually addressed in the academic programme of undergraduate degrees, which results in the consequent lack of technological knowledge of future graduates. This research proposes the inclusion of a recently developed approach based on the techniques and tools of geomatics engineering and advanced statistical analysis in bachelor’s degrees in Archaeology, that aim at providing students with advance skills in several free/open software pieces, which might ultimately be particularly useful during working or research activities. The method uses 3D model visualisation techniques and statistical analysis based on geometric morphometrics to improve zooarchaeological/taphonomic studies through the investigation of bone surface modifications. The work presents a detailed description of the methodology to be reproduced by students, as well as a specific workflow for the generation of didactic material. The activity has been designed in a way that all the necessary material can be provided through the Moodle institutional learning platform. The comprehension of geomatics and geometric morphometric techniques and their application to archaeological problems will help students address questions of the human past from a more objective quantitative perspective. On one hand, this might help students improve their critical thinking, and, on the other hand, this new knowledge could help future archaeologist face the challenges of the labour market.","Maté-González, Miguel Ángel;Aramendi, Julia;Sáez Blázquez, Cristina;Arriaza, Mari Carmen;Yravedra, José",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Educational Technology,2023-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Universidad Complutense de Madrid;Universidad de Salamanca;Universidad de León,archaeology ;  Educational innovation ;  geometric morphometrics ;  photogrammetry ;  taphonomy
Application and Progress of Cultured Models of Gallbladder Carcinoma,"Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a malignant tumor of the biliary system that is aggressive, difficult to detect early, and has a low surgical resection rate and poor prognosis. Ap-propriate in vitro growth models are expected to focus on the study of the biological behavior and assess treatment effects. Nonetheless, cancer initiation, progression, and invasion include spatiotemporal changes and changes in the cell microenvironment intracellular communication, and intracellular molecules, making the development of in vitro growth models very challenging. Recent advances in bioma-terial methods and tissue engineering, particularly advances in bioprinting procedures, have paved the way for advances in the creative phase of in vitro cancer research. To date, an increasing number of cultured models of gallbladder disease have emerged, such as two-dimensional (2D) GBC growth cell cultures, three-dimensional (3D) GBC growth cell cul-tures, xenograft models, and 3D bioprinting methods. These models can serve as stronger platforms, focusing on tumor growth initiation, the association with the microenvironment, angiogenesis, motility, aggression, and infiltration. Bioprint-ed growth models can also be used for high-throughput drug screening and validation, as well as translational opportunities for individual cancer therapy. This study focused on the exploration, progress, and significance of the development of GBC cultural models. We present our views on the short-comings of existing models, investigate new innovations, and plan future improvements and application possibilities for cancer models.","Xing, Jiali;Ding, Peiwen;Wan, Xueshuai;Xu, Gang;Mao, Yilei;Sang, Xinting;Du, Shunda;Yang, Huayu",Journal,Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology,2023-01-01,West China School of Medicine/West China Hospital of Sichuan University;Peking Union Medical College Hospital;Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,2D gallbladder cancer cell culture ;  3D bioprinting technology ;  3D gallbladder cancer cell culture ;  Gallbladder cancer ;  Xenograft model

It is able to digitally present design solutions through computer-aided design technology, thus inspiring designers' design inspiration. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of computer-aided design technology on innovation in art and design. This paper is based on the study of increased development education and the current teaching situation of art and design in a private university. The experimental results show that most students find the most useful professional course during their school years is the computer design course. Through analysis and research, problems were found, and well proposed countermeasures on improving the quality of art and design education in private colleges and universities to make art and design education more perfect and more adaptable.","Wang, Zijia",Conference Proceeding,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems, ICICACS 2023",2023-01-01,Changchun Humanities and Sciences College,art and design ;  computer-aided ;  design innovation ;  university education
Promoting Sustainability and Energy Efficiency in Higher Education Through the Optimized Management of Geothermal Resources,"The present research shows a novel approach for the acquisition of specific competences related to energy efficiency in the Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering by the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) when designing shallow geothermal installations.

The Research on Computer On-line Teaching Simulation System Based on OBE Concept,"As a mature educational concept centered on comprehensively improving students’ ability and quality, oriented by improving teaching results, and following the sustainable development, OBE thought has a pivotal guiding significance level of school education practice. With the comprehensive information technology development, the demand for computer network technology talents is increasing day by day, the current teaching mode of computer network technology is difficult to adapt to the modern education form, innovation research is not deep enough, and there is still a big gap with the objective requirements of education. Therefore, the introduction of the OBE concept has very significance for increasing the innovation of the computer network technology teach and learn mode.

The Role of Engineering in Achieving the SDGs: A Case Study on Awareness-Raising Through Different Undergraduate Subjects at the Higher Polytechnic School of Zamora (Spain),"This study presents the results of a teaching innovation project at the University of Salamanca, in which more than 140 students from 6 undergraduate and master’s degree courses in engineering and architecture participated. The objective focuses on raising awareness and committing future generations of engineers to sustainable development by acquiring knowledge about the broader aspects of the UN 2030 Agenda and the importance of STEAM professions in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The generation of a course in the virtual campus promoted debate sessions based on flipped classrooms in 11 subjects from different areas of knowledge. The proposal allowed carrying out research works in the context of the involved subjects that related sustainable development to their contents. The exhibition of the research results allowed cooperative learning and the celebration of the World Engineering Day at the Higher Polytechnic School of Zamora. The low average score on an initial objective test shows a lack of information concerning SDG among engineering students. This score improved by 3 points in the final objective test. The satisfaction survey results show that the experience was positive for the students and the teaching team.

Review on research of butterfly failure theory and its application,"The mining of coal mine leads to the drastic change of the regional stress field of the roadway compared with the primary rock stress. Based on the non-isobaric stress environment of mining roadway, the quantitative relationship between the failure mode of roadway surrounding rock and the regional stress field is established by the butterfly failure theory, which provides a theoretical basis for the study of the mechanical behavior and dynamic disaster of roadway surrounding rock. Firstly, this paper systematically reviews the development process of butterfly failure related research, and expounds the research trend of butterfly theory. Then, three failure modes and their discriminant criteria, five types of butterfly failure characteristics and the adaptability of butterfly failure theory in four aspects of roadway surrounding rock are evaluated, and the application and innovation of butterfly failure theory in various roadway surrounding rock stability control, coal and gas joint mining, rock burst, coal and gas outburst, butterfly earthquake and fault formation mechanism are introduced. Finally, the adaptability and limitations of butterfly failure theory are deeply discussed, and the future development direction of butterfly failure theory is pointed out from the perspective of butterfly failure charecteristic charecterization, practical verification of a series of mechanisms, and new technology research and development.","Li, Jun;Ma, Nianjie;Wang, Weijun;Ren, Jianju;Lian, Xiaoyong;Ma, Zhenkai",Journal,Zhongguo Kuangye Daxue Xuebao/Journal of China University of Mining and Technology,2023-01-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Liaoning Technical University;Hunan University of Science and Technology",buttefly failure ;  buttefly outlook ;  charecteristic of buttefly fallure ;  engineering application ;  morphological evolution ;  theoretical adaptability
SIIBED: Subsea Ice Interaction Barriers to Energy Development – Overview,"The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the Subsea Ice Interaction Barriers to Energy Development (SIIBED) project including work on acceptance criteria used in finite element analysis (FEA), physical modelling and risk analysis activities. The overall structure of the SIIBED program and the relationship between the various tasks is presented. SIIBED is a continuation of two previous projects funded by Energy Research & Innovation Newfoundland and Labrador (ERINL): Alternatives to Flowline Trenching (AFT) and Alternatives to Weak Links (AWL). The SIIBED scope was expanded to include subsea cables, reflecting the interest in moving towards electrification of offshore operations. Numerical modelling of iceberg interaction with rigid pipelines, flexible flowlines and cables requires an understanding of elastic/plastic stiffness and stress/deformation limit states. This paper reviews existing technologies, industry standards and best practices. The behavior of rigid pipes in an ice grounding environment is fairly well understood and was reviewed in relation to applications supporting developments in the Beaufort Sea. In contrast, the construction of flexible flowlines is much more complex and variable, and firm guidelines on design strain limits are lacking for the application considered here. Subsea cables are even less well understood. When considering subsea cables and the adoption of limit state design criteria, the model of failure consequences was examined in the context of approximately a 15 second ice-pipe-soil interaction before the iceberg passes over-top. Under loading, the three conductors in an AC cable must maintain separation to prevent electrical arcing. Insulation around a single conductor DC cable must remain intact. It has been observed that, unlike steel pipes that ovalize when compressed restricting access for pigging as well as loss of strength integrity, the cables (particularly the insulation around conductors), bounce back to the original shape. The potential loss of conductivity could not be tested. If cables bounce back, then to prevent arcing, a cable could be de-energized for the short period ice keel interaction and re-energized after the iceberg passes over-top. While a considerable understanding for modeling rigid pipelines against iceberg keel interaction exists, analysis of subsea cables is much less understood. These are, however, now necessary as the oil and gas industry transitions to a net zero carbon footprint or alternative energy sources (e.g. offshore wind power) are developed in ice prone regions. While more testing and verification work is needed, this work suggests","Ralph, Freeman;King, Tony;Fowlow, Chad;Butler, Chad;Paulin, Mike;Price, Jason;Ogban, Peter",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2023-01-01,Growler Energy;Scanmudring Canada Inc.;Intecsea Worley Group;Angler Solutions Inc.;C-CORE,
Exploring Novel Innovation Strategies to Close a Technology Gap in Neurosurgery: HORAO Crowdsourcing Campaign,"Background: Scientific research is typically performed by expert individuals or groups who investigate potential solutions in a sequential manner. Given the current worldwide exponential increase in technical innovations, potential solutions for any new problem might already exist, even though they were developed to solve a different problem. Therefore, in crowdsourcing ideation, a research question is explained to a much larger group of individuals beyond the specialist community to obtain a multitude of diverse, outside-the-box solutions. These are then assessed in parallel by a group of experts for their capacity to solve the new problem. The 2 key problems in brain tumor surgery are the difficulty of discerning the exact border between a tumor and the surrounding brain, and the difficulty of identifying the function of a specific area of the brain. Both problems could be solved by a method that visualizes the highly organized fiber tracts within the brain; the absence of fibers would reveal the tumor, whereas the spatial orientation of the tracts would reveal the area’s function. To raise awareness about our challenge of developing a means of intraoperative, real-time, noninvasive identification of fiber tracts and tumor borders to improve neurosurgical oncology, we turned to the crowd with a crowdsourcing ideation challenge. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility of a crowdsourcing ideation campaign for finding novel solutions to challenges in neuroscience. The purpose of this paper is to introduce our chosen crowdsourcing method and discuss it in the context of the current literature. Methods: We ran a prize-based crowdsourcing ideation competition called HORAO on the commercial platform HeroX. Prize money previously collected through a crowdfunding campaign was offered as an incentive. Using a multistage approach, an expert jury first selected promising technical solutions based on broad, predefined criteria, coached the respective solvers in the second stage, and finally selected the winners in a conference setting. We performed a postchallenge web-based survey among the solvers crowd to find out about their backgrounds and demographics. Results: Our web-based campaign reached more than 20,000 people (views). We received 45 proposals from 32 individuals and 7 teams, working in 26 countries on 4 continents. The postchallenge survey revealed that most of the submissions came from single solvers or teams working in engineering or the natural sciences, with additional submissions from other nonmedical fields.

Growing International Operations: Multiple Deployments of Multiple Hydrokinetic Power Systems in 2023,"The objective of this paper is to outline how technical validation of marine hydrokinetic devices is achieved through multiple in-water demonstration projects. The importance of these projects in accelerating the commercialization of the technology by increasing market awareness and adoption is also presented. This paper will outline how a suite of power systems using the same core technology, based around a patented cross-flow hydrokinetic turbine, has been developed to generate power in both river and tidal environments. A pathway advancing the design and testing five generations of turbine technology through fourteen system deployments has been followed, successfully facilitating progress to multiple parallel deployments in an 18 month period across 2022-23. The paper will demonstrate how these projects are being delivered, combining internal engineering, development and operational expertise with partnerships with communities, research organisations, regulators and suppliers. Structured innovation processes for optimizing and advancing novel systems and components are also discussed. The paper outlines the installation and operation of a new hydrokinetic turbine device in Manitoba, Canada, next-generation river turbine units in Millinocket, Maine, and a single turbine tidal energy test system in Eastport, Maine. These are joining an ongoing deployment at Igiugig, Alaska which is demonstrating the performance and survivability of these systems in challenging conditions and proving the model of providing baseload renewable power to remote communities using hydrokinetic turbines. The lessons learned from these projects are described in detail. The success of these demonstration projects will be shown to unlock the growth of the installed hydrokinetic device capacity by up to nine devices in eight locations on multiple continents and countries over the next 12 to 18 months. The paper will outline how management of parallel device deployments has enabled technology developers to significantly enhance their supply chain capacity, increase the volume of devices that can be manufactured and installed, and reduce unit costs as the project pipeline grows. The paper will detail industry-leading approaches to supply chain strategy; project opportunity validation and advancement; regulatory and operations timeline implementation; and community engagement. This will provide insight into approaches that can be replicated across the wider marine energy sector.","Cahill, Brendan;Caspard, Marie;Johnson, Nathan;Davies, Stuart;Leung, Pak",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2023-01-01,Ocean Renewable Power Company (ORPC);Shell,
How Texas Can Become the Leader in Offshore Wind in North and South America by Using New Technology and Leveraging Existing Infrastructure and Expertise,"Large fixed and floating wind farms are planned in the US, the first of which will come on stream along the East Coast, and then possibly followed by the West Coast in deepwater. However, there are other regions in North and South America, and even the Caribbean that are rapidly aiming for offshore wind farms. One of those locations, offshore Texas, may develop ahead of the West Coast by taking advantage of the unparalleled expertise in ocean engineering in Texas gained through over 40 years of offshore oil and gas developments. In addition, Texas has regional competitive advantages that could result in another offshore boom for the region. Texas is the leading state for onshore wind power and consequently has some highly innovative research institutions and initiatives that could further push Texas to the forefront of regional, if not global, offshore wind technology development and deployment. The additional advantages that Texas can provide to wind farm developers based on its proximity to the Caribbean and South American offshore wind markets are also presented. As an example of innovation in Texas, the University of Texas at Dallas, DOE ARPA-E (Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy) funded vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) development is summarized (ARPA-E, 2020). While elements of VAWT technology are transferable to horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) technology to improve HAWT performance, more generally, the deployment of VAWTs overcomes many logistical and performance problems inherent in deploying HAWTs offshore. Such VAWT advantages are discussed. Two cases are presented comparing HAWT versus VAWT floating wind farms. The technology and execution differences of the two cases are compared and the net present value and internal rate of return are calculated conserving the technology differences. Discussion of forthcoming additional financing opportunities is also presented to illustrate how even in low-cost electric rate markets, offshore wind can still be feasible.","Shelley, Steffen Allan;Boo, Sung Youn;Luyties, William H.;Todd Griffith, D.",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2023-01-01,The University of Texas at Dallas;LLC,
ADVANCED MATERIALS AND RESEARCH FOR THE GREEN FUTURE,"Environmental concerns, such as pollution, greenhouse-gas emissions, sustainability, global warming and climate change, are the biggest challenges of our times. In this respect, the more efficient use of energy and materials combined with technology optimization and innovation are playing a key role in the quest to become a green society with green industry. Multiple environmental and economic benefits can mostly be achieved through novel, lightweight energy-efficient designs. In order to develop and properly use new materials and new designs, complete understanding and information on their properties must be obtained. It is also vital to know how these properties are affected by the conditions of a specific application. Furthermore, as the design of components is pushed towards the limits, unsuitable and outdated measuring methods, measuring uncertainty and deviations from the defined material properties can lead to unexpected premature failure of the component and environmental problems. For the green future, it is extremely important to develop new, advanced materials. However, it is often the changes of the production technology and to the surface of an already-existing material that can achieve great benefits to performance as well as the environment. It is all about modifying the material to perform better, last longer, be biocompatible and achieve different functionalities. Finally, besides high-tech equipment and research facilities, close cooperation between universities, research institutes and industry is needed to develop technologies, functional materials and solutions that can effectively support the journey of our society into a green future.","Podgornik, Bojan",Journal,Materiali in Tehnologije,2023-01-01,Institute of Metals and Technology Ljubljana,advanced materials ;  environment ;  pollution ;  research ;  surface engineering

Evaluation of the properties and applications of FRP bars and anchors: A review,"The performance deterioration of steel anchors caused by steel corrosion is becoming more serious in slope anchorage applications. Therefore, the fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composites have become a substitute material for traditional anchorage structures due to their advantages of low price, lightweight, high strength, and corrosion resistance. Numerous studies have proven that FRP anchors have better anchoring capacity than traditional steel anchors in practical engineering and are not as susceptible to environmental influences. This review mainly introduced the mechanical properties of FRP, focuses on the current research progress and innovation of FRP anchor in anchorage engineering, then provides a basis for the design of FRP anchor. In this study, the failure characteristics and problem of insufficient bonding strength of the first interface of FRP anchor anchoring slope were discussed, and the improvement was introduced. It will be conducive to the extension and application of FRP composites as structural materials in civil engineering. A detailed introduction is also given to biomaterials, which are mainly derived from nature and which will not only reduce waste disposal problems and environmental pollution but will also replace conventional applications. Finally, there will be an important reference and value for the development of green and sustainable engineering structures.","Ren, Yuhang;Wang, Hongguang;Guan, Zhongzhi;Yang, Kainan",Journal,Reviews on Advanced Materials Science,2023-01-01,Northeast Forestry University,biological polymer ;  environmental degradation ;  mechanical properties ;  microstructural analysis ;  polymer-matrix composites

In vivo corneal elastography: A topical review of challenges and opportunities,"Clinical measurement of corneal biomechanics can aid in the early diagnosis, progression tracking, and treatment evaluation of ocular diseases. Over the past two decades, interdisciplinary collaborations between investigators in optical engineering, analytical biomechanical modeling, and clinical research has expanded our knowledge of corneal biomechanics. These advances have led to innovations in testing methods (ex vivo, and recently, in vivo) across multiple spatial and strain scales. However, in vivo measurement of corneal biomechanics remains a long-standing challenge and is currently an active area of research. Here, we review the existing and emerging approaches for in vivo corneal biomechanics evaluation, which include corneal applanation methods, such as ocular response analyzer (ORA) and corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology (Corvis ST), Brillouin microscopy, and elastography methods, and the emerging field of optical coherence elastography (OCE). We describe the fundamental concepts, analytical methods, and current clinical status for each of these methods. Finally, we discuss open questions for the current state of in vivo biomechanics assessment techniques and requirements for wider use that will further broaden our understanding of corneal biomechanics for the detection and management of ocular diseases, and improve the safety and efficacy of future clinical practice.","Lan, Gongpu;Twa, Michael D.;Song, Chengjin;Feng, Jin Ping;Huang, Yanping;Xu, Jingjiang;Qin, Jia;An, Lin;Wei, Xunbin",Journal,Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal,2023-01-01,University of Houston College of Optometry;Hubei University of Science and Technology;Peking University;Foshan University;Peking University Health Science Center;Ltd.,Brillouin microscopy ;  Corneal biomechanics ;  Corneal visualization scheimpflug technology ;  Elastography ;  Ocular response analyzer ;  Optical coherence elastography ;  Young's modulus
"Psychosocial safety climate as a predictor of work engagement, creativity, innovation, and work performance: A case study of software engineers","Introduction: Creativity is vital for competitive advantage within technological environments facing the fourth industrial revolution. However, existing research on creativity has rarely addressed how a climate beneficial for worker psychological health, a psychosocial safety climate (PSC), could additionally stimulate the growth of workplace creativity, innovation, and performance in digital environments. Method: To examine how individually perceived PSC influences subsequent work engagement promoting higher levels of computer-based radical and incremental creativity, innovation, and work performance, employees in a software engineering firm (N = 29, 86 observations) completed a weekly questionnaire for 4 consecutive weeks. Results: At the between-person level PSC was positively related to average future weekly individual fluctuations of creativity (radical and incremental), work engagement, and job performance. Additionally weekly work engagement was related to future creativity (radical and incremental). Work engagement also mediated the between-person relationship between PSC and future creativity (both radical and incremental). PSC did not predict innovation. Discussion: This study contributes to the theory on PSC, creativity, and work performance by elucidating the individual perceived PSC-creativity relationship and suggesting PSC systems as meaningful antecedents to digital work performance.","Zadow, Amy;Loh, May Young;Dollard, Maureen Frances;Mathisen, Gro Ellen;Yantcheva, Bella",Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,2023-01-01,"University of Adelaide, School of Psychology;University of South Australia;Universitetet i Stavanger",creativity ;  engagement ;  innovation ;  psychosocial safety climate ;  software engineers ;  work performance

Monitoring and control of the program comprehension teaching in a computer class environment,"Introduction. The comprehension of computer programs is claimed to be a decisive faculty and even skill of any successful exercising professional duties of program engineers, for example, prototype analysis, decision making and discussion about algorithms and structures, development of detailed documentation, test development and test analysis. Exercising of the duties demands from the engineer a special competence to judge about a program behavior basing on the consideration of its source and sometimes digital codes, screenshots, execution protocols. The skill and opportunity to make trial runs can supplement but not replace the competence. Manifesting itself on particular programs it is not a presentation of an extensive and deep familiarity with the programs, but results from the experience with a lot of programs and is obscured by another competence, the competence of the developer. This paper is aimed to precise the interpretation of the notion “program comprehension”, to research the opportunities of a purposeful and enhanced teaching the program comprehension, to develop methods and tools for the assessment of the program comprehension teaching in the higher school. The aim is relevant because of current university curricula allot considerable lecture and laboratory time for teaching programming, including program comprehension. But this time is constantly not enough in view of a growing intensity of innovations in the area of the program engineering. The problem of a control over processes of the program comprehension fostering in a computer class is a key problem of achieving the aim having been set. Materials and methods. The research is based on the university syllabi, the author’s lecture notes, protocols of experimental and sample runs of the developed programs, Internet resources, such as site of the ACM and others. The following research methods were used: terminological analysis and elaboration of a vocabulary demanded in the research and discourse within the paper; modelling and simulation, including a theoretical conceptual model representation of the program comprehension, a computer program simulation of the monitoring and control over the comprehension progress; an UML-presentation and a trial implementation of the proposed interface for the program comprehension monitoring and control. Research results. Redefinition of conceptual cognitive models of program comprehension is proposed. The program comprehension is postulated to be a state of the cognitive knowledge base that represents an actual affordance of giving correct answers to questions about an eventual program behavior. This model highlights a special kind of teaching to be called “didactic parsing” that is targeted to generate at the audience a comprehension of programs being parsed. Dynamics of question and answers during the didactic parsing is used for assessing the education success and, finally, for a control of the teaching tempo. A user interface for learning computer systems (counters, controls and policies) are proposed to assist in monitoring and control of the didactic parsing. Sample implementation of the interface is built in JL (Joint Lesson) computer system. A graph model and a corresponding simulation program are developed that capture relevant dynamic features of control over the didactic parsing and are applied for the further investigation and demonstration of general didactic parsing effects as well as an aid for planning and control of program comprehension teaching during particular lectures. Conclusion. The research results provide creation of an environment, methods and tools enabling to positively impact the processes of program comprehension attainment. In particular, they permit to control the program comprehension level at a particular audience, adjust style of teaching to be most applicable to it, refine time plans of lectures in the area of program engineering.","Gagarin, A.

‘I don’t find it hard!’ They defied the gendered norm in science!,"Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects offered as a discipline in schools demand that learners engage in critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity and innovation. The subjects develop logical thinking, information literacy and exploration, all essential skills to survive work-life demands in the 21st century. The reality however is that STEM is perceived as challenging to master and constructed as a masculine discipline. Therefore, there is a high prevalence of gender stereotypes affecting female access. While gendered beliefs and practices are known to reduce access to STEM, research does not accentuate the positive on women and girls that have broken the barriers in science as the few studies are predominantly from the West. However, increasingly, Kenya National Examination Council results indicate the rise of women in STEM. A selection of successful girls and teachers in a public secondary school in Taita Taveta County, Kenya was taken. Drawing from focus group discussions,interviews and documents, the qualitative study demonstrates an invincible trend where an interplay of positive influences, strong self-efficacy and motivation have become anchors toward girls’ successful engagement in STEM. Findings confirm the postulates of the expectancy-value theory that students’ self-concepts and intrinsic value determine their aspirations, subject choices and achievement.","Machocho Mwang’ombe, Alice;Mwingi, Mweru",Journal,International Journal of Science Education,2023-01-01,The Aga Khan University Tanzania,Girls and STEM ;  qualitative ;  science engagement
Community review: a robust and scalable selection system for resource allocation within open science and innovation communities,"Resource allocation is essential to selection and implementation of innovative projects in science and technology. Current “winner-take-all” models for grant applications require significant researcher time in writing extensive project proposals, and rely on the availability of a few time-saturated volunteer experts. Such processes usually carry over several months, resulting in high effective costs compared to expected benefits. We devised an agile “community review” system to allocate micro-grants for the fast prototyping of innovative solutions. Here we describe and evaluate the implementation of this community review across 147 projects from the “Just One Giant Lab’s OpenCOVID19 initiative” and “Helpful Engineering” open research communities. The community review process uses granular review forms and requires the participation of grant applicants in the review process. Within a year, we organised 7 rounds of review, resulting in 614 reviews from 201 reviewers, and the attribution of 48 micro-grants of up to 4,000 euros. The system is fast, with a median process duration of 10 days, scalable, with a median of 4 reviewers per project independent of the total number of projects, and fair, with project rankings highly preserved after the synthetic removal of reviewers. Regarding potential bias introduced by involving applicants in the process, we find that review scores from both applicants and non-applicants have a similar correlation of r=0.28 with other reviews within a project, matching traditional approaches. Finally, we find that the ability of projects to apply to several rounds allows to foster the further implementation of successful early prototypes, as well as provide a pathway to constructively improve an initially failing proposal in an agile manner. Overall, this study quantitatively highlights the benefits of a frugal, community review system acting as a due diligence for rapid and agile resource allocation in open research and innovation programs, with implications for decentralised communities.","Graham, Chris L.B.;Landrain, Thomas E.;Vjestica, Amber;Masselot, Camille;Lawton, Elliot;Blondel, Leo;Haenal, Luca;Greshake Tzovaras, Bastian;Santolini, Marc",Journal,F1000Research,2023-01-01,Université Paris Cité;University of Warwick;University of Nottingham;Just One Giant Lab,community science ;  decision making ;  research and innovation ;  research funding

Using a mixed-methods approach, the study firstly entailed a quantitative survey of engineering graduates at a South African University during their graduation using a questionnaire and convenience sampling. Graduates’ needs, aspirations, reason for pursuing engineering and their expectations of the workplace were determined and analysed using the Biggs’ Study Motives and Strategies framework. The study thereafter attempted to ascertain the perspectives of academic leaders at the same university, drawing from their years of experience and liaison with industry partners. Academic leaders at the university were interviewed qualitatively. An interpretivist paradigm was considered using deductive thematic semantic analysis on various themes concerning their views on graduate and employer expectations, trends, training programmes, postgraduate study, outcomes and attributes. The study also drew upon findings by the university Quality Promotions and Assurance survey for further corroboration of findings. Key misalignments between graduates and academic leaders were identified and discussed. The main misalignments included guidance expectations, niche proficiencies and innovation expectations. Key causes included language barriers, lack of engineering drive, high workload and surface study strategies, and assessment changes. Recommendations for the university’s role in mitigating many of the issues and mis-alignments were provided, along with recommendations for any possible future research in this area.","Osman, Khalid;Gerwel Proches, Cecile N.",Journal,"African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",2023-01-01,Mangosuthu University of Technology;University of KwaZulu-Natal,alignment ;  engineering education ;  Engineering graduates ;  graduate work expectations

SOIL IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM USING RESIN INJECTIONS IN SUBMERGED TUNNELS,"The world of construction, and in particular the field of underground works, is immersed in a constant state of innovation and development. Numerous new variables are at work in this field, both in the improvement of the properties of materials and construction technology and in the new requirements and demands of users. Throughout history, civil engineering has had to offer support to the needs of comfort, aesthetics, sustainability and worker safety, among others. Of these, the latter is the most important and has become increasingly relevant in recent years. This research aims to offer an integral solution to the tunnelling process, under phreatic surfaces and in geological conditions of low cohesive strength and subjected to high pressures. The intention of this technology is to treat the ground by means of injections applied from inside a TBM to revise and replace the worn tools of its cutting wheel. The proposed solution consists of installing a high-frequency drilling unit in a hydroshield TBM. This new device is analysed to determine whether it offers a solution for the proposed requirements. The results obtained confirm a 15% improvement compared to existing solutions, greater efficiency and speed of execution, while proving to be a safer technique in terms of occupational risk prevention and respect for the environment.","Mondragón-Enguídanos, Catalina;Gil-López, Tomás;Verdú-Vázquez, Amparo;Gorines-Garnacho, Francisco Javier",Journal,Dyna (Spain),2023-01-01,Acciona S.A.;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Ground treatment ;  Hydroshields ;  Injections ;  Subsea tunnel ;  TBM ;  Water table

Relationship between Knowledge Flow of Scientific and Technological Innovation and the Collaborative Innovation Ability of Students,"Scientific and technological innovation ability of students is an important part of scientific and technological innovation in higher vocational colleges. There are few scientific and technological innovation achievements and low scientific and technological content of technical application achievements in higher vocational colleges at present, which are mainly caused by the single innovation organization form and weak innovation knowledge sharing ability. It is of great significance and value to explore the knowledge flow of scientific and technological innovation in colleges and universities and the collaborative innovation of college students. There is little research on the relationship between knowledge flow of scientific and technological innovation and collaborative innovation of college students in the existing literature, so this article has carried out relevant research. This article constructs the mathematical model of knowledge flow of scientific and technological innovation in colleges and universities, analyzes the stability of the mathematical model of knowledge flow of scientific and technological innovation in colleges and universities, and gives the framework of collaborative innovation ecosystem for college students. This article accurately measures the embedding of scientific and technological innovation resources in colleges and universities, the knowledge flow of scientific and technological innovation and the collaborative innovation performance of college students, and empirically tests the direct influence effect of embedding scientific and technological innovation resource network in colleges and universities on the collaborative innovation performance of college students and the moderating effect of the knowledge flow of scientific and technological innovation in colleges and universities.

Diversity Awareness in Software Engineering Participant Research,"Diversity and inclusion are necessary prerequisites for shaping technological innovation that benefits society as a whole. A common indicator of diversity consideration is the representation of different social groups among software engineering (SE) researchers, developers, and students. However, this does not necessarily entail that diversity is considered in the SE research itself.In our study, we examine how diversity is embedded in SE research, particularly research that involves participant studies. To this end, we have selected 79 research papers containing 105 participant studies spanning three years of ICSE technical tracks. Using a content analytical approach, we identified how SE researchers report the various diversity categories of their study participants and investigated: 1) the extent to which participants are described, 2) what diversity categories are commonly reported, and 3) the function diversity serves in the SE studies.We identified 12 different diversity categories reported in SE participant studies. Our results demonstrate that even though most SE studies report on the diversity of participants, SE research often emphasizes professional diversity data, such as occupation and work experience, over social diversity data, such as gender or location of the participants. Furthermore, our results show that participant diversity is seldom analyzed or reflected upon when SE researchers discuss their study results, outcome or limitations.To help researchers self-assess their study diversity awareness, we propose a diversity awareness model and guidelines that SE researchers can apply to their research. With this study, we hope to shed light on a new approach to tackling the diversity and inclusion crisis in the SE field.","Dutta, Riya;Costa, Diego Elias;Shihab, Emad;Tajmel, Tanja",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,2023-01-01,Concordia University;Université du Québec à Montréal,content analysis ;  diversity ;  diversity awareness ;  ICSE ;  participant studies
Research status and development trend of perspective preparation technologies and applications for textiles,"Significance Chemical fiber is a necessary component of human productivity and daily living. Since the 1970s, China's chemical fiber industry has developed quickly, and China has led the world in production of chemical fiber for almost 20 years. In 2021, China's chemical fiber output has reached 60.25 million tons, or more than 70% of the total amount produced worldwide. Currently, the development of high performance, functional, and intelligent textile products has drawn considerable attention as consumer demand has increased significantly. The production of raw resources, technological advancement, and the application fields of functional products are all significant variables. The future development of the textile industry is undoubtedly very important, and in order to be clear about the future development direction, it is thus crucial to summarize the possible and potential development trend of novel technologies and improved products with higher performance and wider application fields in future textile industry on the basis of the existing technologies and problems. Progress Currently, significant obstacles still exist to the growth of the textile sector, which are mostly seen in the following four aspects: 1) shortage of resources for fiber raw materials; 2) increase of processing costs; 3) products elevation. Middle and low-grade products no longer have any advantages, the production and processing capability is forced to migrate out of China, and new and high-grade products are being developed and produced; 4) absence of innovative technology. The developed synthetic biological method and genetic engineering technology can successfully prepare bio-based raw materials like 1, 3-propanediol and lactic acid in order to avoid the significant consumption of petroleum-based raw materials and the competition between bio-based raw materials and grain. Fiber material forming technology is moving progressively in the direction of an effective multi-flow, sustainable, green, and intelligent technology introduction. Furthermore, the fiber forming technology is more advanced to achieve the accurate building of multiple fiber structures. A greater range of applications can be met by the expansion and performance improvement of fiber structures. Application of clothing in the direction of development for high performance, minimal loss, light weight, and multifunctional clothing. Additionally, textiles have new uses in the development of biomedical materials, environmental protection filtration materials, and agricultural production materials. The innovation products are multi-functional and more intelligent, and can realize the active adaptation of structure and performance in varied application conditions. Conclusion and Prospect The development of textile industry and textile technology has played a crucial role in the evolution of human civilization. Today in the 21st century, the textile industry is no longer just a conventional industry to meet the needs of human clothing. Its technological development is more advanced and cutting-edge: 1) the innovation of raw materials. Innovations in feedstock technology such as the development of bio-based feedstocks have made fiber products more environmentally friendly. Pure organic polymers are no longer the only type of fibrous matrix materials; in addition, inorganic, metal, and organic-inorganic hybrid fiber materials are now covered. 2) forming technology. Fiber material forming technology is gradually moving toward an effective multi-flow, environmentally friendly, and sustainable processing process. Infinite creative potential exists for final applications thanks to the advancement of fiber forming technology and the evolution of fiber on a multidimensional scale. 3) intelligent manufacturing. The adoption of intelligent manufacturing, complete process automation, information technology, and digitalization can significantly increase the productivity of the textile sector. 4) more diverse applications. In the future, textiles could be used in apparel, wearable textiles, household textile items, and extremely innovative fields including biomedicine, the environment, energy, agricultural production, building, and transportation, among others, with the focus on intelligence and function. The textile sector has demonstrated multifaceted inventive growth that will open up more room for human civilization and technology advancement.","Wu, Jing;Jiang, Zhenlin;Ji, Peng;Xie, Ruimin;Chen, Ye;Chen, Xiangling;Wang, Huaping",Journal,Fangzhi Xuebao/Journal of Textile Research,2023-01-01,Shanghai University of Engineering Science;Donghua University,forming technology ;  green and low carbon ;  intelligent manufacturing ;  recycling ;  textiles
Deterministic bibliometric disambiguation challenges in company names,"Peer-reviewed publications and patents serve as important signatures of knowledge generation, and therefore the authors and their organizations can represent agents of intellectual transformation. Accurate tracking of these players enables scholars to follow knowledge evolution. However, while author name disambiguation has been discussed extensively, less is known about the impact of organization name on bibliometric studies. We expand here on the recently defined phenomenon of onomastic profusion, high-frequency words used in organization names for semantic reasons, and thus contributing a non-random source of error to bibliographic studies. We use the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I awardees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as a use case in the field of engineering innovation. We find that firms in California or Massachusetts experience a six percent decrease in the likelihood of using the word Technologies in their names. Furthermore, use of the words Research and Science is linked to doubling the number of awards. We illustrate that, in aggregate, firms executing rational strategic naming decisions can create deterministic bibliometric challenges.","Belz, Andrea;Graddy-Reed, Alexandra;Shweta, F.

Applying complexity theory perspective to knowledge management in the innovation context,"Purpose: Interdependence on the global economy and rapid technological changes raised the degree of uncertainty and complexity, leading to innovation challenges. Innovation depends on knowledge, and the solution might rest on how sound firms manage it, particularly in emerging markets such as India. The purpose of this paper is to examine how firms implement knowledge management (KM) in highly innovation-oriented firms (biotechnology and pharmaceuticals) and the factors affecting its implementation by examining knowledge interactions between individuals. Design/methodology/approach: This study consists of a systematic literature review, a case study with embedded units and the use of grounded theory to analyse the data. The factors emerging from the results were examined from an individual and organisational lens. Next, complexity theory (CT) was used to understand the impact of these factors in KM by facilitating its incorporation as a system. Findings: The findings of this paper suggest that constant technology adoption increases human-to-technology interaction, higher circulation of existing knowledge and more controlled environments, discouraging individuals from learning or sharing knowledge. From a system perspective, results of this paper suggest that firms self-organise around technology, indicating that innovation decreases as knowledge creation and sharing tend to reduce with lesser social interactions. This study shows the usefulness of using CT in analysing KM for innovation. The performance of the system is analysed based on its constituents and interactions. Originality/value: This study contributes to advancing CT in KM in the context of innovation in highly knowledge-intensive firms, as few studies were found in the literature.","Pacheco, Carla;Paul, Bino",Journal,VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems,2023-01-01,Tata Institute of Social Sciences,Complexity theory ;  Emerging markets ;  Existing knowledge ;  Grounded theory ;  Human-to-technology interaction ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge management ;  Tacit knowledge
"The Missionaries' Engagement with Science and Technology in Colonial Kenya, 1887-1963","The missionaries' engagement with science and technology in colonial Kenya (1887-1963) is evidentially seen through the use of the post-industrial revolution's breakthroughs of the eighteenth century, which included: advancement in science and mass production, steam engines, and the rise of digital technology. The tendency to rely heavily on post-industrial innovations and inventions were critical in fast-tracking their missiological discourses, which included scriptural translations, publishing, and the use of printing machines. These were critical in generating instructional materials and especially the Bible, which was produced in the local indigenous languages by 1952, and by encouraging technical-science education after primary school, among other methods. Although the concept of science and technology is largely attributed to the scientific breakthroughs of the twenty-first century, we argue that this concept was also evident in both the African indigenous society and in the missionary era. The widespread use of the phrase 'science and technology' is further seen in the missionary enterprises since they founded or supported the establishment of technical schools that offered electrical engineering, plumbing, carpentry, masonry, mechanical engineering, and training in medicine and the establishment of dispensaries and hospitals, among other relevant activities. Methodologically, the research article endeavours to review the European missionary societies, especially the Protestant wing, in its aim to understand their engagement with science and technology, and to determine if there conflict between Western science and the indigenous systems. The data was gathered through a review of existing literature, archival sources, unpublished materials and other oral sources.

"Connecting Dots Between Entrepreneurs, Research Publishers, and Software Engineering Researchers: An Outcome of Mixed Methods Empirical Research","To evaluate the potential for innovation in the existing startup scholarly literature, we conducted a study and a survey. The business implications on startups because of information transfer from scholarly papers are used to assess innovation potential. The multimethodology discovered that knowledge transmission from scholarly literature to the startup community is limited, as evidenced by their high failure rates, indicating that there are disconnections between them that obstruct knowledge transfer. The explanations are based on disparately dispersed knowledge across numerous bibliographic venues, unique constraints faced by startup communities, including limited resources and dynamism in the environment, and perceptual beliefs about the contrasts in researcher and entrepreneur roles. Finally, the methods for connecting researchers, publishing venues, and entrepreneurs in order to enhance knowledge transfer are discussed. More collaborative research, the dissemination of industrial research, an adaptation of the citation framework, an emphasis on open entrepreneurship, a change in review criteria, an emphasis on venues for practice, and open innovation by involving experts, particularly university libraries, are all core component of the proposed solution.","Gupta, Varun;Rubalcaba, Luis;Gupta, Chetna",Journal,IT Professional,2023-01-01,Jaypee Institute of Information Technology;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Universidad de Alcalá;GISMA University of Applied Sciences,
Prototypes for Industrial Design Research,"As authors of this last chapter, we provide our point of view deriving from our disciplinary background in industrial design, design innovation, and design engineering. We selected four examples that would give us a broad view of the use of prototypes in the product design area of innovation and engineering. First, we interviewed two academic colleagues: Sara Colombo, now an Assistant Professor at Eindhoven University of Technology, shared an example of research she developed in collaboration with a large industrial company while working as a research project lead at MIT Design Lab. Pieter Jan Stappers, Professor of Design Techniques at T.U. Delft, shared a milestone doctoral thesis in theorizing the Research Through Design approach. Their examples covered top technical universities’ “research + practice” and the “academic research” contexts. We then interviewed two practitioners presenting us with award-winning projects where prototypes played a crucial role in design research. Marco Meraviglia, a designer at Cefriel, extensive engineering and design research center, presented a project falling into our definition of “practice + research.” Gabriele Diamanti, the cofounder of Ddpstudio, which matches our context definition of “practice,” presented us with the case of a small design studio participating in a large, applied research project.","Ferraris, Silvia D.;Rampino, Lucia",Book Series,SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology,2023-01-01,Politecnico di Milano,

On-demand AI systems like IBM Watson and other AI systems are superficially illustrated. Mystifying concepts of Artificial intelligence, Machine learning and deep learning are presented in a comparative yet unadorned manner. With numerous opportunities come challenges which are keenly annotated. We conclude with the verity that AI is a mere re-engineering of the human mind and cannot match human intelligence, there are debates and always competition between AI and HI but in actuality, AI is a mere redesigning of the human mind.","Lingayat, Isha",Book,Applications of Artificial Intelligence in the Healthcare Sector,2023-01-01,"National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Mohali",Artificial Intelligence ;  Deep learning ;  Healthcare ;  Machine learning ;  Medicine
Application of Improved Ant Colony Algorithm in Path Planning of Underwater Robot,"With the continuous deepening of scientific development and technological innovation, many algorithms have been derived from the research on robot path planning, including the current research on ant colony algorithm. It is often accompanied by a series of problems such as slow convergence speed, seeking optimal solutions according to local conditions, insufficient optimization ability, and inability to complement the diversity of ant colony species and convergence speed. In view of the current shortcomings, first, the initial pheromone distribution is uneven, which can avoid the useless search behavior trajectory of the ants during the movement process, thereby speeding up the solution speed and saving time; secondly, based on the advantages of the A* algorithm, the introduction into its algorithm The heuristic search function further improves the heuristic function of the traditional ant colony algorithm and maximizes the speed of the search. Considering the influence factors of energy consumption factors on the experiment in actual situations, a new heuristic function is formed by combining with traditional factors, a simulation environment is built, and the proposed method is verified and compared through a set of examples. The results show that the improved ant colony algorithm is in the optimal path. It has better performance in length and number of iterations, and has practical engineering significance for robot path planning.","Xin, Pei Yuan;Fei, Zhi Peng;Qiu, Hai Yang;Hui, Wang;Lu, Zhu Wan;Ran, Wang Wei",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2023-01-01,Jiangsu University of Science and Technology,A* algorithm ;  Ant colony algorithm ;  MATLAB simulation ;  Path planning
Augmented Reality (AR) in Education: An Exploratory Analysis,"The use of new technologies plays an essential role in our lives and more specifically in education because of the improvement they represent in the educational process. Within the use of technologies, there are a large number of promising tools with advanced technology that are already being applied in the educational field. One of the most popular is augmented reality (AR). However, despite their growing importance, there is still a need to carry out more studies on these new tools, and more specifically, on the perception that users have of them. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the reviews of the main AR mobile applications (apps) that can be used in the field of education. For this, web scraping techniques will be carried out for the massive extraction of the reviews. The main result achieved in the current research shows the general dissatisfaction of users towards the functionalities of these apps considering that they are in a preliminary stage. The conclusions of this study show that the use of AR apps has not proliferated significantly in the educational field yet, although an expansion is expected in the future.","Perez-Calañas, Cinta;Hernández-Garrido, Rocío;Perea, David;Rodriguez-Perez, Ángel Mariano",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,2023-01-01,Universidade de Aveiro;Universidad de Huelva,Apps ;  Innovation ;  Reviews ;  Web scraping

Education for Sustainability: Calculation of the Digital Carbon Footprint,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought confinement that caused a drastic change throughout society. Mobility was reduced, education suffered a substantive change, distance learning, and digital skills were developed. Climate change and environmental pollution indicators indeed decreased. However, the quantification of the environmental footprint of the new form of remote work (digital carbon footprint) has not been considered in systematic studies. There are not many tools to calculate the corresponding emissions. The main objective of this educational research work was to determine the carbon footprint of digital activities in a company during the confinement caused by COVID-19 through a Challenge-Based Learning methodology. A one-semester academic program was designed to develop energy auditing skills for students of Sustainable Development Engineering. A company (training partner) was determined to validate the evaluation instruments. Techniques for data collection, questionnaires, and analysis of energy consumption data were designed. A helpful protocol was defined to determine the digital carbon footprint generated in the pilot company, allowing us to scale our research towards quantifying Greenhouse Gas emissions in Institutions or Companies of greater size. The soft and disciplinary graduation competencies of the students were solidly developed and evaluated through internal instruments and by the training partner standards. Finally, we propose mitigation measures aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, in line with the new Green and Sustainable Digital Education trend.","Martínez-Acosta, Mariajulia;Vázquez-Villegas, Patricia;Caratozzolo, Patricia;Lara-Prieto, Vianney;García-García, Rebeca;Membrillo-Hernández, Jorge",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Carbon footprint ;  Challenge-based learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Sustainability
Education 4.0: Proposal of a Model for Autonomous Management of Learning Processes,"From antiquity until nowadays, educational systems have evolved in parallel with major social and economic changes, integrating pedagogical and technological innovations into the educational ecosystem and leading to the advent of a new educational revolution, called Education 4.0. The Education 4.0 paradigm allows both, to support educational organizations in the adoption of pedagogical and digital transformations, and at the same time to meet the needs of new generations of learners and teachers. The increasing use of ICT and the power of the Internet have fostered the emergence of a new generation of learners for whom technology is an integral part of their lives and therefore of their learning style. To respond effectively to the specific needs of these new learner profiles, educational organizations must adopt significant and ongoing transformations in the way we teach and learn. Enabling student-centered teaching, personalized learning paths, and access to a variety of heterogeneous educational resources have made educational processes too complex for the educator to effectively monitor the individual progress of each student. It becomes necessary to automate the management of learning processes to provide better answers to the evolving and specific needs of the different actors (students, educators, training program managers, companies, etc.). This research project aims at proposing an autonomous architecture of Cyber-Physical systems for Education 4.0. This architecture responds to the needs of educational systems, integrating digital technologies for the development of heterogeneous learning environments, capable of meeting the needs of a plurality of learners with different profiles and supporting teachers and training managers in the management of learning processes. This architecture offers the possibility of autonomous management of learning processes to analyze the progress of students and to prescribe the necessary recommendations to increase the chances of success, facilitating the mission of teachers.","Gueye, Mamadou Lamine;Exposito, Ernesto",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2023-01-01,Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,Autonomic computing ;  Cyber-physical systems ;  Education 4.0 ;  Learning analytics ;  Learning process
The Content Structure of Science Technology and Innovation Policy—Applying Co-word Analysis to Funding Calls in Colombia,"STIP (science, technology, and innovation policy/es) affect how rules, methods and practices are designed and applied to develop basic or applied research within national borders. Literature on STIP has been fertile in multiple streams, such as theoretical/conceptual frameworks for improving STIP. This study built on the literature stream by unveiling the underlying structure of STIP expressed in the key areas and research fields explicitly supported for the case of Colombia 2005–2018 via co-word network analysis. We empirically identify the changing STIP priorities between two government administrations. While government-A prioritized Physical Sciences and Life Sciences and gave room for bi-disciplinary field communities, government-B doubled Health Sciences presence and balanced the participation of all areas. Social Sciences and Humanities had transversal participation in research field clusters.

Technology Factors Influencing Saudi Higher Education Institutions’ Adoption of Blockchain Technology: A Qualitative Study,"Given the lack of empirical research on blockchain adoption in higher education, this study aims to partially fill this gap in the knowledge by focusing on the technology factors that could play a role in the process. Using Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory, five technology factors were considered: relative advantage, compatibility, observability, complexity, and trialability. The data analysis was based on ten semi-structured interviews with university mid- and senior-level administrators and IT personnel. Relative advantage emerged as the strongest perceived factor. The effect of compatibility and complexity was observed to a lesser extent. The influence of observability and trialability was unclear. The uncovered underlying mechanisms for these effects are discussed and implications for theory, practice, and future research are explored.","Alalyan, Mohrah S.;Jaafari, Naif A.;Hussain, Farookh Khadeer",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,King Khalid University;University of Technology Sydney,
Internationalisation of Chinese green buildings: Review and prospect,"The internationalisation of Chinese green buildings is still in its early stages, with a scarcity of relevant research, academic outcomes and engineering practices. This paper aims to review and summarise the situation in China’s green building sector, propose the topic of “internationalisation of Chinese green buildings”, investigate its definition, sort out its causes, analyse the significance and inevitability, and provide theoretical foundations and recommendations for future development. Following a review, the exploration of the internationalisation of China’s green buildings has yielded certain results, and the conditions are favourable. There have been four overseas projects for certification and implementation of Chinese green building standards. China’s Green Building standards are world-leading. Research institutions collaborate extensively with foreign countries and export Chinese solutions. The domestic business environment is being optimised for green buildings, resulting in a booming local market. Moreover, the internationalisation work of China’s construction industry in the 13th Five-Year Summary concludes that international science and technology cooperation has been steadily promoted, the ‘Belt and Road’ science and technology innovation cooperation has been effective, and the internationalisation of China’s engineering construction standards has been promoted. The maturity of the conditions for China’s green building industry to expand internationally includes the perfection of the policy environment, the advantages of industrial scale, and the completion of domestic goals. It also includes the industry’s predicament and the inevitability of internationalisation. The first reason is that domestic opportunities have diminished, and challenges have increased. The second reason is a decrease in domestic real estate market demand. The third reason is the depletion of the supply-side technology and innovation model. The world’s green building market is large in scale and high in growth rate. China’s engineering enterprises can take advantage of the massive radiation effect of the “Belt and Road” initiative to enter the market covered, and these regions generally have low urbanisation rates and high construction potential. The global efforts to improve human settlements and mitigate climate change are also favourable factors. After discussion, internationalisation appears to be the most promising opportunity for the future of China’s construction industry, both in high-quality development and business growth. The internationalisation model of the Chinese green building industry is the sum of the globalisation of domestic green building companies and the greening of Chinese construction and engineering companies that are already overseas. It will emerge from a development model with Chinese characteristics via a model that combines local and overseas. The path to the internationalisation of Chinese green buildings may be as follows: Combining domestic and overseas engineering and technical strength, relying on the massive domestic market to form a huge industrial scale and robust productivity, undertaking the “Belt and Road” countries’ urbanisation needs, and then promoting the development of international standards through the “go out and bring in” formation of multilateralism transnational cooperation, and ultimately driving the entire industry chain.","Dai, Rui Ye;Wang, Youwei;Deng, Yuechao",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,China Academy of Building Research;Chinese Society for Urban Studies,Belt ;  construction industry ;  green building ;  internationalisation ;  Road ;  standard
Achieving Manufacturing Competitiveness Through Six Sigma: A Study on Steel Firms,"This study investigates that Six Sigma has potential feasibility to be instrumental in enhancing the manufacturing competitivity of the Indian steel industries. The research paper has been categorized into three sections, viz: identification of the competitive priorities from the relevant studies, surveying Six Sigma users and non-users of Indian steel industries employing a 5-point Likert scale, data analysis of the steel industries. One-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical data analysis. A conceptual framework was built on previous literature, demonstrating the five drivers of manufacturing competitiveness, namely, quality, cost, delivery, flexibility, and innovation. In conclusion, all five hypotheses were supported with significant results. However, the cost priority showed to be the least depending on the manufacturing competitiveness. On the scales of competitiveness, the Six Sigma users had relatively higher mean scores than the non-users.","Rath, Sudeshna;Agrawal, Rajat",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,2023-01-01,Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,Competitive priorities ;  Manufacturing competitiveness ;  Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) ;  Six Sigma ;  Steel industries
Raw material recycled practices for carbon neutrality,"Carbon reduction is a primary strategic business development target of every industry. Petrochemical engineering and ferrous metallurgy are raw material industries that are key players in carbon emission control and are also facing huge challenges. Raw material recycling is a subject that has received much focus but is difficult to apply to products that have high quality and functional characteristics. This practical paper introduces two case studies of Company A to illustrate practical suggestions on raw material recycling realization and management for carbon neutrality from the following business strategic aspects: chances and risks of application, technical process innovation, carbon reduction rate and cost. The results show the obvious feasibility and benefit of recycling raw materials into certain strategic selected products. This can reduce carbon effectively in parallel when there is a balance among the maturity level of raw material recycling systems in the market, supplier technical capability, and product demand. This research provides suggestions to firms on how to set up a transformation management strategy and achieve readiness for green innovation.","Gu, Shuwei",Journal,Global Transitions,2023-01-01,"School of Management, Zhejiang University",Carbon neutrality ;  Cost benefit ;  Joint development ;  Scrap recycling ;  Sustainability ;  Technical process innovation
"Practice and cognition of efficient CBM development under complex geological conditions: A case study of Zhengzhuang Block, Qinshui Basin","The geological conditions of various CBM sites in China are complicated and features similarly. With the recent development of exploring CBM towards the medium-deep, ultra-low permeability and structurally complex areas, it is of great significance to develop a set of efficient exploring techniques in complex areas to revitalize a large number of domestic CBM resources. Taking an example of the successful development of Zhengzhuang Block with early low yield and relatively complex geology, it had faced a series of problems, including complex geological conditions with internal fracture, strong heterogeneity, low permeability, lack of corresponding developing technologies for the early stage development, production rate less than 30% in the early stage. The sweet area optimization and efficient development theory was developed through deepening the research on CBM geological enrichment law and the development and application of new technologies. With these proposed techniques on optimal rapid drilling, dredging capacity increasing revamp and quantitative dredging and drainage control in two-open full-diameter horizontal wells, the production of single well was greatly increased, and the project yield increased from 29.3% to 98.5%. The research results indicate: (1) Timely and appropriate adjustment on the development plan is essential for the successful development of complex and low-permeability high-rank coalbed methane, providing space and platform for the continuous improvement in CBM exploring techniques; (2) The rolling operation mode of cluster well group can significantly reduce production and construction risks, and increase the overall scheme productivity by more than 20%; (3) The continuous innovation of horizontal well geology and engineering integration technology is a key element to achieve the overall improvement of productivity.","Zhu, Qingzhong;Li, Zhijun;Li, Zongyuan;Wang, Sanshuai;Sun, Ruixue;Wang, Yuting;Xiao, Yuhang;Wang, Jing;Wang, Jingyue;Guan, Xiaoqu",Journal,Meitiandizhi Yu Kantan/Coal Geology and Exploration,2023-01-01,CNPC Pilot Test Base of CBM Exploration and Development;PetroChina Huabei Oilfield Company,engineering integration ;  geology ;  high-efficient development ;  high-rank coal CBM ;  horizontal well ;  production and construction of new area
High-Performance Work Systems and Employees’ Innovative Work Behaviour: An Empirical Investigation Based on Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Theory,"The drivers of individual-level innovation remain an underresearched area. Based on JD-R theory, we argue that (a) high-performance work systems (HPWS) enhance employees’ innovative work behaviours (IWB) through an increase in employees’ work engagement, and (b) that the positive relationship between HPWS and work engagement will be magnified at high levels of work overload. We collected data from 313 supervisor-subordinate dyads in an engineering R&D organization in India. Structural equation modelling results supported all the hypotheses except the moderation hypotheses.

The evaluation of innovation efficiency of China’s high-tech manufacturing industry based on the analysis of the three-stage network DEA-Malmquist model,"The paper applies the three-stage network DEA and DEA-Malmquist method to measure the innovation efficiency of the high-tech Manufacturing industry for the period 2009–2017 in China. The analysis is divided into two parts to study. In the first analysis, we analyse the innovation efficiency of the high-tech manufacturing industry by using a three-stage network DEA, to open the black box of high technology innovation process in Chia. In the second stage, we use the DEA-Malmquist index method to evaluate the efficiency of technological innovation dynamically. We first found that the average innovation efficiency in the three stages from 2009 to 2017 shows a ‘Λ’ trend, there is room for improvement, especially in the basic and applied innovation stages. Moreover, the innovation is mainly driven by the east. Through the years 2009–2017, the development of high technology is unbalanced as well as insufficient. Our analyses show that the efficiency of technological innovation has been affected by the SEC and national policies. Therefore, we should adopt strategic measures to improve the innovation efficiency.","Lin, Tsung Xian;Wu, Zhong Huan;Yang, Jia Jia",Journal,Production Planning and Control,2023-01-01,South China University of Technology;King's College London;Guangzhou Huashang College,DEA-Malmquist ;  high technology ;  innovation efficiency ;  Three-stage network DEA
Deep and organizational learning as innovation catalyzer in digital business ecosystems – a scenario analysis on the tourism destination Berlin,"Purpose: The below-average innovative capacity of the tourism sector raises the question on the potentials of digital business ecosystems (DBEs) to overcome these shortages at a destination level – especially within a smart city environment. Using the example of the German Capital Berlin, this article aims to discuss both the possibilities and inhibitors of innovative knowledge-creation by building scenarios on one specific design option: the integration of digital deep learning (DL) functionalities and traditional organizational learning (OL) processes. Design/methodology/approach: Using the qualitative GABEK-method, major characteristics of a DBE as resource-, platform- and innovation systems are analyzed toward their interactions with the construction of basic action models (as the basic building blocks of knowledge). Findings: Against the background of the research findings, two scenarios are discussed for future evolution of the Berlin DBE, one building on cultural emulation as a trigger for optimized DL functionalities and one following the idea of cultural engineering supported by DL functionalities. Both scenarios focus specifically on the identified systemic inhibitors of innovative capabilities. Research limitations/implications: While this study highlights the potential of the GABEK method to analyze mental models, separation of explicit and latent models still remains challenging – so does the reconstruction of higher order mental models which require a combined take on interview techniques in the future. Originality/value: The resulting scenarios innovatively combine concepts from OL theory with the concept of DBE, thus indicating possible pathways into a tourism future where the limitations of human learning capacities could be compensated through the targeted support of general artificial intelligence (AI).","Schuhbert, Arne;Thees, Hannes;Pechlaner, Harald",Journal,European Journal of Innovation Management,2023-01-01,Katholische Universität Eichstätt - Ingolstadt,Deep learning ;  Destination Berlin ;  Digital business eco-systems ;  Digital platforms ;  Innovation processes ;  Organizational learning
New insights in biosurfactants research,"Surfactants are molecules that are characterized by their surface-active properties but have a diverse chemical composition as was discussed in the previous chapter. Due to their tensio-active behavior, they are used in a wide variety of industrial applications, ranging from the soap and detergent industries to food, cosmetics, agriculture, oil recovery, and bioremediation. Most of the surfactants in the market are chemically synthesized but, in several cases, they are toxic and recalcitrant compounds that represent an environmental hazard, since they are mainly petroleum derived. An environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative is represented by biosurfactants (BSs) produced by microorganisms. However, BSs currently represent a small share of the market. This is mainly due to the lower production cost of chemically synthesized surfactants and to important technical challenges in the large-scale production of BS, such as foaming during the fermentation process, which is difficult to manage and causes loss of biomass from the bioreactor. In this chapter we will describe some of the recent developments in the field of BS research, discussing different perspectives and the latest research innovations coming from diverse scientific approaches, that include the description of some of the microorganisms that produce BS, metabolic engineering strategies that have been reported for increasing their production, novel strategies in fermentation and downstream processing for their production. We will also present some applications of several BS types.","Soberón-Chávez, Gloria;Soto-Aceves, Martín P.;Servín-González, Luis",Book,Biosurfactants: Research and Development,2023-01-01,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México;University of Washington,Biosurfactants industrial applications ;  Genetic engineering of biosurfactant producers ;  Glycolipids ;  Lipopeptides ;  Microorganisms that produce biosurfactants
Sustaining yield and nutritional quality of peanuts in harsh environments: Physiological and molecular basis of drought and heat stress tolerance,"Climate change is significantly impacting agricultural production worldwide. Peanuts provide food and nutritional security to millions of people across the globe because of its high nutritive values. Drought and heat stress alone or in combination cause substantial yield losses to peanut production. The stress, in addition, adversely impact nutritional quality. Peanuts exposed to drought stress at reproductive stage are prone to aflatoxin contamination, which imposes a restriction on use of peanuts as health food and also adversely impact peanut trade. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of drought and heat stress at physiological and molecular levels may accelerate the development of stress tolerant productive peanut cultivars adapted to a given production system. Significant progress has been achieved towards the characterization of germplasm for drought and heat stress tolerance, unlocking the physiological and molecular basis of stress tolerance, identifying significant marker-trait associations as well major QTLs and candidate genes associated with drought tolerance, which after validation may be deployed to initiate marker-assisted breeding for abiotic stress adaptation in peanut. The proof of concept about the use of transgenic technology to add value to peanuts has been demonstrated. Advances in phenomics and artificial intelligence to accelerate the timely and cost-effective collection of phenotyping data in large germplasm/breeding populations have also been discussed. Greater focus is needed to accelerate research on heat stress tolerance in peanut. A suits of technological innovations are now available in the breeders toolbox to enhance productivity and nutritional quality of peanuts in harsh environments. A holistic breeding approach that considers drought and heat-tolerant traits to simultaneously address both stresses could be a successful strategy to produce climate-resilient peanut genotypes with improved nutritional quality.","Puppala, Naveen;Nayak, Spurthi N.;Sanz-Saez, Alvaro;Chen, Charles;Devi, Mura Jyostna;Nivedita, Nivedita;Bao, Yin;He, Guohao;Traore, Sy M.;Wright, David A.;Pandey, Manish K.;Sharma, Vinay",Journal,Frontiers in Genetics,2023-01-01,"United States Department of Agriculture;University of Wisconsin-Madison;International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics;University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad;Auburn University;Samuel Ginn College of Engineering;Tuskegee University;Iowa State University;New Mexico State University",drought ;  heat stress ;  high-throughput phenotyping ;  introgression ;  molecular ;  physiological ;  transgenes and CRISPR
A Strategic Research Framework for Defeating Diabetes in India: A 21st-Century Agenda,"Indian people are at high risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) even at younger ages and lower body weights. Already 74 million people in India have the disease, and the proportion of those with T2DM is increasing across all strata of society. Unique aspects, related to lower insulin secretion or function, and higher hepatic fat deposition, accompanied by the rise in overweight (related to lifestyle changes) may all be responsible for this unrelenting epidemic of T2DM. Yet, research to understand the causes, pathophysiology, phenotypes, prevention, treatment, and healthcare delivery of T2DM in India seriously lags behind. There are major opportunities for scientific discovery and technological innovation, which if tapped can generate solutions for T2DM relevant to the country’s context and make leading contributions to global science. We analyze the situation of T2DM in India, and present a four-pillar (etiology, precision medicine, implementation research, and health policy) strategic research framework to tackle the challenge. We offer key research questions for each pillar, and identify infrastructure needs. India offers a fertile environment for shifting the paradigm from imprecise late-stage diabetes treatment toward early-stage precision prevention and care. Investing in and leveraging academic and technological infrastructures, across the disciplines of science, engineering, and medicine, can accelerate progress toward a diabetes-free nation.","Narayan, K.

Application and prospect of tissue engineering strategies based on decellularized extracellular matrix in bone‑tendon injuries,"Under the rapid development of national health and fitness, the incidence rates of bone‑tendon injuries have been increasing observably. Bone‑to‑tendon healing poses a formidable clinical challenge due to the complex structure, composition and mechanics of the interface. A variety of strategies, including advanced biomaterials, bioactive growth factors and multiple stem cell lineages, have been developed, providing new adjuvant therapies for the repair of motor system injuries. Among them, tissue engineering of decellularized extracellular matrix materials is one of the most promising approaches. The well‑designed shapes of scaffolds, the improvements of acellular protocols, the bioactivity enhancement of materials and the appropriate seed cells in biomimetic applications have been proved to have more satisfactory clinical efficacy and application prospects.

Envisioning the solar stereo exploration mission,"Solar space exploration is of great importance in the study of cutting-edge solar physic problems and space weather forecasting applications. Over the past 60+ years of exploration activities, people have made a series of significant achievements, but still left many root problems that need to be solved. Solar stereo exploration can overcome the limitation of single-view observation, and access to omni-directional & multi-element physical data, thus contributing to the solution of major scientific problems in solar physics. This paper first introduces four scientific objectives (the Sun’s internal structure and the origin of solar magnetic fields, the mechanism of solar activities, full heliospheric space weather effects of solar activities and space weather forecasting models), then explains the space layout and system composition of the solar stereo exploration mission and the probe’s system engineering, and ends up with the mission’s payload configuration and its major technical indicators. By orbiting the ecliptic and omni-dimensional exploration of polar regions, solar stereo exploration realizes solar detection from five views, equipped China with the ability to detect the Sun in all directions and will provide high-quality data for scientific research and space weather forecasting. These achievements will promote Chinese solar physics research to a global frontier academic position and greatly improve the performance on Chinese space weather forecast. Therefore, we could realize a leapfrogged development in the field of solar exploration and give strong support for China’s innovation-driven development strategy and the construction of a strong sci-tech nation.","Yang, Mengfei;Wang, Jingxiu;Wang, Chi;Zong, Qiugang;Zhang, Xiaoxin;Dai, Shuwu;Deng, Yuanyong;Feng, Xueshang;Wang, Ying;Zhu, Chenglin;Zhang, Yechi;Zhang, Qingxiang;Shen, Fenggang;Tian, Baiyi;Zhou, Wenyan;Li, Linling;Yan, Yihua;Zhou, Guiping;Yang, Shangbin;Xiong, Ming;Zhang, Aibing;He, Jiansen;Tian, Hui;Li, Jiawei;Gan, Weiqun;Xia, Lidong;Peng, Jilong;Huang, Changning;Jiang, Jie;Quan, Lin",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2023-01-01,"Shandong University, Weihai;China Academy of Space Technology;Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunication Technology;China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation;National Satellite Meteorological Center Beijing;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;National Space Science Center;Chinese Academy of Sciences;Peking University;Beihang University;Purple Mountain Observatory Chinese Academy of Sciences;Beijing Institute of Satellite Environmental Engineering",solar activity ;  solar physics ;  solar stereo exploration ;  space weather
Virtual Electromagnetism Laboratory as a didactic strategy using situated learning approach in engineering,"Virtual laboratories (VL) have had a special interest in recent years in which immersive education is attractive to students and complements the teaching and learning processes in institutions of diverse educational levels. Although there are several types of virtual laboratories used at various educational levels, there are important challenges for their design as an ad-hoc didactic strategy. One of the main difficulties in the application of educational technology is having virtual educational environments especially dedicated to the areas of engineering, which not only present interactive practical sessions where animations are manipulated, but also encourage the metacognitive analysis of the students; in order to build an autonomous and reflective learning through educational approaches that accompany educational innovation through new technologies. This article presents the design and implementation of a Virtual Laboratory of Electromagnetism (VLE) as a didactic strategy under the situated learning approach, remotely applied to university engineering students through portable versions of the didactic tool designed with Unity® in a public university of Mexico. This research describes the context of the case study, the methodology to identify the criteria under the approach of the situated learning educational model suggested for the development of the virtual environment, the characteristics of the design through animation software, and the educational intervention implemented at the university education level. Finally, an analysis of the results obtained after the application of the laboratory is carried out by studying the perception of the university community through exit surveys.","Castro-Gutiérrez, Nereyda;Flores-Cruz, Jesús Alberto;Magallanes, Fermín Acosta",Journal,Publicaciones de la Facultad de Educacion y Humanidades del Campus de Melilla,2023-01-01,Instituto Politécnico Nacional;Universidad Veracruzana,educational technology ;  electromagnetism ;  engineering ;  immersive education ;  situated learning ;  Virtual Laboratory ;  virtual reality
"Does computation technology matter in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) projects?","Background: STEM education and research are increasingly emphasized by governments worldwide to foster national development and productivity, economic competitiveness and societal wellbeing. There is no exception in Hong Kong, with its desire to promote STEM education and to strengthen Innovation and Technology development in the future. Purpose: This study aimed to explore the STEM activities employed in primary students’ STEM projects under the theme ‘Living in a Smart City’, and to identify what and how computation technologies were generally used and to examine the differences of computation technology used among project types and award levels. Sample: 168 project reports were collected from a STEM Fair with the following areas of content: the origins of the inquiry idea; scientific/STEM theories employed; inquiry process and testing methods implemented; findings and results obtained; difficulties encountered; and students’ reflections. Design and methods: Content analysis on project reports and students’ reflections was performed. The qualitative data were coded for statistical analysis, to explore the differences in the association of the STEM activities in the projects. Analyses were supported by students’ reflections in the reports to explore students’ computation experiences. Results: Most students worked on new device projects, and projects producing new devices were more likely to integrate technological activities. On the whole, science, engineering and mathematics activities complemented each other well, with less evidence of integration with respect to technology activities. Students gained valuable knowledge and got a sense of achievement from the STEM project work. Conclusion: It is encouraging to find that students were capable of integrating STEM activities to different extents into STEM projects. It is noticed that more emphasis should be laid on promoting the infusion of computation technological activities. More attention should also be paid on providing computation technique assistance or logical explanation to students.","So, Winnie Wing Mui",Journal,Research in Science and Technological Education,2023-01-01,The Education University of Hong Kong,computation technologies ;  Integrated STEM ;  STEM activities ;  STEM projects
Genetic programming based compressive strength prediction model for green concrete,"Machine Learning (ML) has transformed the workplace in all the engineering domains. Traditionally, the lab experiments are conducted to evaluate the compressive strength of concrete however, it's have been proved to be time-consuming and labour-intensive. The high costs involved in the testing limits the number of trials and thus compromises with reliability of the construction. The study proposes state-of-art novel genetic programming (GP) based soft-computing prediction model for the estimation of the concrete compressive strength. The current focus on sustainable development goals have led to the innovations in high performance concrete from waste materials which can potentially reduce the adverse environmental impact of cement production, however, the non-linear correlation makes it difficult for the empirical relations and basic ML models to arrive at a reliable prediction model. For this purpose, a dataset of 144 trials of fly ash and silica fume concrete is taken from literature for training and testing the GP model. The GP model performs best with ten genes and a maximum tree depth of four. The population and tournament sizes have been set at 100 and 30, respectively. Crossover and mutation probabilities are 0.84 and 0.14, respectively. The GP model is authenticated using statistical parameters (R2 = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.03). The model proposes an easy-to-use equation for the prediction of compressive strength. The proposed model will save capital, labour and time along with allowing better planning since there is no need to wait for 28 long days. The models can be trained on the in-situ data and trained model can be put to use for variety of datasets in future research.","Kumar, Manish;Deepika Sree, T.

The innovation incubation ability and the operating efficiency of the innovation ecosystem of these bases were evaluated using the three-stage DEA model, and the factors affecting the operating efficiency were analyzed. Then, the effects of five environment variables (including the per capita GDP, the business volume of telecommunications service, the number of graduates, the local financial expenditure on science and technology, and the Internet penetration rate, as the explanatory variables) on the operating efficiency of the innovation ecosystem of college students' start-ups were studied by using efficiency values excluding environment variables and random factors as the explained variables, and five environment variables as the explanatory variables.","Wang, Hong",Journal,Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering,2023-01-01,Shenyang University of Technology;Liaoning Provincial Employment and Talent Service Center,college students' start-ups ;  DEA ;  efficiency evaluation ;  innovation ecosystem ;  Three-stage DEA model
Practical R-R Interval Editing for Heart Rate Variability Analysis Using Single-Channel Wearable ECG Devices,"Recent innovations in wearable devices have expanded the usage opportunities of single-channel electrocardiography (ECG) recordings in a daily life environment and enabled a variety of indirect daily activity monitoring based on heart rate variability (HRV). In general, wearable ECGs rarely undergo visual inspection by medical experts and therefore may contain noise or artifacts. Although noise/artifact-induced changes in ECG waveforms are known to cause misdetection of the QRS complex (i.e., the most distinguishable ECG components comprised of Q wave, R wave, and S wave), its complete suppression might be technically impossible. Since misdetection occurs in the QRS complex unit, we propose reframing the traditional HRV analysis flow by subdividing the R-R interval (RRI) editing into four steps in accordance with the processing detail (i.e., identification and editing) and its target unit (i.e., QRS complex or RRI). In addition, as a dubious QRS complex identification method for practical use, we utilize the amplitude at the detected point assuming the use of a single-channel wearable ECG without a reference. Initial evaluations using pseudo/real ECG datasets including ECGs with noise/artifacts show that the proposed processing/unit-based subdivision is theoretically effective for improving HRV calculation accuracy, and that the dubious QRS complex identification method for practical use also maintains this effect. Our study starting from practical HRV analysis using single-channel wearable ECG devices encourages reexamining each step in HRV analysis through the interdisciplinary research of clinical medicine and engineering/informatics that reveals the relationship of every two adjacent steps from the perspective of theory and practice.","Eguchi, Kana;Aoki, Ryosuke",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,NTT Communication Science Laboratories;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,Electrocardiography (ECG) ;  heart rate variability (HRV) ;  R-R interval (RRI) editing ;  single-channel/single-lead ;  wearable device
DIGITAL BIOETHICS AS DIGITAL HEALTH ETHICS,"Personalized medicine development includes an active use of digital products and tools for diagnosing, treating and monitoring health. This phenomenon generates such digital-related concepts as “digital health,” “Digital Medicine,” “Digital Therapeutics,” or “Digital Wellness.” Digital health includes tele- and algorithmic medicine, e-health, and mobile health. Bioethics represents a research area and social institution. Bioethics should increase the ethical support for bioethical choice subjects in the context of the social practices’ transformation in personal and public health. The article highlights the features of the subject and methodology interpretation; indicates the prospects for the development of digital bioethics. This article describes digital bioethics as digital health ethics. This interpretation differs from the understanding of digital bioethics as a field of using digital methods of empirical research. The research subject is social relations regarding confidentiality, truthfulness, trust, justice, and accountability. The entire social system is involved in the bioethical analysis, since the ethical issues of digital health are considered in a wide context of social dynamics, economic interactions, and political governance. Thus, digital bioethics is close to biopolitics. Digital bioethics uses several approaches. It refers to certain ethical theories to evaluate the results of the digital health technologies’ use. It considers different digital health-related situations through bioethical principles. It also describes the ethical harm in the digital technologies’ creation and integration in healthcare. Ethical issues are related to the social mechanisms in which they are created and used. The moral dilemmas’ resolution is seen as power relations’ manifestation. Digital bioethics analyzes the policy of various healthcare actors, the dependence of digital health on communication infrastructure and economic influence. Digital bioethics proposes to address treatment depersonalization and anonymization which represent the consequences of health and disease datafication. Digital bioethics complements empirical description of digital health practices and public health policies. On the one hand, digital bioethics is a field of digital methods’ application for studying bioethical discourse in the digital space. Thus, digital bioethics digitizes analog methods and additionally develops digital analysis methods. On the other hand, digital bioethics is defined as digital health ethics, and does not pay attention to the development of its own research methods. These two interpretations are interconnected. According to digital bioethics, ethically acceptable futures are the basis for management decisions in healthcare. This fact enhances a comprehensive transdisciplinary description of digital ethical foundations and ethical regulation mechanisms.

Idea generation and integration method for inclusion and integration teamwork,"Idea generation is fundamental in higher education, principally in engineering and creative areas. The challenge presented in our research was to correctly implement a progressive, intuitive categorization method to generate solutions, unifying individual proposals and ideas through a virtual platform or face-to-face sessions and real-time communication. This paper aims to present the implementation impact from students’ first-use perceptions and experiences, segmented by study area, gender, and semesters. Our research began with creating an idea generation method. Experienced design professionals integrated various tools to run on digital platforms. This method was called ICRI, an acronym for Ideation, Categorization, Regrouping, and Ideation. The method had two primary stages. The initial stage employed four-step where the students defined, investigated, established findings, and formed teams to move on to the second stage. This second stage comprised two parts, the first four-step where students generated ideas, reviewed, defined, and grouped them; the second five-step process involved focusing the ideas for regrouping, discussion, fusion, and writing new ideas. This method was applied to start a product design process or design strategy to create a project design. The results revealed high student acceptance of the method due to its practicality, rapidity, and functionality in generating ideas and active, equitable student participation. We found that certain students’ profiles are not optimistic about the use of such tools. Also, we found that there were no significant differences by gender of the student profile, but it was noted that female students liked the method more. The findings derived from the creation and application of the ICRI method were consequences of the need to create innovative practices to integrate higher education students. The ICRI method reinforces the trend of educational methods that address the relevance of collaborative idea generation and processes that facilitate effective interactions, even in a virtual and remote mode.","Cañizares, Juan Carlos Márquez;Rojas, Juan Carlos;Acuña, Alejandro",Journal,Frontiers in Education,2023-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,design ;  educational innovation ;  higher education ;  ideas generation ;  professional education ;  teamwork
Women in Forestry Engineering School,"In the last decade of the 20th century, study plans leading to the title of Technical Forestry Engineer were implemented in different Spanish universities, including the Vigo University. Many of these titles arose within agricultural or civil engineering schools, the Pontevedra School is being the only one that, together with Madrid, maintained its purely forestry character. With the adaptation to the European Higher Education Area, these plans were generally transformed into Degrees in Forestry Engineering or Degrees in Forestry and Natural Environment Engineering. The Pontevedra School of Forestry Engineering conceives of itself as a teaching, research and knowledge transfer center, strongly in demand for decades by Pontevedra society and integrated into what is known as the “Pontevedra Forestry Pole”. The Center is strongly committed to scientific research and innovation and the transfer. This paper analyzes the role of women in the School of Forestry Engineering of the University of VIGO, for which the indicators and profiles of students, teachers and administration and service staff will be analyzed.

How to Flip a Classroom? Project Based and Collaborative Learning with Learner-Centered Methods and Its Impact on Technical Teacher Education,"Creating a collaborative learning environment is one of the most important school tasks today. It is necessary both to shape the attitudes of prospective teachers and to broaden their methodological knowledge, so that learning based on student activity can be implemented at all levels of education, including in vocational training. This study presents the collaborative learning environment and methods and tasks that are part of a didactic module developed within the framework of an international program. The primary goal is to develop the methodological approach of teachers teaching STEM subjects, and to get to know the characteristics of planning, forms of work and different methods and the possibilities of using them in lessons, not only in theory but also in practice through their own experiences. To complete the module, engineering teacher and technical vocational students are organized into small groups and work on a project assignment over a semester on the topic of student-centered methods. In parallel, they learn and work on other collaborative methods and a variety of tasks on other topics (flipped classroom, cooperative methods, mind mapping, film analysis, etc.) and thus move towards the main theme of the project (learner-centered methods). The groups take full responsibility for the implementation of their projects, which is documented. To track effectiveness, the study identifies pre- and post-trial methodological approaches and knowledge through mixed-method research. The results of follow-up studies so far (qualitative data) show that the project, the flipped classroom and the collaborative learning process have a positive impact on students’teacher awareness, innovation and planning skills. The flipped classroom has attracted a lot of attention and different opinions, so we look at the factors that influence students’ opinions and satisfaction. The results of follow-up studies so far (qualitative data) show that the project, the flipped classroom and the collaborative learning process have a positive impact on students’teacher awareness, innovation and planning skills. Learning embedded in a similar activity is a good way to prepare teacher students to acquire and support the soft skills expected in the labor market, such as collaboration. We recommend that student-centered collaborative and other supportive methods be incorporated into teacher training at the university as part of a separate didactic subject.","Tomory, Ibolya",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,Obuda University,Collaborative learning ;  Flipped classroom ;  Learner-centered methods ;  Project ;  Technical teacher training
The Role of Group Project-Based Learning in Engineering Training,"Reforming education, changing its role and priorities, stimulating scientific research and innovation has led to the need to find new models of engineering training. In these conditions group project-based learning for both students and engineering teachers seems to be promising. With this in mind, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the specifics of group project-based learning in engineering training and to develop a toolkit for building a graduate profile based on assessments of various key stakeholders. The paper analyzes the opinion of experts, the results of questionnaire survey and interviewing of teachers and students of engineering specialties of universities and colleges in different regions of Kazakhstan about the role of group project-based learning in the integration of engineering educational programs with industry, the results of students’ self-assessment of their competencies and skills formed in the process of learning. The results of students’ self-assessment and expert assessment ranking allowed to identify five main groups of competencies. Groups 1 and 2 contain interdisciplinary competences, group 3 - organizational competences, self-reflection and control competences, professional and didactic competences, group 4 includes mainly communication and teamwork competences, group 5 - information and analytical competences. The approach used in the work allows highlighting those competences and skills which are underdeveloped within the educational program. The good correlation between the results of students’ self-assessment of their formed competences and skills in the process of group project-based learning and the results of expert assessment allows us to consider the method of group project-based learning effective and reliable in maintaining educational goals and achieving the best results in engineers’ training. The application of the organizational forms, methods, and tools of group project-based learning proposed in the article allowed us to propose a model of graduate profile creation adapted to the constantly changing requirements for specialists’ qualifications and gradation of their skills.","Karstina, Svetlana",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,Buketov Karagandy University,Engineering education ;  Project-based learning ;  Skills and competencies
Investigation of design of independent metro station entrances in China,"In recent years, China has extensively made use of underground space, and with the rapid development of metros, more than 40 cities have opened rail transit. However, a problem has also emerged in the form and function of entrances to metro stations. Unlike countries of the West, Chinese design has developed under the historical background of rapid social and economic development and transformation. The design of entrances to metro stations mostly stays at the level of satisfying functions; many spaces adopt similar designs, lack innovative ideas and fail to spread urban culture and improve city visibility. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and research on entrances to Chinese metro stations and proposes design concepts suitable for China's national conditions to stand out as examples for many metro stations that will be built in future. This paper investigates and analyses the entrances of independent metro stations in China, explores the problems in independent metro stations and proposes the corresponding solutions. Finally, the design concept of entrances to metro stations is discussed in terms of exterior and interior spaces.","Liang, Xing;Lu, Zhuoran;Ye, Fei;Zhang, Wenjun",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Municipal Engineer,2023-01-01,Manchester School of Architecture;Chang'an University;Tianjin University,Buildings ;  Bus stations ;  innovation and infrastructure ;  Municipal & public service engineering ;  Rail ;  Structures design ;  UN SDG 9: Industry
Raspberry Pi-Based Low-Cost System for Electrical Parameters Gathering and Analysis for Performance Evaluation of Electric Vehicles,"In recent years, both the manufacture and sales of electric vehicles have significantly grown compared with traditional vehicles. This growth has favored the creation of tools that measure and evaluate this class of vehicles' mechanical and electrical operation quickly, simply, and efficiently. Nevertheless, the measurement of electric vehicle parameters can be a challenge due to the fact that the required data acquisition (DAQ) equipment is expensive and thus of limited availability. This work describes a low-cost data acquisition system to simplify and reduce the cost of measuring the current and voltage parameters of electric vehicles. The proposed system is based on a Raspberry PI 3b+ microcomputer and it was evaluated during different driving cycles. The results were compared with the data obtained using a professional Dewesoft Sirius system for validation. The Raspberry Pi-based low-cost system achieved comparable performance to commercial systems (with a measurement error of less than 1%), despite having a lower sampling rate. Furthermore, unlike other systems, the proposed platform is an easy-to-set universal solution that can store the measured data, display them in real-time, graph them, and export the information for analysis with other specialized statistical tools. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that the proposed low-cost DAQ system can be easily cloned, and the components' cost of the prototype is about 10 times less than the price of the commercial systems.","Guagalango-Gomez, Pablo Javier;Balbuena-Campuzano, Carlos Alberto;Chunab-Rodriguez, Marco Antonio;Rodriguez-Arce, Jorge;Vinolas, Jordi;Santana-Diaz, Alfredo",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2023-01-01,Universidad Francisco de Vitoria;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México,Data acquisition (DAQ) ;  educational innovation ;  electric vehicles ;  electrical parameters ;  engineering research ;  higher education ;  professional education
Comparative advantages and application of polymer-based materials: Prioritizing natural fibres as reinforcement in building structures,"Climate change and uncertainties in energy transition continue to increase the risk of environmental pollutions. The need for new materials derivable from organic materials have opened several new frontiers in research and innovation. Polymer-based materials (PBMs), considering its versatility, have shown their potentials in engineering structures and, the results are promising and far-reaching. PBMs possesses excellent thermal, mechanical and chemical properties, which necessitated significant research interest in these materials, resulting in their involvement in building and construction works. However, as their needs widened, spanning all human endeavours, it therefore important to establish how best these materials could be deplored in the face of climate change. Part of what is necessary as we explore these materials, is to report how best these materials could be applicable in building and construction works due to their low thermal conductivity’s values and their biodegradability properties. The application of natural fibres is noticeable everywhere with possibility of being used the more if containment measures are put in place to reduce its vulnerability. This review paper x-rays the natural fibre materials as a reliable reinforcement in building structure and this assertion is premised on its peculiarities and thermal properties. As established in many published papers, natural fibre is of lower thermal conductivities values, compared with other materials in building reinforcements. This discussion would be all encompassing, providing details on how natural fibre could assist in energy conservation in building and equally saves considerable cost in construction works.","Adekomaya, Oludaisi;Majozi, Thokozani",Journal,Engineering and Applied Science Research,2023-01-01,School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering,Building ;  Natural fibre ;  Polymer ;  Structures ;  Thermal conductivity

Short communication: To speed or not to speed? The impact of market type and the COVID pandemic,"Rapidly developing and bring an innovation to market (innovation speed) should have positive effects on performance. Yet innovation and technology management literature also suggests that faster innovation speed may lead to higher innovation failures in some scenarios. We investigate the value of innovation speed in four market scenarios: established markets before and during the COVID pandemic and emergent markets before and during the COVID pandemic. The study findings indicate that the pandemic has major implications for the value of innovation speed. In established markets where customer needs are well defined, rapid innovation increases performance before the pandemic; yet fast innovation speed leads to worst performance during the pandemic. In emergent markets where customer needs are still being formed, before the pandemic, the effect of innovation speed on performance is U-shaped (that is, slow or rapid innovation speed is better than moderate innovation speeds). In contrast, increasing innovation speed always leads to higher performance during the pandemic and innovation is most successful at very fast innovation speed. We present top ten success factors for managing innovation speed before and during the pandemic. The research findings are applicable for the post-pandemic new normal. The study also advances the engineering and technology management literature.","Zhang, Haili;Song, Michael",Journal,Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M,2023-01-01,Xi'an Technological University,COVID pandemic ;  Emergent markets ;  Established markets ;  Innovation speed ;  Performance

System of directed loading and rupture of borehole walls for stress assessment in rock mass,"Reliable information on the stress–strain behavior of rock mass is one of the top-priority tasks within applied geomechanics and geocontrol. This information enjoys wide application at the project stages and during implementation of all process flows included in mine construction, mineral mining and operation of various-purpose underground structures. Intelligence on the quality and quantity characteristics of stresses in the crust takes a perceptible part in prediction of possible dynamic events, as well as in selection and optimization of solutions on the technique and technology in ground control and stability of mining system structures. The developed procedure of directed loading and rupture of borehole walls for the stress assessment in rock mass can decrease labor content of measurements and increase their timeliness, and can provide the objective information on natural stresses to predict hazardous events induced by rock pressure and to backup geomechanical calculations with the required parameters. Considering the fact that the value of pressure applied by the developed system on the borehole walls in appearance of the Kaiser effect conforms with the value of stresses in intact rock mass, the proposed procedure can enable automated processing of data to eliminate errors and reduce the analysis time.

Research on Evaluation of Scientific and Technological Innovation Efficiency in Chinese Universities-An Analysis Based on Sample Data of 31 Provinces,"20112020 is a golden decade of innovation-driven development for China. During this period, scientific and technological innovation (STI) of Chinese universities has achieved historic development. To better capture its innovation trajectory and shed light on practical implications, this study uses DEA-BCC model and Malmquist index to calculate the STI efficiency of Chinese universities in 31 provinces and municipalities from 2011 to 2020. The findings illustrate that: 1) the barrier effect of pure technical efficiency is greater than that of scale efficiency; 2) although the STI efficiency of Chinese universities increased by 0.6% on average, the contribution rate of technological progress growth was high, and the scale efficiency showed negative growth; 3) in terms of regional distribution, DEA efficient provinces and cities are concentrated in northern China, while non DEA efficient provinces and cities are mostly concentrated in southern China. Based on the findings, countermeasures and suggestions are made to improve the STI efficiency for Chinese universities from the aspects of scientific innovation alliance, evaluation mechanism and innovation management ability. It provides a theoretical and practical reference for innovation-driven development of Chinese universities.","Zhao, Xi;Chen, Mengyao;Long, Chengming;Zhao, Jiaxing;Wang, Shuangguo",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,ECUST School of Business;Hefei University;Nanjing Tech University,Chinese universities ;  DEA-BCC model ;  Malmquist index ;  scientific and technological innovation efficiency
Effects of ATDE Teaching Mode during Online Teaching on Creative Thinking Ability of Learners,"Online teaching based on computer and network technology has become a vital teaching mode under the current situation of the overwhelming COVID-19 epidemic. Teachers and students who fully understand and master basic knowledge and skills of various information technologies in online learning can stimulate students’ interest in learning information technology and train their ability in information collection, processing, and use. Given the lack of face-to-face communication and deep emotional exchange, online teaching has poor performance in improving the creative thinking ability of learners. During online teaching, teachers train the innovation consciousness quality of students in online courses successfully and improve the creative thinking ability of learners by using “asking,” “thinking,” “doing,” and “evaluation,” that is, the ATDE teaching mode. In this study, a teaching experiment was carried out on 41 undergraduates admitted in 2018 who majored in civil engineering at Zhengzhou University of Industrial Technology, Henan Province, China. Students were divided into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group adopted the ATDE teaching mode for the course Design of concrete structure, while the control group applied the traditional teaching mode. A questionnaire survey of students’ creative thinking ability was conducted for both groups. Results showed that university students’ creative, emotional attitude under the ATDE teaching mode was far higher than that under the traditional (F=6.490, p=0.015). The creative thinking performance of university students under the ATDE teaching mode was higher than that under the traditional teaching mode (F=7.468, p=0.009). The Pearson correlation coefficient between creative, emotional attitude and creative thinking performance was 0.985 in the late test stage, which was higher than in the early test stage (0.480), which reveals that the ATDE teaching mode was conducive to improving abstract course learning effect of students majoring in civil engineering. Research conclusions can provide some references to investigate the feasibility of ATDE teaching mode in universities and offer a new choice and feasible path to train students’ creative thinking ability","Lv, Xinwei;Wu, Yamin;Cui, Xiuli",Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2023-01-01,Yellow River Conservancy Technical Institute;Zhengzhou University,ATDE teaching mode ;  creative thinking ability ;  learners ;  Online teaching ;  paired-sample T test ;  variance test
Shale Oil Development and Utilization and Its Role in Energy Industry,"Shale oil boom in the United States has catapulted it from an importer of crude oil to a net exporter. Field applications show that both the shift in exploration paradigm from finding traps to targeting resource-rich petroleum source kitchens (i.e., “sweet spots”) and the technological innovation represented by horizontal well multi-stage fracturing are among the key factors for the large-scale development of shale oil in the United States. Compared with marine shale oils in North America, China’s lacustrine shale oil resources have great potential, but the endowment conditions are not optimal. Early exploration and development experience shows that the adaptive technology for lacustrine shale oil needs to be solved urgently. Under the continuous efforts of the petroleum industry and relevant scientific research institutions, China has achieved partial breakthroughs in the shale oil development and utilization, and more efforts are now on the way to make greater strike. Once the production potential and commercial productivity are realized, shale oil revolution will spread in China and change the domestic energy landscape. Several policy suggestions are made on the shale oil development and utilization in China, based on the global trend analysis and a comparative study of the geological and engineering characteristics of shale oils in China and the United States.","Guo, Xusheng;Li, Maowen;Zhao, Mengyun",Journal,Bulletin of Chinese Academy of Sciences,2023-01-01,Sinopec;China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation;State Center for Research and Development of Oil Shale Exploitation;State Key Laboratory of Shale Oil and Gas Enrichment Mechanisms and Effective Development,China ;  development and utilization ;  energy security ;  energy system ;  policy proposal ;  shale oil

Study on the spatial spillover effects of capital enrichment on industrial green technology innovation in China,"In the context of the strategic target of carbon emission peaking and carbon neutrality, industrial green technology innovation (GTI) has become the focus of discussion in academia these days. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2019, we construct Spatial Durbin Models to explore the spatial effects of capital enrichment (CE) on GTI by using the geographical distance matrix, the economic distance matrix and the adjacency matrix. The results reveal that: (1) The regional differences in the development of GTI are prominent, showing a higher level in the east and lower in the west. (2) GTI exhibits the spatial characteristic of polarization. Its spatiotemporal evolutionary pattern reveals a phased feature of first strengthened and then weakened. (3) The CE has a significant inhibitory effect on GTI, which may be caused by the 'rebound effect', dominated by short-term economic interests and the ineffective capital allocation. This effect is more prominent in regions with unbalanced economies. (4) The spatial spillover effect of CE is significantly negative, indicating a 'siphon effect'. Based on these findings, the suggestions for promoting GTI are put forward.","Lina, Ma;Hao, Ma;Yang, Zhang;Iqbal, Najaf",Journal,Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems,2023-01-01,Anhui University of Finance and Economics;Wuhan Textile University;Jiangsu University,Capital enrichment ;  green technology innovation ;  low-carbon economy ;  spatial spillover effect ;  spatio-temporal evolution

The Influence of Organizational Social Network on Enterprise Collaborative Innovation-Mediating Role of Knowledge Sharing and Moderating Effect of Digital Construction,"This paper mainly discusses the influence of organizational social network on enterprise collaborative innovation, as well as the intermediary role of knowledge sharing and the regulatory role of digital construction. Based on social exchange theory and social cognition theory, an integration model of organizational social network influencing enterprise collaborative innovation is constructed. The hierarchical regression analysis was used to sample the high-tech enterprises in China's Yangtze River Delta. Statistical analysis of 212 questionnaires was performed using SPSS and AMOS. It is found that organizational social network has a significant positive impact on enterprise collaborative innovation. Knowledge sharing plays a partially mediating role in the relationship between the organizational social network and enterprise collaborative innovation. Digital construction positively moderates the relationship between organizational social network and enterprise collaborative innovation. In general, In general, the research findings show that improving the construction of organizational social networks and enhancing employees' knowledge sharing behavior can improve enterprises' collaborative innovation ability. In addition, in the context of highly digital construction, the effect of organizational social networks on improving enterprise collaborative innovation is more obvious.","Miao, Bin;Liang, Yingjie;Suo, Yueyue",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power,digital construction ;  enterprise collaborative innovation ;  knowledge sharing ;  Organizational social network
Research on Judgment and Solving Strategy of Flow Problems in Complex Engineering Systems,"Frequent processes of mutual transfer and transformation generally take place between the material flow, the energy flow, and the information flow in complex engineering systems, and complex coupling relationships exist between the different flows. Abnormal coupling of flows will cause flow problems, which can easily lead to the failure of the system functions. To address these problems, in this study, the starting point has been taken as the change in the attributes and types of the study flow, the attributes of the flows have been categorized, and a flow transfer and transformation model, oriented to the flow problem analysis has been proposed. Secondly, based on the analysis of the effect of the attribute changes of flows in complex engineering systems on the generation of flow problems, an innovatively introduced information processing mathematical tool, the polychromatic sets theory, has been used to explore and determine the flow problems existing in complex engineering systems. Further, depending on the different manifestations of flow problems, three solution strategies have been proposed. Finally, the process model of the flow problem judgment and a solution strategy for complex engineering systems has been constructed. The feasibility of the process model has been verified by considering the engineering case of the tubular feeding machine (TFM) system of a large-scale integrated marine resource survey ship.","Zhang, Jianhui;Li, Jianyong;Pu, Xuejie;Wang, Xuerui",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,Hebei University of Technology;Treolica (Tianjin) Company Ltd,Complex engineering system ;  flow problem judgment ;  polychromatic sets ;  solving strategy ;  tubular feeding machine (TFM) system
Success Factors of the Adoption of Smart Factory Transformation: An Examination of Korean Manufacturing SMEs,"A smart factory is a fully automated production system enabled with novel digital technologies. Numerous studies consider its emergence as the arrival of a new wave of production innovation. However, research is scant on why its adoption rate has lagged behind the expectations of investors and policymakers. Thus, this study examined the effect of top management support for information systems, the existing production systems, the perceived usefulness of smart factories, and outsourcing experiences on firms' intention to adopt smart factories. Using the data of 1,067 Korean manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises and structural equation modeling, this study finds that the performance of the existing production systems significantly increases the benefits expected from smart production systems, thus strengthening firms' intention to adopt smart factories. It also finds that the top management's support for information systems does not have a significant impact on the benefits expected from smart production systems. Furthermore, the overall mechanism of smart factories' adoption is strengthened when firms develop their production systems in-house. The results of this study provide useful insights for practitioners seeking to transform traditional production systems into smart factories. They also provide a strategic guideline regarding outsourcing experiences.","Jung, Sungwook;Kim, Donghee;Shin, Nina",Journal,IEEE Access,2023-01-01,Sejong University;Seoul National University;Incheon National University,Industry 4.0 ;  Korean SMEs ;  smart factory ;  smart factory transformation ;  smart production system ;  structural equation modeling ;  top management support
Does intrinsic motivation mediate perceived artificial intelligence (AI) learning and computational thinking of students during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.","Martín-Núñez, José Luis;Ar, Anil Yasin;Fernández, Rodrigo Pérez;Abbas, Asad;Radovanović, Danica",Journal,Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence,2023-01-01,"Tecnológico de Monterrey, Querétaro;Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Universitetet i Oslo;Tecnológico de Monterrey",Artificial intelligence ;  Computational thinking ;  COVID-19 ;  E-learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  SDG 4 ;  Soft skills
Scientific Method’s Application Contexts for the Development and Evaluation of Research Skills in Higher-Education Learners,"The evolution of curricula in recent decades has given rise to multiple ways of teaching the task of experimental science, through which research skills are developed. In this learning gain process, teaching the systematized steps of the scientific method has been of invaluable help. In this study, we wanted to determine under what contexts of the last century the knowledge of the scientific method has encouraged the development of research skills in higher education learners. Through a literature review yielding nineteen empirical articles in the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases between 2000 and 2022, it was found that the scientific method is rarely mentioned and is more often referred to as a set of steps or structures to solve a problem, a challenge, or to carry out an investigation or an assigned task. Problem-solving and critical thinking were the two most-cited skills developed through the knowledge and practice of the scientific method. There are skills developed in theoretical classes and others that can be developed in practical courses such as laboratories or field work. A gap was found in the literature on using the scientific method and developing research skills in learners of non-science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The findings of this review lead studies to determine and compare whether effectively teaching students the scientific method improves their understanding and development of research skills in STEM and non-STEM areas.","Vázquez-Villegas, Patricia;Mejía-Manzano, Luis Alberto;Sánchez-Rangel, Juan Carlos;Membrillo-Hernández, Jorge",Journal,Education Sciences,2023-01-01,Universidad de Colima;Tecnológico de Monterrey,challenge-based learning ;  critical thinking ;  educational innovation ;  engineering ;  higher education ;  mathematics ;  problem-solving ;  science ;  STEM ;  technology
The Knowledge Sharing Capability in Innovative Behavior: A SEM Approach from Graduate Students’ Insights,"The capability to share knowledge is considered one of the most relevant components of knowledge management. Moreover, there is little empirical evidence indicating how future human resources in the construction industry value the richness of knowledge sharing and the richness of their innovative behavior. The purposes of this study are (1) to determine which facilitators, from the point of view of master’s degree students related to engineering and construction management in Spain, most substantially influence knowledge sharing capability; (2) to test whether knowledge sharing capability (KS) positively influences innovative behavior (IB); and (3) demonstrating whether organizational innovation climate (OIC) is a factor that moderates the relationship between KS and IB. In this research, we have proposed a theoretical model and empirically tested the model in a sample of 253 master’s degree students in public universities in Spain. The findings support the proposed model, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) evaluation suggests that, among all the facilitators of KS, information and communication technologies (ICT) stand out among the other facilitators and have a more significant influence on KS. Furthermore, the research found a direct correlation between KS and IB and causal links between OIC and IB.","Yepes, Víctor;López, Salvador",Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2023-01-01,Universitat Politècnica de València,graduate students ;  innovation climate ;  innovative behavior ;  knowledge sharing capability ;  knowledge sharing facilitators ;  SEM
Indian Biosimilars and Vaccines at Crossroads–Replicating the Success of Pharmagenerics,"Background: The global pharma sector is fast shifting from generics to biologics and biosimilars with the first approval in Europe in 2006 followed by US approval in 2015. In the form of Hepatitis B vaccine, India saw its first recombinant biologics approval in 2000. Around 20% of generic medications and 62% of vaccines are now supplied by the Indian pharmaceutical industry. It is this good position in biologics and biosimilars production that could potentially improve healthcare via decreased treatment cost. India has witnessed large investments in biosimilars over the years. Numerous India-bred new players, e.g., Enzene Biosciences Ltd., are keen on biosimilars and have joined the race alongside the emerging giants, e.g., Biocon and Dr. Reddy’s. A very positive sign was the remarkable disposition during the COVID-19 pandemic by Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India. India’s biopharmaceutical industry has been instrumental in producing and supplying preventives and therapeutics to fight COVID-19. Despite a weak supply chain and workforce pressure, the production was augmented to provide reasonably priced high-quality medications to more than 133 nations. Biosimilars could cost-effectively treat chronic diseases involving expensive conventional therapies, including diabetes, respiratory ailments, cancer, and connective tissue diseases. Biologics and biosimilars have been and are being tested to treat and manage COVID-19 symptoms characterized by inflammation and respiratory distress. Purpose of review: Although India boasts many universities, research centers, and a relatively skilled workforce, its global University–Industry collaboration ranking is 24, IPR ranking remains 47 and innovation ranking 39. This reveals a wide industry-academia gap to bridge. There are gaps in effective translational research in India that must be promptly and appropriately addressed. Innovation demands strong and effective collaborations among universities, techno-incubators, and industries. Methodology: Many successful research findings in academia do not get translation opportunities supposedly due to low industrial collaboration, low IP knowledge, and publication pressure with stringent timelines. In light of this, a detailed review of literature, including policy papers, government initiatives, and corporate reviews, was carried out, and the compilation and synthesis of the secondary data were meticulously summarized for the easy comprehension of the facts and roadmap ahead. For easy comprehension, charts, figures, and compiled tables are presented. Results: This review assesses India’s situation in the biosimilar space, the gaps and areas to improve for Indian investment strategies, development, and innovation, addressing need for a more skilled workforce, industrial collaboration, and business models. Conclusions: This review also proposes forward an approach to empowering technopreneurs to develop MSMEs for large-scale operations to support India in taking innovative thoughts to the global level to ultimately realize a self-reliant India. The limitations of the compilation are also highlighted towards the end.","Panda, Sunita;Singh, Puneet Kumar;Mishra, Snehasish;Mitra, Sagnik;Pattnaik, Priyabrata;Adhikary, Sanjib Das;Mohapatra, Ranjan K.",Journal,Vaccines,2023-01-01,"Indian Institute of Technology Indore;Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar;Penn State College of Medicine;Merck Electronics Pte Ltd.;Government College of Engineering",healthcare scenario ;  human resource ;  Indian biosimilars ;  pharmagenerics ;  visionary perspective

Analysis of the First Metallic Works That Represented a Geometric Innovation in Their Architectural Application: The Origin of the Architecture-Engineering Dichotomy,"This research analyses the geometric modifications and improvements that the application of the technique of metallurgy meant for architecture. In the early days of engineering and without having the historical burden that architecture bore, the small variations in the classical definition of geometry meant the greatest advances at a structural and conceptual level in the world of metal structures. The use of metal as a structural element capable of containing new uses and responding to the great challenges that progress required was definitive for the development of the new architecture and paradigms of the new century. The new metallic materials and their mathematical and constructive models were the cause and effect of what would be the basis of the great change in modern architecture and engineering and would lay the foundations of today’s world. The interaction of these two new disciplines, architecture and engineering, and their relationship with metal is the basis of this research, which aims to find out where, when, and how these geometric changes took place that started to change the conception of metal structures.","Rueda Márquez de la Plata, Adela;Cruz Franco, Pablo Alejandro",Journal,Metals,2023-01-01,Universidad de Extremadura,19th century ;  geometric application ;  geometry ;  industrial revolution ;  metal structures ;  structural heritage

"The Spatial Effect and Threshold Characteristics of Green Technological Innovation on the Environmental Pollution of Thermal Power, etc., Air Pollution-Intensive Industrial Agglomeration in China","Serious air pollution has occurred in China since 2012. With the increasing investment in technological innovation in China, the role of green technological innovation in reducing air pollution has attracted more and more attention. By constructing the spatial Durbin model and threshold regression model and using the statistical data of China’s provinces, this study explores the spatial effects and threshold characteristics of China’s green technology innovation on the environmental pollution of China’s air pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration. The research objective is to find out the spatial effects and threshold characteristics of green technology innovation on the environmental pollution of China’s air pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration. The results show that thermal power, etc., air pollution-intensive industrial are important sources of sulfur dioxide emissions; however, their degree of concentration is gradually increasing, resulting in rising sulfur dioxide emissions in these areas. When the level of green technological innovation is greater than 8.0523, its inhibition effect on sulfur dioxide emissions in these industries is significantly increased. Improving green technology innovation ability in thermal power, etc., air pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration areas can effectively reduce pollution in the atmosphere. The level of green technology innovation in key zones must be increased to adjust the concentration of pollution-intensive industries, improve China’s industrial structure, and reduce atmospheric environment pollution.","Zhou, Jingkun;Li, Yating;Tian, Juan;Ma, Zhifei",Journal,Processes,2023-01-01,Wuzhou University;Ludong University;Xinyang Normal University;Guangxi University;Hebei University of Economics and Business,green technology innovation ;  industrial agglomeration ;  pollution-intensive industry ;  spatial Durbin model ;  threshold regression model
Effect of Impeller Trimming on the Energy Efficiency of the Counter-Rotating Pumping Stage,"Developing ways to increase centrifugal pumps’ pressure and power characteristics is a critical problem in up-to-date engineering. There are many ways to resolve it, but each has advantages and flaws. The presented article aimed to ensure higher energy efficiency indicators by using a counter-rotating pumping stage with trimming. During the research, the comprehensive approach was based on CFD modeling and the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse approach for overestimated systems. According to the obtained data, pumps with a counter-rotating stage allowed the pressure head to be significantly increased compared with the standard design of the flow part. Notably, for pumping units CPS 180/1900 with a basic stage, the pressure head of 127 m was reached. However, when using a counter-rotating stage, the pressure head could be increased up to 270 m, which was 2.1 times higher. Therefore, to ensure unchanged characteristics when using centrifugal pumps with the counter-rotating stage, the weight and size indicators can be significantly reduced compared to the traditional design scheme. The proposed numerical and analytical approaches allow estimating the highest pressure and energy characteristics values.","Pavlenko, Ivan;Kulikov, Oleksandr;Ratushnyi, Oleksandr;Ivanov, Vitalii;Piteľ, Ján;Kondus, Vladyslav",Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2023-01-01,Technická Univerzita v Košiciach;Sumy State University,centrifugal pump ;  energy efficiency ;  power consumption ;  process innovation
"An Introduction to Human Resources for Development and Innovation, Science Transformation into Industry Infrastructure by China’s New Universities: A Case Study of Green Materials","The connection of universities with new knowledge in various sciences leads to entrepreneurship and the progress of the economic development of universities. Countries with higher education institutions, in the shadow of practical research and development, are trying to strengthen the economic structure and entrepreneurship, and conduct basic research. Besides, higher education institutions are building science parks and implementing high-tech projects jointly with industry. New materials such as PVC and concrete have been created through scientific evolution between innovators and industry workers, which can be used as one of the most useful building materials. Among the advantages of these materials, we can point out their low cost compared to the high volume of their use, which has attracted the attention of most engineers, designers, employers, innovators and entrepreneurs. In this regard, the construction industry is also a huge consumer of natural resources and at the same time a waste producer, which is solved by this number of graduate students. In this article, we intend to investigate the engineering properties and environmental effects of green materials prepared with PVC waste powder using designers, innovators and entrepreneurial ideas. Many studies have been conducted on the chemical decomposition of PVC to transform PVC into other products, so investigating the possibility of recycling PVC and reusing it in the production cycle is an important issue in the discussion of waste. One of the proposed ways is to replace river sand with PVC waste to prepare concrete, which can be considered one of the environmentally friendly activities of employers, innovators and entrepreneurs. The obtained results show that there is a great demand for the production of natural materials as non-renewable materials with better support for the economy of countries such as China or with high waste.","Qin, Shengyang;Duan, Xinxing;Khandan, A.

OpenCare5G: O-RAN in Private Network for Digital Health Applications,"Digital Health is a new way for medicine to work together with computer engineering and ICT to carry out tests and obtain reliable information about the health status of citizens in the most remote places in Brazil in near-real time, applying new technologies and digital tools in the process. InovaHC is the technological innovation core of the Clinics Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo (HCFMUSP). It is the first national medical institution to seek new opportunities offered by 5G technology and test its application in the first private network for Digital Health in the largest hospital complex in Latin America through the OpenCare5G Project. This project uses an Open RAN concept and network disaggregation with lower costs than the traditional concept used by the telecommunications industry. The technological project connected to the 5G network was divided into two phases for proof-of-concept testing: the first with an initial focus on carrying out examinations with portable ultrasound equipment in different locations at HCFMUSP, and the second focusing on carrying out remote examinations with health professionals in other states of Brazil, who will be working in remote areas in other states with little or no ICT infrastructure together with a doctor analyzing exams in real time at HCFMUSP in São Paulo. The objective of the project is to evaluate the connectivity and capacity of the 5G private network in these the proof-of-concept tests for transmitting the volume of data from remote exams with higher speed and lower latency. We are in the first phase of the proof of concept testing to achieve the expected success. This project is a catalyst for innovation in health, connecting resources and entrepreneurs to generate solutions for the innovation ecosystem of organizations. It is coordinated by Deloitte with the participation of the Escola Politécnica da USP (The School of Engineering—University of São Paulo), Airspan, Itaú Bank, Siemens Healthineers, NEC, Telecom Infra Projet, ABDI and IDB. The use of 5G Open RAN technology in public health is concluded to be of extreme social, economic, and fundamental importance for HCFMUSP, citizens, and the development of health research to promote great positive impacts ranging from attracting investment in the country to improving the quality of patient care.","de Oliveira, Wagner;Batista, José Olimpio Rodrigues;Novais, Tiago;Takashima, Silvio Toshiyuki;Stange, Leonardo Roccon;Martucci, Moacyr;Cugnasca, Carlos Eduardo;Bressan, Graça",Journal,Sensors,2023-01-01,Meta;Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu;Universidade de São Paulo;NEC Latin America S.A.,5G ;  B5G ;  digital health ;  Open RAN ;  private network
Research Ethics and Research Ethics Committees in Europe,"In Europe, the topics of “research ethics” and “ethics committees” are becoming increasingly present in publications, university seminars, public debate, but also in connection with codes of conduct of companies or non-governmental organisations. The reasons for this are to be found in particular in the fact that technological developments are dramatically changing society and nature. This is because natural boundaries are being shifted or overcome, which raises the question of new moral boundaries in order to control or minimise the negative consequences or risks of the application of technologies. Morality thus becomes the “price of modernity” that societies have to pay through increasing dissolution of boundaries in the form of self-limitations. Ethical reflections structure this field of possible normative reorganisations and can contribute to opening up the attitudes of actors in order to articulate ethical self-obligations independently of legal regulations. For the field of science and research, an ethos of researchers would ideally emerge as a common scientific ethos before state-imposed legal regulations intervene to regulate. Currently, in addition to new methods, for example in genetic engineering (e.g., genome editing through Cripr-Cas9), the challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19), the focus is particularly on information technology research and innovations. Data collection, automation as well as robotic and autonomous systems based on AI are significantly changing not only biomedical research, but also medical practice and healthcare systems. Moreover, these developments are not selective or regionally limited, but rather encounter internationally linked societies. With a global view of the ethical debates, however, one also recognises different views of values and norms, which can vary in detail even within Europe despite many moral commonalities. This is already the case, for example, with the ideas about the appropriate handling of personal data. In addition to the ethical debates on new fields of research and their applications, a system of ethical consultation by ethics committees has been established worldwide within the scientific community for medical research. Against the background of abusive medical research, not only under the Nazi regime in Germany, the involvement of ethics committees is intended to ensure compliance with ethical standards. The importance of the work of ethics committees is not exhausted in the review of the protection of human participants who make themselves available for research purposes, but also represents a genuine contribution to stabilising the moral credibility of research. Ethics committees are therefore often also addressed as “intermediary institutions” between science and society, which contribute to social trust in research and contribute to the ethical infrastructure of a research institution. The procedures of ethical evaluations of research projects in Europe are increasingly expanding to other disciplines, guided by the example of ethics committees in medicine. In particular, when personal data are processed, for example in social science or psychological projects, funding organisations or publication bodies often consider ethical consultation to be appropriate. Nevertheless, the procedures for this are only uniformly regulated in a few European countries. In contrast, the instrument of the new EU regulation for clinical trials intends to standardise the work of medical research ethics committees in Europe through clear deadlines and a central electronic EU portal. However, since the European legislator has left the member states freedom of implementation with regard to the competence of the ethics committee, there will probably be differences between the procedures in the member states, especially with regard to the scope of the ethical review. The chapter gives an overview about this recent European debate in a global context.","Lanzerath, Dirk",Book Series,Philosophy and Medicine,2023-01-01,Universität Bonn,
Team Science Principles Enhance Cancer Care Delivery Quality Improvement: Interdisciplinary Implementation of Breast Cancer Screening Shared Decision Making,"PURPOSE:Implementing shared decision making (SDM), recommended in screening mammography by national guidelines for women age 40-49 years, faces challenges that innovations in quality improvement and team science (TS) are poised to address. We aimed to improve the effectiveness, patient-centeredness, and efficiency of SDM in primary care for breast cancer screening.METHODS:Our interdisciplinary team included primary and specialty care, psychology, epidemiology, communication science, engineering, and stakeholders (patients and clinicians). Over a 6-year period, we executed two iterative cycles of plan-do-study-act (PDSA) to develop, revise, and implement a SDM tool using TS principles. Patient and physician surveys and retrospective analysis of tool performance informed our first PDSA cycle. Patient and physician surveys, toolkit use, and clinical outcomes in the second PDSA cycle supported SDM implementation. We gathered team member assessments on the importance of individual TS activities.RESULTS:Our first PDSA cycle successfully generated a SDM tool called Breast Cancer Risk Estimator, deemed valuable by 87% of patients surveyed. Our second PDSA cycle increased Breast Cancer Risk Estimator utilization, from 2,000 sessions in 2017 to 4,097 sessions in 2019 while maintaining early-stage breast cancer diagnoses. Although TS activities such as culture, trust, and communication needed to be sustained throughout the project, shared goals, research/data infrastructure support, and leadership were more important earlier in the project and persisted in the later stages of the project.CONCLUSION:Combining rigorous quality improvement and TS principles can support the complex, interdependent, and interdisciplinary activities necessary to improve cancer care delivery exemplified by our implementation of a breast cancer screening SDM tool.","Burnside, Elizabeth S.;Schrager, Sarina;Dubenske, Lori;Keevil, Jon;Little, Terry;Trentham-Dietz, Amy;Rolland, Betsy;Shah, Dhavan;Alagoz, Oguzhan",Journal,JCO Oncology Practice,2023-01-01,UW-Madison College of Engineering;University of Wisconsin-Madison;University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health;HealthDecision Founder,
Intelligent Safety Ergonomics: A Cleaner Research Direction for Ergonomics in the Era of Big Data,"Safety ergonomics is an important branch of safety science and environmental engineering. As humans enter the era of big data, the development of information technology has brought new opportunities and challenges to the innovation, transformation, and upgrading of safety ergonomics, as the traditional safety ergonomics theory has gradually failed to adapt to the need for safe and clean production. Intelligent safety ergonomics (ISE) is regarded as a new direction for the development of safety ergonomics in the era of big data. Unfortunately, since ISE is an emerging concept, there is no research to clarify its basic problems, which leads to a lack of theoretical guidance for the research and practice of ISE. In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional safety ergonomics theories and methods, first of all, this paper answers the basic questions of ISE, including the basic concepts, characteristics, attributes, contents, and research objects. Then, practical application functions of ISE are systematically clarified. Finally, following the life cycle of the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of the system, it ends with a discussion of the challenges and application prospects of ISE. The conclusion shows that ISE is a cleaner research direction for ergonomics in the era of big data, that it can deepen the understanding of humans, machines, and environment systems, and it can provide a new method for further research on safety and cleaner production. Overall, this paper not only helps safety researchers and practitioners to correctly understand the concept of intelligent safety ergonomics, but it will certainly inject energy and vitality into the development of safety ergonomics and cleaner production.","Dong, Longjun;Wang, Jiachuang",Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2023-01-01,Central South University,big data era ;  intelligent safety ergonomics ;  safety management ;  safety system ;  system safety

RESEARCH AND SAFETY GUARANTEE TECHNOLOGY OF LARGE DIAMETER HIGH-PERFORMANCE PVC PIPELINES FOR WATER DELIVERY PROJECT,"Focuses on the design of compound, equipment development, process optimization and pipe quality evaluation for PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) pipes and safety evaluation, health monitoring and repair in PVC pipeline engineering. For more than 10 years, a series of breakthrough innovations have been achieved: High toughness compounds are obtained for large diameter PVC pipes, and the only automatic production line for large-diameter PVC pipes with a diameter of 1800 mm in China was established. The ABR pipe (made of acrylate polymer blended with poly (vinyl chloride) resin for water supply), a novel PVC pipe, is invented, which has high strength, high toughness and high impact resistance. The quality evaluation method of ABR pipe is established by carrying out the test of tensile, thermal expansion and bearing performance of ABR pipes under internal & external pressure. The safety evaluation method of large-diameter pipeline engineering under complex operating environment is established through prototype test and numerical simulation of the performance of buried PVC pipeline under natural disasters such as rockfall impact, soil collapse, landslide and geological fault. The fiber optic sensing technology is proposed for pipeline deformation health monitoring. Pipeline defects are located, identified and diagnosed by the combination of the 'Listening' robot, a pipeline inspection device, and an artificial intelligence algorithm for target detection. Four kinds of pipeline repair technology without excavation are proposed and applied to pipeline engineering repair. The safety of PVC pipeline project operation has been effectively guaranteed.","Hu, Shao Wei;Yang, Jin Hui",Journal,Gongcheng Lixue/Engineering Mechanics,2023-01-01,Wuhan University;Chongqing University,intelligent monitoring ;  large diameter PVC pipe ;  performance improvement ;  safety assurance ;  safety evaluation
How women of colour engineering faculty respond to wage disparities,"Women of Color (WoC) engineering faculty in higher education differ in their approaches to coping with inequities and salary disparities. This study draws upon McGee's Stereotype Management [McGee, E.

Results reveal that WoC contend with identity taxation that forces them to navigate gendered negotiation systems to achieve salary parity. The racial backgrounds of WoC appeared to influence how they managed the impacts of pay inequity. Stereotype management emerges as a form of identity taxation that WoC use to navigate their academic environments. Our research suggests that, rather than confronting their structural racism, institutions of higher education place the onus on scholars of colour to use strategies to protect themselves from the reality of race/gendered wage disparity.","McGee, Ebony O.;White, Devin T.;Main, Joyce B.;Cox, Monica F.;Parker, Lynette",Journal,Ethnic and Racial Studies,2023-01-01,College of Engineering;Vanderbilt University's Peabody College;Purdue University;Digital Promise Global,engineering education ;  higher education ;  identity taxation ;  salary ;  stereotype management ;  Women of color
"Assessing the Current State of Science, Technology, and Innovation in Mauritius for Improving Economic Growth and Development","Science, technology, and innovation (STI) play a critical role in the socio-economic development of a country. Mauritius being a small island economy that does not possess natural resources except the ocean needs to further promote science and technology to achieve a higher level of innovation and economic growth. The economic development model of the country has since long been dependent on traditional economic sectors such as textiles, tourism, and financial services. These economic activities do not rely much on scientific contributions explaining the low interests of students to embrace the scientific fields of study. This paper analyzes the development of STI in Mauritius especially in the field of education over the last ten years using existing statistics, literature, and policy papers. Secondary school students prefer the business and economics stream over science subjects, with biology being the least preferred subject. At the tertiary level, the most popular streams in STI are information technology, engineering, medicine, and mathematics. Scientific publications in STI fields have increased significantly over the years yet Mauritius still lags behind many African countries. By providing examples of national policy decisions to improve the current STI situation, the paper makes a contextual contribution to Mauritius’s vision to invest in sectors that need and will derive benefits from enhanced scientific research outputs.","Roopchund, Randhir",Book Series,Research for Development,2023-01-01,Université des Mascareignes,Competitiveness ;  Innovation ;  Mauritius ;  Science education ;  Socio-economic development ;  STI
Present Status of Science Diplomacy in Nepal,"Science diplomacy is the use of scientific collaboration among nations to build constructive international partnerships to address common problems. It has become an umbrella describing several formal or informal technical, research-based, academic or engineering exchanges. As a country belonging to the group of “Least Developed Countries (LDC)” with the associated financial and technological constraints, Nepal still relies on support from international agencies and countries for national development. With the establishment of a democratic system, Nepal has enhanced its S&T capability through the establishment of academic, research and development organizations and created a critical mass of scientists and technologists. The practice of science diplomacy remains in initial stages, and more efforts are needed to strengthen the science diplomacy capability of diplomatic missions by bringing together the knowledge and expertise of scientists, technologists and diplomats.","Regmi, Chiranjivi",Book Series,Research for Development,2023-01-01,Nepal Academy of Science and Technology,Diplomatic missions ;  Innovation ;  International partnerships ;  Nepal ;  Science ;  Technology ;  Universities
The Local Authority Perspective on EU–Funded Collaborative Projects,"The EU, through various funding streams, continues to invest heavily on sustainable mobility to reduce congestion, carbon emissions, improve inclusivity, health and well-being, etc. This is leading to new methods, tools and processes, service propositions and technical innovations (in engineering and computing). Local authorities are responsible for the design and delivery of transport services in their cities. As such they may be regarded as one of the end users of the vast amount of material that is produced by projects such as SUITS. They can also receive funding to participate in some capacity, in many of the programmes, e.g. to run technology trials, to attend training events. This chapter takes a reflective approach to understanding the experience of local authority partners, what were their expectations, what were the costs and benefits, and what recommendations would they make for others to ensure they received maximum benefit if they were invited to participate in future projects. These insights are useful for the designers of research programmes, project managers and local authorities who might be invited into a consortium.","Woodcock, Andree;Nienaber, Ann Marie;Saunders, Janet;Spundflasch, Sebastian;Budhdeo, Sunil;Keelan Fadden Hopper, ;Estivio, Guiseppe",Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2023-01-01,"Coventry City Council, United Kingdom;Technischen Universität Ilmenau;Coventry University;Transport for West Midlands",

An overview of nanotechnological applications in biomedical engineering,"Advances in nanomedicine are expected to fundamentally alter how diseases are identified and treated. The future of biomedical engineering and medical treatments could be significantly impacted by nanotechnology in a number of ways. Toxicology testing procedures must be correlated and reproducible, and there must be sufficient knowledge about in vivo and in vitro results in biomedical applications before using nanotechnology in the workplace. In recent years, key studies in the domains of safety and tolerance, both non-clinical and clinical, have become necessary in order to create prospective commercial applications. Although it hasn't yet been fully realized, the potential for nanopatterning of usable medical devices is significant. Pharmaceutical engineering, tissue engineering, genetic engineering, medical devices innovation, imaging and antiviral usage were among the applications proposed. More study is needed on the immunological and inflammatory responses, the effects of reactions at the interface of tissue/blood and fibres, medication concentration, and the outcomes.

Gas sensors and factors influencing sensing mechanism with a special focus on MOS sensors,"Industrialization and its progress are very important for the economy and to move towards prosperity, stimulating innovation and creating jobs. Nonetheless, industrialization has negative impacts, if not done judiciously, such as pollution, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming. Therefore, amenity-with-security is of fundamental significance in a new and dynamic lifestyle. A gas sensor is one of the crucial devices for monitoring and subsequently preserving the clean atmosphere among a number of other safety technologies. In-depth assessments of gas sensors and their necessity in the environment (air) pollution are provided in the current review. With a special emphasis on metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)-based gas sensors, the review includes a thorough study of gas sensors and the factors relating to sensing mechanisms. It not only describes the basic concepts and brief history of gas sensors, but also highlights the schemes responsible for improving the gas sensing properties and state-of-art literature review. These schemes include (1) surface engineering/morphological tuning and (2) bulk and surface doping. To keep scientific rigour and in-depth analyses, this review focuses on these two schemes only. In the doping area, the emphasis is given on graphene loading, decorated with nanoparticles of noble metals, spillover mechanism, and heterojunction (p–n, n–n, and p–p) formation. The conclusion summarizes the most optimized MOS gas sensors with enhanced gas sensing capabilities. The emphasis is given to formulate the article in such a way that it will be useful for the beginners who wish to explore the gas sensor research field, as well as to the established researchers to further improve the sensing capabilities of MOS gas sensors.","Nadargi, Digambar Y.;Umar, Ahmad;Nadargi, Jyoti D.;Lokare, Smita A.;Akbar, Sheikh;Mulla, Imtiaz S.;Suryavanshi, Sharad S.;Bhandari, Nagesh L.;Chaskar, Manohar G.",Journal,Journal of Materials Science,2023-01-01,"College of Engineering;N.

Construction Sector Transformation: Developing a New Learning Paradigm,"Architecture, Construction and Engineering (AEC) has historically reported low levels of productivity and performance, especially when compared with other sectors and industries such as automotive, aviation, manufacturing and ICT/telecoms. This is particularly concerning, given that this sector is a significant contributor to many countries Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Acknowledging this, and the fervent need to improve productivity as part of AEC’s digital transition to Industry 4.0 – the so-called Construction 4.0 - this paper explores some of contributory forces affecting this journey. One aspect of this transition is the examination of industrialisation, or indeed the level of technological sophistication applied to this sector, including the ‘success’ indicators used. A historical reflection on the industrialisation process is presented, including traditional industrialisation approaches from Late Industrialisation. Developing economies undergoing late industrialisation are seen as unique because they did not base their material development on inventions, but rather on the basis of learning – i.e., using ‘borrowed’ technology. From this literature, a qualitative [explorative] research approach was adopted based on the principles of Critical Realism. Findings from this were then applied to four focus groups with 23 industry professionals. Research findings highlighted that AEC was not industrialised per se, but simply modernised. Moreover, that access to modern techniques and technological sophistication were insufficient to support sector transformation through such conduits as industrialisation, knowledge management or indeed innovation. Findings also indicate the need to more purposefully align transformational thinking to socio-economic transition models, principally those underpinned by grounded learning paradigms aligned to key industrial policy institutions.","de Matos Camarinha, Ricardo;Goulding, Jack;Peter, Camaren",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2023-01-01,University of Cape Town;BIMTEC Consultancy;Unisearch Ltd,AEC ;  Economic development ;  Industrialisation ;  Innovation ;  Technology

Factors affecting firms’ green technology innovation: an evolutionary game based on prospect theory,"In the context of green development and the construction of ecological civilization, a key issue for governments is how to promote firms’ green technology innovation. Assuming the bounded rationality of decision-makers, this paper constructs a game model of green technology innovation between firms and the government based on prospect theory. It dynamically analyzes the decision process and optimal strategy under different scenarios and uses numerical simulation to identify the influencing factors. There are three main findings. (1) Firms’ green technology innovation decisions depend on the net income difference between strategies. Environmental regulation encourages firms to carry out green technology innovation by increasing the environmental costs to non-green technology innovation firms and increasing the income of green technology innovation firms. (2) Uncertainty and the behavioral characteristics of managers significantly affect green technology innovation. Firms’ green technology innovation is positively correlated with the success rate of green technology innovation, whereas is negatively correlated with perceived value sensitivity and loss aversion. (3) There is instrumental heterogeneity in the incentive effect of environmental regulation on firms’ green technology innovation. The most effective tool is comprehensive environmental regulation, followed by punishment and then subsidy. The research provides a reference for governments to formulate environmental regulations and firms to manage innovation.","Li, Chuang;Wang, Zhijia;Wang, Liping",Journal,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,2023-01-01,Henan Polytechnic University;Jimei University,Environmental regulation ;  Fault-tolerant subsidy ;  Green technology innovation of firms ;  Perceived value ;  Prospect theory
The Digital Transformation of the Aerospace Industry in the Madrid Region: A Study of the Situation and Future Trends,"As part of my research on digital transformation at the Higher Technical School of Aeronautical and Space Engineering of Madrid, I wanted to conduct a sector-wide study to determine the situation of the aerospace industry. This type of study has not been done at the regional level until now, so the first survey on digital shifts in the aerospace industry was launched in the Community of Madrid. The results of these data allow us to systematise this situation of Madrid companies. We have characterised and quantified the influence of what we have called “transformative enablers”. These variables have served to determine a map of the state of the regional aerospace industry from the point of view of its shift to digitisation. We have also analysed the relationships with the general characteristics of the companies in the study analysed, such as location, number of employees, legal form, or type of company. We also obtained interesting conclusions about the role of respondents within organisations to discover the “capillarity” of their situations and thus understand the degree of digital transformation (DT) in terms of whether they achieve the so-called industry 4.0. Finally, we have made an in-depth study of the situation of recently created companies (<1 year) with disruptive innovations (startups) to check whether or not they have an influence on this situation and, to what extent, whether they can be the protagonists of a process, which we have termed the “startuprisation” of the sector as a precursor to real digital transformation.","Morillas Guerrero, Juan José",Book Series,EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing,2023-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Aerospace ;  Digital enablers ;  Digital transformation ;  Startuprisation
Technology transition from traditional oil and gas reservoir simulation to the next generation energy development,"Energy transition has been a focus in both scientific research and social concerns in the past decade, thanks to the urgent need of reducing carbon emissions, slowing down the abnormal speed of global climate and achieving a balance between environmental protection and economic development. Although the global energy sector is shifting from the fossil-based energy systems, including oil and gas, to the renewable energy resources like hydrogen, the necessity of conventional energy development has received increasing attentions with regard to the stable supply and maturely developed technologies. The long-history simulation techniques developed for oil and gas reservoir investigations have enabled the deeper explorations into reservoir properties and enhanced significantly the resource recovery. As a main direction in energy transition, the development of hydrogen energy is profoundly influencing the long-term reconstruction of the world’s energy supply and application system, and is accelerating the transition and generational evolution in the fields of transportation, power generation, chemicals, and housing. In this paper, three research directions are proposed as the potential focus of technology transition, where traditional oil and gas reservoir simulation technologies can be adjusted and improved to be used to benefit the development of hydrogen energy.","Zhang, Tao;Liu, Jie;Sun, Shuyu",Journal,Advances in Geo-Energy Research,2023-01-01,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology,energy transition ;  hydrogen ;  phase equilibrium ;  Technology transition
Technology Entrepreneurship and Innovation: A Systematic Literature Review,"In the last two decades, technology entrepreneurship, involving two established but related fields, entrepreneurship, and technology-based innovation, attracted researchers and policymakers’ interest due to the recognized positive effect on economic development. Considering technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship as the main forces to achieve sustainable development at different levels of the economy and society, it is vital to assess and develop the ability to synergetic create these forces. Based on the importance of technology entrepreneurship and innovation in actual research trends, this research aims to develop a systematic literature review to analyze the existing articles that approach technology entrepreneurship and innovation and summarize their findings. The 73 articles reviewed were obtained through a search in the Web of Science database and used in a bibliographic-coupling analysis with VOSviewer software. The results enable the categorization of the existing literature revealing four clusters, namely, (1) venture financing, (2) factors of influence, (3) new technology ventures, and (4) importance of policies, location, and entrepreneurial surroundings. This study presents direct implications for the literature in TE and innovation, systematizing the existing studies and addressing the need for a systematic literature review that approaches both concepts simultaneously. It provides a framework that enables the scientific community to access the main subjects discussed and the articulation between concepts.

Fall Detection of Elderly Using YOLO,"Unintentional injury caused by falls is the second leading cause of death in the elderly. To detect falls, several strategies are used, but they are controlled in number by the algorithm’s computing complexity. The captured images are routed through the system to a server at the back end for the processor. As the IOT fills in prevalence, this engineering will confront difficulties, for example, rising transmission capacity expenses and server packing. New strategies for reducing server stress are being developed by shifting specific computing worth loads from cloud server to edge figuring stages. To that purpose, our research developed a revolutionary technique in light of neuromorphic processing equipment that smoothes out and moves the brain network modal from the back end PC to the edge figuring stage. A neural network model with int8-bit8 bit accuracy is built using the edge figuring stage to change over the camera’s item pictures into human movement ascribes, and a help vector machine is then utilized for order. The overall system was found to have 96% accuracy, a detection speed of 11.5 fps, and power consumption of 0.3 W after testing. This innovation can follow the falls of more seasoned people continuously and throughout an extensive period. To compute all of the data, an edge computing platform was used. A computer system that can automatically and effectively identify and classify falls would be valuable for monitoring the elderly population and speeding up the assistance process, reducing the risk of long-term harm and mortality.

Asymmetric effects of heterogeneous environmental standards on green technology innovation: Evidence from China,"Exploring the asymmetric effects of heterogeneous environmental standards on green technology innovation can enrich the Porter hypothesis and play a vital role in transforming industrial production modes and promoting sustainable development. Based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Technology Concordance, this study transforms the International Patent Classification (IPC)-based green patent data into provincial-industrial level green patent data during 2006–2015. Treating the implementation of cleaner production standards and pollution emission standards as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ the difference-in-differences (DID) and propensity score matching DID (PSM-DID) models to investigate the asymmetric effects of heterogeneous environmental standards on green technology innovation and examine the heterogeneous effects between different regions and industries. In addition, we use an interaction regression model to identify three influence mechanisms: market competition, foreign direct investment (FDI), and research and development (R&D) inputs. The results show that the green technology innovation effects of heterogeneous environmental standards are asymmetric. Cleaner production standards can significantly promote green technology innovation. However, pollution emission standards produce a significant inhibition effect on green technology innovation. After a series of robustness checks, such asymmetric effects are still evident. Moreover, the green technology innovation effects of cleaner production standards exhibit no heterogeneity at the regional and industrial levels. Nevertheless, the inhibitory effect of pollution emission standards on green technology innovation is confirmed in non-energy-intensive industries rather than in energy-intensive industries, indicating a significant heterogeneity at the industrial level. Concerning the influence mechanism, increasing market competition has advantages and disadvantages for the green technology innovation effects of cleaner production standards in eastern China and midwestern China, respectively. The pollution halo effect of FDI triggered by cleaner production standards exists in eastern China and non-energy-intensive industries. Cleaner production standards can stimulate green technology innovation by increasing R&D inputs. However, under the regulation of pollution emission standards in non-energy-intensive industries, R&D inputs are not conducive to green technology innovation.","Xu, Le;Yang, Lili;Li, Ding;Shao, Shuai",Journal,Energy Economics,2023-01-01,Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting and Finance;ECUST School of Business;Shanghai University of Finance and Economics;Southwestern University of Finance and Economics,Asymmetric effects ;  China ;  Cleaner production standards ;  Green technology innovation ;  Heterogeneous environmental standards ;  Pollution emission standards

Preclinical-to-clinical innovations in stem cell therapies for liver regeneration,"Acute and chronic liver diseases are the major cause of high morbidity and mortality globally. Liver transplantation is a widely used therapeutic option for liver failure. However, the shortage of availability of liver donors has encouraged research on the alternative approach to liver regeneration. Cell-based regenerative medicine is the best alternative therapy to cater to this need. To date, advanced preclinical approaches have been undertaken on stem cell differentiation and their use in liver tissue engineering for generating efficacious and promising regenerative therapies. Advancements in the bioengineering of stem cells, and organoid generation are the way forward to efficient therapies against liver injury. This review summarizes the recent approaches for stem cell therapy-based liver regeneration and their proof of concepts for clinical application, bioengineering liver organoids to alleviate the liver failure caused due to chronic liver diseases.","Chawla, Shilpa;Das, Amitava",Journal,Current Research in Translational Medicine,2023-01-01,Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR);Council of Scientific and Industrial Research India,Bioprinting ;  Clinical trials of stem cells-based liver regeneration ;  Liver organoid ;  Liver regeneration ;  Scaffolds ;  Stem cell therapy ;  Tissue engineering
Pressure transient analysis of a horizontal well intercepted by multiple hydraulic fractures in heterogeneous reservoir with multiple connected regions using boundary element method,"The focus of this paper is to establish a new general model framework considering both hydraulic fractures with finite conductivity and heterogeneous characteristics of multiple connected regions by using boundary element method. With this framework, we can calculate the pressure performance of any heterogeneous reservoir. The innovation is that the complex fracture flow, boundary shape and heterogeneous characteristics can be flexibly considered in the model. Transient pressure of fractured horizontal wells in heterogeneous reservoir is obtained by using Stehfest numerical inversion method. Subsequently, this proposed regional heterogeneity model was validated by using numerical simulation methods. The results show that the proposed heterogeneous model can be divided into five flow segments, which are bilinear flow, linear flow, radial flow, first boundary dominated flow and second boundary dominated flow. However, the research results show that the presence or absence of some flow sections is closely related to the regional permeability ratio and the regional storage capacity ratio. As the two most important parameters of heterogeneous reservoir, the permeability ratio and regional storage capacity of heterogeneous reservoir will have a huge impact on the pressure response and pressure field. The sensitivity analysis shows that these two factors will lead to the deformation of the pressure field distribution and affect the flow characteristics, and cause some flow segments to fail to appear. The smaller the regional storage capacity ratio, the deeper the V-shape, and the more fluid supplied from the outer zone to the inner zone. This study also suggests that the fracture conductivity mainly affects the early flow characteristics, and the smaller the conductivity, the greater the pressure loss. In addition, irregular boundary will also cause important deformation of pressure field, and the area size will affect the late flow characteristics, and the smaller the area, the greater the pressure loss. The new semi-analytical solutions can form a series of typical curves and be applied to the well test analysis of multi-stage fracturing horizontal wells in heterogeneous and unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. The findings of this study can help for better understanding of the influence of reservoir heterogeneity on pressure response and find some applications in well testing for inverse problems in heterogeneous reservoirs.","Chen, Xiaoxia;Liu, Pengcheng",Journal,Journal of Hydrology,2023-01-01,School of Energy Resources;Beijing Key Laboratory of Unconventional Natural Gas Geological Evaluation and Development Engineering,Boundary elements method ;  Fractured horizontal wells ;  Green's function ;  Irregular heterogeneous reservoirs ;  Pressure transient
Exploring Responsible Research and Innovation in Museums Through Hands-on Activities,"Responsible research and innovation (RRI) is a framework for thinking about the implications of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) discoveries and innovations and shaping them in a way that is responsible to people, future generations, and the natural environment. In this paper, we present a project that engages museum visitors in learning about RRI through hands-on activities inspired by Mary Shelley's Frankenstein story, characters, and themes. We developed a learning framework describing strategies and outcomes for RRI in informal educational settings, then created a set of seven activities that embodied the framework and studied their implementation at 13 museums. Evidence from observations and interviews are consistent with the RRI learning framework and suggest a number of practical implications for its use in museums.","Ostman, Rae;Nagy, Peter;Mawasi, Areej;Finn, Ed;Wylie, Ruth",Journal,Curator,2023-01-01,Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College;Technion - Israel Institute of Technology;Arizona State University,
The role of foreign trade and technology innovation on economic recovery in China: The mediating role of natural resources development,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused the most recent global economic collapse, which severely impacted worldwide economic operations. Natural resource volatility significantly affects global economic recovery. Therefore, the study aims to determine the significance of natural resource volatility, foreign trade, technological innovation, urbanisation, and investment in energy resources on the economic recovery of Chinese provinces. A total of 30 provinces in China were examined between 1995 and 2020. The generalised method of movement (GMM) technique was used to demonstrate that investments in energy sector resources, international commerce, and technological innovation are inconsistent than gross domestic product (GDP) and natural resources. The results demonstrated how trade blocs limit the effect of natural resources on regional economic development in the central provinces. Specifically, 33.4% of energy was saved while 35.2% of emissions were reduced. Although abundant natural resources significantly influence economic growth, studies discovered a negative impact on urbanisation. Nonetheless, the positive effects of trade openness outweighed those of economic recovery. The study proposed stabilising the fluctuating costs of natural resources, encouraging green financing, and increasing investment in energy resources. The findings also provided a novel strategy for achieving high economic growth and recovery.","Hasan, Mohammad Maruf;Du, Fang",Journal,Resources Policy,2023-01-01,Sichuan University,Ecological footprint ;  Economic recovery ;  Foreign trade ;  Natural resources volatility ;  Technology innovation
"Asymmetric influence of digital finance, and renewable energy technology innovation on green growth in China","This study examines the influence of digital finance and renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) on green growth using Chinese regional data from 2007 to 2019. It applies Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) to integrate asymmetric green growth patterns in China's prefecture-level regions. Moreover, the generalized method of moment (GMM) is used to address possible endogeneity between model variables. The results of MMQR reveal that digital finance stimulates green growth at middle to higher quantiles (4th to 6th), and central and eastern regions fall within these quantiles. In contrast, western regions have an insignificant impact as prescribed by lower quantiles (1st to 3rd). Similarly, RETI failed to increase the growth across lower to middle (1st to 6th) quantiles in western and central regions. However, the extremely high quantiles indicate a significantly positive connection, demonstrating that RETI contributes to green growth primarily in eastern regions. Moreover, the outcomes stated that government intervention significantly enhances green growth throughout quantiles. The results from GMM endorse a similar outcome, indicating that the marginal contribution of digital green finance towards green growth is more substantial in the eastern sub-sample, followed by central and western regions, respectively. Likewise, green growth is more responsive to changes in RETI in eastern and western regions. These results suggest that digital finance and RETI are imperative to ensure regional green growth; however, their marginal contribution should be improved in western and eastern regions.","Razzaq, Asif;Sharif, Arshian;Ozturk, Ilhan;Skare, Marinko",Journal,Renewable Energy,2023-01-01,Juraj Dobrila University of Pula;College of Business Administration;Sunway University;Nişantaşı Üniversitesi;Akademia Ekonomiczno-Humanistyczna w Warszawie;Ilma University;China Medical University Hospital;Dalian University of Technology,China's regional economies ;  Digital finance ;  Green growth ;  Renewable energy technological innovation
Optimization of carbon performance evaluation and its application to strategy decision for investment of green technology innovation,"Carbon regulation and the mechanism of carbon emission right motivate firms with high carbon consumption and emission to transition to a production and operation model with higher carbon usage. Green technology innovation is the usual way out, with carbon performance metrics serving as guideposts along the route. The intersection of the two topics is the focus of this study. The carbon performance evaluation is optimized by taking carbon asset variance into account. This criteria investigates investment in green technology innovation for its relationship with carbon performance, and investment plans are assessed and determined for the optimum carbon performance based on a stochastic model using geometric Brownian motion for Monte Carlo simulation and prediction. Strategy design of green technology investment is optimized by comparison among a series of proposed schemes, and the conclusions based on case study are applicable for similar situations of enterprises with carbon consumption. The following are the ways in which this research contributes. 1) Improvement of the carbon performance measure by the addition of carbon asset modifications. 2) The practical application of carbon performance, which serves to direct management practice, is illustrated and realized.","Liu, Yue;Xu, Lu;Sun, Huaping;Chen, Bin;Wang, Ling",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2023-01-01,Nanjing Normal University;Jiangsu University;China University of Geosciences,Carbon emission right ;  Carbon performance ;  Green technology innovation ;  Investment strategy
A perspective on plant robotics: from bioinspiration to hybrid systems,"As miscellaneous as the Plant Kingdom is, correspondingly diverse are the opportunities for taking inspiration from plants for innovations in science and engineering. Especially in robotics, properties like growth, adaptation to environments, ingenious materials, sustainability, and energy-effectiveness of plants provide an extremely rich source of inspiration to develop new technologies—and many of them are still in the beginning of being discovered. In the last decade, researchers have begun to reproduce complex plant functions leading to functionality that goes far beyond conventional robotics and this includes sustainability, resource saving, and eco-friendliness. This perspective drawn by specialists in different related disciplines provides a snapshot from the last decade of research in the field and draws conclusions on the current challenges, unanswered questions on plant functions, plant-inspired robots, bioinspired materials, and plant-hybrid systems looking ahead to the future of these research fields.","Meder, Fabian;Baytekin, Bilge;Del Dottore, Emanuela;Meroz, Yasmine;Tauber, Falk;Walker, Ian;Mazzolai, Barbara",Journal,Bioinspiration and Biomimetics,2023-01-01,"Clemson University College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences;Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia;Universität Freiburg;Bilkent Üniversitesi;Tel Aviv University",actuation ;  autonomy ;  biohybrid systems ;  bioinspiration ;  energy ;  materials science ;  robotics
"Green investment, financial development, digitalization and economic sustainability in Vietnam: Evidence from a quantile-on-quantile regression and wavelet coherence","This study analyzes how economic sustainability in Vietnam could be promoted by realizing opportunities represented by green investment, digitalization, and financial development. The relationship between digitalization, green investment, financial development, and sustainable development has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In addition, no research has been conducted in Vietnam on the relationship between these indicators to the best of our knowledge. By doing so, we adopt a novel three-stage methodology comprising quantile-on-quantile regression developed by Sim and Zhou (2015), Granger causality in quantiles proposed by Troster (2018), and wavelet analysis. The findings demonstrate a strong positive effect of digitalization, green investment, and financial development on economic sustainability in Vietnam across most quantiles, indicating that investment in green resources, technology innovation, and financial development supports the country's transition to sustainable development. Overall, the empirical findings show that digitalization, green investment, and financial development can all play a significant role in significantly increasing the sustainability of Vietnam's current high economic growth trajectories. The findings could create a roadmap for developing countries to use technology innovation, green investment, and financial development in productive sectors to accomplish sustainable development goals.","Hung, Ngo Thai",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2023-01-01,University of Finance - Marketing,Digitalization ;  Financial development ;  Green investment ;  Quantile regression ;  Vietnam
Innovation and Control of Health Technology Management Procedures Applying Six Sigma Methodology,"The National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER. Its acronym in Spanish) is a public healthcare institution that provides medical attention, teaching and scientific research centered on diseases of the respiratory system. In 2019, the hospital held 228 beds and over six thousand medical devices for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the Hospital to convert 215 conventional care beds to intensive care beds, assigned exclusively to critical COVID-19 patients. This resulted in a higher demand of Health Technology Management (HTM) resources which were reflected by a 60% increase in the Hospital’s medical devices. Therefore, the technical staff of the Department of Biomedical Engineering grew by 300%. Thus, the objective of this work was to innovate HTM procedures through the application of Six Sigma Methodology and two Lean tools: 5S and Kanban, to control the activities carried out at the Hospital. Procedures for dealing with work orders and inventory control of supplies (accessories, consumables, and spare parts) that medical equipment require for its operation were analyzed. Additionally, three activities related to HTM were analyzed: tool control, work area control and information flow among all 5 personnel work shifts. In total, seven innovation strategies were proposed and implemented in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the INER.","Navarro-Arcos, Y. J.;Aguilar-Pimentel, A. B.;Ortiz-Posadas, M.

Green technology innovation and CO<inf>2</inf> emission in China: Evidence from a spatial-temporal analysis and a nonlinear spatial durbin model,"Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2007 to 2019, this paper investigates the impact of green technology innovation on carbon intensity. Firstly, this paper studies the dynamic evolution and temporal and spatial pattern of China's provincial green technology innovation and carbon intensity. On this basis, the nonlinear spatial Durbin model (SDM) is used to explore the impact of green technology innovation on carbon intensity, and the relevant variables are controlled. The results show that there is a significant spatial agglomeration phenomenon in China's provincial green technology innovation level and carbon intensity. The direct impact of green technological innovation on carbon intensity in local region shows a significant “inverted-U” relationship, that is, when the level of green technological innovation is relatively low, green technological innovation will promote carbon emissions, while when the level of green technological innovation reaches a certain level, this promotion relationship will change into inhibition relationship. From the perspective of interregional spillover effect, green technological innovation also has an “inverted-U″ nonlinear impact on carbon emissions in adjacent regions, that is, the impact of green technological innovation on carbon emissions in adjacent regions is also promoted first and then restrained.","Chen, Huanyu;Yi, Jizheng;Chen, Aibin;Peng, Duanxiang;Yang, Jieqiong",Journal,Energy Policy,2023-01-01,Central South University of Forestry and Technology,Carbon intensity ;  Direct effect ;  Green technology innovation ;  Spatial durbin model (SDM) ;  Spillover effect
Designing the Metaverse: A Study of Design Research and Creative Practice from Speculative Fictions to Functioning Prototypes,"As ubiquitous computing evolves towards greater adoption of Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed (VAM) Reality design paradigms, designers, engineers, and artists must develop new creative strategies to advance both the technical innovations necessary for new technology to emerge, as well as a critical framework to examine the consequences that these new technologies may have on society and culture. In this paper we present design research that explores these themes through a creative process of iterative prototyping and critique, from speculative fictions to functioning prototypes. These strategies draw heavily on literature, performance, as well as other areas in the humanities not usually considered within the domain of engineering. The prototypes presented in this paper demonstrate innovations for the design of VAM Reality within the emerging metaverse, as they give insight into the creative process from which they developed.","Gonsher, Ian;Rapoport, Daniel;Marbach, Alice;Kurniawan, Dana;Eiseman, Seth;Zhang, Emily;Qu, Amy;Abela, Mikey;Li, Xinru;Sheth, Aanchal M.;Chen, Annie;Upadhyayula, Rohan;Li, Sunny;Bansal, Sahil;Zhao, Ivan;Chen, Grace;Tan, Charles;Lei, Zhenhong",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,Brown University,Creative process ;  Design process ;  Metaverse design ;  Mixed Reality ;  Virtual Reality
3D Data Management and Thermographic Studies as a Knowledge Base for the Conservation of a Rationalist Architecture,"Thanks to the development of technologies for digitalization, new possibilities of management and valorization of Cultural Heritage have been opened. These issues are addressed by the project IDEHA (Innovation for Data Elaboration in Heritage Areas), funded by MIUR Italian Ministry, for Italian assets of historical interest. Among the different case studies, the library tower of the XX Century complex of the Faculty of Engineering in Bologna has a great significance as an example of rationalist architecture. The present work aims at the 3D digitization of the tower, the analysis of its state of maintenance by using active thermography and the implementation of a BIM model that contains all these information. Aerial (by UAV) and terrestrial photogrammetry was used for the development of the three-dimensional model. From the acquired images, a point cloud and a textured mesh of the Tower were processed. The point cloud was also used as a reference for the elaboration of an HBIM model representing both the interior and exterior of the tower structure. Moreover, a study of the conditions of the external facades recently treated with water repellent was conducted through active thermography. The study of the state of the external brick wall face was carried out through the multi-temporal analysis of thermal images. This allowed to identify the areas where the water repellent treatment is damaged and therefore more exposed to deterioration phenomena. The main challenge of this research work is to incorporate the information acquired through active thermography into the information model in order to better manage the building.","Barbieri, Ester;Franzoni, Elisa;Lambertini, Alessandro;Pizzigatti, Cesare;Trevisiol, Francesca;Bitelli, Gabriele",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,2023-01-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,3D modeling ;  3D surveying ;  HBIM ;  Thermography
"Recent Innovations in the Strategies for the Functionalization of Chitosan, Pectin, Alginate, Hyaluronic Acid, Dextran and Inulin Biomaterials for Anticancer Applications-A Review","Polysaccharide biomaterials with carbohydrate backbones are currently the subject of material science and engineering research for anticancer applications. Polysaccharides exhibit surprising advantages compared to other substances because they are available in nature, are generally absorbed and have favorable immunogenicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability. The naturally obtained polysaccharides sometimes have undesirable drawbacks in their structures that limit their use as biomaterials and therefore functionalization of polysaccharides is important to increase their applications. Anti-tumor approaches involving polysaccharide biomaterials are associated with probiotic properties immune-enhancement, anti-mutagenic potential, tumor growth inhibition and regulatory actions to oncogene modification. Polysaccharide biomaterials with various anticancer and antimicrobial agents have been investigated as drug delivery vehicles or biomaterials. This review summarizes recent strategies for the developments of polysaccharides biomaterials such as (chitosan, pectin, alginate, hyaluronic acid, dextran and inulin) for anticancer applications, the analysis of different polysaccharide biomaterial formulations and the influence of bioactive molecules on their anticancer properties.","Ganie, Showkat Ali;Rather, Luqman Jameel;Li, Qing",Journal,Journal of Polymers and the Environment,2023-01-01,Southwest University,Alginate ;  Anticancer ;  Biomaterials ;  Chitosan ;  Dextran ;  Hyaluronic acid ;  Inulin ;  Pectin and Polysaccharide
Crucial Business Model Elements for Medical Device Startup Companies in Emerging Markets,"Objectives: Medical devices that suit the needs and challenges of low- and middle-income countries are desperately needed. To provide sustainable access to such devices, business approaches must be developed to meet the demands of individual economic, healthcare, and innovation ecosystems. Currently, there is a gap in the literature regarding business models for medical devices in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: A multimodal approach using literature review and key informant interviews was performed to determine critical components of business models for medical device organizations operating in LMICs, specifically focusing on models in emerging markets. Results: The search resulted in 4,674 articles, of which 31 were determined to be relevant and were reviewed. Additional sources included 1 government website, 5 nongovernmental organization websites, 2 private enterprises, and 6 publicly available, non-peer reviewed websites and 1 video. From these sources, four major criteria were found to be necessary for successful development of medical device business models in emerging markets: value proposition, partnerships, strategic pricing, and funding models. Conclusions: Innovators must custom tailor their business model when implementing these elements to the regulatory, cultural, and economic landscapes of each setting. This will improve access to safer, affordable medical care and successfully bring innovative technologies to emerging markets.","Jiang, Tiffany;Kost, Samantha;Doshi, Pratik;Ho, Pei Ching;Phillips, Sarah Dunn;Mutindi, Eunice;Mueller, Jenna L.;Fitzgerald, Tamara N.",Journal,Value in Health Regional Issues,2023-01-01,Trinity College of Arts & Sciences;A.

Analysis on Potential Use of Crowdsourcing in Different Domain Using Metasynthesis,"The concept of crowdsourcing is gaining its importance in all the domains, viz. innovation, microtasking, health care, software engineering, education and many more. People and people are the important part of society in day to day life. How the potential of crowd utilized in all domain is becoming an interesting topic of research. In this paper, we tried to gather information and techniques from all the domains, where the crowd activity and communication are utilized. There was no comprehensive literature review carried out on crowdsourcing for the filed as a whole. Most of the reviews are concentrated on specific field like data acquisition for machine learning, micro tasking, emergency management and so on. Here, we tried to combine all the research under single umbrella and conduct analysis and synthesis on the data collected. We tried to find what is the least touched area and which domain was given more importance. What are the reasons for most people to work in particular domain and how to drag researcher’s attention toward least touched domain? A systematic review process is followed using the keyword search and including subtopic search using advanced search provided by sources like IEEE, Springer and Elsevier, etc. Then, the screening was done using the reference section for most cited papers. The metasynthesis is being used for finding the answers to all the questions posed.","Kasturi, Nivedita;Totad, S.

Modeling the Knowledge of Users in an Augmented Reality-Based Learning Environment Using Fuzzy Logic,"Augmented Reality has been an important part of engineering education, and more specific in the field of spatial skills training. Based on the literature review, desktop or mobile spatial ability training applications already developed, lack personalization as they do not identify students’ learning styles, and the activities delivered to them are the same complexity for all. In view of the above, this paper presents PARSAT, a developed mobile augmented reality spatial ability training system, which converts students’ knowledge to fuzzy weights, and delivers adaptive learning activities to students’ spatial skills. The innovation of the developed system is that PARSAT is a student-centered system, delivering adaptive domain knowledge content, using the technology of fuzzy weights in a rule-based decision-making module. As a testbed of this research, the developed system has been incorporated in the laboratory course deliveries of a computer-aided-design university course, and has been evaluated by the students during the 2021–22 winter semester.","Papakostas, Christos;Troussas, Christos;Krouska, Akrivi;Sgouropoulou, Cleo",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,University of West Attica,Augmented reality ;  Fuzzy weights ;  Personalized system ;  Spatial ability training
The role of digitalization on green economic growth: Does industrial structure optimization and green innovation matter?,"The digital economy has demonstrated strong resilience and great potential, under the interwoven influence of the global pandemic and severe environmental concerns across the world. Therefore, there is a need to focus on the value of green economic growth in the digital economy. This paper constructs an evaluation index system and adopts the SEEA (System of Environmental and Economic Accounting) method to measure the digitalization level (Digi) and green economy growth level (GEG) of China. The internal mechanism and linear relationship between digitalization and green economy growth are examined based on the panel data from 2013 to 2019. Moreover, this study explores the spatial spillover effect. The major study findings are as follows: (1) Digitalization and green economy growth represent a steady growth trend, and the former as a whole significantly promotes the latter, with a marginal effect of 1.648. (2) The mechanism analysis indicates the intermediary effects’ size of three crucial intermediaries: green technology innovation > advanced industrial structure > the rationalization of industrial structure. (3) Both the “local effect” (0.556; 0.574) and “neighboring effect” (1.382; 1.415) of digitalization on green economy growth are positive under the two weight matrices and display “simultaneous resonance” characteristics based on the spatial perspective. (4) There exists obvious regional spatial heterogeneity and resource endowment heterogeneity. Finally, this study put forward corresponding policy implications, such as construction of new digital infrastructures and guiding green-energy consumption.","Hao, Xiaoli;Li, Yuhong;Ren, Siyu;Wu, Haitao;Hao, Yu",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2023-01-01,Xi'an Jiaotong University;Nankai University;Beijing Institute of Technology;Xinjiang University,Digitalization ;  Green economic growth ;  Green technology innovation ;  Industrial structure optimization ;  Spatial spillover effect

Here, we designed and optimized a highly sensitive MEC-type BOD sensor by screening inoculants, comparing electrode materials, and optimizing the reactor configuration. The results showed that effective means to optimize a BOD sensor for fast activation and sensitive testing included the inoculation of the MEC reactor effluent with large amounts of biomass and highly active bacteria, selection of carbon felt electrodes with excellent adsorption and permeability, miniaturization of the reactor, regulation of suitable electrode spacing, and design of the penetrating fluid structure. Then, the optimized sensing system was applied to determine the BOD concentration in model solutions of sodium acetate in a laboratory environment, where it accurately measured BOD concentrations in the range of 10–500 mg/L and maintained good parallelism during long-term operation. Next, the MEC-type BOD sensors were put into practice in the field as an alarm for accidents at an actual sewage plant. The whole BOD sensing system was quickly assembled on site and started up, and it gave an early warning shortly after the concentration of organic matter in the water suddenly increased, thus showing a high potential for engineering applications. This study broadened the domains of application of MEC-type BOD sensors in environmental monitoring, and promoted the development of technological innovation in water ecology and environmental monitoring.","Wang, Ziyuan;Liao, Chengmei;Zhong, Zihan;Liu, Siyan;Li, Ming;Wang, Xin",Journal,Environmental Research,2023-01-01,Nankai University;Ltd.,Biochemical oxygen demand ;  Engineering ;  Microbial electrolysis cell ;  Optimized ;  Real-time monitoring ;  Wastewater treatment plant
Player profiles for game-based applications in engineering education,"The use of digital learning environments in higher education has led to design methodological strategies, like gamification, adapted to computer-based learning. The effectiveness of gamification depends on the adaptation of the methodology to the player's profile. Four types of player profiles (Explorer, Killer, Socialized, and Achiever) are established according to the Bartle classification. In this article, quantitative research is carried out on the player profile and the one considered best for learning engineering professors. Sociological and academic aspects that influence player profile choices are also identified. A descriptive and inferential analysis of the answers given by a population of 532 engineering professors —who attended a training course on gamification in digital environments—to a survey designed by the authors was carried out. The results reveal that most engineering professors are Explorers and this is also the player profile considered best for learning, although there is a gap between the own player profile and the choice of the most effective one. The player profile shown here to be the most frequent among engineering professors differs from that attributed to students in the literature, which is Achiever. Gaps by gender, age, teaching experience, and university tenure are also identified. Universities are recommended to strengthen professor training to design personalized game-based computing environments and to cater to differences due to several sociological and academic aspects.","Vergara, Diego;Antón-Sancho, Álvaro;Fernández-Arias, Pablo",Journal,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2023-01-01,Universidad Católica de Ávila,engineering education ;  gamification ;  innovation ;  player profile
Research On The Management System Of College Students’ Innovation And Entrepreneurship Education Based On B/S Architecture,"With the increasing enrollment of colleges and universities and the increase of the population of our country, the number of college graduates increases year by year, many college graduates are engaged in the occupation which is not in conformity with their professional. In the very convenient information network era, traditional innovation laboratory project uses pure artificial management mode, which consumes a lot of manpower and material resources, and is not conducive to encourage and promote innovation and entrepreneurship project management. Therefore, in order to better encourage college graduates to start an enterprise, it is necessary and urgent to research and develop the innovation and entrepreneurship education management system based on information technology. Based on this, the research on the innovation and entrepreneurship education management system of university students based on the B/S structure was carried out. Personal information management mainly includes review, approval, deactivation, information correction, key reset, information export, sharing and adding of individual members. After a brief introduction of the relevant knowledge, the system was analyzed in detail and the design and analysis were carried out, the SQL Server was regarded as a background database management system, Java was regarded as the development language, ASP.NET was regarded as a development platform, so as to achieve the innovation and entrepreneurship education management system.","Li, Fangjing",Journal,Journal of Applied Science and Engineering,2023-01-01,Xi'an International University,ASP ;  B/S ;  Innovation And Entrepreneurship ;  Java ;  NET
Experimental investigation of thermal efficiency and thermal performance improvement of compound parabolic collector utilizing SiO<inf>2</inf>/Ethylene glycol–water nanofluid,"A compound parabolic collector has been used in the present study to lower operating costs per unit of heat increase compared to other tracker concentrators. This type of collector has been given more attention in industrial and domestic applications in the temperature range of 60 to 300 °C. Also, to increase the thermal efficiency, nanofluid containing SiO2 nanoparticles in ethylene glycol–water hybrid base fluid (10–90 vol.%) have been used in three different volumetric fractions. The innovation of this present study includes the utilization of mentioned nanofluids for the first time in this collector, which has good stability and is cost-effective compared to other nanoparticles. In addition, the experimental measurement of thermal and hydraulic properties of nanofluids represents new aspects of the present study. The experiments used three volumetric fractions of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% under extensive solar radiation. Thermal performance of the collector at four volumetric flow rates of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 Lit/min have been investigated according to ASHRAE standard 93–2010 (RA2014). According to the experimental data, the thermal efficiency of the collector improved by 5% to 11.6% when the nanofluid was applied. The maximum enhancement of the average Nusselt number of the nanofluid versus the base fluid at the volumetric flow rate of 1 Lit/min and the volumetric fraction of 1.5% was equal to 7.3%. Besides, nanofluid increased the pressure drop, and consequently, the pumping power slightly. Finally, considering both the impacts of heat transfer and pressure drop, performance evaluation criteria and overall efficiency for nanofluid have been analyzed. The results represented that in all volumetric fractions, the values of performance evaluation criteria and overall efficiency enhanced compared to the base fluid. This research provides researchers and engineers with important information to better understand the thermal and hydraulic parameters of the parabolic compound concentrator in the presence of nanofluid to improve its thermal performance. The results also highlight the potential of using SiO2 nanoparticles to improve the thermal efficiency of solar collectors despite their low thermal conductivity compared to other conventional nanoparticles.","Khaledi, Omid;Saedodin, Seyfolah;Rostamian, Seyed Hadi",Journal,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2023-01-01,Semnan University;Damghan University,Compound parabolic collector (CPC) ;  Experimental investigation ;  Heat transfer ;  Nanofluid containing silica ;  Thermal efficiency
A bibliometric review of a decade’ research on industry 4.0 & supply chain management,The advancement of innovation from the latest engineering age to the innovation eon also called Industry 4.0 brought greater interest in the digitalization of the company. Supply Chain with Industry 4.0 enabling technologies increasingly get attention from industry practitioners and researchers. It is observed that most of the review articles are published with a focus on a particular journal or field. The methodology used in the previous review technique is the systematic literature and comprehensive literature method. Thus there is scope to apply a bibliometric analysis tool and technique for the decade of research in the field. An inclusive bibliometric analysis was carried out based on 1554 articles in the Scopus database from 2011 to 2022. In order to identify research hotspots thematic areas trending topics knowledge base R-Studio CiteSpace and VOSviewer are used for the analysis.

Reviewing the intellectual structure of product modularization: Toward a common view and future research agenda,"Product modularization in new product development has attracted considerable interest among scholars and practitioners from diverse fields of specialization. This has resulted in cross-disciplinary diversity in the field, diverting attention from its overall intellectual structure and hindering the development of a common view and shared concepts. Extant research lacks an integrative review, transcending a focal discipline that could identify gaps and ambiguities while making recommendations to advance the field. Considering a period of 30 years (1990–2020), we generate a data set of 2988 citing publications to which we apply a co-citation analysis. Thereby, we uncover the intellectual structure of the field and find three research perspectives that represent key knowledge bases: (1) product system, (2) production system, and (3) organizational system. Delimiting the data set into four periods, we can track developments over time, where we notice an increasing disintegration of the product system perspective, which is rooted in the discipline of engineering design. Within the two other perspectives, we document extensive dynamism in terms of publications, especially in the two most recent periods, indicating an active discussion and a potential receptivity to new trends. For these periods, we also identify an emerging cluster of fundamental publications and an increasing emphasis on the concept of system architecture. Leveraging the synthesis of these results, we forge links between neighboring disciplines and recommend avenues for further research, ideally to develop a more common view.","Mertens, Kai G.;Rennpferdt, Christoph;Greve, Erik;Krause, Dieter;Meyer, Matthias",Journal,Journal of Product Innovation Management,2023-01-01,Hamburg University of Technology,innovation ;  modularity ;  modularization ;  new product development ;  platform ;  review
A Technology Pillars for Civil Engineering Industries Related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution Toward Organizational Sustainability,"The development of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is the rise of technologies characterized through utilization of cyber-physical systems, smart factories, and service innovations affecting workplace elements of the civil engineering industry in order to create an organization capable of continuous change. It is imperative that the organizations are equipped with technology, but surprisingly, this is influenced by critical factors such as the rise of smart industries. Little is known about technology pillars and green technology in the civil engineering Industry 4.0, and research has made few contributions to the topic of Industry 4.0 from a civil engineer’s perspective. This paper aims to fill this research gap in terms of organizational sustainability. Therefore, this study is conducted to identify technology pillars related to Industry 4.0 affecting the sectors in the civil engineering industry and to identify the civil engineering sectors affected by Green Technology. The research method used in this study was a survey in which 270 respondents participated from Malaysia civil engineering industries. The findings could help support and guide best practices of technology adoption for civil engineering industries for organizational sustainability.","Qatyan, Ahlam Ba;Rahim, Zulhasni Abdul",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2023-01-01,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Kuala Lumpur,Civil engineering ;  Construction industry ;  Green technology ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Smart industry ;  Sustainability ;  Technology pillars

How knowledge loss and network-structure jointly determine R&D productivity in the biotechnology industry,"Organizational learning scholarship has shown that experience accumulates in manufacturing operations over time, affecting organizational productivity. To date, we have a limited understanding of how the loss of this experience by decay conditions R&D productivity. We advance this research by developing a model in which a scientist's R&D productivity is a function of her or his technological expertise. This technological expertise is subject to loss over time. Using a long panel (1970–2007) of data from the U.S. biotechnology industry, we find that knowledge loss decreases a scientist's R&D productivity because it reduces the technological expertise the scientist possesses and uses in R&D projects. Knowledge loss also affects R&D productivity through spillovers of knowledge. In our model, spillovers of external knowledge jointly depend on a scientist's network centrality and cohesion, the scientists' prior knowledge, and the extent to which external knowledge is available. Our analysis indicates that since knowledge loss limits decreases the scientist's prior knowledge, it diminishes her or his ability to assimilate and use external knowledge present in a firm and an industry. This in turn decreases the scientists' R&D productivity. Knowledge loss thus is critical to understand R&D productivity and knowledge spillovers.","Jain, Amit",Journal,Technovation,2023-01-01,National University of Singapore,Absorptive capacity ;  Innovative capability ;  Knowledge accumulation ;  Knowledge loss ;  Organizational forgetting ;  Technological innovation
Biofuel Cells: Materials and Challenges,"Rapid industrialization and urbanization associated with the environment changes calls for reduced pollution and thereby least use of fossil fuels. Biofuel cells are bioenergy resources and biocompatible alternatives to conventional fuel cells. Biofuel cells are one of the new sustainable renewable energy sources that are based on the direct conversion of chemical matters to electricity with the aid of microorganisms or enzymes as biocatalysts. The gradual depletion of fossil fuels, increasing energy needs, and the pressing problem of environmental pollution have stimulated a wide range of research and development efforts for renewable and environmentally friendly energy. Energy generation from biomass resources by employing biofuel cells is crucial for sustainable development. Biofuel cells have attracted considerable attention as micro- or even nano-power sources for implantable biomedical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers, implantable self-powered sensors, and biosensors for monitoring physiological parameters. This book covers the most recent developments and offers a detailed overview of fundamentals, principles, mechanisms, properties, optimizing parameters, analytical characterization tools, various types of biofuel cells, all-category of materials, catalysts, engineering architectures, implantable biofuel cells, applications and novel innovations and challenges in this sector.

More-than-national and less-than-global: The biochemical infrastructure of vaccine manufacturing,"The recent efforts to mount an R&D response to public health emergencies of international concern have led to the formation of what we term a biochemical infrastructure of vaccine development and production. In principle, this infrastructure is expected not only to curtail existing pandemics but also anticipate and contain yet-to-emerge future threats. Critically, by nature of its geographical distribution and technical modularity, that infrastructure promises both to accelerate and expand access to essential medical tools, and in so doing, redress global health inequities. In practice, however, the biochemical infrastructure of vaccines remains highly uneven, fragmented and unjust. Moving beyond calls for ‘global health solidarity’, this paper examines the key actors, normative techniques and socio-technical assemblages, from viral platform technologies to intellectual property waivers and from accelerated regulatory pathways to advance market commitments, that serve to link ‘just-in-case’ and ‘just-in-time’ modalities of global health R&D. We argue that the biomedical infrastructure of vaccine development and production emerging in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is unfolding across an innovation ecosystem that is more-than-national and yet less-than global: a reconfiguration that may offer possibilities for a new, radically-overhauled, model of vaccine equity.","Jensen, Nele;Barry, Andrew;Kelly, Ann H.",Journal,Economy and Society,2023-01-01,University College London;King's College London,biochemical engineering ;  COVID-19 ;  equity ;  infrastructure ;  vaccine R&D

"When digital technology innovation enhances Indigenous Peoples’ e-participation in climate change resilience-building: perspectives under the “e-GIS Smart, Inclusive, and, Climate-resilient Indigenous Peoples Landscape and Community Clearing-House Mechanism Solution”","Web-based multilingual tools to facilitate communication between Local and Indigenous Communities is an environmental technology approach emerging under the United Nations Biodiversity Global Agenda. To better address present climate resilience-building challenges in the current smart world, this contribution presents innovative avenues leading to the development of the « e-GIS Smart, Inclusive, and, Climate-resilient Indigenous Peoples Landscape and Community Clearing-House Mechanism Solution » which is meant to be used in the mobile-friendly website environment and the e-app environment. This technology policy paper shows that digital GIS, remote sensing products of observation satellites, and smartphone applications products derived from telecommunication satellites can help facilitate Indigenous Peoples’ contribution to climate resilience-building within their territories in terms of biodiversity and within their communities in terms of poverty eradication throughout the implementation of the United Nations Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs Global Agenda. The methodology used consists, therefore, of a plural technology interface that promises, among many other benefits, to facilitate Indigenous Peoples’ participation in decision-making processes. This research reminds us of the importance of state responsibility in these matters. It shows the importance of Indigenous Peoples’ participation in the implementation of global instances’ agendas through national reporting. It highlights the key role of Indigenous information decolonization and governance as principles of Indigenous Peoples’ sovereignty over Indigenous information. The results of this research are illustrated with case studies, when possible, to show the potential of the Solution to achieve its goals in climate resilience-building in Indigenous Peoples Landscapes and Communities with Indigenous Peoples and the financial support of state governments and inter-governmental institutions. In Canada, the use of the Solution to move forward in the Indigenous Peoples Affairs’ agenda, has the potential, among others, to enhance the expected outcome of the Canadian First Nations Data Governance Strategy (FNDGS) which is adopted as a response to an evolving smart planet to ensure no First Nation is left behind.","Manga, Sylvestre José Tidiane",Journal,Journal of Environmental Planning and Management,2023-01-01,Université McGill;International consultant to the UNCBD Parties;UNCCD,climate change adaptation ;  Indigenous information ;  Indigenous Peoples Affairs Global Agenda ;  Indigenous Peoples’ e-participation ;  Indigenous Peoples’ right to decision-making ;  Indigenous Peoples’ sovereignty ;  Landscape Geomatics Engineering Technology trends ;  technology solutions and innovation
Building Information Modeling in Canada: A Multidisciplinary Practical Analysis,"Building information modeling (BIM) provides promising opportunities to architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) disciplines in Canada and around the world. Although used in practice primarily for design, BIM has improved coordination and enhanced productivity of field workflows for contractors too. This paper investigates the state of BIM in Canada from a multidisciplinary perspective. It is then followed by a case study to explore the potential uses of BIM in the field. Governments around the world have introduced or plan to initiate national/local digital programs to incentivize or mandate the use of BIM in public projects. In Canada, however, there is no such national initiative in place. This study demonstrates the current state of BIM adoption in Canada and provides insights into the viewpoint of those in architecture, engineering, construction, and BIM specialized disciplines with regard to the effect of BIM on working practices and its benefits and barriers. To this aim, Building Innovation Research Centre at University of Toronto, in collaboration with national and local industry organizations, conducted three nationwide surveys over the past years. These results were analyzed and presented in this paper. The case study examines the feasibility of BIM implementation on a construction site through interviews with key site individuals, as well as active attendance at site coordination meetings. The outcome of this study can serve as a benchmark for evaluating and tracking the state of BIM adoption in Canada from the perspective of disciplines.","Nasrazadani, H.;Shahi, K.;Shahi, A.;McCabe, B.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2023-01-01,University of Toronto;AECO Innovation Lab,

Investigating the drivers of failure of research-industry collaborations in open innovation contexts,"Collaboration between research and industry is fundamental for technology innovation. Most existing research in this domain has focused on the drivers or enabling factors that lead to the success of such collaboration. On the contrary, the lack of information about collaboration failures in research-industry settings still represents one of the main obstacles to studying this topic. In this paper, we argue that management scholars should deepen inquiry on unsuccessful research-industry collaborations, as these occurrences may also have major repercussions in terms of business failures. Accordingly, we take stock of research on unsuccessful collaborations in the Big Science context, a special open innovation environment characterised by unexplored cases of research-industry collaboration failures. To address the need to investigate the drivers of failure in this context, we leverage a multiple case study analysis with a retrospective approach of a polar sample type of six case studies of collaborations between CERN – the biggest fundamental research organisation in the world – and supplier companies: three collaborations that have been recognised as successful, and three that have been recognised as failures. By doing so, we aim to provide a framework highlighting the main drivers that lead to failures of collaborations in this peculiar open innovation context and to shed light on the reasons why research-industry collaborations may fail in the Big Science context.","Puliga, Gloria;Urbinati, Andrea;Franchin, Enrico Maria;Castegnaro, Stefano",Journal,Technovation,2023-01-01,"Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Padova;Università Carlo Cattaneo",Big science ;  CERN ;  Failure ;  Open innovation ;  Research-industry collaborations ;  Technology innovation
Typology of teachers’ stages of concern for STEM education,"Background: Despite the focus of many global education systems on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, research on teachers’ concerns about this relatively new educational phenomenon remains scarce. Purpose: This study used the concerns-based adoption model as the theoretical framework to examine the primary concerns expressed by teachers about STEM education and identified a typology of teachers based on the response patterns of their concerns. Sample: A regionally representative sample of 331 primary and secondary school teachers of STEM-related subjects in Hong Kong participated in this study. Design and methods: Data were collected from the teachers through an online, self-reported survey. Latent class analysis was used to profile teachers’ concerns about STEM education in this study, and multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to regress the latent class outcome variable on the covariates. Results: The majority of the teachers reported high levels of concern at all five stages of STEM education implementation, namely evaluation, information, management, consequence, and refocusing. Latent class analysis revealed three classes of teachers who were extremely concerned (49.1%), considerably concerned (43.5%), or moderately concerned (7.4%) about STEM education. Multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that the teaching sector (primary or secondary) and participation in STEM education training significantly contributed to the prediction of the latent class outcome variable. Conclusion: Given that 96% of the teachers in this study were trained in STEM education through workshops, seminars, courses, and trips, these findings highlight the necessity of designing personalized professional learning experiences for teachers and provide empirically supported evidence to indicate teachers’ preparedness and readiness to adopt STEM education as an educational innovation and directions for future research in related areas. This study also informs evidence-based policy making regarding STEM teacher education.","Lau, Wilfred W.F.;Jong, Morris S.Y.",Journal,Research in Science and Technological Education,2023-01-01,Chinese University of Hong Kong,personalized professional learning ;  STEM education ;  teacher education ;  Teachers’ concerns

Developing an improved reverse engineering adoption model towards the improvement of performance in metal engineering industries,"Purpose: This research aims to develop an improved model that promotes reverse engineering /RE/ practice in metal engineering industries (MEIs). RE is one cost-effective technology transfer /TT/ and innovation method that improves organizational performance. However, only a few scholars have written on the adoption of RE models, and no one has contextualized TT and innovation models as a means to adopt RE practice. Methodology: Primarily, the study conducted a systematic literature review based on previous works to develop a conceptual model for RE adoption. To do this, the researchers conducted an intensive literature review and identified factors contributing to the model. Contextualizing TT and innovation factors and models within the new RE adoption model is also a significant part of the work. After a comparative analysis, the researchers developed the improved RE adoption model that enhances the performance of MEIs. Finding: The majority of previous related literature focuses on RE hardware, with only a few authors acknowledging the soft aspects, i.e., managerial and legal issues of RE practice. Besides, no authors contextualized factors of TT and innovation within the RE adoption. In this study, the researchers identified and clustered RE adoption factors as organizational, technological, managerial, and resource-based from previous RE adoption models and contextualization of TT and innovation adoption factors. Originality: To the best of the writers’ knowledge, no previous authors have contextualized TT and innovation models within the adoption of RE. However, such models have a substantial impact on adopting the practice. Hence, the researchers developed an improved model by examining and contextualizing the existing models that can impact MEI performance through improving product, process, and technological capabilities.","Goshime, Yichalewal;Kitaw, Daniel;Ebinger, Frank;Jilcha, Kassu",Journal,"African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development",2023-01-01,Addis Ababa University;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,adoption models ;  developing countries ;  metal engineering industries ;  performance improvement ;  reverse engineering
"Technology, entrepreneurship, innovation and social change in digital economics","Technology and digitalization are increasingly core subjects for researchers across disciplines, from economics and management to engineering and the humanities. Digital innovations, such as the Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and various digital technology-based platforms, are influencing business venturing and changing the ways that extend beyond entrepreneurship and innovation practices to influence culture, politics and society. Social media platforms and digital communications have even restructured social relations. Yet little research has fully addressed the profound relationship between technology, entrepreneurship/innovation and social change. To correct this oversight, this Special Issue in Technovation is devoted to publishing original research that enriches our knowledge about the nature of digital technology and its influence on entrepreneurship and innovation in digital economies. We elaborate the emerging new business models, their antecedents, and their economic and social consequences. The issue also highlights key emerging research areas of digital technology-based entrepreneurship/innovation and articulates an agenda for future scholarship.","Si, Steven;Hall, Jeremy;Suddaby, Roy;Ahlstrom, David;Wei, Jiang",Journal,Technovation,2023-01-01,"Peter B.

"Let's Talk with Developers, Not about Developers: A Review of Automatic Program Repair Research","Automatic program repair (APR) offers significant potential for automating some coding tasks. Using APR could reduce the high costs historically associated with fixing code faults and deliver significant benefits to software engineering. Adopting APR could also have profound implications for software developers' daily activities, transforming their work practices. To realise the benefits of APR it is vital that we consider how developers feel about APR and the impact APR may have on developers' work. Developing APR tools without consideration of the developer is likely to undermine the success of APR deployment. In this paper, we critically review how developers are considered in APR research by analysing how human factors are treated in 260 studies from Monperrus's Living Review of APR. Over half of the 260 studies in our review were motivated by a problem faced by developers (e.g., the difficulty associated with fixing faults). Despite these human-oriented motivations, fewer than 7% of the 260 studies included a human study. We looked in detail at these human studies and found their quality mixed (for example, one human study was based on input from only one developer). Our results suggest that software developers are often talked about in APR studies, but are rarely talked with. A more comprehensive and reliable understanding of developer human factors in relation to APR is needed. Without this understanding, it will be difficult to develop APR tools and techniques which integrate effectively into developers' workflows. We recommend a future research agenda to advance the study of human factors in APR.","Winter, Emily;Nowack, Vesna;Bowes, David;Counsell, Steve;Hall, Tracy;Haraldsson, Saemundur;Woodward, John",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2023-01-01,"School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University;University of Stirling;Queen Mary University of London;Brunel University London",automatic program repair ;  Human factors ;  software development
International Trends in Mining Tailings Research through Machine Learning Method: Retrospective or Prospective Oriented Research?,"Using a conceptual distinction between prospective and retrospective research, we analyze the international high-impact literature on tailings. This distinction differentiates between investigations concentrated on specific case studies, where the socio-environmental consequences of tailings are addressed or specific actions on them are documented, and the investigations that model interventions on tailings, propose new forms of design, management and remediation applicable to tailings. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, we covered all the publications registered in the Scopus database between 2010 and 2020 on mining tailings. Our research question ask for the temporal orientations in the international publication on mining tailings deposits between 2010 and 2020? Our results show an increase in the number of prospective investigations, which practically double the retrospective ones. However, at the level of citations, this difference is reduced and the most cited investigations in the retrospective perspective outnumber the most cited ones in the prospective perspective. We conclude by discussing the need to address the impact of prospective research on mining companies and overcoming resistance to innovation in the industry when there are no regulatory or legal obligations. In the same way, we call for an increase in the public contribution to maintain the independence of retrospective research, without neglecting the necessary construction of updated evidence on the socio-environmental consequences of mining tailings.","Campos-Medina, Fernando;Ojeda-Pereira, Iván;Quiroz, Joaquín;Guzmán, Joao",Journal,Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Review,2023-01-01,Universidad de Chile,engineering ;  environmental and earth sciences ;  machine learning ;  mining tailings ;  prospective/retrospective research ;  social sciences
Antibody engineering and its therapeutic applications,"As a natural function, antibodies defend the host from infected cells and pathogens by recognizing their pathogenic determinants. Antibodies (Abs) gained wide acceptance with an enormous impact on human health and have predominantly captured the arena of bio-therapeutics and bio-diagnostics. The scope of Ab-based biologics is vast, and it is likely to solve many unmet clinical needs in future. The majority of attention is now devoted to developing innovative technologies for manufacturing and engineering Abs, better suited to satisfy human needs. The advent of Ab engineering technologies (AET) led to phenomenal developments leading to the generation of Abs-/Ab-derived molecules with desirable functional properties proportional to their expanding requirements. Evolution brought by AET, from the naturally occurring Ab forms to several advanced Ab formats and derivatives, was much needed as it is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, numerous advancements in AET have propelled success in therapeutic Ab development, along with the potential for ever-increasing improvements. Unique characteristics of Abs, such as its diversity, specificity, structural integrity and an array of possible applications, together inspire continuous innovation in the field. Overall, the AET could assist in conquer of several limitations of Abs in terms of their applicability in the field of therapeutics, diagnostics and research; AET has so far led to the production of next-generation Abs, which have revolutionized these arenas. Here in this review, we discuss the various distinguished engineering platforms for Ab development and the progress in modern therapeutics by the so-called “next-generation Abs.”.","Kandari, Divya;Bhatnagar, Rakesh",Journal,International Reviews of Immunology,2023-01-01,Amity University Rajasthan;Jawaharlal Nehru University;Banaras Hindu University,Antibodies (Abs) ;  Antibody Engineering Technologies (AET) ;  Antibody Therapeutics ;  Bispecific Antibodies (BsAbs) ;  Next-generation Antibodies
"Digital fabrication, BIM and early contractor involvement in design in construction projects: a comparative case study","Digital Fabrication (DFAB) is a systemic innovation with low adoption rates in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) projects. Managing requirements of a new design process is one major challenge for the increased DFAB adoption. For other types of innovations, practices such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) improve design management by integrating process, information and organisation in construction projects. In theory, BIM and ECI could improve design management and increase the adoption of DFAB. However, the relationship between DFAB, BIM and ECI has not yet been studied thoroughly. There is a need to understand new paradigms of DFAB design management in regard to process integration, information integration and organisational integration. This study undertakes a comparative study of four DFAB adoptions in AEC projects with varying levels of BIM and ECI implementation. The design processes of DFAB are traced using swimlane process diagrams. From this, relationships between DFAB, BIM, and ECI are derived using a quadripartite interrelationship diagram. This work illustrates the proposed relationships in DFAB adoption in design using a fishbone diagram. This work concludes with potential future research in design management for digital fabrication, including five takeaways for practitioners to adopt and manage DFAB in the design process of construction projects.","Ng, Ming Shan;Graser, Konrad;Hall, Daniel Mark",Journal,Architectural Engineering and Design Management,2023-01-01,ETH Zürich,BIM ;  comparative case study ;  design management ;  Digital fabrication ;  early contractor involvement
IPLSL and IPLSQ: Two types of imputation PLS algorithms for hierarchical latent variable model,"In many applications of hierarchical latent variable model, manifest variables could be missing due to various reasons. Improper missing data techniques or data imputation algorithms may lead to incredible data sets and inaccurate estimates. In our paper, we propose two types of imputation partial least square (PLS) algorithms to deal with missing data problems in hierarchical latent variable model. One is the imputation PLS algorithms based on linear regression (IPLSL), the other is the imputation PLS algorithms based on quantile regression (IPLSQ). In IPLSL, we apply the idea of complete case analysis (CC), inverse probability weighting (IPW) and fractional imputation (FI) to one kind of PLS algorithm which is different from the existing repeated indicators approach, two-step approach and hybrid approach. In IPLSQ, we also apply CC, IPW and FI to a modified PLS algorithm based on quantile regression. Compared with IPLSL, IPLSQ has the advantages in capturing overall view of structural relationships at different quantiles and highlighting the changing relations according to the explored quantile of interest. Together with mean and median imputation, we investigate the performances of our IPLSL and IPLSQ algorithms through simulation studies and then apply them to national science and technology innovation capability study based on part of World Bank database and Global Innovation Index report.","Cheng, Hao",Journal,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods,2023-01-01,Renmin University of China;China Association for Science and Technology,formative measurement model ;  hierarchical latent variable model ;  Missing data ;  partial least square
R&D Dynamic Capabilities in a Changing Regulatory Context,"An extension of the dynamic capabilities model is evaluated in a rapidly changing and complex context: the global automotive sector. This industry is undergoing significant change to improve sustainable performance (e.g., alternative power train technologies with less pollution and better energy performance) responding to more stringent regulations and changing locus of innovation (i.e., suppliers investing more in R&D). Using a comparative and validated sample of 104 R&D projects in the U.S. and China, five hypotheses are tested and supported: 1) dynamic capabilities are significantly related to R&D project success, mediated by strategic intent (H1); 2) dynamic capabilities and resources operate independently and significantly in a model to predict sustainable R&D project success (H2); 3) for the U.S. data (a mature economy), there is a significant relationship between technology novelty and dynamic capabilities (H3), but not for the Chinese data, as predicted (H4); and 4) the Chinese economy does not experience the slowdown encountered in the U.S. economy (H5), but Chinese R&D is dominated by incremental improvements of existing products. These results sustain and clarify the differences in the dynamic capabilities model in mature and emerging economies for the global automotive industry.","Ettlie, John;Muammer, Ozer;Murthy, Rajendran",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-01-01,City University of Hong Kong;Rochester Institute of Technology,Automotive components ;  engineering management ;  industry applications ;  management ;  manufacturing industries ;  mechanical products ;  research and development ;  technology management
Implementing Business Models Into Operations: Impact of Business Model Implementation on Performance,"Business models (BMs) help firms to translate abstract strategic decisions into their daily operations. Because BMs mediate between strategy and operations, BM innovation involves both high-level strategic experiments and low-level implementation into operations and technologies. However, most existing empirical studies regarding BM innovation focus exclusively on strategic management and marketing theory. This article examines whether the performance implications of BM experimentation are mediated by the time and effort spent on implementing BMs into operating models and enterprise architectures. We adopt an empirical approach, by analyzing the results of a large-scale, representative survey among European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In line with the existing literature, the research confirms that spending time and effort experimenting with new BMs has a positive impact on the firm performance. An important new finding is that impact is in part mediated by BM implementation (i.e., translating new BMs into operating models and enterprise architectures). This article provides empirical support for the argument that BM innovation is not just a matter of strategic thinking and experimenting with BM components and BM architecture, but that is also involve aligning BMs to operations and enterprise architectures. Our findings call for future research into the process of BM innovation from a business modeling, an enterprise architecting and engineering management perspective, with a focus on information exchange, business processes, and supporting IT applications and infrastructure.","Verhagen, Mathijs;De Reuver, Mark;Bouwman, Harry",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2023-01-01,"Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management, TU Delft",business model innovation (BMI) ;  Business models (BMs) ;  enterprise architecture (EA) ;  operating model (OM)
Electric Vehicle Control and Driving Safety Systems: A Review,"The relevance of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and the overall market demands of the respective control units is in a never before leap all around the globe as seen from the news, business studies, research trends and technological innovations today. Compared to earlier years, the relevance of driving safety in EVs also gains special attention due to the unforeseen surge in promoting EVs by National, State and City administrations for better environment and societal changes in future. For EV, the scenario broadens to a wider landscape beyond the earlier passive safety design features, to a highly comfortable and safer possible road travel. Safety enhancements can be experimented and implemented on EVs in a reliable way with higher end control of the dynamics, stability and optimised utilisation of individual vehicle characteristics and driver behaviours. In this paper, an attempt is made to scrutinise different control design approaches and possible solution paths experimented upon in the past and currently for EV as seen in the published literature. The quest is also to explore optimisation strategies in an organised way to ensure best possible driving safety along with passenger safety in EVs.","Indu, K.;Aswatha Kumar, M.",Journal,IETE Journal of Research,2023-01-01,Christ University,Control strategies ;  Electric vehicle ;  Electronic control unit ;  Optimisation techniques ;  Safety systems ;  Vehicle control unit ;  Vehicle safety
"CREATING INCLUSIVE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) COURSES","This chapter focuses on research-based inclusive teaching practices that can address the “chilly climate” in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. It draws on the products of the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL), which provide recommendations to improve the success of underrepresented groups. STEM instructors can expand the pool of students who succeed in the field by improving students’ educational experiences. The CIRTL, a National Science Foundation-funded network of six universities promoting the quality preparation of future STEM faculty, has developed resources to help faculty both support and benefit from classroom diversity. The chapter defines diversity in the broadest terms possible, to include ethnicity, gender, disability, learning style, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and other societal categories. Both female students and students of color experience exclusion and disrespect in college courses. When introducing teaching innovations to the classroom, seeking feedback from students is essential.","Gunasekera, Nilhan;Friedrich, Katherine",Book,Getting Culture: Incorporating Diversity Across the Curriculum,2023-01-01,University of Wisconsin-Whitewater at Rock County;University of Wisconsin-Madison,
