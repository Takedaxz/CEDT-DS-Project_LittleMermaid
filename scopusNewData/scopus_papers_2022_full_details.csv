CRISPR/Cas9 as precision and high-throughput genetic engineering tools in gastrointestinal cancer research and therapy,"Gastrointestinal cancer (GI) is one of the most serious and health-threatening diseases worldwide. Many countries have encountered an escalating prevalence of shock. Therefore, there is a pressing need to clarify the molecular pathogenesis of these cancers. The use of high-throughput technologies that allow the precise and simultaneous investigation of thousands of genes, proteins, and metabolites is a critical step in disease diagnosis and cure. Recent innovations have provided easy and reliable methods for genome investigation, including TALENs, ZFNs, and the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats system). Among these, CRISPR/Cas9 has been revolutionary tool in genetic research. Recent years were prosperous years for CRISPR by the discovery of novel Cas enzymes, the Nobel Prize, and the development of critical clinical trials. This technology utilizes comprehensive information on genes associated with tumor development, provides high-throughput libraries for tumor therapy by developing screening platforms, and generates rapid tools for cancer therapy. This review discusses the various applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in genome editing, with a particular focus on genome manipulation, including infection-related genes, RNAi targets, pooled library screening for identification of unknown driver mutations, and molecular targets for gastrointestinal cancer modeling. Finally, it provides an overview of CRISPR/Cas9 clinical trials, as well as the challenges associated with its use.","Hosseini, Sayedeh Azimeh;Salehifard Jouneghani, Alizamen;Ghatrehsamani, Mahdi;Yaghoobi, Hajar;Elahian, Fatemeh;Mirzaei, Seyed Abbas",Journal,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,2022-12-31,Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences,CRISPR/Cas9 ;  Gastrointestinal cancers ;  Genetic engineering ;  Infectious diseases ;  Non-coding RNA ;  Organoid cancer modeling
Metal Halide Perovskite/Electrode Contacts in Charge-Transporting-Layer-Free Devices,"Metal halide perovskites have drawn substantial interest in optoelectronic devices in the past decade. Perovskite/electrode contacts are crucial for constructing high-performance charge-transporting-layer-free perovskite devices, such as solar cells, field-effect transistors, artificial synapses, memories, etc. Many studies have evidenced that the perovskite layer can directly contact the electrodes, showing abundant physicochemical, electronic, and photoelectric properties in charge-transporting-layer-free perovskite devices. Meanwhile, for perovskite/metal contacts, some critical interfacial physical and chemical processes are reported, including band bending, interface dipoles, metal halogenation, and perovskite decomposition induced by metal electrodes. Thus, a systematic summary of the role of metal halide perovskite/electrode contacts on device performance is essential. This review summarizes and discusses charge carrier dynamics, electronic band engineering, electrode corrosion, electrochemical metallization and dissolution, perovskite decomposition, and interface engineering in perovskite/electrode contacts-based electronic devices for a comprehensive understanding of the contacts. The physicochemical, electronic, and morphological properties of various perovskite/electrode contacts, as well as relevant engineering techniques, are presented. Finally, the current challenges are analyzed, and appropriate recommendations are put forward. It can be expected that further research will lead to significant breakthroughs in their application and promote reforms and innovations in future solid-state physics and materials science.","Li, Deli;Dong, Xue;Cheng, Peng;Song, Lin;Wu, Zhongbin;Chen, Yonghua;Huang, Wei",Journal,Advanced Science,2022-12-28,Nanjing Tech University;Fujian Normal University;Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications;Northwestern Polytechnical University,artificial synapses ;  charge transporting layer ;  perovskite/electrode contact ;  solar cells ;  transistors
Development and practice of national first-class undergraduate course “bioengineering equipment”,"As a strategic emerging industry of China, the biotechnology industry develops rapidly in recent years, which significantly increased the demand for creative and capable talents. As a core curriculum of bioengineering specialty, biotechnology equipment plays an important role in fostering such talents. To address the problems in biotechnology equipment course teaching such as limited equipment availability, limited engineering practice, and lack of learning motivations, curriculum reform and optimization were performed based on curriculum resource development, virtual reality-physical combined engineering training, and boosting learning motivations. The optimized teaching contents focus on fostering morality, intelligence, and creative practice abilities by connecting new requirements of social development, introducing new progress in biotechnology research, as well as new practices in research and development (R&D). Measures such as teaching methods innovation, assessment and evaluation methods optimization, cutting-edge R&D progress, diverse resources integration, and online-offline combined teaching, were developed to boost the learning motivation and foster the innovation competence of students. By above exploration and practice, the practice and innovation competence of students were significantly enhanced.","Wang, Yuanshan;Niu, Kun;Cheng, Feng;Wu, Zheming;Xu, Jianmiao;Song, Xiaofei;Zheng, Yuguo",Journal,Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Biotechnology,2022-12-25,Zhejiang University of Technology,biotechnology equipment ;  biotechnology industry ;  creative practice ability ;  industry-education integration
Green technology innovation in China city system: Dynamics and determinants,"Green technology innovation is the first driving force to promote green development and harmonious coexistence between human and nature. Green technology innovation is the core issue of environmental economics, innovation economics, innovation management and other research fields. It is also one of the emerging topics in the field of environmental economic geography in recent years. Overall, the research on enterprise level is dominant, while the research on spatial scale is relatively less. In this paper, by deriving green patent applications for measuring green technology innovation from the Wanfang Patent Database, the spatial and temporal characteristics and its determinants of green technology innovation in China's city system from 2007 to 2017 are explored. The results indicate that technologies related to buildings has dominated the development of environmental innovation in China's city system, while technologies in the field of greenhouse gases and water adaptation were quite unpopular throughout China. In 2007, China's environmental innovation was dominated by individuals and enterprises. By 2017, enterprises have become the main body of China's environmental innovation, highlighting the essential characteristics of enterprises as the subject of environmental innovation. In space, the geography of environmental innovation in China's city system presents a strong spatial imbalance feature, a tripolar pattern dominated by the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Beijing-Tianjin region has become increasingly prominent. In terms of determinants, spatial Durbin model regression results reflect that there are significant spatial spillover effects and path dependence characteristics in China's environmental innovation. Environmental regulation intensity, city size, market size, technological innovation level, FDI, and air quality have obvious positive effects on urban environmental innovation, while the industrial structure dominated by secondary industry has obvious inhibitory effect on urban environmental innovation.","Duan, Dezhong;Du, Debin",Journal,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,2022-12-25,East China Normal University,China ;  Determinants ;  Green patents ;  Green technology innovation ;  Innovation subjects ;  Space- time pattern

"Smart Hydrogen Atoms in Heterocyclic Cations of 1,2,4-Triazolium-Type Poly(ionic liquid)s","ConspectusDiscovering and constructing molecular functionality platforms for materials chemistry innovation has been a persistent target in the fields of chemistry, materials, and engineering. Around this task, basic scientific questions can be asked, novel functional materials can be synthesized, and efficient system functionality can be established. Poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) have attracted growing interest far beyond polymer science and are now considered an interdisciplinary crossing point between multiple research areas due to their designable chemical structure, intriguing physicochemical properties, and broad and diverse applications. Recently, we discovered that 1,2,4-triazolium-type PILs show enhanced performance profiles, which are due to stronger and more abundant supramolecular interactions ranging from hydrogen bonding to metal coordination, when compared with structurally similar imidazolium counterparts. This phenomenon in our view can be related to the smart hydrogen atoms (SHAs), that is, any proton that binds to the carbon in the N-heterocyclic cations of 1,2,4-triazolium-type PILs. The replacement of one carbon by an electron-withdrawing nitrogen atom in the broadly studied heterocyclic imidazolium ring will further polarize the C-H bond (especially for C5-H) of the resultant 1,2,4-triazolium cation and establish new chemical tools for materials design. For instance, the H-bond-donating strength of the SHA, as well as its Broønsted acidity, is increased. Furthermore, polycarbene complexes can be readily formed even in the presence of weak or medium bases, which is by contrast rather challenging for imidazolium-type PILs. The combination of SHAs with the intrinsic features of heterocyclic cation-functionalized PILs (e.g., N-coordination capability and polymeric multibinding effects) enables new phenomena and therefore innovative materials applications.In this Account, recent progress on SHAs is presented. SHA-related applications in several research branches are highlighted together with the corresponding materials design at size scales ranging from nano- to micro- and macroscopic levels. At a nanoscopic level, it is possible to manipulate the interior and outer shapes and surface properties of PIL nanocolloids by adjusting the hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between SHAs and water. Owing to the interplay of polycarbene structure, N-coordination, and the polymer multidentate binding of 1,2,4-triazolium-type PILs, metal clusters with controllable size at sub-nanometer scale were successfully synthesized and stabilized, which exhibited record-high catalytic performance in H2 generation via methanolysis of ammonia borane. At the microscopic level, SHAs are found to efficiently catalyze single crystal formation of structurally complex organics. Free protons in situ released from the SHAs serve as organocatalysts to activate formation of C-N bonds at room temperature in a series of imine-linked crystalline porous organics, such as organic cages, macrocycles and covalent organic frameworks; meanwhile the concurrent ""salting-out""effect of PILs as polymers in solution accelerated the crystallization rate of product molecules by at least 1 order of magnitude. At the macroscopic scale, by finely regulating the supramolecular interactions of SHAs, a series of functional supramolecular porous polyelectrolyte membranes (SPPMs) with switchable pores and gradient cross-sectional structures were manufactured. These membranes demonstrate impressive figures of merit, ranging from chiral separation and proton recognition to switchable optical properties and real-time chemical reaction monitoring. Although the concept of SHAs is in the incipient stage of development, our successful examples of applications portend bright prospects for materials chemistry innovation.","Liu, Si Hua;Wang, Hong;Sun, Jian Ke;Antonietti, Markus;Yuan, Jiayin",Journal,Accounts of Chemical Research,2022-12-20,Stockholms universitet;Nankai University;Beijing Institute of Technology;Max-Planck-Institut für Kolloid- und Grenzflächenforschung,
Bi<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>Te Nanosheets Saturable Absorber-Based Passive Mode-Locked Fiber Laser: From Soliton Molecules to Harmonic Soliton,"As a recent addition to the emerging 2D bismuth oxychalcogenides (Bi2O2X, where X = S, Se, and Te), atomically-thin bismuth oxytellurium (Bi2O2Te) exhibits unique thermoelectric and photoelectric properties. In this study, high-quality Bi2O2Te nanosheets (NSs)-based saturable absorber (SA) with a modulation depth of 8.2% is developed using the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) method and is successfully applied to a passively mode-locked Er-doped fiber laser (EDFL) for the first time (with reference to the available literature). Due to the excellent nonlinear saturable absorption property of Bi2O2Te NSs, various switchable and stable mode-locking states can be realized in the same EDFL, including fundamental frequency conventional soliton (CS), soliton molecules, and harmonic mode-locking (HML) states. Among them, the CS pulse at 7.48 MHz (fundamental frequency) with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 67.25 dB is obtained. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-order soliton molecules are observed with a soliton pulse separation of ≈6.2 ps. Moreover, for HML, a maximum repetition rate of 1.78 GHz (i.e., corresponding to the 238th-order harmonic) is obtained. The results reveal that Bi2O2Te NSs demonstrate excellent nonlinear optical modulation properties and can serve as a fundamental basis for promotion of academic research and innovation of engineering applications involving ultrafast photonics.","Hui, Zhanqiang;Bu, Xiaofeng;Wang, Yuanhong;Han, Dongdong;Gong, Jiamin;Li, Lu;Li, Xiaohui;Yan, Shuangyi",Journal,Advanced Optical Materials,2022-12-19,Xi'an Institute of Posts and Telecommunications;University of Bristol;Shaanxi Normal University,2D materials ;  Bi  O  Te 2 2 ;  harmonic mode-locking ;  mode-locked fiber laser ;  saturable absorber ;  soliton molecules
Application of Modeling and Simulation Technology in Teaching Practice of Engineering Mechanics,"Experiment teaching is the teaching difficulty of Engineering Mechanics in vocational colleges. The lack of relevant equipment poses a great challenge to teaching. In order to solve this problem and improve the quality of teaching, the research group proposed a strategy using simulation technology. The torsion experiment of Engineering Mechanics was used as a case for teaching practice. Firstly, the problems in the teaching were analyzed. Secondly, the research group proposed a targeted teaching design. Thirdly, the finite element model was established and simulated on a server. Fourthly, the digital teaching resources were sorted out based on the simulation results. Fifthly, teaching practice had been implemented in the classroom. Finally, the quality of teaching practice was evaluated. The results show that modeling and simulation technology can significantly improve the quality of teaching. The enthusiasm of the students has been significantly improved. The colorful nephograms are convenient for students to understand the boring knowledge. This study provides ideas for the innovation of experimental teaching and the development of curriculum resources in vocational colleges. More new technologies should be explored and tried by more scholars.","Wang, Shang;Zhu, Qingsong;Zhen, Xuesong",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-12-16,Beijing Polytechnic,Finite element model ;  Simulation ;  Teaching design ;  Torsion experiment
Hydroinformatics as a 'game changer' in the water business,"This chapter presents the field of hydroinformatics as a game-changer in the water sector business. It reflects on Mike Abbott's original ideas and evaluates their impact from the perspective of water business owners, water consultants, clients, and communities. Mike Abbott promoted a novel concept, combining theoretical and practical aspects of modelling, towards 'industrial modelling systems'. The chapter traces the development of this concept, from its early adoption by government-funded research institutes engaged in scientific support to hydraulic engineering, through establishment of market for water-modelling software products, to its broad adoption by consultants. Mike Abbott also saw a significant opportunity for hydroinformatics in the developing world. New policies and businesses were easier to implement in countries without a mature market of ideas resisting a change. Many of his followers were eager to explore business paths, which were much faster and more agile than those in academic circles. Most large companies that are currently developing commercial applications and tools for water modelling matured during the so-called 'third modelling generation', when generic modelling tools started to be developed. Subsequently, the real growth was observed when the knowledge encapsulation and robustness of the applications expanded their use from specialists to a broad pool of water professionals and practitioners. The social impact of hydroinformatics was significant as it spread through a wide range of organisations impacting decision making, education, innovation and knowledge sharing. As modelling systems became a norm in the water business, the business itself has been transformed. Impacts of current technologies and new data sources on water modelling business are presented (such as the Cloud, High Performance Computing - HPC, virtualisation, internet of things - IoT, remote sensing, and others), and how they impact current needs of software producers and users. Diverse business models have emerged, which need to meet the future challenges of urban and environmental water management under challenges of climate change. With the large and continuously growing community of modelling experts and users, it can be argued that the Mike Abbott's vision of hydroinformatics has been well established.","Zeman, E.;Metelka, T.;Ingeduld, P.;Shipton, S.",Book,Michael Abbott's Hydroinformatics: Poiesis of New Relationships with Water,2022-12-15,Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic;Climate Change Adaptation Department;DHI Water and Environment;DHI a.s.,Cloud computing ;  Collaboration ;  GIS ;  Hydroinformatics ;  Simulation models ;  Water business

Investigating porous catalysts with synchrotron X-rays and neutrons,"Porous catalysts have been widely used in the industry and are among the most promising candidates to facilitate the transformation to a sustainable society. Their rational design generally adopts the approach of molecular engineering, which relies on a deep understanding of the relations between atomic structures and catalytic properties. In recent years, synchrotron X-ray and neutron techniques have attracted great attention for probing the atomic structures of many functional materials. In this perspective, we look at recent developments in several synchrotron X-ray and neutron techniques for understanding the structure-property relations of porous catalysts at the atomic level. We extensively elucidate the study of both the static and dynamic structures of porous catalysts and their relation to catalytic properties. We highlight the limitations of the synchrotron X-ray and neutron techniques discussed for investigating porous catalysts and provide future research directions on this critical yet underdeveloped topic.","Mo, Shichao;Wang, Guilian;Ng, Bryan K.Y.;Zhao, Pu",Journal,Chem Catalysis,2022-12-15,University of Oxford;Soochow University,neutrons ;  porous catalysts ;  SDG9: Industry innovation and infrastructure ;  synchrotron X-rays
Recent advances on bioactive baghdadite ceramic for bone tissue engineering applications: 20 years of research and innovation (a review),"Various artificial bone graft substitutes based on ceramics have been developed over the last 20 years. Among them, calcium-silicate-based ceramics, which are osteoconductive and can attach directly to biological organs, have received great attention for bone tissue engineering applications. However, the degradation rate of calcium-silicate and bone formation is often out of balance, resulting in stress shielding (osteopenia). A new strategy to improve the drawbacks of these ceramics is incorporating trace elements such as Zn, Mg, and Zr into their lattice structures, enhancing their physical and biological properties. Recently, baghdadite (Ca3ZrSi2O9) ceramic, one of the most appealing calcium-silicate-based ceramics, has demonstrated high bioactivity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and cell interaction. Because of its physical, mechanical, and biological properties and ability to be shaped using various fabrication techniques, baghdadite has found high potential in various biomedical applications such as coatings, fillers, cement, scaffolds, and drug delivery systems. Undoubtedly, there is a high potential for this newly developed ceramic to contribute significantly to therapies to provide a tremendous clinical outcome. This review paper aims to summarize and discuss the most relevant studies performed on baghdadite-based ceramics and composites by focusing on their behavior in vivo and in vitro.","Sadeghzade, Sorour;Liu, Jingyi;Wang, Huiru;Li, Xin;Cao, Jinrui;Cao, Huiling;Tang, Bin;Yuan, Hongyan",Journal,Materials Today Bio,2022-12-15,Southern University of Science and Technology,3D-printing ;  Baghdadite ;  Bioactive ceramics ;  Bone tissue engineering ;  Calcium-silicate bioceramic
The policy effects of demand-pull and technology-push on the diffusion of wind power: A scenario analysis based on system dynamics approach,"With the support of incentive policies, the diffusion of wind power has achieved tremendous achievements in China. However, behind this rapid expansion, it is raised a question: what are the driving forces behind the diffusion of wind power? And which policies are more efficient to improve the diffusion rate of wind power? To scientifically answer this question, this paper combines system dynamics and the two-factor learning curve to investigate the dynamic diffusion process of wind power. The results show that: (1) The demand-pull policy through feed-in tariff (FIT) policy can promote the diffusion of wind power; (2) The technology-push policy through R&D policy also promotes the diffusion of wind power; (3) A higher level of FIT is more efficient to expand the installed capacity of wind power, in addition, a higher level of R&D intensity is more efficient for cost reduction; (4) The coefficient of learning by doing of wind power is 0.0274 and the coefficient of learning by research of wind power is 0.2540, which indicates China's wind power industry is transitioning from price subsidies to technology innovation policies. The research results can enrich the research on the diffusion of wind power and provide a reference for other regions to study the diffusion of renewable energy.","Xin-gang, Zhao;Wei, Wang;Jieying, Wang",Journal,Energy,2022-12-15,Beijing University of Technology;North China Electric Power University,Demand-pull ;  Renewable energy ;  System dynamics ;  Technology diffusion ;  Technology-push ;  Wind power
Implementation of the Experimental Design Outcome in the Chemical Engineering Degree Program at Technical University of Madrid (GIQ-ETSII-UPM),"This paper presents an insight on the pedagogy and strategic design of the organization of the four experimental subjects of the Chemical Engineering Degree Curricula at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (GIQ-ETSII-UPM). Outcome-based learning is applied, focused on the student's work, centering explicitly in Experimental Design outcomes. These skills are necessary not only for research, but also for innovation activities that will be fundamental for future engineers and chemists, and students should be encouraged to practice them during their time at university. The learnings are graduated following the requirements of the courses, and experimentations are realistic and easily approached as guided or free experimentation. Students must apply previous knowledge and acquire new ones, implement attitudes, work in teams, and make their own decisions. Among the students' free comments collected in teacher surveys carried out on more than 400 students over 10 years, there are recurrent evaluations such as ""We are able to put into practice what we have studied in other subjects"". These subjects are the ones students perceive as very important toward their future. Feedback is essential to improve their experimental proposals and make them viable to avoid student frustration. The number of teachers involved is between a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7 for 30-40 students and 14 sessions in each subject. It is essential to note that the teacher's engagement is indispensable for the performance of this framework.","Del Mar De La Fuente García-Soto, M.;Martínez-Urreaga, Joaquín;Narros Sierra, Adolfo",Journal,Journal of Chemical Education,2022-12-13,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Experimental Design Learning ;  Experimental Subjects ;  Outcomes Assessment ;  Undergraduate Education
Introducing Second Year Analytical Chemistry Students to Research through Experimental Design in the Undergraduate Teaching Laboratory,"Advancements in technology have led to significant changes in the workforce and created a demand for expertise in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In response, curricula have evolved to emphasize essential skills such as critical thinking and communication to prepare students for STEM-based careers. To this end, postsecondary institutions continue to develop and incorporate project-based learning (PBL), course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), and process-oriented guided-inquiry learning (POGIL). These opportunities can be offered in junior level (1st and 2nd year) courses by designing projects that match students' skills and knowledge. Opportunities at the junior level reach a larger student population and can increase interest in STEM-based careers. In this article, we introduce a project-based activity for the second-year analytical chemistry laboratory in which students design and conduct experiments to quantify analytes in real-life samples. Analytes selected for this project (acids or bases, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, calcium, oxalate, reducing sugars and starch) can be quantified using techniques familiar to second year students including titration and absorbance spectroscopy. Students first designed experimental procedures and received feedback before conducting the experiments. Each experiment was performed over two laboratory periods, which allowed students to modify procedures between iterations to improve their experimental design. This experience allowed students to develop 21st century competencies including critical thinking and problem solving, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, self-directed learning, collaboration, and communication.","Doughan, Samer;Shahmuradyan, Anna",Journal,Journal of Chemical Education,2022-12-13,University of Toronto,Analytical Chemistry ;  Applications of Chemistry ;  Collaborative/Cooperative Learning ;  Communication/Writing ;  Inquiry-Based/Discovery Learning ;  Problem Solving/Decision Making ;  Second-Year Undergraduate
"Teaching design for values: Concepts, tools & practices","The process of identifying, interpreting, and implementing societal values in university education is an essential part of responsible innovation and designing for equitable, inclusive, and sustainable societies. While there is now a well-defined and growing body of research on the theory and application of designing for values (or 'value sensitive design'), at present the pedagogical dimension remains underexplored. Teaching Design for Values: A Companion is a resource for teachers of design-based disciplines who wish to foreground values more explicitly in their classes. With fourteen chapters written by both TU Delft educators and international contributors, the book aims to examine the concepts, methods and experiences of teaching design for values within a variety of fields, including urbanism, engineering, architecture, artificial intelligence and industrial design. Through its multi-disciplinarity, Teaching Design for Values proposes an expanded definition of 'design' to encompass a broad range of disciplines and processes that deal generally with 'future-imagining' and 'future-building', including process management. In doing so it explores the ways that values may be expressed and analysed in a variety of different pedagogical contexts.","Rocco, Roberto;Thomas, Amy;Novas-Ferradás, María",Book,"Teaching Design For Values: Concepts, Tools &amp; Practices",2022-12-08,"Faculteit Bouwkunde van de TU Delft;Department of Urbanism, TU Delft",Design for value ;  Design tools ;  Teaching design ;  Teaching spatial justice ;  Value-based pedagogy
The characteristics and evolution of business model for green buildings: a bibliometric approach,"Purpose: The wide uptake of green building is hindered by factors such as limited market demand and high up-front cost despite substantial policy incentives. Successful business models (BMs) help facilitate the diffusion of sustainable innovation and have attracted increasing attention. However, little attention has been paid to examining the adoption of green building from the perspective of BM. This paper aims to identify the characteristics of BM that companies adopted to deliver green building projects and examine the evolution path of BM for green buildings. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 744 interdisciplinary bibliographic records related to BM and green buildings from the Web of Science Core Collection database have been identified from the Web of Science Core Collection and analyzed through co-author analysis, co-word analysis and co-citation analysis. Findings: BM research mainly focuses on five subjects, namely, environmental science, engineering, business, economics, science and technology. Keywords “strategy”, “capability”, “perspective” and “design” receive the highest centrality index, which suggests that the strategy design and corporate capability are indispensable elements when designing or innovating a company's BM. “BM canvas” and “resource based view” received the burst citations in the recent decade. Twelve research clusters are identified, including performance evaluation, waste management, energy efficiency, BM, project business, professional capital, leadership and product innovation. These topics highlight three evolution direction for green building projects, i.e. life cycle-oriented value proposition, collaborative value delivery and innovative cost and revenue structure. Originality/value: The findings contribute to a systematic understanding of the underlying mechanisms of BM for green buildings and illuminate the development trend of business strategies for sustainability.","Zhao, Xiaojing;Pan, Wei",Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2022-12-07,Beijing Institute of Technology;The University of Hong Kong,Business model ;  Co-citation ;  Evolution ;  Green building ;  Innovation
Assessment of organizational agility in response to disruptive innovation: a case of an engineering services firm,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework to manage the strategy to counter disruptive innovation by identifying stronger attributes and key strategic areas for improvements in an engineering services context with less freedom to orchestrate product innovation. The authors also validate the combined use of multi-grade fuzzy, Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) and gap analysis in developing the strategy to mitigate turbulence. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a framework using a combination of Dynamic Capabilities and Organizational Agility to develop the strategy. The study uses data gathered from a 60-member engineering project team working on an Aircraft Engine Controller design to identify 50 attributes and the related importance and performance ratings. The research study is designed using a three-tier approach. First, multi-grade fuzzy is utilized to measure the overall firm response agility index. In the second step, the IPA is used to analyze the strength and weaknesses of the firm and to identify the attributes where the firm needs to focus. In the past step, gap analysis is used to prioritize the identified attributes. The findings are validated by panel discussions with a different group of experts from the project team and action points were arrived at. Findings: This research work finds that the firms’ response agility index of 6.97 is comparable to that of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) from previous literature, but still needs a better agility score to effectively counter turbulence from disruptive innovations. It also identifies seven key areas for improvement and their relative priority to effectively improve the response agility by utilizing the least number of resources, the reasons for the gap and the mitigation strategy to close the gap. The findings highlight a few key differences between an engineering services firm in comparison to OEMs and Software Services firms. Practical implications: The findings help the practitioners with a comparative agility score of an engineering services firm, and an effective way of measuring agility, identify key focus areas and prioritize the actions using a simple set of data that could be collected regularly to keep track of the improvements. The provided strategic framework to improve the agility score can be used for continuous improvement. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature by developing a framework for outsourcing services companies to cope with the turbulence by using dynamic capabilities and organizational agility. It also adds to the literature by extending the validity of IPA and gap analysis in making strategic decisions in an industrial set-up.","Vasanthan, Perinbanathan;Suresh, M.",Journal,International Journal of Organizational Analysis,2022-12-07,Amrita School of Business,Disruptive innovation ;  Engineering services ;  Importance-Performance Analysis ;  Multi-grade fuzzy ;  Organizational agility ;  Response agility
Frameworks for scientific and technological research oriented by transdisciplinary co-production,"This book presents the Framework Knowledge Acquisition Design, indicated for the development of scientific and technological research that demand the dialogue of academic and non-academic researchers for the configuration of the unit of knowledge, established in a transdisciplinary methodology of co-production in a diachronic study of the main theoretical frameworks, methodological and contextual, and with the presentation of selected frameworks of transdisciplinary co-production. The work can be classified both as a reference work in Transdisciplinary Research Methodology and as a textbook to guide the Transdisciplinary Coproduction in the context of innovation and organizational and social development. The constituent elements of the work that make it a reference work in Research Methodology are the theoretical foundations on the unity of knowledge, on the issue of transdisciplinary and on co-production, in a trajectory that begins with the first thinkers of the renaissance (and its basis in the philosophy of classical antiquity) addressing contemporaneity, supported by the main thinkers of transdisciplinary and integrative research. The constituent elements of the work that make it a textbook is the presentation of the main conceptual frameworks on the partnership between academic and non-academic actors (public and private) for the co-production of scientific knowledge, which will be the basis for the presentation of a new method that is sufficiently robust to accommodate from scientific initiation to complex, deep and substantial doctoral studies. Genuine transdisciplinary research aims to coordinate different bodies of knowledge, after identifying gaps in the science, technology and society tripod filling these gaps with appropriate scientific methodology and theoretical references. It is the recognition that specialized knowledge bases are dispersed in the very heterogeneity of reality and that, therefore, only an integrative approach will be able to capture essential features of the context in which the problem is inserted. It is to bring to the scientific framework relevant social problems that need a solution and lead to the relevant problems that need a solution, wherever they are, science. In this context, the involvement of non-academic actors in the disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary continuum advances towards transdisciplinary research, intensifying the cooperation and integration of various fields of knowledge in solving the research problem. Transdisciplinary, in a broad sense, can be described like a movement as the shift from fragmentation to relationality, from unity to the integrative process, from situated homogeneity to heterogeneity, from linearity to non-linearity, from simplicity to complexity, from universality to practices, from isolation to collaboration and cooperation. The appreciation and increase of these forms of interaction in search of the unity of knowledge beckon a new form of articulation between society and academia, especially for conducting scientific research, fostering new partnerships between university and society. This book brings the fundamentals of the changes that have become necessary to transcend and integrate disciplinary paradigms and the theoretical and methodological references for the realization of scientific researches that consider this scenario, including the presentation of a robust new conceptual framework for academic research in the field the integration engineering and knowledge governance.","de Rezende Alvares, Lillian Maria Araujo;de Sá Freire, Patricia",Book,Frameworks for Scientific and Technological Research Oriented by Transdisciplinary Co-Production,2022-12-06,Universidade de Brasília;Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,

CO<inf>2</inf> Sequestration Using Sodium Hydroxide and Its Utilization for Chlorella sorokiniana Biomass Production,"Chlorella is widely used for its fast growth rate and easy cultivation with 14–30% lipid content and 36–59% dry weight. Thus, sodium hydroxide is used to increase carbon consumption, biomass, and metabolites productions in microalgae. This study was conducted to observe the effect of sodium hydroxide addition on biomass and metabolites production in photoautotrophic cultivated Chlorella sorokiniana. Microalgae C.sorokiniana (LIPI12-Al016) was obtained from the culture collection of Microalgae and Bioprocess Engineering Research Group laboratory, National Research and Innovation Agency. Then, the microalgae were cultivated in media with various concentrations of sodium hydroxide. Biomass production was measured by gravimetry, and carbon consumption was measured by acid-alkalimetry. Sodium hydroxide 60 mM gave the best growth, maximizing average carbon consumption to 691.8 mg.L-1 and biomass production to 598.3 mg.L-1. The utilization of NaOH in the medium did not increase the metabolites content, except for protein. Carbohydrate was the dominant metabolite among the others. Fatty acids profile mainly composed of C16 and C18 fatty acids, which are favorable for biodiesel production. These results gave an overview of the potency of microalgae C. sorokiniana as a CO2 mitigation agent and alternative sources of energy and nutrition.","Sadewo, Ragil Pandu;Hidhayati, Noor;Ambarsari, Laksmi;Anam, Khairul",Journal,Biosaintifika,2022-12-01,Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional;IPB University,biomass ;  C. sorokiniana ;  CO  consumption 2 ;  metabolites ;  sodium hydroxide
Applying concepts from “rapid” and “agile” implementation to advance implementation research,"Background: The translation of research findings into practice can be improved to maximize benefits more quickly and with greater flexibility. To expedite translation, researchers have developed innovative approaches to implementation branded as “rapid” and “agile” implementation. Rapid implementation has roots in precision medicine and agile implementation has roots in systems engineering and software design. Research has shown that innovation often derives from learning and applying ideas that have impacted other fields. Implications for implementation researchers: This commentary examines “rapid” and “agile” approaches to implementation and provides recommendations to implementation researchers stemming from these approaches. Four key ideas are synthesized that may be broadly applicable to implementation research, including (1) adopting a problem orientation, (2) applying lessons from behavioral economics, (3) using adaptive study designs and adaptive interventions, and (4) using multi-level models to guide implementation. Examples are highlighted from the field where researchers are applying these key ideas to illustrate their potential impact. Conclusions: “Rapid” and “agile” implementation approaches to implementation stem from diverse fields. Elements of these approaches show potential for advancing implementation research, although adopting them may entail shifting scientific norms in the field.","Quanbeck, Andrew;Hennessy, Rose Garza;Park, Linda",Journal,Implementation Science Communications,2022-12-01,University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health;University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,Agile implementation ;  Behavioral economics ;  Complex systems ;  Rapid implementation ;  Systems engineering
Trend analysis and prospects of seed metering technologies,"Seed metering can be widely used to deliver the seeds or fertilizers from the hopper at selected rates during planting. However, it is still lacking in the quantitative and comprehensive analysis of the current technology of seed metering devices. In this study, a metrological analysis was systematically conducted on the existing literature on seed metering technology, in order to visualize the research trend, in terms of scientific research productivity, influence, and development power. The development of seeding technology was also summarized from the hot topics in recent years. The agricultural products were introduced from the domestic and foreign advanced agricultural machinery enterprises using frontier seed arrangement technology. Finally, the development trend was proposed from the industrialization application at present. The results showed that the seed metering technology was developed in a high-speed steady state. Much more scientific research output and influence in China were close to that in the United States. The high-impact journals included the Biosystems Engineering, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Journal of Agricultural Machinery, and Journal of Agricultural Engineering. High-impact scholars and institutions were focused on the seed metering technology for the typical crops in different regions. As such, the seed metering technology was advanced to upgrade the mechanization level. The development trend of seed metering technology was gradually changed from single-topic research on the realization of functions into the in-depth exploration of vertical subdivision topics, such as mechanism optimization, mechanism analysis, and virtual simulation. The current research hotspots of seed metering technology were focused mainly on high-speed simultaneous seeding, seeding uniformity, DEM-CFD coupling simulation, control, and monitoring system. In addition, the high efficiency and performance equipment can be expected to be further developed in the application of seed metering technology, particularly for the new products of seed metering in the running stage. Emerging technologies, interdisciplinary integration, and innovative thinking can be applied to develop with high speed, performance, precise, digital, and intelligent aspects. This review can provide a strong reference to grasp the research status, development trend, and innovation of seeding machines.","Juan, Zheng;Yitao, Liao;Qingxi, Liao;Mai, Sun",Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2022-12-01,Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China;Huazhong Agricultural University,agricultural machinery ;  information visualization ;  research focus ;  seeder ;  seeding technology ;  trends
The Facilitator Model: Investigating a Novel Dual Credit Experience for Open-Ended Design Coursework,"This study explored the implementation of a novel approach to dual credit referred to as the facilitator model that can be suited for STEM-focused coursework such as courses focused on engineering, design, technology, and innovation. Unlike other models, high school teachers facilitate the implementation of a college course for both high school and college credit in collaboration with a university instructor who evaluates student learning. This novel approach was specifically implemented for an open-ended undergraduate design course within an engineering technology college, similar to many first-year engineering course experiences that emphasize project-based learning, from a large research-intensive public university. For this study, the facilitator model was piloted with five high school teachers as facilitators of an undergraduate design course for dual credit at two innovative, STEM-focused public charter schools. The qualitative research design focused on examining (1) teacher needs while implementing, and perceptions of, the dual credit facilitator model for an undergraduate design course in urban public charter schools and (2) the impact of this model on student learning. This study included the collection and analysis of over 90 h of interviews, focus groups, surveys, and observations. Results provide a promising outlook for the use of the facilitator model when delivering dual credit content that is open ended and within the context of design, technology, and engineering by (1) navigating multiple institutional policies and processes related to dual-credit implementation, (2) providing ongoing support and fostering collaboration between high schools and university, (3) enabling students to earn directly transcripted college credits that count as a required course toward degree completion, and (4) increasing affordability and access to dual credit coursework. These potential advantages over other dual credit models can help address barriers that may limit access to dual credit coursework, specifically for underserved high schools.","Thorne, Scott;Strimel, Greg J.;Mentzer, Nathan;Sears, David",Journal,Journal for STEM Education Research,2022-12-01,Purdue University,Design thinking ;  Dual credit ;  Engineering technology ;  Facilitator model ;  High school ;  Project based

Finally, based on RE modelling method of the biological system to search for and sort out biological cases using the established biologically inspired design auxiliary system, the new functions of system-assisted solution were obtained to make product re-innovation schemes. Taking the protective clothing used by medical staff in the shelter hospital as an example, it is verified that the product innovation methods of RE and BID have a good feasibility.","Liu, Xiaomin;Yang, Dong;Chen, Liang;Fan, Shuai",Journal,Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering,2022-12-01,Fuzhou University,bio-inspired design ;  demand evolution ;  product innovation ;  protective clothing ;  reverse engineering
Some research advances in the failure mechanism and design & control technologies of shale gas well integrity,"The horizontal well drilling and volume fracturing completion technology is key for efficient development of shale gas field. This technology is also applied in the exploitation of shale gas fields in China. However, due to some subjective and objective reasons such as the special geological conditions of shale reservoirs and the complexity of fracturing operation, the problem of well integrity failure is prominent during the fracturing of horizontal wells. Therefore, it is required to discover the internal failure mechanism and develop corresponding design and control technologies for well integrity of shale gas boreholes. This paper emphatically introduces relevant innovation work of the author's team through elaborating the research progresses in the failure mechanism and the design and control technologies of well integrity of horizontal shale gas boreholes. The main points are as below:the failure mechanism and main control factors of well integrity in volume fracturing of horizontal shale gas boreholes, the technical system of well integrity control, and the design technology of special high-performance casings and graduated strings for horizontal shale gas boreholes. It is concluded that after years of innovative research and practice, China has developed a set of special casings and established an effective technical system of design and control of well integrity for horizontal shale gas boreholes, which can provide safety guarantee for well integrity during the large-scale development of shale gas fields in China.","Deli, Gao;Kui, Liu;Yanbin, Wang;Jinhai, Liu;Xuan, Li",Journal,Shiyou Xuebao/Acta Petrolei Sinica,2022-12-01,Sinopec;China University of Petroleum-Beijing;China National Petroleum Corporation;Tianjin Pipe (Group) Corporation,design and control technology ;  engineering application ;  failure mechanism ;  shale gas engineering ;  well integrity

Career Development and Improvements of Preservice Teachers Through Design Your Life Course at Science and Technology Universities,"Background and Purpose In the life of a student, the college phase is often regarded as a preparation stage for exploring career options and entering society as an adult. Very few students begin thinking about their future careers and preparing for their lives soon after or before entering college. Most students delay the decision-making process until the year of graduation, at which point they feel helpless when they have to make a career decision; during this period, they start preparing for future employment by processing information related to career development. Compared with these students, preservice teachers have a distinct career prospect. Compared with other students from comprehensive universities, students at science and technology universities must overcome more hurdles to become qualified teachers. The aim of this study was to explore preservice teachers’ perspectives on career development and improvements in their self-identity after participating in a career design course, entitled Design Your Life, at a science and technology university. Literature Review This study reviewed research on the implementation of design thinking in education and on the career development and self-identity of preservice teachers. Design thinking was first introduced by the design company IDEO and the Stanford d.school. Currently, in the field of higher education, design thinking is widely implemented in business management, humanities and social sciences, medicine, and engineering. With the promotion of design thinking, career designing has exceeded its original scope and been developed into a set of basic methodologies for cross-disciplinary cooperation and innovation. However, few studies have focused on the implementation of design thinking in the field of teacher training. Design thinking is a process of continual exploration. In addition to exploring the needs of individuals through investigation and research and developing innovative strategies for solving relevant problems, designers receive feedback from others, develop creative solutions, and construct prototypes in the testing stage, which would subsequently lead to effective results. The creative and specific process of design thinking itself is the key to solving complex problems. Moreover, life is a process of continual exploration and problem-solving. Experiencing different careers helps individuals assess their most suitable career options. By accepting feedback from others, individuals can construct a life prototype to meet their ultimate life expectations. Preservice teachers at science and technology universities are highly likely to become future teachers; through the training process, they must discover their career potentials and educational work-related values. Previous studies have conducted various exploratory investigations regarding the career development of preservice teachers. Through continual selection and trial experiences, future teachers can evaluate themselves and gradually outline the direction of their career development; they must identify a practical and feasible goal and balance their ideal future self, personal ability, and reality. Regarding self-identity, studies have indicated that individuals form an inner structure on the basis of their abilities, experiences, beliefs, and inner drives; this structure represents self-identity, which increases or decreases with time or transfers. Therefore, individuals’ current state of self-identify is not the end point of self-identification. The development of self-identity is an exploratory process. To develop a distinct self-identity, individuals must be introspective and must persevere through a period of decision-making involving conflicts and doubts. Thus, to determine their career goals, preservice teachers must first explore their inner selves and the external environment and then make career decisions and commitments. Methods This study was based on Stanford University’s Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-lived, Joyful Life career planning course and the Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-lived, Joyful Life book (Burnett & Evans, 2016/2016). In an actual setting, career design courses are planned in accordance with the five-stage design thinking model (Stanford University); these stages are empathy, definition, idea, prototype, and test. Through design thinking, students explore their diverse interests and potentials, identify suitable career paths, and work toward future career development. The present study selected preservice teachers from a total of 16 private science and technology universities and subjected them to the aforementioned course (three workshops, each lasting for 6h; total credit hours, 18) between March and July 2019. The study collected the following data for coding and analysis: teaching and reflective journals, class worksheets, homework sheets, student reports, and teaching feedback. Data were analyzed using triangulation correction and continual comparison methods to ensure the validity of the study findings. Results The results revealed that the preservice teachers could objectively view themselves through visual recordings and could discuss with others to increase their self-awareness levels. Convergent and divergent thinking resulting from the process of individual dialogue and teamwork helped strengthen the preservice teachers’ self-identity and career orientation. Finally, they could develop a positive creative mindset — fail early, succeed sooner — and could devise strategies to solve their life problems. Discussion and Recommendations On the basis of the findings, this study suggests that preservice teachers can not only use design thinking to plan their own careers but also learn how to implement this approach in designing courses for others. For example, future teachers may use the five-stage design thinking model to design courses for primary and secondary school students in order to help them discover their life or on-campus problems and to promote problem-oriented learning. Therefore, teacher education centers may include this course in their curricula and support preservice teachers who require career guidance and assistance with career development. Furthermore, although this study focused on preservice teachers at private science and technology universities, the findings may be useful for high school and college students because career indecision is a normal and common phenomenon. Thus, the content of this course may be expanded to include general high school and college students. Future studies are warranted to expand the content of teaching commitment in the current curriculum; moreover, future research should include more evaluation tools, such as career development scales, value scales, and self-identity scales, to offer empirical evidence for teacher education centers.","Wang, Chia Chi;Sung, Shih Hsiang",Journal,Journal of Research in Education Sciences,2022-12-01,National Kaohsiung Normal University;National Sun Yat-Sen University,career development ;  design thinking ;  preservice teachers at science and technology universities ;  self-identity
Invited Review: Genetic decision tools for increasing cow efficiency and sustainability in forage-based beef systems,"Purpose: The beef industry is experiencing pressure to increase the efficiency and sustainability of forage-based cow-calf production. Dozens of traits affect a cow's ability to be biologically, economically, and environmentally efficient. Furthermore, in an increasingly volatile climate, an animal's genetic merit must be considered in the context of its environment. This review discusses the complex problem of cow efficiency and how the industry can leverage genetic selection tools to improve these traits. I review currently available selection tools for increasing cow-calf production efficiency and discuss developing technologies and research that will drive future innovation. Sources: This review draws on primary literature from animal breeding, beef production, engineering, and agricultural sustainability to broadly discuss the challenges of genetically improving cow-calf efficiency and adaptability. Synthesis: Decision support tools allow breeders to select sires that will have more efficient daughters. Historically, these tools have focused on moderating mature cow size and milk production. They have recently expanded to include traits that directly measure feed efficiency and other related phenotypes such as longevity and fertility. Genetic selection tools also exist for adaptive traits to help producers select sires that produce offspring that respond better to environmental stressors such as heat stress or high elevation. Conclusions and Applications: Future work to develop genetic selection tools for forage-based beef systems will rely on integrating genomics, animal breeding, and precision livestock technologies. These developing technologies, coupled with existing tools, will enable producers to more directly make breeding decisions focused on cow efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.","Rowan, Troy N.",Journal,Applied Animal Science,2022-12-01,University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture,cow-calf ;  fertility ;  genomics ;  methane ;  novel phenotypes
Rethinking Committee Work in the Research Enterprise: The Case of Regenerative Gatekeeping,"Committees touch nearly every facet in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics research enterprise. However, the role of gatekeeping through committee work has received little attention in Earth and space sciences. We propose a novel concept called, “regenerative gatekeeping” to challenge institutional inertia, cultivate belonging, accessibility, justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion in committee work. Three examples, a hiring committee process, a seminar series innovation, and an awards committee, highlight the need to self-assess policies and practices, ask critical questions and engage in generative conflict. Rethinking committee work can activate distributed mechanisms needed to promote change.","Lewis, Jonathan C.;Alemán-Díaz, Aixa;Behl, Mona;Kolesar, Sarah;White, Lisa;Jones, Brandon;Garza, Corey;Cooper, Sharon",Journal,AGU Advances,2022-12-01,"American Geophysical Union;Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory;University of Georgia;University of California, Berkeley;Indiana University of Pennsylvania;Oregon State University;National Science Foundation;California State University, Monterey Bay",belonging ;  diversity ;  equity ;  gatekeeping ;  inclusion ;  justice
Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Sense of Belonging in Higher Education for STEM Students in the United States and Mexico,"The COVID-19 pandemic generated worldwide negative effects on college students’ stress levels and motivation to learn. This research focuses on the lack of development of a sense of belonging in engineering students due to online classes during the pandemic and possible differences experiencing online classes between students from different contexts and cultures. Data were collected from 88 Mexican and 139 U.S. engineering students during the Spring 2021 semester using ten survey items asking students’ perceptions of the effects of taking online courses during the COVID-19 pandemic on their sense of belonging in their major. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted, aiming to determine the effects of taking online classes on students’ sense of belonging in engineering. Findings stressed the poor sense of belonging that engineering students may have after taking online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic when they missed opportunities to develop meaningful relationships with their peers and professors due to the lack of good communication. Consequently, students had uncertainties about successful learning during the pandemic in both Mexico and the U.S. Thus, activities such as accessible office hours, study groups, and meetings with mentors and tutors should be promoted to help students recover from the lack of a sense of belonging in the engineering major generated during online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Morán-Soto, Gustavo;Marsh, Aradaryn;González Peña, Omar Israel;Sheppard, Matthew;Gómez-Quiñones, José Isabel;Benson, Lisa C.",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-12-01,"Clemson University College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences;Tecnológico Nacional de México;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez;National Institute of Sciences and Innovation for the Formation of the Scientific Community;Instituto Tecnológico de Durango",coronavirus ;  distance education ;  educational innovation ;  engineering students ;  higher education ;  information technologies ;  online classes ;  post-pandemic ;  remote classes ;  students’ perceptions

To verify the scientific nature of environmental governance by governments of various countries, researchers need to provide a scientific basis and practical support for governments to adjust and formulate new policies and regulatory measures at any time through data analysis. This paper applies visual literature, aggregate analysis, engineering data programming, advanced mathematical science algorithms, and innovation entropy theory, and through this study obtains sustainable impact data from eight Chinese provinces in the 21st century, including environmental, economic, and social impacts. The results show that China’s sustainable data should grow from 2021 to about 2044. After 2045, it will be stable, and there will be negative growth in a short period. The overall life cycle assessment (LCA) and social impact assessment (SIA) continue to remain in the positive range. There will be no negative growth in aggregate data and zero or negative emissions before 2108. The final research data are accurately presented in the form of annual emissions, which provide a scientific and theoretical basis for the government to formulate medium- and long-term ecological regulations and plans.","Zhou, Zhiwu;Alcalá, Julián;Yepes, Víctor",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-12-01,Universitat Politècnica de València,bridge ;  carbon emissions ;  environment ;  life cycle assessment ;  life cycle cost (LCC) ;  social impact assessment

Ensuring that these complex architectures are safe is paramount to enabling the certification and entry into service of new aircraft concepts. Emerging techniques in systems architecting, such as using model-based systems engineering (MBSE), help deal with such complexity. However, MBSE techniques are currently not integrated with the overall aircraft conceptual design, using automated multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) techniques. Current MDAO frameworks do not incorporate the various aspects of system safety assessment. The industry is increasingly interested in Model-Based Safety Assessment (MBSA) to improve the safety assessment process and give the safety engineer detailed insight into the failure characteristics of system components. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to introduce various aspects of safety assessment in conceptual design and MDAO, also considering downstream compatibility of the system architecting and safety assessment process. The presented methodology includes specific elements of the SAE ARP4761 safety assessment process and adapts them to the systems architecting process in conceptual design. The proposed framework also introduces a novel safety-based filtering approach for large system architecture design spaces. The framework’s effectiveness is illustrated with examples from applications in recent collaborative research projects with industry and academia. The work presented in this paper contributes to increasing maturity in conceptual design studies and enables more innovation by opening the design space while considering safety upfront.","Jeyaraj, Andrew K.;Liscouët-Hanke, Susan",Journal,Aerospace,2022-12-01,Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design & Innovation;Concordia University,aircraft ;  conceptual design ;  MBSA ;  MBSE ;  multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization ;  safety assessment ;  systems ;  systems architecting
Ameliorating creativity in engineering education: Educator perspective,"Engineering students need creative thinking skills to achieve innovation. This study focuses on ameliorating the creative process in engineering design units with the purpose of getting more creative and innovative engineering design solutions from students and better preparing them for industry and real-life conditions. It is suggested that engineering should use design pedagogy as a model for ameliorating creativity. The research is carried out using qualitative investigation. The study used triangulation to collect data about engineering educators’ approach, understanding and beliefs about creativity using observational research, a survey and in-depth interviews both with students and with educators. The study used an interpretive approach for data analysis by following the levels of understanding in an organizational culture. Three main results drawn from this work are as follows: (1) Engineering educators should understand the practice of creativity in an educational context. (2) Engineering educators need to value creativity as an important part of engineering design. (3) The discipline needs to value creativity as a core part of the curriculum. The findings suggests that enriching creativity in engineering education is not feasible until engineering instructors comprehend and embrace the use of creativity in the classroom. This article specifically explores ways of integrating creativity in engineering design processes that took place in a mechanical engineering undergraduate programme – with an expectation that the research can be used as an exemplar for other engineering disciplines to learn from. This study is an important step, with a holistic approach, in suggesting creativity and creative thinking be inherent and an integral part of every engineering curriculum.","Tekmen-Araci, Yasemin;Kuys, Blair",Journal,"Journal of Design, Business and Society",2022-12-01,Swinburne University of Technology;The University of Sydney,creative thinking ;  creativity ;  education ;  educator approach ;  engineering design ;  teaching and learning
Increasing Firm Performance through Industry 4.0—A Method to Define and Reach Meaningful Goals,"Industry 4.0 is one of the most influential trends in manufacturing as of now. Coined as the fourth industrial revolution it promises to overthrow entrenched structures opening new pathways for innovation and value creation. Like all revolutions, it is accompanied by disruption and uncertainty. Consequently, many manufacturing companies struggle to adopt an Industry 4.0 perspective that benefits their performance. Hence, our goal was to develop a method for increasing firm performance through Industry 4.0. A key factor was to focus on the entire company as a socio-technical system to depict the numerous interactions between people, technology, and business/organization. To realize the method, we combined consortium research, design science, and method engineering. We gathered comprehensive data from workshops, interviews, and five case studies, which we used to develop the method. It consists of four phases: a maturity model to determine the status quo, a procedure to derive a target position, a pattern-based approach to design the socio-technical system, and a procedure to define a transformation setup. Our approach is the first to combine maturity models with foresight and extensive prescriptive knowledge. For practitioners, the method gives orientation for the future-oriented planning of their transformation processes.","Koldewey, Christian;Hobscheidt, Daniela;Pierenkemper, Christoph;Kühn, Arno;Dumitrescu, Roman",Journal,Sci,2022-12-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design IEM;Paderborn University;CP Contech Electronic GmbH,Industry 4.0 ;  Industry 4.0 strategy ;  maturity model ;  methodology ;  socio-technical system ;  transformation
Development of a Method for the Engineering of Digital Innovation Using Design Science Research,"This paper outlines the path towards a method focusing on a process model for the integrated engineering of Digital Innovation (DI) and Design Science Research (DSR). The use of the DSR methodology allows for achieving both scientific rigor and practical relevance, while integrating the concept of innovation strategies into the proposed method enables a conscious approach to classify different Information Systems (IS) artifacts, and provides a way to create, transfer, and generalize their design. The resulting approach allows for the systematic creation of innovative IS artifacts. On top of that, cumulative DSR knowledge can be systematically built up, facilitating description, comparability, and reuse of the artifacts. We evaluate this newly completed approach in a case study for an automated conversational call center interface leveraging the identification of the caller’s age and gender for dialog optimization, based on machine learning models trained on the SpeechDat spoken-language resource database. Moreover, we validate innovation strategies by analyzing additional innovative projects.","Huseynli, Murad;Bub, Udo;Ogbuachi, Michael Chima",Journal,Information (Switzerland),2022-12-01,Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem,design science research ;  digital innovation engineering ;  information systems ;  innovation management ;  machine learning ;  method engineering ;  process management ;  speech data analytics
The Revealed Mechanism of Rock Burst Based on an Innovative Calculation Method of Rock Mass Released Energy,"It is very necessary to study the mechanism of rock burst, which is related to the safe construction of many geotechnical projects. Previous studies have shown that small trigger stress will lead to large energy release, but the specific conditions that cause the release and how to quantify the energy are urgent problems to be solved. In this study, an innovative calculation method of rock mass energy release is proposed, and the calculated release energy is consistent with the monitoring results of field monitoring equipment. The revealed mechanism of rock burst reflected is that under the condition of a large-ratio pre-state stress field (mostly > 2.5), a small trigger stress field will lead to a large amount of energy release under “late butterfly shape” or “final butterfly shape” of the plastic zone. This study reveals the key factor of rock burst, which plays an important reference role for the mechanism research, subsequent monitoring and treatment method of rock burst.","Zhang, Wenlong;Feng, Jicheng;Ma, Ji;Shi, Jianjun",Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022-12-01,Qingdao Huanghai University;North China Institute of Science and Technology;Henan Polytechnic University,calculation method ;  numerical simulation ;  released energy ;  rock burst ;  rock mass
The impact of renewable energy technology innovation on energy poverty: Does climate risk matter?,"While the literature has explored various determinants of energy poverty (EP), there is scant knowledge about the linkage between renewable energy technology (RET) innovation and EP. Based on an evaluation index system of energy poverty, this research applies the method of moment quantile regression model to examine whether and how RET innovation affects EP. Using panel data from China's 30 provinces for the 2003–2019 period, the results first reveal that RET innovation does relieve EP. Second, both linear and nonlinear models confirm that climate risk exhibits both a moderating effect and threshold effect on the relationship between them. When the climate risk index is low, RET innovation is conducive to the alleviation of EP; otherwise, the opposite is true. Finally, this moderating effect shows obvious spatial heterogeneity that only exists in western China and is not significant in the central and eastern region. Our findings thus enrich the extant literature and provide insights into targeted energy poverty reduction and achieving sustainable energy development.","Lee, Chien Chiang;Yuan, Zihao;Lee, Chi Chuan;Chang, Yu Fang",Journal,Energy Economics,2022-12-01,Southwestern University of Finance and Economics;Takming University of Science and Technology;Nanchang University,China ;  Climate risk ;  Energy poverty ;  Moderating effect ;  Renewable energy technology innovation
Employing Robotics in Education to Enhance Cognitive Development—A Pilot Study,"(1) Background: Info-communication technology (ICT) offers opportunities for innovations in teaching and learning methods, bringing significant changes in the world of pedagogy. The field called educational robotics is both a motivational basis for teaching and learning coding and programming, and a tool for linking STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Moreover, it might contribute to the development of cognitive and social skills. The aim of the present paper is to report on a pilot study at the intersection of neurodiversity and educational robotics. (2) Methods: The pilot study was part of a larger project, namely Robotics for the Inclusive Development of Atypical and Typical Children (RIDE). A pre-test/post-test design was used to examine the development of different cognitive processes in sixth-grade students, such as computational thinking (CT), spatial relations, visuo-constructive ability, attention, and reading ability, in relation to a robotics development program employed in the classroom. (3) Results: The results suggest a general improvement on nearly all measures. Specifically, participants’ performance improved significantly from pre-test to post-test in the visuo-constructive abilities test, they made significantly fewer reading errors, and improved substantially in their reading comprehension. (4) Conclusions: The RIDE project’s curriculum development has resulted in a highly innovative, sustainable, and inclusive package of pedagogical methods, and the pilot research shows promising results regarding the implementation of robotics in education.","Kálózi-Szabó, Csilla;Mohai, Katalin;Cottini, Milvia",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-12-01,Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem;Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,attention ;  cognition ;  computational thinking ;  education ;  reading ability ;  robotics ;  spatial relations ;  visuo-constructive ability
"Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) Framework: A Current Review, Update and Discussion","Compared with other industries, construction has maintained one of the lowest growth rates in productivity and innovation over the last decades. Moreover, low compliance with schedule targets has remained a common issue throughout projects. Therefore, although methodologies developed have benefited productivity in design, construction and operation, meeting client and project objectives becomes challenging without properly integrating organization, information, systems and processes. This perspective introduces the Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) framework. First, this paper studies and reviews VDC since its creation at the Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE) of Stanford University in 2001. After that, a comprehensive bibliographical review of the VDC framework is presented and updated with examples of its application in construction projects, delving into its elements: Client Objectives, Project Objectives, Production Objectives, Controllable Factors, Integrated Concurrent Engineering (ICE), Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Project Production Management (PPM). Finally, the main benefits and project outcomes when applying the VDC framework are presented and discussed, followed by the conclusions and recommendations for future research.","Del Savio, Alexandre Almeida;Vidal Quincot, José Francisco;Bazán Montalto, Alvaro Daniel;Rischmoller Delgado, Leonardo Antonio;Fischer, Martin",Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2022-12-01,Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering;DPR Construction;Universidad de Lima,BIM ;  controllable factor ;  integrated concurrent engineering ;  integrating project delivery ;  IPD ;  metrics ;  production objectives ;  project production management ;  VDC ;  virtual design and construction
Speech technology in healthcare,"As the population ages with advances in technology, health monitoring through early detection is increasing. There are several approaches to the analysis, monitoring and management of human activity in health care. Gaining proficiency and knowledge from complicated, multidimensional, and dissimilar biomedical data remains a key challenge for healthcare innovation. Different kinds of data have been appearing in modern biomedical research. Recent advances in deep learning technology provide a powerful new paradigm for deriving end to end learning models out of complicated data. Speech technology is anticipated to lead to changes in health care, transforming traditional treatment modalities. The present language interface is being transformed into a next generation medical companion who interacts among people and monitors their health, according to researchers. New genuine mechanisms are required to reinforce the medical prognosis of the diseases and lessen the hour spent in the diagnostic process. This allows speech to be used as a future digital biomarker for disease detection, with benefits such as improved access to diagnosis, symptom monitoring, cost savings and improved diagnostic accuracy. The motive of this paper is to conduct an extensive survey related to speech technology in healthcare. Because of its societal implications, research in this subject has a broad reach.","Deepa, P.;Khilar, Rashmita",Journal,Measurement: Sensors,2022-12-01,Saveetha School of Engineering,Biomedical applications ;  Deep learning ;  Digital biomarker ;  Healthcare ;  Machine learning ;  Speech technology
Regional empowerment through decentralised governance under a centralised regulatory system facilitates the development of cellular therapy in China,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is an example of gene engineering-based cellular therapy, which combines immunotherapy, gene therapy, and cellular therapy. Historically, the second clinical trial of gene therapy for patients with haemophilia B was conducted by Chinese scientists in 1991, and China became the first country to approve a commercial gene therapy product in 2003. However, China almost lost its lead in this field, partly due to an early scarcity of clear and cohesive policies regarding cellular therapy. Cellular therapy is not only a novel medical practice but also a medicinal product. The increasing commercialisation of globally approved cell therapy products made the Chinese Government issue a series of relevant policies to promote the canonical development of cell therapy and its standardisation in China. Encouraged by flexible regulatory frameworks that have facilitated the development of cellular therapy since 2017, remarkable progress has been achieved, thereby putting China back at the forefront of the field worldwide. Some policies on cellular therapy launched by the Chinese government in 2019 have contributed to the growth of cellular therapy in China; however, the regulation, governance, and management of commercialised products remain challenging. This Series paper aims to provide an overview of the current regulatory reforms on clinical cellular therapy in China with a historical perspective. We also highlight several important contributors that could promote innovation and industrialisation of cellular therapy in China. Further efforts are needed to establish a legislative system with clear and cohesive policies for the increasing use of cellular therapy in China, enabling a more prescriptive, diligent, and informed process.","Li, Xiaolei;Dai, Hanren;Wang, Yao;Wu, Zhiqiang;Wang, Hua;Qian, Wenbin;Liang, Aibin;Han, Weidong",Journal,The Lancet Haematology,2022-12-01,Tongji University School of Medicine;The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University;The Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine;General Hospital of People's Liberation Army;Anhui Medical University;Changping Laboratory,
Towards European standards for quantum technologies,"The Second Quantum Revolution facilitates the engineering of new classes of sensors, communication technologies, and computers with unprecedented capabilities. Supply chains for quantum technologies are emerging, some focused on commercially available components for enabling technologies and/or quantum-technologies research infrastructures, others with already higher technology-readiness levels, near to the market. In 2018, the European Commission has launched its large-scale and long-term Quantum Flagship research initiative to support and foster the creation and development of a competitive European quantum technologies industry, as well as the consolidation and expansion of leadership and excellence in European quantum technology research. One of the measures to achieve an accelerated development and uptake has been identified by the Quantum Flagship in its Strategic Research Agenda: The promotion of coordinated, dedicated standardisation and certification efforts. Standardisation is indeed of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products, innovation, and competition, all leading to structuring and hence growth of markets. As quantum technologies mature, the time has come to start thinking about further standardisation needs. This article presents insights on standardisation for quantum technologies from the perspective of the CEN-CENELEC Focus Group on Quantum Technologies (FGQT), which was established in June 2020 to coordinate and support the development of standards relevant for European industry and research.","van Deventer, Oskar;Spethmann, Nicolas;Loeffler, Marius;Amoretti, Michele;van den Brink, Rob;Bruno, Natalia;Comi, Paolo;Farrugia, Noel;Gramegna, Marco;Jenet, Andreas;Kassenberg, Ben;Kozlowski, Wojciech;Länger, Thomas;Lindstrom, Tobias;Martin, Vicente;Neumann, Niels;Papadopoulos, Homer;Pascazio, Saverio;Peev, Momtchil;Pitwon, Richard;Rol, M.

EVAnalyzer: High content imaging for rigorous characterisation of single extracellular vesicles using standard laboratory equipment and a new open-source ImageJ/Fiji plugin,"Extracellular vesicle (EV) research increasingly demands for quantitative characterisation at the single vesicle level to address heterogeneity and complexity of EV subpopulations. Emerging, commercialised technologies for single EV analysis based on, for example, imaging flow cytometry or imaging after capture on chips generally require dedicated instrumentation and proprietary software not readily accessible to every lab. This limits their implementation for routine EV characterisation in the rapidly growing EV field. We and others have shown that single vesicles can be detected as light diffraction limited fluorescent spots using standard confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopes. Advancing this simple strategy into a process for routine EV quantitation, we developed ‘EVAnalyzer’, an ImageJ/Fiji (Fiji is just ImageJ) plugin for automated, quantitative single vesicle analysis from imaging data. Using EVAnalyzer, we established a robust protocol for capture, (immuno-)labelling and fluorescent imaging of EVs. To exemplify the application scope, the process was optimised and systematically tested for (i) quantification of EV subpopulations, (ii) validation of EV labelling reagents, (iii) in situ determination of antibody specificity, sensitivity and species cross-reactivity for EV markers and (iv) optimisation of genetic EV engineering. Additionally, we show that the process can be applied to synthetic nanoparticles, allowing to determine siRNA encapsulation efficiencies of lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) and protein loading of SiO2 nanoparticles. EVAnalyzer further provides a pipeline for automated quantification of cell uptake at the single cell–single vesicle level, thereby enabling high content EV cell uptake assays and plate-based screens. Notably, the entire procedure from sample preparation to the final data output is entirely based on standard reagents, materials, laboratory equipment and open access software. In summary, we show that EVAnalyzer enables rigorous characterisation of EVs with generally accessible tools. Since we further provide the plugin as open-source code, we expect EVAnalyzer to not only be a resource of immediate impact, but an open innovation platform for the EV and nanoparticle research communities.","Schürz, Melanie;Danmayr, Joachim;Jaritsch, Maria;Klinglmayr, Eva;Benirschke, Heloisa Melo;Matea, Cristian Tudor;Zimmerebner, Patrick;Rauter, Jakob;Wolf, Martin;Gomes, Fausto Gueths;Kratochvil, Zdenek;Heger, Zbynek;Miller, Andrew;Heuser, Thomas;Stanojlovic, Vesna;Kiefer, Jana;Plank, Tanja;Johnson, Litty;Himly, Martin;Blöchl, Constantin;Huber, Christian G.;Hintersteiner, Martin;Meisner-Kober, Nicole",Journal,Journal of Extracellular Vesicles,2022-12-01,"Veterinary Research Institute, Brno;FernUniversität in Hagen;Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversitat;Mendelova Univerzita v Brně;Universität Salzburg;EvoBiotiX SA;KP Therapeutics (Europe) s.r.o.;Vienna Biocentre Core Facilities",cell uptake ;  EV immunolabelling ;  exosomes ;  extracellular vesicles ;  lipid nanoparticles ;  liposomes ;  open innovation ;  silica nanoparticles ;  single particle imaging ;  single vesicle imaging
A configurational approach to capabilities of business model innovation: Insights from a project-based firm,"The capabilities of business model innovation (BMI) are crucial for the modern firm to remain competitive. This study aims to answer recent calls for a more structured approach to understanding BMI and to researching how the capabilities relate to performance. Furthermore, and despite the rise of the project-based firm, there is still a profound lack of BMI research in the setting of project-based firms – a research stream, which we contribute to developing further. Theoretically, and on the basis of a literature review, we suggest a set of four overall capabilities for BMI with 29 corresponding themes within the areas of strategy, business models, management, and organizations. Empirically, we gained deep access to 15 projects in a major European engineering consultancy, which were marked by BMI. Analytically, we analyzed the results through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and derived three main findings. Firstly, a high degree of skunkworks with little relationship to the firm's strategic and operational logic leads to a fast time to market. Secondly, lack of managerial capabilities leads to increased investment and lower revenues. Finally, lack of managerial capabilities—even with the presence of strategic capabilities of BMI and organizational capabilities of BMI—leads to lower future potential of the business model. In continuation of these findings, we develop three propositions and recommend project-based firms to boost the managerial capabilities of leading BMI by focusing on training of BMI managers, organizational learning through experiments, establishing trust in project employees, ensuring openness in collaborations, minimizing transaction costs and developing appropriate key metrics for the BMI project.","Løbner, Kristian;Goduscheit, René Chester",Journal,Creativity and Innovation Management,2022-12-01,Aarhus Universitet,business model innovation ;  capabilities ;  case study ;  configurations ;  fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis ;  project-based firm

An Analysis of the Space Tourism Market in the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Its Potential for Development of Zero-Gravity and Suborbital Commercial Spaceflights,"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have developed an increasingly active and capable space industry over recent years. Saudi Arabia sent its first astronaut to space in 1985 aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle, while the UAE sent its inaugural astronaut to the International Space Station as recently as September 2019. Both countries have ambitious plans for the further development of a local but internationally collaborative space ecosystem with science, technology, engineering, math, innovation, and commercial enterprise as pillars. This article argues that space tourism can play a key role in this space ecosystem. This article analyzes the regional space tourism market and characteristics. This is achieved by a targeted questionnaire-based survey of space tourism attitudes, behaviors, desires, willingness to pay, and stated preferences from a range of socioeconomic and demographic respondent profiles. The results of the surveys carried out in 2020 are compared with identical surveys carried out by the author in 2012. Therefore, key trends in customer behaviors and preferences for space tourism are evaluated since both the 2020 and 2012 sets of surveys are also comparable with previous surveys by other organizations and corresponding comparisons are presented. The research highlights stated preferences by respondents for three space tourism segments: (1) high-speed, high-altitude jetfighter flights, (2) commercial zero-gravity parabolic flights, and (3) future suborbital commercial spaceflights. It concludes that a UAE based zero-gravity parabolic flight venture can be commercially viable. Such a venture would also create opportunity for locally based astronaut training and scientific research in weightlessness and microgravity without having the need to travel to other countries. Furthermore, it is argued that the establishment of a local spaceport for suborbital and eventual point to point suborbital travel has the potential for longer term economic value addition to the country's economy.","Khan, M.

Green supply chain management/green finance: a bibliometric analysis of the last twenty years by using the Scopus database,"Mostly, the product manufacturer and activities related to transportation have a greater influence on the supply chain and the environment. Hence, the green investment in water, biodiversity protection, waste treatment, resources, and climate change alleviation help in enhancing industrial production. Thus, for the enhancement of green growth, the industries must adopt green financing by making investments in ecology, climate change, and carbon reduction. Despite having the greatest growth in green supply chain management, still, the implementations of greening the product and processes have not been seen properly in many industries. A bibliometric analysis was conducted through VOS viewer version 1.6.7. of last twenty years (2001-2021). A total of 2385 articles were retrieved from the Scopus database. The results revealed that China, India, Iran, and Taiwan have a vast collection of articles and have very strong international collaborations. The most cited authors were Sarkis, J., Zhu, Q., and Khan, S.A.R. The results also suggest that green supply chain management research was related to the field of engineering, environmental science, energy sciences, social sciences, and business management. Some new areas are discovered like green innovation, green information technology, green productivity, corporate environmental responsibility, green investments, green credit, and green credit policy. As evidenced from our bibliographic database search, it is observed that integrated work on green supply chain management and green finance is limited, and this makes this research work to be novel. This study is beneficial for credit managers and policymakers.","Fahim, Faryal;Mahadi, Batiah",Journal,Environmental science and pollution research international,2022-12-01,Azman Hashim International Business School,Environmental performance ;  Green credit ;  Green finance ;  Green supply chain management ;  Sustainability
Agile R&D Units' Organization Beyond Software - Developing and Validating a Multidimensional Scale in an Engineering Context,"Previous literature addressed organizations' adaptiveness to ever-changing business environments and investigated the concept of agility. However, extant agility research primarily covers the corporate and project levels and is typically located in the information systems and operations management fields. Relatively little quantitative research in innovation management literature exists, and those studies approached the concept solely from an outcome perspective (i.e., increased adaptiveness) instead of elucidating how organizations should organize themselves to be agile (i.e., a capability perspective). This article addresses these shortcomings and adopts a capability perspective since no empirical studies have examined agile R&D units' organization (ARDO). Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, we develop a measure of ARDO, conceptualizing it as a second-order construct, consisting of six dimensions: a culture of agile values, customer integration, autonomy, an iterative work method, cross-functional capabilities, and flat hierarchies. We validated the measurement by conducting three studies to ensure content, structural, and nomological validity. We applied structural equation modeling on a sample of 175 R&D managers and cross validated our findings on different hierarchical levels via a sample of 454 R&D employees. The results confirm the second-order nature of the ARDO measure and provide evidence of its positive relationship with front-end success. We advance scarce quantitative research on agility's neglected capability perspective and contribute to the innovation management field by facilitating further empirical research on agile R&D units' antecedents and outcomes in the context of physical product development.","Meier, Andre;Kock, Alexander",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-12-01,Technische Universität Darmstadt,Agile RandD units ;  agility ;  dynamic capabilities ;  front end of innovation ;  scale development
Learning to be a Platform Owner: How BMW Enhances App Development for Cars,"Platform owners face multiple challenges such as onboarding and orchestrating app developers as well as providing resources to enable the development of complementary apps. Information systems research considers digital platform governance as key to address these challenges. Thereby, the focus lies on the relationship of a platform owner and app developers. However, while there is evidence how app developers acquire skills through these interactions, there is limited knowledge of how platform owners benefit from interacting with app developers to improve their digital platforms. To address this gap, in this article, we study the emergence of a digital platform for automotive onboard apps within the BMW Group. Our results are grounded in 30 expert interviews that we conducted during a period of two years and are enriched by extensive secondary data. We identify transfer of perspective, transfer of knowledge, and transfer of artifacts as basic mechanisms that enable a platform owner to enhance its digital platform. The inherent improvements of the digital platform facilitate the app development. Our work extends the existing theory on platform emergence and provides insights into the learning process of an inexperienced platform owner. Our findings reveal valuable recommendations for organizations that are struggling to establish digital platforms.","Weiss, Niklas;Wiesche, Manuel;Schreieck, Maximilian;Krcmar, Helmut",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-12-01,Technische Universität Dortmund;Technische Universität München,Connected car ;  digital platforms ;  grounded theory ;  organizational learning ;  platform emergence ;  platform governance
"Applications of atmospheric cold plasma in agricultural, medical, and bioprocessing industries","Abstract: Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) is a nonthermal technology that is extensively used in several industries. Within the scopes of engineering and biotechnology, some notable applications of ACP include waste management, material modification, medicine, and agriculture. Notwithstanding numerous applications, ACP still encounters a number of challenges such as diverse types of plasma generators and sizes, causing standardization challenges. This review focuses on the uses of ACP in engineering and biotechnology sectors in which the innovation can positively impact the operation process, enhance safety, and reduce cost. Additionally, its limitations are examined. Since ACP is still in its nascent stage, the review will also propose potential research opportunities that can help scientists gain more insights on the technology. Key points: • ACP technology has been used in agriculture, medical, and bioprocessing industries. • Chemical study on the reactive species is crucial to produce function-specific ACP. • Different ACP devices and conditions still pose standardization problems.","Lin, Shin Ping;Khumsupan, Darin;Chou, Yu Jou;Hsieh, Kuan Chen;Hsu, Hsien Yi;Ting, Yuwen;Cheng, Kuan Chen",Journal,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,2022-12-01,City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute;Asia University;China Medical University Hospital;Taipei Medical University;City University of Hong Kong;National Taiwan University,Agriculture ;  Atmospheric cold plasma ;  Material modification ;  Medicine ;  Waste management
Global Catastrophic Risk and the Drivers of Scientist Attitudes Towards Policy,"An anthropogenic global catastrophic risk is a human-induced risk that threatens sustained and wide-scale loss of life and damage to civilisation across the globe. In order to understand how new research on governance mechanisms for emerging technologies might assuage such risks, it is important to ask how perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes towards the governance of global catastrophic risk within the research community shape the conduct of potentially risky research. The aim of this study is to deepen our understanding of emerging technology research culture as it relates to global catastrophic risks, and to shed new light on how new research governance mechanisms might be developed. We analyse in-depth interviews with leading AI and biotech researchers both from universities and the private sector. We develop new insights in terms of four salient themes. First, ‘engineering mindset’, which highlights the premium placed by many interviewees on pursuing interesting research about the physical world for its own sake. Second, ‘self-government’, which looks at how self-regulation of technological development currently occurs. Third, ‘pure incentives’, focussing on how career and other incentives shapes research. Fourth, ‘norms and persuasion’, which examines the role of moral considerations in guiding the research choices of scientists. We end by considering the implications of these findings for future research on governance of anthropogenic global catastrophic risk.","Nathan, Christopher;Hyams, Keith",Journal,Science and Engineering Ethics,2022-12-01,University of Warwick,Global catastrophe ;  Policy ;  Research culture ;  Responsible Research and Innovation ;  Risk
Ten questions concerning human-building interaction research for improving the quality of life,"This paper seeks to address ten questions that explore the burgeoning field of Human-Building Interaction (HBI), an interdisciplinary field that represents the next frontier in convergent research and innovation to enable the dynamic interplay of human and building interactional intelligence. The field of HBI builds on several existing efforts in historically separate research fields/communities and aims to understand how buildings affect human outcomes and experiences, as well as how humans interact with, adapt to, and affect the built environment and its systems, to support buildings that can learn, enable adaptation, and evolve at different scales to improve the quality-of-life of its users while optimizing resource usage and service availability. Questions were developed by a diverse group of researchers with backgrounds in design, engineering, computer science, social science, and health science. Answers to these questions draw conclusions from what has been achieved to date as reported in the available literature and establish a foundation for future HBI research. This paper aims to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations in HBI research to change the way people interact with and perceive technology within the context of buildings and inform the design, construction, and operation of next-generation, intelligent built environments. In doing so, HBI research can realize a myriad of benefits for human users, including improved productivity, health, cognition, convenience, and comfort, all of which are essential to societal well-being.","Becerik-Gerber, Burçin;Lucas, Gale;Aryal, Ashrant;Awada, Mohamad;Bergés, Mario;Billington, Sarah L.;Boric-Lubecke, Olga;Ghahramani, Ali;Heydarian, Arsalan;Jazizadeh, Farrokh;Liu, Ruying;Zhu, Runhe;Marks, Frederick;Roll, Shawn;Seyedrezaei, Mirmahdi;Taylor, John E.;Höelscher, Christoph;Khan, Azam;Langevin, Jared;Mauriello, Matthew Louis;Murnane, Elizabeth;Noh, Haeyoung;Pritoni, Marco;Schaumann, Davide;Zhao, Jie",Journal,Building and Environment,2022-12-01,Virginia Tech College of Engineering;USC Viterbi School of Engineering;University of Delaware College of Engineering;Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering;College of Engineering;Singapore-​ETH Centre;Salk Institute for Biological Studies;Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth;University of Southern California;Carnegie Mellon University;ETH Zürich;Technion - Israel Institute of Technology;University of Virginia;Texas A&M University;National University of Singapore;University of Toronto;University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;University of Pennsylvania;Trax.Co;Delos Labs at Delos,Building lifecycle ;  Built environment ;  Human-centered ;  Interaction ;  Occupants ;  Quality of life ;  Well-being
NAO robots as context to teach numerical methods,"This article examines the contextual role that NAO humanoid robots play in the learning environment of a numerical methods course through a design-based research approach. Under the design of intentional and reflective planning that emanates from the socio-critical paradigm in education, the feasibility of using this type of robot in the classroom as a motivation element to engage students in understanding numerical analysis issues is addressed. In particular, the active learning of engineering students is achieved by studying such robots' forward and inverse kinematics. The didactical sequence to teach the generalized Newton–Raphson method for solving non-linear equation systems is validated as part of a Hypothetical Learning Trajectory proposed. Besides, this research provides a brief theoretical discussion on reflection-in-action of the teacher of Higher Education level.","Cruz-Ramírez, Sergio Rolando;García-Martínez, Moisés;Olais-Govea, José Manuel",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2022-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Active learning ;  Design-based research approach ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering teacher reflection ;  NAO humanoid robots ;  Socio-critical paradigm
Insularity and early domestication: anthropogenic ecosystems as habitat islands,"Over the past decade research into early domestication has been transformed by the genomics revolution and increased archaeological investigation. Despite clarification of the timing, locations and genetic processes, most scholars still envision evolutionary responses to human innovations, such as sickle harvesting, tilling, selection for docility or directed breeding. Stepping away from anthropocentric models, evolutionary parallels in the wild can provide case studies for understanding what ecological pressures drove the evolution of the first domestication traits. I contrast evolutionary trends seen among plants and animals confined on oceanic islands with the changes seen in the first cultivated crops and animals. I argue that the earliest villages functioned as habitat islands, applying parallel selective pressures as those on oceanic islands. In this view, the collective assemblage of parallel evolving traits that some scholars refer to as either an island syndrome or domestication syndrome results from similar ecological pressures of insularity, notably ecological release.","Spengler, Robert N.",Journal,Oikos,2022-12-01,Max-Planck-Institut für Geoanthropologie,archaeobotany ;  domestication ;  ecosystem engineering ;  origins of agriculture ;  zooarchaeology
Providing “a beam of light to see the gaps”: determinants of implementation of the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach applied to the pediatric and adolescent HIV cascade in Kenya,"Background: Children and adolescents living with HIV have poorer rates of HIV testing, treatment, and virologic suppression than adults. Strategies that use a systems approach to optimize these multiple, linked steps simultaneously are critical to close these gaps. Methods: The Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA) was adapted and piloted for the pediatric and adolescent HIV care and treatment cascade (SAIA-PEDS) at 6 facilities in Kenya. SAIA-PEDS includes three tools: continuous quality improvement (CQI), flow mapping, and pediatric cascade analysis (PedCAT). A predominately qualitative evaluation utilizing focus group discussions (N = 6) and in-depth interviews (N = 19) was conducted with healthcare workers after implementation to identify determinants of implementation. Data collection and analysis were grounded in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Results: Overall, the adapted SAIA-PEDS strategy was acceptable, and the three tools complemented one another and provided a relative advantage over existing processes. The flow mapping and CQI tools were compatible with existing workflows and resonated with team priorities and goals while providing a structure for group problem solving that transcended a single department’s focus. The PedCAT was overly complex, making it difficult to use. Leadership and hierarchy were complex determinants. All teams reported supportive leadership, with some describing in detail how their leadership was engaged and enthusiastic about the SAIA-PEDS process, by providing recognition, time, and resources. Hierarchy was similarly complex: in some facilities, leadership stifled rapid innovation by insisting on approving each change, while at other facilities, leadership had strong and supportive oversight of processes, checking on the progress frequently and empowering teams to test innovative ideas. Conclusion: CQI and flow mapping were core components of SAIA-PEDS, with high acceptability and consistent use, but the PedCAT was too complex. Leadership and hierarchy had a nuanced role in implementation. Future SAIA-PEDS testing should address PedCAT complexity and further explore the modifiability of leadership engagement to maximize implementation.","Beima-Sofie, Kristin;Wagner, Anjuli D.;Soi, Caroline;Liu, Wenjia;Tollefson, Deanna;Njuguna, Irene N.;Ogutu, Emily;Gaitho, Douglas;Mburu, Nancy;Oluoch, Geoffrey;Mwaura, Peter;Cherutich, Peter;Oyiengo, Laura;John-Stewart, Grace C.;Nduati, Ruth;Sherr, Kenneth;Gimbel, Sarah",Journal,Implementation Science Communications,2022-12-01,Network of AIDS Researchers in East and Southern Africa;Ministry of Health Nairobi;Kenyatta National Hospital;University of Nairobi;University of Washington;Emory University;School of Medicine,Adolescent ;  Cascade analysis ;  Consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) ;  Continuous quality improvement ;  Flow mapping ;  Health systems ;  HIV ;  Implementation determinants ;  Implementation science ;  Pediatric ;  Systems Analysis Improvement Approach (SAIA) ;  Systems engineering
An experimentally validated model for predicting the tensile modulus of tubular biaxial and triaxial hybrid braids,"Braiding is a versatile and cost-effective approach to generating various composite structures for mechanical, sports, and biomedical engineering applications, which are different from each other. For example, a stent is a braided structure and blood penetration in it is essential as much as the right function. Predicting the tensile responses is a prerequisite for the success of implementation of braided structures, and it is usually performed via destructive mechanical testing that might be costly and/or time-consuming. Therefore, it is essential to provide a model that can accurately predict the tensile modulus. In this research, a theoretical model is developed using the simplification of a braided structure and is validated via testing of biaxial and triaxial braids composed of polyester, glass, and basalt yarns on a 16-carrier vertical braiding machine. Experimental results not only are used for the model validation but also show the effectiveness of axial yarn presence, hybridization, and the presence of high-performance yarn in the braided structures on the tensile properties. A good correlation between theoretical values and experimental results is observed approving the high accuracy of the proposed model. This paper is likely to fill a gap in the state of the art and provide pertinent results that are instrumental in the design of hybrid-braided structures with minimum computational/experimental effort. The research innovation centers on the use of two different yarns to make hybridization, simplicity of the model to be used for biaxial and triaxial braided structures, and a start to omit destructive tests.","Ghamkhar, Ghazal;Johari, Majid Safar;Toudeshky, Hossein Hosseini;Bodaghi, Mahdi",Journal,Polymer Composites,2022-12-01,Amirkabir University of Technology;Nottingham Trent University,biaxial braid ;  hybrid braid ;  tensile modulus ;  theoretical model ;  triaxial braid ;  tubular braid
A study of green roof and impact on the temperature of buildings using integrated IoT system,"With the rise of environmental consciousness and the evolution of circular cities, the Internet of things (IoT) has been combined with the concept of circular economies to promote the effective control of renewable energy and resources. In this study, a comprehensive IoT system containing front-end device applications, network layer innovations, and cloud platform integrations was used in civil engineering applications. This IoT architecture is presented as a development basis for constructing modular automatic monitoring devices and integrating circular city concepts with the IoT. According to the concept of circular city, green circulation and energy use are systematically integrated and called “green energy”. In addition, the green energy system can be divided into above-ground and underground. The above-ground part uses green roofs and solar panels for research and discussion. The composite solar green roofs of the two are called green roofs, and the comparison of their benefits is discussed on the spot. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) technologies were used in this study. The advantages of the developed system were analyzed using measured pH values, air temperatures, soil temperatures, and humidity. The results of this study indicate that constructing a green energy roof can decrease indoor temperatures by 1.5 °C and solar module temperatures by 1.6 °C while increasing power generation; thus, green energy roofs are suitable for tropical regions.","Tseng, Kuo Hsiung;Chung, Meng Yun;Chen, Li Hsien;Chou, Lu An",Journal,Scientific Reports,2022-12-01,National Taipei University of Technology;WSP International LLC.,
Anode interfacial modification for non-fullerene polymer solar cells: Recent advances and prospects,"Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs) has surpassed 19% due to the fast development of novel donor polymers, NF-acceptors, device engineering, and interlayer materials. The anode interlayer (AIL) plays a vital role in improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs. The challenges and opportunities in this research area encourage researchers to pursue great innovation in developing new materials and strategies for highly efficient NF-PSCs. This review summarizes the recent development of AIL materials and their modification strategies in single-junction NF-PSCs. Firstly, a brief introduction, key functions, basic requirements, and peculiar features of AILs when employed in NF-PSCs are discussed. Then, the impact of AIL materials (including organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials) on the PCE and the stability of NF-PSCs are described. Afterward, the fabrication of large-area devices and related issues are highlighted. The summary and the future challenges regarding efficient AIL are summarized in the last section of this review.

Exploring the microgeography and typology of U.S. high-tech clusters,"Despite the principal role of high-tech clusters in local planning practice and research, their location and sectoral typology at the granular level have been rarely studied. This study explores the location of U.S. high-tech clusters at a micro-scale by employing firm-level data sets and spatial statistics and examines their sectoral typology using market concentration indices in 52 large U.S regions. The majority (80 %) of the 627 tech clusters we identify have multiple dominant tech industries or are specialized in professional services. Furthermore, while clusters form the major regional hubs for the high-tech economy, they are home to a very small share (7 %, on average) of regional population. U.S. regions also have widely diverse spatial patterns of high-tech clusters; although some regions have scattered clusters, the New York and Northern California high-tech booming regions have clusters concentrated in central business districts (CBDs). Last, U.S. high-tech clusters and the overall high-tech economy are strongly shaped by the location and performance of professional services, i.e., consulting, legal, computer, engineering, and architectural services.","Zandiatashbar, Ahoura;Hamidi, Shima",Journal,Cities,2022-12-01,Department of Environmental Health and Engineering;San Jose State University,Economic development ;  High-tech cluster ;  Innovation districts ;  Smart growth management
CRISPR/Cas9 technology as an innovative approach to enhancing the phytoremediation: Concepts and implications,"Phytoremediation is currently an active field of research focusing chiefly on identifying and characterizing novel and high chelation action super-accumulators. In the last few years, molecular tools have been widely exploited to understand better metal absorption, translocation, cation, and tolerance mechanisms in plants. Recently more advanced CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering technology is also employed to enhance detoxification efficiency. Further, advances in molecular science will trigger the understanding of adaptive phytoremediation ability plant production in current global warming conditions. The enhanced abilities of nucleases for genome modification can improve plant repair capabilities by modifying the genome, thereby achieving a sustainable ecosystem. The purpose of this manuscript focuses on biotechnology's fundamental principles and application to promote climate-resistant metal plants, especially the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system for enhancing the phytoremediation of harmful contamination and pollutants.","Naz, Misbah;Benavides-Mendoza, Adalberto;Tariq, Muhammad;Zhou, Jianyu;Wang, Jiahao;Qi, Shanshan;Dai, Zhicong;Du, Daolin",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2022-12-01,Suzhou University of Science and Technology;Jiangsu University;Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro;Lahore College Women University,CRISPR/Cas9 technology ;  Gene editing ;  Phytoremediation ;  Stress tolerance
Innovative nanotechnology tools for the functional control and tracking of human stem cells,"The precise control of stem cell behavior, including differentiation, transdifferentiation, and reprogramming, is fundamental for safely and efficiently using human stem cells in regenerative medicine. Thanks to recent innovations and developments in the field of nanomedicine, as well as its integration with advanced molecular biology approaches, the possibility of engineering and restoring functions of complex tissues become reality. Multifunctional nanotechnological tools allow to finely control the release of growth factors, mRNA, and other molecules, to promote cell fate conversion, and to perform long-term tracking in vivo. Furthermore, stimulation approaches based on smart and biocompatible nanotransducers promise to remotely modulate the stem cell activity, paving the way for the actual exploitation of these technologies in the internal tissues of large-sized animals. In this review, the most innovative nanotechnology tools applied to stem cell-based regenerative medicine are presented, and their implications for future research and clinics are discussed.","Marino, Attilio;Battaglini, Matteo;Tapeinos, Christos;Larrañaga, Aitor;Ciofani, Gianni",Journal,Materials Today Advances,2022-12-01,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia;Universidad del Pais Vasco;Helsingin Yliopisto,Cell tracking ;  Nanostructured surfaces ;  Remote cell stimulation ;  Smart nanomaterials ;  Stem cells
"Does the resources curse hypothesis exist in China? What is the dynamic role of fiscal decentralization, economic policy uncertainty, and technology innovation for sustainable financial development?","Sustainable economic development is the primary goal of each economy. In this regard, the role of natural resources has been extensively debated in the existing literature; however, the studies on the natural resource's influence on the financial development of developing countries are scarce. This study investigates the validity of the resource curse hypothesis related to financial development by recruiting fiscal decentralization, technology innovation, and economic policy uncertainty in China. The study employed the contemporary and innovative approach of quantile autoregressive distribution lag (QARDL) to evaluate the asymmetric association between variables from 1990 to 2020. Empirical findings validate the resource curse hypothesis in China, which implies that the natural resource rent compressed financial development. Likewise, economic policy uncertainty also adversely affected financial development. In contrast, fiscal decentralization and technological innovation accelerated financial development and neutralized the negative consequences of natural resources. Based on the findings, conductive short-run and long-run business strategies and regulations should be implemented, including the adequate consumption of natural resources, reallocation of funds at regional government levels, and transformation toward sustainable technologies to shift the curse into a blessing.","Li, Hui;Usman, Nazar;Coulibay, Megnoro Hamed;Phiri, Ruth;Tang, Xiaoying",Journal,Resources Policy,2022-12-01,Chang'an University;Central South University,Economic policy uncertainty ;  Fiscal decentralization ;  Natural resource rent ;  Resource curse hypothesis ;  Sustainable development ;  Technology innovation

Emerging advances in biomimetic synthesis of nanocomposites and potential applications,"Nanoscale materials are primarily synthesized by utilizing several physiochemical methodologies; however, with inevitable negative consequences, such as environmental pollution, high energy consumption, high cost, and potential health problems. Hence, in recent years, several efforts have been made to identify reliable and environmentally friendly synthetic strategies for synthesizing nanocomposites (NCs). Amongst, the plant-mediated synthesis has been identified as an alternative as plant extracts are used rather than the industrial chemical agents and harsh operational conditions to reduce metal ions which provide significant benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness, decreased toxicity, and abundancies of raw materials. Further, plant-derived biofunctionalized NCs are currently being used successfully in several applications, including environmental remediation, biomedical applications, agricultural and food industries, and engineering, due to their obvious beneficial properties. The use of plant-derived NCs in the field of nanotechnology has paved the way for sustainable synthesis as well as opened up new opportunities for innovation and commercialization in a wide range of industries. Hence, this review describes the advantages of the plant-derived NCs to the nanotechnology field, as well as an overview of the three types of matrix NCs, their synthesis, properties, and various potential applications. Further, this review article may facilitate future research and development on plant-derived NCs in touched and untouched areas of science.","Aththanayaka, S.;Thiripuranathar, G.;Ekanayake, S.",Journal,Materials Today Sustainability,2022-12-01,University of Sri Jayewardenepura;College of Chemical Sciences,Green synthesis ;  Metal matrix ;  Nanotechnology ;  Plant-derived ;  Properties ;  Sustainability
Nursing science as a federally-recognized STEM degree: A call to action for the United States with global implications,"Nursing science contributes to advancements in patient care, public health, and innovation within numerous scientific domains. Despite commonality with United States Department of Education definitions of a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational programs, nursing continues to be excluded from Department of Homeland Security STEM classification. This exclusion prevents societal recognition of nursing as a science and limits attraction of clinicians and nurse scientists born outside of the United States due to omission from various federal visa provisions the Department of Homeland Security classification provides. We evaluated existing Department of Homeland Security STEM-classified educational programs and identified methodological and content congruency among STEM-classified programs and nursing. We provide clear evidence that nursing contributes impactful STEM research; and argue that inclusion is critical for advancement of the profession and the potential to mitigate the faculty shortage. Beyond evaluation of nursing as a STEM field, we offer a policy-focused solution for development and diversification of the nursing workforce.","Dreisbach, Caitlin;Wright, Michelle L.;Walker, Rae K.;Byon, Ha Do;Keim-Malpass, Jessica",Journal,International Journal of Nursing Studies Advances,2022-12-01,Dell Medical School;University of Virginia School of Nursing;University of Virginia School of Medicine;Columbia University;University of Massachusetts Amherst;The University of Texas at Austin,
Identifying the Roles of Research Entities in Technological Knowledge Flow Among Patents Assignees by Using Patent Citations,"Despite much research on the interdisciplinarity of the publications across subject categories, few studies analyze the interdisciplinarity of the technological knowledge flow among research entities (i.e., patent assignees, inventors, and countries). In this article, we propose a framework to identify the roles of the research entities by measuring the interdisciplinarity of the technological knowledge flow. Research entities are positioned on the two-dimensional maps based on the integration index, diffusion index, and specialization index, which are used to measure the degree of the interdisciplinarity of different research entities in knowledge flow. In order to explore the role of the research entities in knowledge flow, we put forward four kinds of research entities: diverse knowledge provider, active mediator of diverse knowledge flow, diverse knowledge consumer, and negative mediator of diverse knowledge flow. The case study related to synthetic biology indicates that this method is valid and could explore effectively, the roles of the research entities to further guide the creation of new inventions by converging prominent technologies beyond technology field boundaries in facilitating active technology flow and support technological competitive evaluation and policy decision-making.","Wang, Ying;Qiao, Yali;Wang, Xuefeng;Wan, Dong",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-12-01,Beijing Institute of Technology,Diffusion index ;  integration index ;  interdi- sciplinarity ;  research entities ;  specialization index ;  technological knowledge flow
Revisiting critical STEM interventions: a literature review of STEM organizational learning,"There is inconclusive evidence on the ability of scientific research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education to scale-up from one context to another and ultimately become institutionalized. The dearth of evidence draws focus on how organizations change and evolve or the process of organizational learning. We designed this systematic review of the literature to uncover to what extent and how organizational theory has been leveraged within STEM interventions or as a research tool to inform the policies and practices of STEM education organizations. Unlike previous reviews, we explicitly focused on how organizational learning informs cultural transformation toward the success of racially and ethnically underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM. The research question was: How has organizational theory and learning informed the potential for STEM education to center the success of URM students? Our results reveal that STEM entities that did not leverage organizational theory consistently fell into either the “decision trap” identified by Langely et al. created by ignoring temporal structures or deemed the innovation threatening, as Kezar suggested. We conclude with practical recommendations for the design of STEM education interventions.","López, Norma;Morgan, Demetri L.;Hutchings, Quortne R.;Davis, Kendrick",Journal,International Journal of STEM Education,2022-12-01,University of Southern California;Tufts University;Northern Illinois University;Loyola University Chicago,Change processes ;  Organizational learning ;  STEM education ;  URM students
Influence of Shear Effects on the Characteristics of Axisymmetric Wave Propagation in a Buried Fluid-Filled Pipe,"The acoustic propagation characteristics of axisymmetric waves have been widely used in leak detection of fluid-filled pipes. The related acoustic methods and equipment are gradually coming to the market, but their theoretical research obviously lags behind the field practice, which seriously restricts the breakthrough and innovation of this technology. Based on the fully three-dimensional effect of the surrounding medium, a coupled motion equation of axisymmetric wave of buried liquid-filled pipes is derived in detail, a contact coefficient is used to express the coupling strength between surrounding medium and pipe, then, a general equation of motion was derived which contain the pipe soil lubrication contact, pipe soil compact contact and pipe in water and air. Finally, the corresponding numerical calculation model is established and solved used numerical method. The shear effects of the surrounding medium and the shear effects at the interface between surrounding medium and pipe are discussed in detail. The output indicates that the surrounding medium is to add mass to the pipe wall, but the shear effect is to add stiffness. With the consideration of the contact strength between the pipe and the medium, the additional mass and the pipe wall will resonate at a specific frequency, resulting in a significant increase in the radiation wave to the surrounding medium. The research contents have great guiding effect on the theory of acoustic wave propagation and the engineering application of leak detection technology in the buried pipe.","Lu, Ping;Sheng, Xiaozhen;Gao, Yan;Wang, Ruichen",Journal,Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering (English Edition),2022-12-01,Shanghai University of Engineering Science;University of Huddersfield;Institute of Acoustics Chinese Academy of Sciences;Southwest Jiaotong University,Axisymmetric waves ;  Buried fluid-filled pipe ;  Dispersion ;  Shear effect
Real-time whole-brain imaging of hemodynamics and oxygenation at micro-vessel resolution with ultrafast wide-field photoacoustic microscopy,"High-speed high-resolution imaging of the whole-brain hemodynamics is critically important to facilitating neurovascular research. High imaging speed and image quality are crucial to visualizing real-time hemodynamics in complex brain vascular networks, and tracking fast pathophysiological activities at the microvessel level, which will enable advances in current queries in neurovascular and brain metabolism research, including stroke, dementia, and acute brain injury. Further, real-time imaging of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (sO2) can capture fast-paced oxygen delivery dynamics, which is needed to solve pertinent questions in these fields and beyond. Here, we present a novel ultrafast functional photoacoustic microscopy (UFF-PAM) to image the whole-brain hemodynamics and oxygenation. UFF-PAM takes advantage of several key engineering innovations, including stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) based dual-wavelength laser excitation, water-immersible 12-facet-polygon scanner, high-sensitivity ultrasound transducer, and deep-learning-based image upsampling. A volumetric imaging rate of 2 Hz has been achieved over a field of view (FOV) of 11 × 7.5 × 1.5 mm3 with a high spatial resolution of ~10 μm. Using the UFF-PAM system, we have demonstrated proof-of-concept studies on the mouse brains in response to systemic hypoxia, sodium nitroprusside, and stroke. We observed the mouse brain’s fast morphological and functional changes over the entire cortex, including vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and deoxygenation. More interestingly, for the first time, with the whole-brain FOV and micro-vessel resolution, we captured the vasoconstriction and hypoxia simultaneously in the spreading depolarization (SD) wave. We expect the new imaging technology will provide a great potential for fundamental brain research under various pathological and physiological conditions.","Zhu, Xiaoyi;Huang, Qiang;DiSpirito, Anthony;Vu, Tri;Rong, Qiangzhou;Peng, Xiaorui;Sheng, Huaxin;Shen, Xiling;Zhou, Qifa;Jiang, Laiming;Hoffmann, Ulrike;Yao, Junjie",Journal,Light: Science and Applications,2022-12-01,USC Viterbi School of Engineering;Pratt School of Engineering;The Second Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University;Keck School of Medicine of USC;Duke University School of Medicine,
"Combining development, capacity building and responsible innovation in GCRF-funded medical technology research","Development-oriented funding schemes such as the UK Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) have opened up opportunities for collaborations between low-middle income countries (LMICs) and high-income country (HIC) researchers. In particular, funding for medical technology research has seen a rise in previously under-represented disciplines such as physics and engineering. These collaborations have considerable potential to advance healthcare in LMICs, yet can pose challenges experienced to researchers undertaking these collaborations. Key challenges include a lack of tradition of HIC/LMIC collaborations within participating departments, lack of experience with development agendas, designing contextually-appropriate technologies and ensuring long-term viability of research outputs. This paper reflects on these key challenges, using the experiences of the authors on the Open Laboratory Instrumentation (OLI) project as a focalizing lens.

Investigating the role of peptides in effective therapies against cancer,"Early diagnosis and effective treatment of cancer are challenging. To diagnose and treat cancer effectively and to overcome these challenges, fundamental innovations in traditional diagnosis and therapy are necessary. Peptides can be very helpful in this regard due to their potential and diversity. To enhance the therapeutic potential of peptides, their limitations must be properly identified and their structures engineered and modified for higher efficiency. Promoting the bioavailability and stability of peptides is one of the main concerns. Peptides can also be effective in different areas of targeting, alone or with the help of other therapeutic agents. There has been a lot of research in this area, and the potential for variability of peptides will continue to improve this process. Another promising area in which peptides can help treat cancer is peptide vaccines, which are undergoing promising research, and high throughput technologies can lead to fundamental changes in this area. Peptides have been effective in almost all areas of cancer treatment, and some have even gone through clinical phases. However, many barriers need to be overcome to reach the desired point. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the mechanisms associated with peptides in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Therefore, related studies in this area will be discussed.","Naeimi, Reza;Bahmani, Asrin;Afshar, Saeid",Journal,Cancer Cell International,2022-12-01,Research Center for Molecular;Hamadan University of Medical Sciences,Cancer ;  Peptides ;  Therapeutic effect ;  Vaccines

Interfirm Transformative Capacity Within Global Value Chains,"How do global value chains (GVCs) affect a firm's innovation impact? Working as international communities, GVCs are rich in knowledge and resource interchange. The prior literature has focused on knowledge absorbing or internal knowledge transfer within firms for in-house innovation. However, scant research has focused on promoting innovation across interfirm networks in a GVC context. This article develops a new concept of interfirm transformative capacity as a firm's ability to transfer developed technology knowledge across time, space, and firm networks. In this article, we explore three mechanisms of interfirm transformative capacity in GVCs: 1) choosing knowledge intermediaries, 2) transmitting and maintaining knowledge over time and space, and 3) reactivating and synthesizing knowledge. We predict that engagement in a lead firm's GVC, structural holes, and network centrality will affect a focal firm's innovation impact as a result of interfirm transformative capacity. Integrator suppliers have higher innovation impacts than modular suppliers.

A Scientometric Exploration of Crowdsourcing: Research Clusters and Applications,"Crowdsourcing is a multidisciplinary research area that represents a rapidly expanding field where new applications are constantly emerging. Research in this area has investigated its use for citizen science in data gathering for research and crowdsourcing for industrial innovation. Previous studies have reviewed and categorized crowdsourcing research using qualitative methods. This has led to the limited coverage of the entire field, using smaller discrete parts of the literature and mostly reviewing the industrial aspects of crowdsourcing. This study uses a scientometric analysis of 7059 publications over the period 2006-2019 to map crowdsourcing research to identify clusters and applications. Our results are the first in the literature to map crowdsourcing research holistically. In this article, we classify its usage in the three domains of innovation, engineering, and science, where 11 categories and 26 subcategories are further developed. The results of this article reveal that the most active scientific clusters where crowdsourcing is used are environmental sciences and ecology. For the engineering domain, it is computer science, telecommunication, and operations research. In innovation, idea crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, and crowd creation are the most frequent areas. The findings of this study map crowdsourcing usage across different fields and illustrate emerging crowdsourcing applications.","Ozcan, Sercan;Boye, David;Arsenyan, Jbid;Trott, Paul",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-12-01,Portsmouth Business School;Rennes School of Business;Bahçeşehir Üniversitesi;HSE University,Crowdsourcing ;  emerging clusters ;  research trends ;  scientometric ;  text mining
"The European Preinstrumental Earthquake Catalogue EPICA, the 1000-1899 catalogue for the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020","The European PreInstrumental Earthquake CAtalogue (EPICA) (Rovida and Antonucci, 2021; 10.13127/epica.1.1) is the 1000-1899 seismic catalogue compiled for the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020 (ESHM20), an outcome of the project Seismology and Earthquake Engineering Research Infrastructure Alliance for Europe (SERA), in the framework of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. EPICA is the update of the SHARE European Earthquake Catalogue (SHEEC) 1000-1899, with which it shares the main principles-mostly transparency, repeatability and continent-wide harmonisation of data-As well as the compilation strategies and methods. Version 1.1 of EPICA contains 5703 earthquakes with either maximum intensity ≥5 or Mw≥4.0, with a spatial coverage from the Atlantic Ocean to the west to 32 E in longitude, and from the Mediterranean Sea to Northern Europe. EPICA relies upon the updated knowledge of the European preinstrumental seismicity provided by the data gathered in the European Archive of Historical Earthquake Data (AHEAD). Such data are both macroseismic intensity data supplied by descriptive historical seismological studies and online macroseismic databases, and parameters contained in regional catalogues. As done for the compilation of SHEEC 1000-1899, these datasets were thoroughly analysed in order to select the most representative of the knowledge of each earthquake, independently from national constraints. Selected intensity distributions are processed with three methods to determine location and magnitude based on the attenuation of macroseismic intensity and are combined with parameters harmonised from modern regional catalogues. This paper describes the compilation procedure of EPICA version 1.1, its input data, the assessment of the earthquake parameters and the resulting catalogue, which is finally compared with its previous version. Technical solutions for accessing the catalogue, both as downloadable files and through web services, are also illustrated.","Rovida, Andrea;Antonucci, Andrea;Locati, Mario",Journal,Earth System Science Data,2022-11-30,"Istituto Nazionale Di Geofisica E Vulcanologia, Rome",
Machine learning for battery research,"Batteries are vital energy storage carriers in industry and in our daily life. There is continued interest in the developments of batteries with excellent service performance and safety. Traditional trial-and-error experimental approaches have the limitations of high-cost and low-efficiency. Atomistic computational simulations are relatively expensive and take long time to screen massive materials. The rapid development of machine learning (ML) has brought innovations in many fields and has also changed the paradigm of the battery research. Numerous ML applications have emerged in the battery community, such as novel materials discovery, property prediction, and characterization. In this review, we introduced the workflow of ML, where the task, data, feature engineering, and evaluation were involved. Several typical ML models used in batteries were highlighted. In addition, we summarized the applications of ML for the discovery of novel materials, and for property and battery state prediction. The challenges for the application of ML in batteries were also discussed.","Wei, Zheng;He, Qiu;Zhao, Yan",Journal,Journal of Power Sources,2022-11-30,State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing;Wuhan University;Sichuan University,Battery materials ;  Battery state prediction ;  Machine learning
"Make-in-India and Industry 4.0: technology readiness of select firms, barriers and socio-technical implications","Purpose: In this research, the emphasis is multifold. First objective is to study differences amongst India's Make-in-India, Germany's Industry 4.0 and China's Made-in-China 2025 on a macro level. Second objective is to identify where does individual industry segment out of the five broad segments (prioritized by Make-in-India initiative) represented by ten firms in India stand in terms of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Third objective is to identify key barriers for each of these five industry segments. Finally, socio-technical interventions are also proposed aimed at faster adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methodological approach is followed to achieve the research objectives. First, for the macro-level comparison of three pertinent countries, extant research and industry literature have been relied upon. Thereafter, at a micro level, inputs from experts belonging to focal sectors are included in this study to ascertain the current level of readiness of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and the barriers to adoption. Finally, the authors argue for and propose some socio-technical interventions that are aimed at mitigation of barriers for adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Findings: It has been ascertained that amongst the ten firms (two each from given focal sectors) considered in the study, the automotive and the software firm are perhaps best placed to adopt the Industry 4.0 technology, while the infrastructure project management firm is least ready for Industry 4.0 technologies. The common barriers to adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, as elaborated by experts belonging to each of the ten firms, are also identified. These three commons barriers are resistance to change, unclear economic benefits and problems related to coordination and collaboration. Research limitations/implications: The study is one of first attempts to understand the nuances related to technology readiness across focal industries pertaining to the Make-in-India initiative and Industry 4.0. The study furthers the extant understanding of common and distinct barriers across industries. Employing the soft-systems methodology, the study advocates for a number of socio-technical interventions pertaining to establishment of e-skill ecosystem, community learning clusters and sector-focussed skill acquisition and augmentation. Since the study considers only two firms corresponding to each of the five focal sectors, including more firms across industries could have resulted in further validation of study as well. Practical implications: Contrasting the initiatives of the three countries results in identification of different thematic focus of the respective initiatives. While India's Make-in-India initiative has a strong social dimension, Germany's Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025 have key objective related to integration of cyber-physical systems and to graduate to innovation-driven country, respectively. Further, analysis on the technology readiness for adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies based on the respective experts' assessment results in understanding of the underlying barriers. Social implications: Adopting the soft-systems perspective linking nuances of stakeholders, socio-technical systems and socio-economic characteristics results in several propositions to further the social objectives of India's Make-in-India initiative. These propositions advocate for pathways in which extant strengths in terms of technology, people and existing socio-technical structures can be brought together to cater to the requirements related to employability and skill augmentation of new as well as existing workforce. Originality/value: Extant research literature is primarily focussed on certain specific topics within Industry 4.0 implementation and is mainly based on conceptual or theoretical basis. From a practitioners' perspective, only a few empirical papers could be found that too are typically focussed on single case studies resulting from pilot applications of Industry 4.0. However, such papers have not examined the broad implications of Industry 4.0 in terms of differences between key countries' manufacturing initiatives, readiness of key sectors, sectoral barriers and accompanying policy-level implications associated with implementation of Industry 4.0. Thus, the objective of this research is to abridge these research gaps.","Goswami, Mohit;Daultani, Yash",Journal,TQM Journal,2022-11-29,Indian Institute of Management Raipur;Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,Industry 4.0 ;  Make-in-India ;  Society ;  Technological innovation ;  Technology adoption ;  Technology readiness
Characterizing Academic Engineering Research Groups: A Case Study of the Advanced Joining Processes Unit,"Academic research is a key activity of higher learning institutions, where the knowledge, skills and capabilities of the staff are directed towards scientific activities. The case of academic engineering research groups is quite particular, as they must perform academic research work but still consistently work with industrial partners in problem-solving research activities. Although they appear to be distinct, these aspects are interconnected and combining impactful research work and academic training is highly advantageous to group performance. This paper studies the operation of academic engineering research groups, starting with a literature review on the subject, followed by an analysis of a case study. The target of the case study is the Advanced Joining Processes Unit, part of the Institute of Science and Innovation in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering and the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, a leading research unit in mechanical engineering, performing research on advanced joining processes. The main lesson drawn is that to achieve lasting success and significant impact on the scientific community and society, a research group must operate with clear and result-oriented leadership, able to provide a work environment with well-defined goals, and which is consistently working towards knowledge generation and dissemination.","Marques, Eduardo A.S.;Carbas, Ricardo J.C.;da Silva, Lucas F.M.",Journal,U.Porto Journal of Engineering,2022-11-28,Instituto de Ciência e Inovação em Engenharia Mecânica e Engenharia Industrial;Universidade do Porto,Dissemination ;  Mechanical Engineering ;  Research Approaches
Evaluation of enterprise technology innovation capability in prefabricated construction in China,"Purpose: This study aims to evaluate enterprise technology innovation capability in prefabricated construction (PC) from an input-output perspective, using six integrated enterprises in China as cases. Design/methodology/approach: An evaluation system for enterprise technology innovation capability in PC was constructed, including total input, technology output (TO) and project output. All the evaluation indexes were quantified, and the subject and object indexes weights were determined using the fuzzy cognitive map and information entropy, respectively. The final scores and ranks were evaluated through gray relational analysis (GRA) based on the combined weights. Findings: It was found that enterprise technology innovation capability in PC was low in China, with its unbalanced development in different dimensions and the poorest performance in TO, currently. Originality/value: This research has developed an evaluation system for technology innovation capability in PC at the enterprise level and scientifically quantified all the indexes, which is a breakthrough over existing studies. The GRA model based on the combined weights proposed in this study can be applied to other comparable fields and regions, with its easy operation.","Dou, Yudan;Xue, Xiaolong;Wang, Yuna;Xue, Weirui;Huangfu, Wenbo",Journal,Construction Innovation,2022-11-28,Guangzhou University;Dalian University of Technology;Ltd.,China ;  Combined weights ;  Enterprises ;  Evaluation ;  Prefabricated construction ;  Technology innovation capability
Conceptual framework of value management adoption in the Nigerian construction industry,"Purpose: The Nigerian construction industry is bedeviled with poor project performance and outcomes which value management (VM) could address if applied. The application of VM on Nigerian construction projects is very minimal due to certain obstacles, namely, lack of VM experts, paucity of knowledge on the techniques, etc., which inhibits the adoption into the construction industry. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual framework of the adoption of VM on construction projects in a typical developing economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study engaged 15 selected VM experts in two rounds of Delphi survey to develop a conceptual framework of VM adoption. The method of data analysis includes mean score, standard deviation, Kendall’s coefficient of concordance, chi-square (χ2) test, interrater agreement analysis and significant level analysis. The developed conceptual framework was sent to a team of local and international VM experts for validation. Findings: This study reveals that the adoption of VM requires the collective effort of relevant stakeholders in the construction industry. The framework developed presents individual and collective activities to be undertaken by the stakeholders. The activities include training, legislation, government-funded research, etc. Thus, the adoption of innovative management methodology like VM requires the collaboration of academics, construction professional bodies and government parastatals. This will assist in the judicious use of limited construction resources and boost the relevance of the Nigerian construction industry among developing nations and in the global construction market. Originality/value: This study used the opinions of few construction professionals that can be regarded as VM experts in Nigeria, as against engaging a pool of construction professionals who may not be knowledgeable in VM process. Engaging the few VM experts in the Nigerian construction industry is important to have a valid basis for drawing conclusion, as large questionnaire survey could be possibly filled by inexperienced or unqualified respondents if stringent criteria are not considered at the outset of this study.","Ojo, Lekan Damilola;Ogunsemi, Deji Rufus;Ogunsina, Olusola",Journal,Construction Innovation,2022-11-28,"Federal University of Technology, Akure;Nnamdi Azikiwe University;City University of Hong Kong",Adoption ;  Conceptual framework ;  Construction industry ;  Innovation ;  Nigeria ;  Value management ;  Value management/engineering

Upgrading microbial strains for fermentation industry,"Fermentation is a green, low-carbon and sustainable process for the production of food, chemicals, fuels, and materials by using microbial strains as biocatalysts and renewable resources such as starch and biomass as feedstocks. China has the world’s largest fermentation industry, the scale of amino acids, vitamins, and some other fermentation products accounted for 60%–80% of the global market share. The development of fermentation industry is of great significance for the strategic goal of “carbon neutralization and carbon peak” and the development of bioeconomy. Microbial strains are the core of fermentation industry, which directly decide what kind of chemical can be produced from what kind of feedstock at what cost. Innovating industrial strains to improve the conversion efficiency of raw materials, increase the production level, and expand product portfolio is the key to the high-quality development of fermentation industry. In recent years, the development of synthetic biology and systems biology has further deepened the understanding of the physiological and metabolic mechanisms of microbial chassis and accelerated the development of gene editing and other enabling technologies for strain design and engineering. All these advances have provided new driving force for the upgrading of industrial strains. This review focused on the representative fermentation products including amino acids, B vitamins, citric acid, and bio-ethanol. The latest progress of strain development for fermentation industry was reviewed from the perspective of basic research and technology innovation for industrial microbial chassis. How the integration of artificial intelligence and automation with life science will reshape the upgrading of industrial strains was also discussed.","Zhou, Wenjuan;Fu, Gang;Qi, Xianni;Zheng, Xiaomei;Fang, Huan;Xia, Miaomiao;Zhang, Dawei;Wang, Qinhong;Zheng, Ping;Wang, Yu;Sun, Jibin",Journal,Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Biotechnology,2022-11-25,Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology;National Technology Innovation Center of Synthetic Biology,amino acid ;  Aspergillus niger ;  Bacillus subtilis ;  citric acid ;  Corynebacterium glutamicum ;  fuel ethanol ;  Saccharomyces cerevisiae ;  vitamin

Knowledge contribution from science to technology in the lithium-ion battery domain based on a genetic model,"Lithium-ion batteries' scientific and technological innovation is a hotspot in the energy storage field. Scientific knowledge has a significant effect on technology innovation in lithium-ion batteries. Understanding how science contributes to the technology in the lithium-ion battery domain could make better use of scientific knowledge to promote technology innovation. Previous studies about lithium-ion battery innovation have provided valuable suggestions while they did not explore how science contributes to the technology in the lithium-ion battery domain. Moreover, most previous studies about relationships between science and technology ignored multi-step indirect citations, which might have caused information loss. Therefore, this study uncovers the knowledge contribution from science to technology in the lithium-ion battery from a more comprehensive view by proposing a paper-patent knowledge genetic model and related indexes which could measure the knowledge contribution effect of both direct and multi-step indirect citations. The findings are: (1) In the lithium-ion battery domain, the indirect citation relationships from science to technology contain information, and they should be noticed. The total knowledge contribution range of science to technology is twice the direct knowledge contribution range, and the total knowledge contribution strength is five times the direct knowledge contribution strength; (2) In the lithium-ion battery domain, the knowledge contribution of science to technology is mainly concentrated within five steps of the knowledge flow. When consulting relevant materials related to scientific papers, patent applicants or patent examiners can obtain data collections of relevant papers through the five-step snowball sampling method to avoid information redundancy and guarantee relatively sufficient reference materials; (3) This study unearthed the top ten papers ranked by total knowledge contribution strength. Most papers are generally highly recognized by the academic community, and most are easily ignored by the traditional method. The knowledge contribution strength index can be used to evaluate papers and predict significant award winners in the lithium-ion battery domain.","Feng, Sida;Li, Huajiao;Qi, Yabin;Magee, Christopher L.;Zhou, Jianlin;Ma, Shao chao",Journal,Journal of Energy Storage,2022-11-25,Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China;School of Economics and Management;Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Beijing University of Chemical Technology,Citation network ;  Knowledge contribution ;  Lithium-ion battery ;  Science ;  Technology
Effect of total quality management practices on nonfinancial performance: an empirical analysis of automotive engineering industry in Ethiopia,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the total quality management (TQM) practices and identify their effect on the nonfinancial performance (NFP) in the automotive engineering industry in Ethiopia. Despite many studies investigating the relationship between TQM practices and NFP, rare research has been conducted on TQM in automotive industries, making this a hugely unexplored field. Design/methodology/approach: The data underlying this study was collected using more than 500 self-administered questionnaire survey, distributed to the employees working under different departments and factories under one automotive engineering industry. Extensive data screening and refinement processes for discarding irrelevant items for the questionnaire (Likert five-point scale) were carried out. The data was employed to test the proposed theoretical model, established with the objective of assessing the effect of TQM practices on the NFP in the case industry. Empirical validated relations have been proofed for previously done researches that there were positive relations between the TQM practices and NFP. Different statistical tools applied include descriptive data analysis, correlation analysis, mean scale test, reliability analysis and factor analysis, and finally, two models were developed based on structural equation modeling by using SPSS and AMOS-26 software. Findings: Results found in this study were quite surprising. Initially, there was a total of ten TQM factors. The six independent factors survived from factor analysis only two factors (employee involvement and innovation) were contributing to the NFP. The study was acted as a performance evaluation system to track the industry NFP. Although the study focused on the effect of TQM practices, for more results it is recommended to conduct a 360-degree further research study to reveal the weaknesses, strengths, opportunities and challenges of the case industry performance. Research limitations/implications: Every research has its own limitations. The way the analysis is conducted in this study ensures that the limitations do not compromise the validity of the results obtained. Control variables (industry type, size, age, process type and technology used) are not considered in the research which may affect the results obtained. The study included the automobile industry alone, so the obtained results cannot be generalized to other industries. Practical implications: The positive relationship between the TQM practices and NFP measures indicates the importance of each of these practices in improving the industry. Researchers/managers/practitioners can use this developed model periodically to understand where the industry stands in the quality management journey. They can also analyze the effect of TQM practices on financial as well as operational performance measures. The research findings can also motivate the top management of the industry for better planning of goals, to arrange resources in time, in pursuit of improving quality, employee and industry performance. Originality/value: The Ethiopian manufacturing industry is required to improve their manufacturing and service quality, in order to enhance their productivity and boost their competitiveness in an international market, which is the basis of this study. This study signifies one of the first attempts to empirically explore this linkage between TQM and performance in the Ethiopian automotive industry context.","Abdi, Mohamed;Singh, Ajit Pal",Journal,TQM Journal,2022-11-24,Ambo University;Defense University,Automotive industry ;  Nonfinancial performance ;  Total quality management
Learning Media Innovation about Keris Cultural Heritage through Augmented Reality,"Keris is a special weapon that is a cultural heritage in Indonesia which is of high value. Until now, the introduction and learning of culture about keris are still limited to 2D from books, or in exhibitions or museums. Learning about keris culture certainly needs to be supported by technological developments. The process of delivering information is currently experiencing rapid development, the latest technology used in delivering information is Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Users can visualize historical objects or objects in three-dimensional (3D) form via Android smartphones. The method used in this research is the ADDIE model, starting from Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. The results reveal that distance, marker angle, and device specifications all have a sizeable impact on the camera's marker readout. The shortest distance between the marker and the camera where 3D objects can be displayed is 20 cm, while the farthest distance at which 3D items cannot be displayed is 100 cm. And the marker reading angle is only about 0° until 45°. The application of Augmented Reality technology is interactive and real-Time, so Augmented Reality can be implemented in various fields and become a learning medium to introduce historical objects that are cultural heritage.","Marcellino, Lucas;Harischandra, Ida Bagus Rama;Buana, I.

Improving Interactive Instruction: Faculty Engagement Requires Starting Small and Telling All,"Interactive instruction, such as student-centered learning or active learning, is known to benefit student success as well as diversity in computer science. However, there is a persistent and substantial dissonance between research and practice of computer science education techniques. Current research on computer science education, while extensive, sees limited adoption beyond the original researchers. The developed educational technologies can lack sufficient detail for replication or be too specific and require extensive reworking to be employable by other instructors. Furthermore, instructors face barriers to adopting interactive techniques within their classroom due to student reception, resources, and awareness. We argue that the advancement of computer science education, in terms of propagation and sustainability of student-centered teaching, requires guided approaches for incremental instructional changes as opposed to revolutionary pedagogy. This requires the prioritization of lightweight techniques that can fit within existing lecture formats to enable instructors to overcome barriers hindering the adoption of interactive techniques. Furthermore, such techniques and innovations must be documented in the form of computing education research artifacts, building upon the practices of software artifacts.","Kacsmar, Bailey",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-11-17,David R.

Metal-organic frameworks’ tricks in asymmetric catalysis,"Asymmetric catalysis plays an irreplaceable role in the fields of pharmaceuticals, biomaterials, pesticides, and chiral optics. Due to the lessons from the specific catalysis occurring inside enzyme pockets, chiral metal-organic frameworks (CMOFs) are conceived as promising candidates for subtly modulating asymmetric catalysis performances. In this review, we first discuss an overview of the design and construction strategies of CMOFs that are essential to discern their versatile tricks in asymmetric catalysis. More importantly, a thoughtful discussion concerning CMOFs’ tricks in performance regulations of asymmetric catalysis is presented, including chiral pore environment decoration, metal node variation, crystal phase controlment, and nanostructure engineering. In addition, challenges and opportunities in this fundamental and cutting-edge research are also provided based on our own perspectives to attract more research interests and efforts in the future.","Guo, Jun;Lian, Ye;Li, Fangfang;Duan, Yulong;Xue, Xiaomin;Long, Chang;Zhang, Yin;Tang, Zhiyong",Journal,Chem Catalysis,2022-11-17,Tiangong University;National Center for Nanoscience and Technology Beijing;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,asymmetric catalysis ;  chiral ;  metal-organic framework ;  SDG9: Industry innovation and infrastructure ;  stereoselectivity

"Technoeconomic and environmental perspectives of biofuel production from sugarcane bagasse: Current status, challenges and future outlook","Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is an attractive lignocellulose feedstock for biofuel production due to its high organic content and biomass yield, and ease of collection and storage. SCB-based biofuel production through the biochemical route is considered to be an eco-friendly option. However, the sustainability of this green technology is still questionable for some technoeconomic challenges associated with the pretreatment, detoxification, microbial tolerance to inhibitors, and conversion of SCB hydrolysates into biofuels. Researchers have attempted to overcome these issues, particularly by developing cost-effective pretreatment methods and engineered strains capable of tolerating inhibitors and converting SCB-derived components more efficiently. This review aims to present the current status and challenges in the conversion of SCB into biofuels like biohydrogen, biomethane, biomethanol, bioethanol, and biobutanol. The major economic and environmental perspectives are also discussed to assess the economics and eco-friendliness of SCB as the feedstocks for biofuel production. In addition, this paper also highlights existing knowledge gaps that might inspire the readers to fine-tune their research, innovations, and business plan for the development of cost-effective technologies for SCB-based biofuel production.","Pan, Shiyou;Zabed, Hossain M.;Wei, Yutuo;Qi, Xianghui",Journal,Industrial Crops and Products,2022-11-15,Guangxi University;Jiangsu University,Biochemical conversion route ;  Bioenergy ;  Bioprocess engineering ;  Biorefinery ;  Lignocellulosic biomass
Research on the impact mechanism of heterogeneous environmental regulation on enterprise green technology innovation,"Green technology innovation (GTI) is an effective way to promote the green development of economy, and government environmental regulations are an important means to encourage enterprises to carry out GTI. Taking Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2010 to 2019 as samples, this paper divides environmental regulations into three categories: command-based environmental regulation (ER1), market-based environmental regulation (ER2) and voluntary environmental regulation (ER3), studies their impact on enterprise GTI, and discusses the joint effect of enterprise research and development (R&D) investment and government support from the perspective of internal and external linkage of enterprises. In addition, this paper also analyzes the compound effect and time effect of environmental regulation. The research conclusions are as follows: (1) From the perspective of policy types, both ER1 and ER 2 could stimulate enterprises to carry out GTI, and the promotion effect of green utility model patents is slightly higher than that of green invention patents. ER3 inhibits enterprise GTI. In addition, this paper finds that the effect of three environmental regulations acting at the same time is greater than that of one of them. (2) The mechanism analysis shows that the R&D investment of enterprise positively could moderate the relationship between ER2 and green invention at the significance level of 5%, positively moderate the relationship between ER2 and green utility model patent at the significance level of 1%, and negatively moderate the relationship between ER3 and green utility model patent at the significance level of 5%. The government support could moderate the relationship between environmental regulation and green utility model patents at the significance level of 5% and 10%. (3) The effect analysis shows that the transformation rate of GTI in China needs to be improved. The three environmental regulations could have an effect on enterprise GTI in a short period, and ER1 has the fastest effect. (4) Considering the differences in the level of economic development and resource endowments in various regions of China, this paper classifies the sample enterprises and finds that the impact of environmental regulation on enterprise GTI is heterogeneous in terms of location, ownership nature, factor density and industry type. The research results provide the important reference for the formulation and implementation of environmental regulation policies according to local conditions.","Wang, Liping;Long, Ying;Li, Chuang",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2022-11-15,Jimei University,Environmental regulation ;  Green technological innovation ;  Heterogeneity ;  Moderating effect ;  Transformation rate of innovation achievements
Research on Micro Flow Measurement Method Based on Pipeline Pressure Wave,"In recent years, with the continuous development of science and technology, the accuracy requirements for flow measurement are also constantly improving. The development of micro flow measurement technology plays a driving role in biomedicine, chemical engineering, semiconductor manufacturing and other fields. In this paper, the relationship between the fluid velocity in the pipe and its pressure on the pipe wall is used to sense the pressure wave generated by the fluid flowing through the pipe through the piezoelectric film, and then measure the small flow in the pipe. A pressure sensitive element was made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric film, and a real flow experimental platform was built. By processing the voltage signal with flow information collected from the real flow experiment, the voltage fluctuation amplitudes corresponding to 9 flow measurement points are obtained. The flow voltage amplitude characteristic curve is obtained through curve fitting, and the flow measurement sensitivity, relative error and repeatability are calculated. The real flow experiment results verify the feasibility of the micro flow measurement method based on pressure wave. The research of this method is an innovation of micro flow detection method, which has important practical significance.","Yuan, Jinlai;Kang, Xirui;Wang, Yiwen;Shi, Huichao;Arman, Samaneh",Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2022-11-14,"The University of Georgia, Tbilisi;Beijing University of Chemical Technology;ShaanXI Electronics Institute",Flow measurement ;  micro flow ;  pressure wave ;  PVDF

Intimate Narratives: An Assets-Based Approach to Develop Holistic Perspectives of Student Mothers' Lives and Their Use of Technology in Parenting,"This paper details our collaborative approach in capturing a holistic understanding of parental technology use through an assets-based framework. We steer the focus away from the design of technology as the central force of technological innovation, and instead support participants to reflect and describe intimate details that highlight specific use-contexts of technology in their lives. We leverage a group of foreign graduate student mothers' self-described unique strengths to gain an in-depth account of their lived experiences with technology. As research participants and co-authors, our collaborators elicit intimate narratives about meaningful events in their lives, bringing social and cultural aspects of their lived experience to the forefront, and thus providing broader context of their use of technology. We detail and reflect upon our approach of promoting user agency by creating an affinity group, fostering a safe and intimate space for research engagement, and describe the implications of using our adapted research methodology in intimate settings. We conclude by highlighting the various ways in which technology facilitates foreign student parenting, as well as the ways in which it serves as a temporary band-aid solution, prompting consideration of larger social issues.","Bhatti, Neelma;Mbakwe, Amarachi Blessing;Nnadi, Sandra;Clarke, Geetha Saarunya;Gautam, Aakash;McCrickard, D.

Best Practices of Bioinspired Design: Key Themes and Challenges,"Bioinspired design (BID) is an interdisciplinary research field that can lead to innovations to solve technical problems. There have been many attempts to develop a framework to de-silo engineering and biology and implement processes to enable BID. In January of 2022, we organized a symposium at the 2022 Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology Annual Meeting to bring together educators and practitioners of BID. The symposium aimed to (a) consolidate best practices in teaching bioinspiration, (b) create and sustain effective multidisciplinary teams, (c) summarize best approaches to conduct problem-based or solution-driven fundamental research, and (d) bring BID innovations to market. During the symposium, several themes emerged. Here we highlight three critical themes that need to be addressed for BID to become a truly interdisciplinary strategy that benefits all stakeholders and results in innovation. First, there is a need for a usable methodology that leads to proper abstraction of biological principles for engineering design. Second, the utilization of engineering models to test biological hypotheses is essential for the continued engagement of biologists in BID. Third, there is a necessity of proven team-science strategies that will lead to successful collaborations between engineers and biologists. Accompanying this introduction is a variety of perspectives and research articles highlighting best practices in BID research and product development and guides that can highlight the challenges and facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations in the field of BID.","Wissa, Aimy;Alleyne, Marianne;Barley, William C.;Suarez, Andrew V.",Journal,Integrative and Comparative Biology,2022-11-01,School of Engineering and Applied Science;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,
A Review of Lightweight Design for Space Mirror Core Structure: Tradition and Future,"With the continuous improvement of the imaging quality requirement of the space optical system, the large-aperture mirror becomes the research focus. However, the increase of the aperture will increase the whole weight which results in high launch cost and degrades the mirror surface figure accuracy. Therefore, the lightweight design method of the mirror structure is of great importance. In recent years, many space telescope system schemes have demonstrated the progress of the structural lightweight design of mirrors, such as Spitzer, SOFIA, JWST, etc. This article reviews the main content and innovations of the research on the structural designs of mirrors including conventional machining designs and topology optimization structures. Meanwhile, some emerging designs (e.g., lattices and Voronoi structures) considering additive manufacturing (AM) are also introduced. Several key elements of different structural design approaches for lightweight mirrors are discussed and compared, such as material, lightweight ratio, design methods, surface figure, etc. Finally, future challenges, trends, and prospects of lightweight design for mirrors are discussed. This article provides a reference for further related research and engineering applications.","Zhang, Changhao;Li, Zongxuan",Journal,Machines,2022-11-01,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences;Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences,additive manufacturing technology ;  lightweight structure ;  mirror ;  topology optimization ;  Voronoi diagram

"Stoneless fruit cultivars: past, present and future perspectives with special reference to economically important Ziziphus species","Fruit pits are composed of the seed and the hard woody substance (or stone). Consumers want to bite into a perfectly ripe fruit without having to worry about how to get rid of the hidden pit. That is why consumers and processors both regard the stone to be an annoyance. As fruit trees are propagated vegetatively, and the seeds are not consumed, the pits are considered agricultural waste by the processing industry and must be disposed of, usually by burning. Pitless (without seed and stone) fruit cultivars would be a superior product that would increase consumption of these nutrient-dense foods (fruits) while also providing a higher income to farmers. Luther Burbank, a visionary breeder, sought to produce stoneless plums for the first time in the early 1900s, using a partly stoneless wild-type plum. Through breeding, he was able to produce better fruit quality with the stoneless trait and even discovered lines without seeds, but he was unable to completely eradicate the stone. In Burbank's attempt to improve plum production, he left an important heritage by demonstrating that the stone may be almost eliminated without sacrificing fruit quality or quantity. Considering the prevailing need for convenience foods (seedless fruit like citrus, grapes, etc.), and enhanced understanding of genetics and breeding innovations, breeders should pick up where Mr. Burbank left off in the production of a better than “nearly perfect” stoneless plum. To date, naturally occurring stoneless fruit cultivars in both Ziziphus jujuba and Z. mauritiana have been identified. Recent technology (like multi-omics, molecular markers, genetic engineering, and accelerated breeding cycles) should be applied to achieve a completely stoneless/seedless high-quality fruit in the cultivated species of Ziziphus Mill. Furthermore, the period necessary for endocarp formation should be defined by assessing the gene expression of several transcription factors involved in the formation of endocarp cells. According to new research, fruit stones contain relatively high amounts of lignin therefore the gene should be targeted for genetic engineering to decrease the level of lignification.","Muhammad, N.;Zhao, Z.

The scholarship of teaching and learning: Understanding the concept and its application in academic programs and emergency management,"For years, education has gone through transformation and incorporated innovation to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning. The scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) is one such activity that transforms and innovates education to engineer effectiveness. SoTL is internationally accepted and applied in Education, Psychology, Management Science, Chemistry, History, English, Sociology, Communication Studies, Mathematics, Engineering, Medicine, and Interdisciplinary Programs with a growing interest in Emergency Management and Homeland Security (EMHS). In relation to the EMHS programs, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) SoTL Special Interest Group members have participated in the American Educational Research Association annual meetings and then shared the relevance of the SoTL concept with the EM scholars, researchers, and practitioners at the FEMA Higher Education programs.1-4 Thus, the concept of SoTL cuts across academic barriers with methodological pluralism in educational practice. In addition, the success of SoTL has been driven with the publication of two edited volumes of Carnegie Scholars works: (1) Opening Lines: Approaches to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning5 and (2) Disciplinary Styles in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning: Exploring Common Ground.6 However, even with these advances, there are some concerns about SoTL critiques. One such critique comes from Boshier who asserts that SoTL is a difficult academic concept to be accepted by the academic community.7 Criticisms notwithstanding, there are many benefits due to SoTL. Its future is bright and encouraging as nations benefit from SoTL s educational transformative and innovative power.","Peters, Ekong J.;Onuegbu, Ugonma Benita;McEntire, David A.",Journal,Journal of Emergency Management,2022-11-01,Utah Valley University;Arkansas Tech University,"Scholarship of teaching and learning, concept, emergency management, higher education, innovation, teaching, learning, transformation, scholarship"
Application of TRIZ Innovative System Method in Rapid Assembly of Folding Chairs,"This design activity is an innovative method of rapid assembly system for folding chairs. The research methods used in this study included literature analysis, TRIZ the method, human factors engineering (HFE), universal design, and IPA. First, the design of the folding chair and the layout of the literature related to the chair are analyzed. The contradiction matrix was used in the TRIZ method to find the principle of invention and analyze it, to provide a reference for the innovative design of folding chairs, and then use the relevant literature on materials to help design and select materials quickly. Next, the chair is assembled and unfolded and universal design is applied to design it into an acceptable product, causing it to be more popular. The human–machine interaction with HFE makes the design of rapid assembly and the design of folding chairs faster and safer. Finally, the IPA method is used to understand the subjective feelings of customers on the products of this research and the satisfaction and importance are used as the basis for evaluation; a two-dimensional matrix graph is drawn. After drawing a simulation using drawing software, it is compared with the traditional folding chair and the research results are as follows: (1) Quick unfolding function: use the pull ring upwards and it naturally unfolds downwards by gravity. (2) Quick folding and storage function: use the foot pedal, single-foot operation, and the folding chair can be quickly stored. (3) Rapid transportation and unfolding function: The chair back can be connected with other chair backs and has the functions of quick unfolding and quick storage, so as to realize the quick placement of the folding chair. This design activity realizes the preliminary design concept and design simulation of the product design through a systematic and innovative method. Through this design activity, we can understand the problems existing in product improvement before product development, so as to conduct market research and production cost assessment in the actual mass production later, and further reduce the cost of product design improvement.","Yao, Kai Chao;Li, Kuo Yi;Xu, Jing Ran;Ho, Wei Sho;Shen, Yu Hao",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-11-01,National Taichung University of Science and Technology;National Chin-Yi University of Technology;National Changhua University of Education;Ltd;Society of Innovative Education and Technology,exhibition chair ;  folding chair ;  human factors engineering design ;  TRIZ ;  universal design
The Effect of Energy Quota Trading on Energy Saving in China: Insight from a Quasi-Natural Experiment,"Saving energy is an important strategy to address the current energy crisis and environmental degradation. Regarding the pilot policy of the energy quota trading as a quasi-natural experiment by employing a difference-in-differences method, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of this pilot policy on energy saving and its mechanisms based on city-level data in China from 2006 to 2020. We find that the energy quota trading policy can reduce the total energy consumption and energy consumption intensity of pilot cities, and the effect of the policy can gradually strengthen over time. The market-oriented reform of energy factor allocation can effectively promote energy saving and economic growth. These results are convincing through a series of robustness checks. The heterogeneity test shows that the energy quota trading has a significant energy saving effect on economically developed cities, densely populated cities and southern cities, but not in economically underdeveloped cities, sparsely populated cities and northern cities. Further mechanism inspection suggests that the pilot policy of energy quota trading mainly achieves energy conservation through industrial structure upgrading and green technology innovation. Our findings provide a valuable insight for China to control energy consumption and promote the high-quality development of the energy economy.","Liao, Liping;Huang, Chukun;Du, Minzhe",Journal,Energies,2022-11-01,Guangdong University of Finance & Economics;South China Normal University,difference-in-differences method ;  energy quota trading ;  energy saving ;  green technology innovation ;  industrial structure upgrading
Comparative Study on International Research Hotspots and National-Level Policy Keywords of Dynamic Disaster Monitoring and Early Warning in China (2000–2021),"For more than 20 years, disaster dynamic monitoring and early warning have achieved orderly and sustainable development in China, forming a systematic academic research system and top-down policy design, which are inseparable from the research of China’s scientific community and the promotion of government departments. In the past, most of the research on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning focused on specific research in a certain field, scene, and discipline, while a few studies focused on research review or policy analysis, and few studies combined macro and meso research reviews in academia with national policy analysis for comparative analysis. It is necessary and urgent to explore the interaction between scholars’ research and policy deployment, which can bring theoretical contributions and policy references to the top-down design, implementation promotion, and academic research of China’s dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. Based on 608 international research articles on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning published by Chinese scholars from 2000–2021 and 187 national policy documents published during this period, this paper conducts a comparative analysis between the knowledge maps of international research hotspots and the co-occurrence maps of policy keywords on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. The research shows that in the stage of initial development (2000–2007), international research articles are few and focused, and research hotspots are somewhat alienated from policy keywords. In the stage of rising development (2008–2015), after the Wenchuan earthquake, research hotspots are closely related to policy keywords, mainly in the fields of geology, engineering disasters, meteorological disasters, natural disasters, etc. Meanwhile, research hotspots also focus on cutting-edge technologies and theories, while national-level policy keywords focus more on overall governance and macro promotion, but the two are gradually closely integrated. In the stage of rapid development (2016–2021), with the continuous attention and policy promotion of the national government, the establishment of the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the gradual establishment and improvement of the disaster early warning and monitoring system, research hotspots and policy keywords are integrated and overlapped with each other, realizing the organic linkage and mutual promotion between academic research and political deployment. The motivation, innovation, integration, and transformation of dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning are promoted by both policy and academic research. The institutions that issue policies at the national level include the State Council and relevant departments, the Ministry of Emergency Management, the Ministry of Water Resources, and other national ministries and commissions. The leading affiliated institutions of scholars’ international research include China University of Mining and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, and other institutions. The disciplines involved are mainly multidisciplinary geosciences, environmental sciences, electrical and electronic engineering, remote sensing, etc. It is worth noting that in the past two to three years, research and policies focusing on COVID-19, public health, epidemic prevention, environmental governance, and emergency management have gradually increased.","Gao, Jie;Zhang, Wu;Yang, Chunbaixue;Wang, Rui;Shao, Shuai;Li, Jiawei;Zhang, Limiao;Li, Zhijian;Liu, Shu;Si, Wentao",Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022-11-01,Hunan University of Finance and Economics;Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute Chinese Academy of Fishery Science;Shandong University;Tsinghua University;Shandong Normal University;Anhui University,disaster prevention and mitigation ;  dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning ;  emergency management ;  knowledge map visualization ;  policy document quantification ;  policy keyword ;  research hotspot

"Regenerative Dentistry in Pakistan: Awareness, Challenges, and Advancements among General Dental Practitioners and Specialists","Objective Regenerative dentistry has developed a revolutionary advancement in dentistry worldwide. However, significant research still needs to be taken to overcome the challenges in Pakistan. The objective of this study is to evaluate the understanding of general and specialist dentists toward different grafts and their resources during surgical procedures. Materials and Methods A questionnaire was disseminated for our survey-based study, emailed the soft copy, and distributed the hard copies among 400 general dental practitioners (GDPs) and specialists throughout Pakistan to evaluate the types of grafts used to cover bone or soft tissue defects. Out of 400 GDPs and dental specialists, 200 participants returned the completed questionnaires. Results Nearly 200 dental surgeons participated from different regions of Pakistan. Most of the GDPs and specialists in Pakistan are not well aware of tissue-engineered grafts and their role in dentistry. The frequency of utilizing a patient's oral fibroblast to generate the collagen is 5.5%. Most of the GDPs are not aware of the resource of bony spicules if utilized which is 49.5%. Consequently, the use of regenerated tissue (oral) grafts is significantly overlooked in Pakistan (p < 0.001). Conclusion Tissue engineering is an extremely encouraging area of reparative biology that attracts the latest innovation in maxillofacial surgery, oral pathology, implantology, cellular and molecular biology, chemistry, and physiology.","Khan, Erum;Soomro, Azeem Hussain;Saleem, Muhammad;Siyal, Zahid Hussain;Ali, Sabir;Khurshid, Zohaib",Journal,European Journal of General Dentistry,2022-11-01,University of Science & Technology of Fujairah;Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences;Dow University of Health Sciences Pakistan;King Faisal University;Stamford Dental Care NHS and Private,cell culture ;  dental grafts ;  oral lesions ;  regeneration ;  repair ;  tissue engineering

The policy effect on photovoltaic technology innovation with regional heterogeneity in China,"This paper examines the policy effect on photovoltaic technology innovation by considering regional heterogeneity. We first evaluated regional heterogeneity by using a range-adjusted measure model, based on which a total of 238 prefecture-level cities in China were classified into four categories. The impact of supply-side, environmental-side, and demand-side policy instruments on PV technology innovation were assessed for each type of cities. The results show significant differences in the policy effects across different types of cities. Specifically, only the direct government subsidy in the supply-side and the feed-in tariff in the environmental-side had a clear incentive for PV technology innovation in all type of cities. The non-direct subsidy instruments in the supply-side were not conducive to PV technology innovation in cities with low levels of economic development and innovation capacity. In addition, the environmental-side regulatory policy instrument favored PV technology innovation in cities with high levels of economic development, population size, and innovation capacity, but goal-oriented instrument had the opposite effect. Moreover, the government purchase in the demand-side had a significantly positive effect on technology innovation in cities with abundant solar energy resources, and average levels of economic development and innovation capacity.","Che, Xiao Jing;Zhou, P.;Wang, M.",Journal,Energy Economics,2022-11-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Demand-side policy ;  Environmental-side policy ;  Regional heterogeneity ;  Supply-side policy ;  Technology innovation

In this article, we report both the latest regulatory requirements which aim to ensure safety and efficacy for patients while encouraging innovation of the medical device industry, and the key programs on medical devices covered in the Regulatory Science Action Plan (RSAP) of the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA). The main features of the revised regulations are first elucidated before the opportunities for translational research are interpreted, including those for additive manufacturing and customized devices, drug–device combination products, artificial intelligence-powered software and surgical robots, and nanomaterials for medical devices. Finally, a regulatory perspective is provided to researchers who expect to translate their technologies in the Chinese medical device market. Important issues including early attention to critical market and clinical needs, understanding the true principle and spirit underlying the changing regulations and standards, and protecting intellectual property rights with comprehensive measures, are discussed. These developments warrant further investigations into the distinct role of regulatory science in shaping medical devices research and development.","Song, Xu;Hu, Minxia;Li, Bin;Zhang, Kai;Zhang, Xingdong;Wang, Lanming",Journal,Journal of Orthopaedic Translation,2022-11-01,National Medical Products Administration;Sichuan University;Soochow University,Biocompatibility ;  Efficacy ;  Medical devices ;  Regulatory science ;  Safety
Accelerating efficiency of green technology innovation on carbon mitigation under low-carbon regulation,"According to the transaction cost theory for carbon mitigation, green technology innovation must achieve energy conservation and emission reduction through appropriate low-carbon regulation. As a consequence, this study compared the punishment effect of the carbon tax and the reward effect of carbon subsidy on the performance of green technology innovation in China's provincial industries from 2006 to 2017. We also elucidated that the enterprises’ green technology innovation restricts and stimulates the role of low-carbon regulation on green efficiency in the case of the double threshold effect of carbon dioxide emission. Based on this framework, the integrated tax-subsidy policy for carbon mitigation has a significant differential effect on green efficiency, which changed from an inhibition effect in the high-carbon stage to a promotion effect in the low-carbon stage. And the validity of low-carbon regulations increases with the reduction degree of carbon dioxide emission. But it all depends on whether low-carbon regulations stimulate the enterprises’ willingness to green technology innovation, and whether innovations generate incentives that both increase carbon dioxide emissions and compensate for their innovation cost. Otherwise, enterprise performance should adopt follow strategy more than green technology innovation. Therefore, we further suggested that offsetting the costs of green technology innovation through carbon subsidies would improve the willingness of enterprises to make technological progress and increase the likelihood of carbon reductions which can help the peak in China's carbon emissions.","Ding, Youqiang;Hu, Yufeng",Journal,Energy Reports,2022-11-01,Tongling University,Carbon mitigation ;  Green efficiency ;  Green technology innovation ;  Low-carbon regulation
How does information and communication technology affect renewable energy technology innovation? International evidence,"Renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) has become a key factor in mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable development of the world economy, but there is no literature on the effect of information and communication technology (ICT) on RETI and its impact mechanism. This paper measures RETI using panel data for 70 countries from 2005 to 2019 based on the combination of diffusion and depreciation effects of technological innovation and systematically examines the direct and mediating mechanisms of ICT's effect on RETI. The results show that ICT significantly contributes to RETI and even holds after addressing endogeneity, replacing the explanatory or explanatory variables, excluding extreme values, and excluding the effects of the financial crisis. The results of the transmission mechanism analysis indicate that ICT affects RETI through human capital accumulation, financial development, and information disclosure, meaning that human capital, financial development, and information disclosure are important mediating transmission mechanisms. The results of heterogeneity analysis note significant economic organizational heterogeneity and innovation environment heterogeneity of ICT to RETI. Specifically, in IEA and OECD member nations as well as in the high renewable energy consumption and high R&D investment groups, the contribution effect of ICT on RETI is more significant.","Lee, Chien Chiang;He, Zhi Wen;Xiao, Fu",Journal,Renewable Energy,2022-11-01,Nanchang University,Green finance ;  Information and communication technology (ICT) ;  Renewable energy technology innovation (RETI)
Landscape of Brazilian research and development public funding in advanced therapies: lessons learned and a roadmap for middle-income economies,"Background aims: Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) have reached the forefront of biotechnological innovation, partly due to public funders’ efforts in the early stages of research and development (R&D). Data on investment in R&D of ATMPs are recognized as scarce, particularly in developing countries. Because of the numerous peculiarities of the Brazilian health system and the science and technology (S&T) system, the country is a good example for the evaluation of public investments in R&D of ATMPs. The aim of this study is to analyze the evolution of investments made by the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Brazil and partners in the ATMP field between 2004 and 2020. Methods: A descriptive analysis was performed based on secondary data. The analysis was based on S&T and innovation research and support for research infrastructure in the field. The database was stratified by year of funding, ATMP type, type of study or research infrastructure project, amount invested in the project, targeted disease for which clinical trials in ATMPs were developed and financing sector (health, education, S&T and economic). Results: The investments coordinated by MoH (61.5%) in partnership with the S&T, education and economic sectors (38.5%) consisted of Int$137.35 million in 282 ATMP projects. Funding included S&T and innovation research (67% of the total amount) and projects to implement or maintain infrastructure in selected research centers (32.98%). With regard to global convergence, cell therapy was the type of ATMP that most benefited from public investment, totaling 82.23% of the total funding in the analyzed period. Cardiology (29%) and neurology (21%) were the main focus of clinical trials. Following the global trend of public sector R&D funding, the number of basic and pre-clinical research projects represented 78.06% of the total number of projects. Conclusions: Despite the need to implement improvements in ATMP R&D financing policy in Brazil, the country has made important steps in the field and can serve as a benchmark for other countries with socioeconomic similarities. Among the main lessons are the prioritization of research aligned with the health needs of the population, cross-sector articulation by the health policymaker to coordinate R&D efforts of the sector and formulation of a specific sector policy (Programa Genomas Brasil, the Brazilian National Program of Genomic and Precision Medicine) to promote knowledge translation.","Sachetti, Camile Giaretta;Júnior, Augusto Barbosa;de Carvalho, Antonio Carlos Campos;Angulo-Tuesta, Antonia;da Silva, Everton Nunes",Journal,Cytotherapy,2022-11-01,Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz;Universidade de Brasília;Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,advanced therapy medicinal products ;  ATMPs ;  Brazil ;  public funding ;  R&D
"Development of a novel dementia risk prediction model in the general population: A large, longitudinal, population-based machine-learning study","Background: The existing dementia risk models are limited to known risk factors and traditional statistical methods. We aimed to employ machine learning (ML) to develop a novel dementia prediction model by leveraging a rich-phenotypic variable space of 366 features covering multiple domains of health-related data. Methods: In this longitudinal population-based cohort of the UK Biobank (UKB), 425,159 non-demented participants were enrolled from 22 recruitment centres across the UK between March 1, 2006 and October 31, 2010. We implemented a data-driven strategy to identify predictors from 366 candidate variables covering a comprehensive range of genetic and environmental factors and developed the ML model to predict incident dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) within five, ten, and much longer years (median 11.9 [Interquartile range 11.2–12.5] years). Findings: During a follow-up of 5,023,337 person-years, 5287 and 2416 participants developed dementia and AD, respectively. A novel UKB dementia risk prediction (UKB-DRP) model comprising ten predictors including age, ApoE ε4, pairs matching time, leg fat percentage, number of medications taken, reaction time, peak expiratory flow, mother's age at death, long-standing illness, and mean corpuscular volume was established. Our prediction model was internally evaluated based on five-fold cross-validation on discrimination and calibration, and it was further compared with existing prediction scales. The UKB-DRP model can achieve high discriminative accuracy in dementia (AUC 0.848 ± 0.007) and even better in AD (AUC 0.862 ± 0.015). The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value = 0.92), and the predictive power was solid in different incidence time groups. More importantly, our model presented an apparent superiority over existing models like Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia Risk Score (AUC 0.705 ± 0.008), the Dementia Risk Score (AUC 0.752 ± 0.007), and the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (AUC 0.584 ± 0.017). The model was internally validated in the general population of European ancestry and White ethnicity; thus, further validation with independent datasets is necessary to confirm these findings. Interpretation: Our ML-based UKB-DRP model incorporated ten easily accessible predictors with solid predictive power for incident dementia and AD within five, ten, and much longer years, which can be used to identify individuals at high risk of dementia and AD in the general population. Funding: This study was funded by grants from the Science and Technology Innovation 2030 Major Projects (2022ZD0211600), National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1312904, 2019YFA070950), National Natural Science Foundation of China (282071201, 81971032, 82071997), Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (2018SHZDZX01), Research Start-up Fund of Huashan Hospital (2022QD002), Excellence 2025 Talent Cultivation Program at Fudan University (3030277001), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (21QA1408700), Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University (yg2021-013), and the 111 Project (No. B18015).","You, Jia;Zhang, Ya Ru;Wang, Hui Fu;Yang, Ming;Feng, Jian Feng;Yu, Jin Tai;Cheng, Wei",Journal,eClinicalMedicine,2022-11-01,Fudan University;Zhejiang Normal University;Zhangjiang Fudan International Innovation Center,Alzheimer's disease ;  Dementia ;  Machine learning ;  Prediction model ;  UK biobank
"Research, inventiveness and biotechnological advances in the production of value-added alkaloids occurring in tropical species","Alkaloids are compounds with wide occurrence in plant species and have been used for thousands of years for medicinal purposes. Industries demand high amounts of these metabolites and their improved production has been achieved due to recent advances in biotechnological techniques. In order to verify the scenario of studies and innovation in alkaloids occurring in tropical species, we surveyed in the Scopus and Espacenet databases, all research papers and patents on this theme. Our survey highlighted that at least 109 families and 481 tropical species were examined for the presence of alkaloids in the last 24 years. In addition, we found that approximately 3,400 patents have been filed in the last 20 years. However, contributions from tropical countries are lower than those from countries outside the region. Finally, we highlight the effort within the most varied biotechnological approaches that have been used to produce and increase the concentration of alkaloids in tropical plants. Although many advances have been made in recent years, challenges such as elucidating pathways in different species, adapting new techniques, discovering new expression vectors with greater compatibility, and elicitation studies for the production of alkaloids in tropical plants still need to be resolved and discussed by the scientific community.","Carréra, Jéfyne Campos;Ucella-Filho, João Gilberto Meza;de Andrade, Camila Moreno Lopes;Stein, Vanessa Cristina;Mori, Fabio Akira",Journal,South African Journal of Botany,2022-11-01,Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo;Universidade Federal de Lavras,Bioactive compounds ;  Elicitors ;  Pathway engineering ;  Tissue culture
Blockchain technology for sustainable education,"Blockchain—a digitally distributed, decentralised, peer-to-peer shared ledger technology that exists across a delimited network—is recognised as a disruptive technology for the next socioeconomic mega trend. Most of the researchers in education theoretically speculate upon blockchain's extraordinary potentials for enterprises, finance, administration, and management of education. Little attention has been paid, however, to the problems of socially inclusive knowledge transformation, sustainability, and equitable access to quality education for marginalised communities. This paper aims to describe an approach and method for leveraging education blockchain as a possible means to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the social inclusion of marginalised communities of teachers and learners. This theoretical paper adopts a reflective research approach to critically analyse the current state of blockchain applications in education, and discuss its prospects for building educational commons for sustainable development. This paper contributes to the field of educational technology by exploring blockchain's prospects to building educational commons through four strategies: (a) network cooperation; (b) diversity of interacting agents; (c) shared resources; and (d) educational logistics. It also contributes to the conceptualisation of knowledge transformation for sustainable education by modelling blockchain-supported educational commons and informing educational practitioners and technological innovation policy makers. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralised, peer-to-peer shared ledger technology that can be adopted across education networks. Blockchain is regarded as a disruptive technology and a key driver of the next socioeconomic mega trend. The extant literature on blockchain in education are technology-centred and limited to applications in financing, administration, and management of education. Blockchain's potential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in education and in favour of marginalised communities remain unexplored. What this paper adds A critique of the mainstream literature and its utilitarian and business-oriented paradigm for leveraging blockchain technology in education. An operational definition of ‘education blockchain’ as a set of affordances of a blockchain technology that empowers educators and learners to achieve sustainability of their education system. Conceptualisation of a ‘sustainable education blockchain’ for the knowledge transformation of marginalised communities. A framework of blockchain for building educational commons through network cooperation, diversity of interactive agents, shared resources and educational logistics. Implications for practice and/or policy This paper calls for re-orienting blockchain technology in education from pro-profit to human-centred adoption. This is to ensure a balance among technological advances, knowledge transformation, and safeguarding of privacy and individual rights of marginalised teachers and learners. Sustainable blockchain technology is for the social inclusion of marginalised teachers and learners by means of secure and trusted peer-to-peer collaboration, autonomous community organisation and fair distribution of resources. This paper contributes to the conceptualisation of knowledge transformation for sustainable education by (a) modelling the key features of blockchain-supported educational commons; and (b) informing educational practitioners and innovation policy makers who are interested in blockchain applications. The model contributes to the understanding of an authentic and humanistic knowledge transformation beyond its dominant notion of an instrumental, linear, purely technological driver of educational systems. The model allows us to envisage a more sustainable transformation in educational practices.","Savelyeva, Tamara;Park, Jae",Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2022-11-01,The Education University of Hong Kong,blockchain technology ;  education commons ;  educational inclusion ;  marginalised communities ;  SDGs ;  sustainable education ;  teaching and learning
"Green technology innovation, environmental externality, and the cleaner upgrading of industrial structure in China — Considering the moderating effect of environmental regulation","Under the requirements of high-quality development of China's economy, how to impel the industrial structure towards a cleaner upgrading path becomes a matter of urgency. Various studies have investigated the role of technology innovation in industrial restructuring and upgrading, however, generally been conducted under the framework of the traditional economic research paradigm which solely aims at economic expansion and economic growth but ignores the extensive consumption of energy and the increasing environmental costs. This study seeks to fill the gap in research by expanding the traditional measurement of industrial upgrading, and further discovering the internal logic between green technology innovation, environmental regulation and the cleaner upgrading of industrial structure in the context of China. Based on empirical regressions on a panel data from China's 35 industrial sectors during 2002–2019, our results have evidenced that green technology innovation is a valid driving force in facilitating the cleaner upgrading except for the Low value-added & Cleaner (LC) sectors. Environmental regulation presents negative direct impacts on industries' cleaner upgrading; while given the obvious industrial heterogeneity, the moderating effects of environmental regulation appear to be quite complex. These findings provide an important policy basis for the formulation of green transformation strategies of China's industries.","Xie, Ronghui;Teo, Thompson S.H.",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-11-01,National University of Singapore;Nanjing University of Science and Technology;Fudan University;Decision-Making and Consultation Research Base of Jiangsu Industrial Cluster,China ;  Cleaner upgrading of industrial structure ;  Driving mechanism ;  Environmental regulation ;  Green technology innovation ;  Moderating effect
Applicability of the diffusion of innovation theory to accelerate model-based systems engineering adoption,"Systems engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary domain that can benefit from incorporating contributions from fields not typically associated with technical disciplines, including integrating relevant research from social sciences. The study of innovation has produced the diffusion of innovation theory, which identifies variables that affect the adoption rate of innovations. Of these variables, the perceived attributes of the innovation have been shown to have the most significant impact on the adoption rate of innovations. Shaping the innovation attributes of relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability and how they are perceived can accelerate its adoption rate. This theory has the potential to accelerate the adoption rate of SE innovations. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is an SE innovation that, despite its benefits, has not been adopted generally. An evaluation of the attributes of MBSE as defined by the diffusion of innovation theory can aid in understanding its slow diffusion and inform methods to accelerate its adoption. Since there is some evidence to suggest that this theory is applicable to SE and MBSE, additional research should be conducted to determine the best way to utilize its principles.","Call, Daniel R.;Herber, Daniel R.",Journal,Systems Engineering,2022-11-01,"Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering",adoption rate ;  diffusion of innovation theory ;  innovation ;  model-based systems engineering ;  process improvement ;  systems engineering
Scientific challenges in disaster risk reduction for the Sichuan–Tibet Railway,"Traversing the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, the Sichuan–Tibet Railway is by far the most difficult railway project in the world. The Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau features the most active crustal dynamics on earth, the strongest coupling effects of endogenic and exogenic dynamics, and the environment most sensitive to global climate change. The project area is characterized by extremely cold climate, high elevation and relief, high seismic intensity, high geothermal activity, and high tectonic stress. Consequently, the threat of various disaster risks is ever-present at different stages of the entire life cycle of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway. There is urgent need to systematically study these problems at various levels from the fundamental science to the development of key technologies. This article investigates the different disaster risks recognized during the various stages of construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway project, and summarizes the scientific challenges and technical problems faced in relation to disaster risk prevention and control. This work also introduces the scientific deployment and relevant research progress of the Sichuan–Tibet Fund special project initiated by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Here, we also aim to solve the major fundamental scientific challenges in terms of long-term risk prevention and control during the construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway, and lay a theoretical foundation to promote breakthroughs in the bottleneck of key technologies. The scientific challenges addressed in the study of disaster risk associated with the Sichuan–Tibet Railway include the following: The quantitative assessment of the activity of deep-large faults and strong earthquake prediction, the evolution of physical fields in areas of strong tectonic activity, the development mechanisms of tunnel hazards, the slope evolution processes under coupled endogenic and exogenic dynamics in alpine gorges, the impact of climate change on the formation and evolution of surface hazards, and the evolution of extreme wind fields in deep-cut canyons. The technical problems faced in disaster risk prevention and mitigation in relation to the Sichuan–Tibet Railway are as follows: Advanced identification, monitoring, and early warning of geological disasters in mountainous areas with steep and complex terrain; risk analysis, prevention, and control of railway engineering disasters based on their dynamic processes; tunnel engineering hazard monitoring, early warning, risk analysis, prevention, and control technologies; key technologies for emergency response; and the green and resilient railway system and lifecycle risk management. The Sichuan–Tibet Fund special project will include five key research topics: (1) the interior geological structure and dynamic evolution of the eastern plateau; (2) the hazard-inducing mechanisms of coupled internal and external forces in canyons and gullies within plateaus; (3) the cataclysm mechanics of deeply buried long-distance tunnel engineering; (4) risk identification and projection of major disasters affecting the railway; and (5) the integrated management of scientific innovations and super large-scale railway construction. Systematic research is expected to reveal the evolution of earth surface movements and coupled engineering-disturbance related disasters. It will also enable the formation of a comprehensive risk analysis method for major engineering disasters, and promote the development of green, safe, efficient, and resilient engineering disaster risk reduction technologies that will support the disaster risk management during the entire lifecycle of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway.","Cui, Peng;Ge, Yonggang;Li, Shaojun;Li, Zhenhong;Xu, Xiwei;Zhou, Gordon G.D.;Chen, Huayong;Wang, Hao;Lei, Yu;Zhou, Libo;Yi, Shujian;Wu, Chunhao;Guo, Jian;Wang, Qi;Lan, Hengxing;Ding, Mingtao;Ren, Junjie;Zeng, Lu;Jiang, Yuanjun;Wang, Yan",Journal,Engineering Geology,2022-11-01,"China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chang'an University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences;Institute of Atmospheric Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences;Wuhan Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences;CAS-HEC;Ministry of Emergency Management of China",Geohazard ;  Railway engineering ;  Risk prevention and control ;  Tectonics ;  Tunnel disaster
Soil-structure interaction of a laterally loaded hybrid foundation for offshore wind turbine,"With the ramping up of the capacity of the offshore wind turbine (OWT), the water depth, and the weight of the superstructure, the need of foundation structure with higher performance but reasonable cost demands innovation from geotechnical and structural engineering. The novel hybrid foundation takes advantage of the mature monopile technology, and innovatively integrates a loading wheel-bucket component around the monopile in the upper layer of soil. The addition of the integrated hybrid component is proven to enhance the overall performance of the foundation by previous research. The soil-structure interaction (SSI) of the hybrid foundation is the key to optimize the design of the structure. In this paper, a series of finite element (FE) analysis of the hybrid foundation under monotonic load are performed. The results of the FE analysis are compared with that of the geotechnical centrifuge tests. The soil pressure distributions on the pile and the hybrid component are investigated. The variation of the soil pressure profile with the increase of rotation angle is also studied. The soil resistance on the skirt of the bucket component is illustrated in the analysis. The FE models also prevail the failure mechanism of the hybrid foundation.","Li, Xinyao;Zhang, Min",Journal,Ocean Engineering,2022-11-01,Case School of Engineering;Taiyuan University of Technology,Finite element method ;  Hybrid foundation ;  Offshore wind turbine ;  Soil-structure interaction
The role of international networks in upgrading national innovation systems,"Technological learning within national innovation systems (NIS) stands at the core of technological upgrading at the firm and economy level. The common understanding is that NIS are the primary source of technological knowledge acquisition for innovating firms, but the opening of economies, the globalization of innovation networks, and the rapid internationalization of innovative firms challenge this view – especially with respect to small open economies in transition. We applied PLS-SEM to data from 131 R&D intensive firms responding to a survey investigating the mediating role of international networks for technological learning within Lithuania's NIS. The findings demonstrate a full mediating role of global innovation system networks in facilitating technological learning within NIS, partially contradicting the prevailing understanding of the primary importance of NIS based networks for firm learning. Technological learning of firms, and thus the upgrading of the NIS they are embedded in, relies more on international networks than previously assumed. These results call for a more careful design and facilitation of technological learning networks, recognizing global networks as a complementary and necessary component in NIS upgrading. This study contributes to the literature of technological learning within national innovation systems, with a special focus on R&D intensive firms leading the technological upgrading of a country's NIS.","Petraite, Monika;Mubarak, Muhammad Faraz;Rimantas, Rauleckas;von Zedtwitz, Max",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-11-01,Kaunas University of Technology;Copenhagen Business School,Central Eastern European Economy ;  Collaborative innovation networks ;  International networks ;  National innovation system ;  R&D intensive firm ;  SEM-PLS modelling ;  Technological learning ;  Technology upgrading
Innovations of the UH model associated with a clue of stress–strain chain,"One of the most fundamental issues in geotechnical engineering is deformation calculation. Within the elastoplastic constitutive model framework, a new concept of stress–strain chain is proposed for the analysis of the computational process of plastic strain. The connotation of the chain is then demonstrated through seven stages, starting with six-component stress and ending with six-component plastic strain. The inadequacies of previous research on plastic strain computation induced by several factors such as anisotropy, dilatancy, hardening law, and hardening parameter are evaluated utilizing the stress–strain chain. Meanwhile, based on the stress–strain chain, innovations of the UH model such as the transformed stress method, the unified normalized compression line, and the unified hardening parameter are introduced and validated. It can be seen with the stress–strain chain that plastic volumetric strain and its assignment criterion are the keys to deformation calculation. Representative innovations of the UH model facilitate the efficiency of plastic strain calculation by accurately determining plastic volumetric strain and appropriate ratio relations. Through a foundation pit excavation case, the values and ratios of strain components predicted by the UH model are more reasonable and reliable. This demonstrates that the UH model enhances the accuracy of deformation calculations greatly.","Yao, Yangping;Zhang, Kui",Journal,Transportation Geotechnics,2022-11-01,Beihang University,Dilatancy ;  Soils ;  Stress–strain chain ;  Transformed stress method ;  UH model
What are the roles of green technology innovation and ICT employment in lowering carbon intensity in China? A city-level analysis of the spatial effects,"China is attempting to establish a feasible pattern for boosting economic structural transition, transforming energy structure, improving energy efficiency, and assuming responsibilities in the international community synchronously. This paper aims to investigate the nexus between green technology innovation (GTI), Information and Communication Technology (ICT) employment, and low carbon development. Drawing on the spatial Durbin model and panel data at the city level, I explored the impacts of GTI and ICT in lowering carbon intensity while considering spatial dependence from 2003 to 2017 in China. My empirical findings indicated that GTI and ICT not only play important roles in lowering local carbon intensity but also imposing positive and negative spatial spillover effects from the local cities to their neighboring cities. My examination of the transmission mechanism illustrates this concept except for the direct carbon mitigation impact. As a general-purpose technology, ICT also exerts an indirect effect in lowering carbon intensity via GTI. Heterogeneity tests reveal that both GTI and ICT have greater impacts on Eastern than Middle-Western regions to lower carbon intensity. Thus, policymakers should enhance the multi-dimensional region collaboration, the diffusion strength of informatization, and the absorptive capacity of technological innovation. The empirical evidence of this study also inspires confidence in accelerating industrial transition and optimizing energy structure toward carbon neutrality by boosting the expansion of ICT-related human capital.","Sun, Hongye",Journal,"Resources, Conservation and Recycling",2022-11-01,University of Jinan,Carbon intensity ;  ICT employment ;  Spatial effects ;  Transmission mechanism
Testing research software: a survey,"Background: Research software plays an important role in solving real-life problems, empowering scientific innovations, and handling emergency situations. Therefore, the correctness and trustworthiness of research software are of absolute importance. Software testing is an important activity for identifying problematic code and helping to produce high-quality software. However, testing of research software is difficult due to the complexity of the underlying science, relatively unknown results from scientific algorithms, and the culture of the research software community. Aims: The goal of this paper is to better understand current testing practices, identify challenges, and provide recommendations on how to improve the testing process for research software development. Method: We surveyed members of the research software developer community to collect information regarding their knowledge about and use of software testing in their projects. Results: We analysed 120 responses and identified that even though research software developers report they have an average level of knowledge about software testing, they still find it difficult due to the numerous challenges involved. However, there are a number of ways, such as proper training, that can improve the testing process for research software. Conclusions: Testing can be challenging for any type of software. This difficulty is especially present in the development of research software, where software engineering activities are typically given less attention. To produce trustworthy results from research software, there is a need for a culture change so that testing is valued and teams devote appropriate effort to writing and executing tests.","Eisty, Nasir U.;Carver, Jeffrey C.",Journal,Empirical Software Engineering,2022-11-01,College of Engineering;Department of Computer Science,Research software ;  Software engineering ;  Software testing ;  Survey
How to certify machine learning based safety-critical systems? A systematic literature review,"Context: Machine Learning (ML) has been at the heart of many innovations over the past years. However, including it in so-called “safety-critical” systems such as automotive or aeronautic has proven to be very challenging, since the shift in paradigm that ML brings completely changes traditional certification approaches. Objective: This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question “How to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?”. Method: We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers published between 2015 and 2020, covering topics related to the certification of ML systems. In total, we identified 217 papers covering topics considered to be the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness, Uncertainty, Explainability, Verification, Safe Reinforcement Learning, and Direct Certification. We analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries of the papers extracted. Results: The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of ML models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between academia and industries to deepen the domain study. Finally, it also illustrated the necessity to build connections between the above mentioned main pillars that are for now mainly studied separately. Conclusion: We highlighted current efforts deployed to enable the certification of ML based software systems, and discuss some future research directions.","Tambon, Florian;Laberge, Gabriel;An, Le;Nikanjam, Amin;Mindom, Paulina Stevia Nouwou;Pequignot, Yann;Khomh, Foutse;Antoniol, Giulio;Merlo, Ettore;Laviolette, François",Journal,Automated Software Engineering,2022-11-01,Université Laval;Polytechnique Montréal,Certification ;  Machine learning ;  Safety-critical ;  Systematic literature review
"How Do Table Shape, Group Size, and Gender Affect On-Task Actions in Computer Education Open-Ended Tasks","Contribution: This article presents a study that adds evidence to the field of computer education by focusing on the interaction between shapes of tables, group size, and gender, and their effects on on-task collaborative learning actions. By studying the collaborative learning environment in the context of computer education, the aim is to understand how different on-task actions are affected by the mentioned factors. Background: Previous research on collaborative learning space in the collaborative computer education context with the focus on the group formation, gender aspect, and analysis of on-task actions. Research Questions: Do different table shapes have different effects on open-ended computer education on-task actions for different groups sizes (two and three participants) and for different genders? Methodology: In order to study a collaborative problem-solving activity that is based on creating a prototype of a responsive toy, two main conditions were examined: table shape (round or rectangular) and how this interacts with group size (two or three participants) and gender. University students were engaged in design tasks conducted in small groups following the Jigsaw pattern. Findings: Results show that students engage more in interaction with physical artifacts when collaboration is conducted in dyads. In terms of gender, the analysis shows a tendency of female students to engage more when the activity is conducted in dyads. Furthermore, the combination of a dyad structure and a round table resulted in more discussion and nonverbal interaction.","Vujovic, Milica;Hernandez-Leo, Davinia",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Education,2022-11-01,Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona,Collaborative problem solving ;  engineering education ;  gender ;  group size
Science teacher’s perceptions of the nature of technology: a Q-methodology study,"The aim of the current study was to explore science teachers’ perceptions of the nature of technology through the use of Q methodology. 17 science teachers were sampled as participants, and to explore their perceptions of the nature of technology, they ranked a Q-sort of 36 statements that constituted the following six categories: (i) definition of technology, (ii) the relationship between science and technology, (iii) the impact of society on technology, (iv) the impact of technology on society, (v) the impact of technology on environment, and (vi) the impact of technology on economy. As the participants completed their Q-sort, they were interviewed. Analysis of the participants’ Q-sorts resulted in a three-factor solution, i.e. three distinct patterns of perception about the nature of technology. The three perspectives included teachers who are (i) equally aware of the benefits and drawbacks of technology and the relation of it to science, (ii) optimist about technology and aware of its dependence on society, and (iii) optimist about technological innovations but tempered by technology-driven environmental and social issues. Findings indicated gender and years of professional experience as potential determiners within these perspectives, which needs further research.","Yenilmez Turkoglu, Ayse;Aydin, Fatih;Es, Huseyin",Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2022-11-01,Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University;Sinop Üniversitesi;Bolu Abant İzzet Baysal Üniversitesi,Nature of technology ;  Q methodology ;  Science education ;  Science teachers ;  Technology education
A Unifying Framework for Human-Agent Collaborative Systems - Part II: Design Procedure and Application,"The human-agent collaboration (HAC) is a prospective research topic, whose great applications and future scenarios have attracted vast attention. It is very important to understand the design process of the HAC system (HACS). Inspired by the systematic analysis framework presented in Part I of this dual publication, this article proposes a normalized two-phase procedure, namely, GET-MAN, for the top-level design of HACS from the perspective of system engineering. The two-phase design procedure can produce a coherent and well-running HACS by sophisticatedly and properly determining the six elements of the HACS and their influences. In the verification phase of GET-MAN, by applying the formalized HACS framework proposed in Part I, a formal model can be constructed to look ahead (predict) and back (explain) at potential faults in the candidate HACS. An example of the HACS design for target searching is employed to illustrate the use of the GET-MAN design procedure. The potential challenges and future research directions are discussed in the light of the GET-MAN design procedure. The systematic analysis framework, Part I, as well as the GET-MAN design procedure, Part II, can serve as common guidance and reference for analyzing and developing various HACSs.","Ding, Yulong;Xin, Bin;Chen, Jie;Yang, Qingkai;Fang, Hao",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022-11-01,Peng Cheng Laboratory;Beijing Institute of Technology,human agent collaborative system (HACS) ;  human robot collaboration ;  Human-agent collaboration (HAC) ;  top-level design procedure
European Union Conceptualisation of Industry 5.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Transdisciplinary Engineering,"‘Industry 5.0' has been used as a term to describe alternative visions of the future of industry. Recently, a European Union Research and Innovation Policy Brief used the label Industry 5.0 to define a vision which is not driven by a new technology, but by a changed perception of value founded on human-centricity, sustainability and resilience. Transdisciplinary Engineering (TE) seeks to integrate knowledge and understanding to reduce the negative effect of engineering innovation on the environment and society, thus there likely exists a natural synergy between Industry 5.0 and TE. Consequently, in this paper we seek to understand what the opportunities and challenges of the emergence of Industry 5.0 might be for the field of TE now and in the future. A workshop involving multidisciplinary experts was convened to brainstorm and then explore perceptions. Opportunities include new research areas and potential access to funding. Challenges center on the extent that TE could, or should, align itself with Industry 5.0, and the lack of consensus around definitions of TE. Conclusions find that to attract funding, the community should clearly articulate how TE differs from complimentary and overlapping fields such as interdisciplinarity and systems engineering.","Lattanzio, Susan;Goh, Yee Mey;Houghton, Robert;Garcia Lazaro, Aida;Newnes, Linda",Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2022-10-31,University of Bath;University of Nottingham;Loughborough University,Future of engineering ;  Industry 5.0 ;  Transdisciplinary Engineering
Research is formalized curiosity: Use of technology in the classroom is that enough virtual reality project,"There is always concern about the way technology is use in the classroom and if it really help the students learning process, some class could still be just learning concepts and remembering information with the use of a learning platform LMS to support teaching, in some cases consistent in using applications like Kahoot, Mentimeter, Quizlet, etc. with the sole porpoise of creating quizzes and exams, there are so many misconception about using technology in the classroom like that the use of it is solely for sciences classes, that a considerable investment in equipment has to be done, and that the teacher implementing it has to be a tech savvy. At Tecnológico de Monterrey by the participation in NOVUS Initiative for the financing of educational innovation projects was a path of discovery of discovered the importance of the interaction with other teachers, peers and students and the ability to discover new and feasible opportunities, to try to be inquiring and curious and be able to get out of the ordinary and of your comfort zone and most important that using technology is not always translate into students' academic success or better learning and understanding.

In relation to the grade of the quizzes applied, there was no significant difference between the control group and the groups that use de VR technology.

Spin-Orbit Torques Based on Topological Materials,"ConspectusWidespread applications of magnetic devices, such as magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), logic-in memory, and neuromorphic computing devices, require an efficient method to manipulate the local magnetization. One superior mechanism is the spin-orbit torque (SOT) associated with spin currents generated by charge currents in a material with strong spin-orbit coupling. A higher SOT efficiency (i.e., a higher charge-to-spin conversion efficiency) is crucial for low-power SOT device operation. Therefore, materials possessing the merit of a high SOT are urgently desired for the innovation of SOT devices. Among all of the SOT materials, topological materials such as topological insulators and topological semimetals have attracted considerable attention recently because of their nontrivial band structures with strong spin-orbit coupling and expected giant SOT. Therefore, topological materials are regarded as promising candidates for future energy-efficient device applications. However, research in the area of topological material-based spintronics is still in an early stage, and the related physical, material and device issues still need to be addressed. In this Account, we review our recent progress regarding the charge-to-spin conversion and SOT-driven magnetization switching using the emerging topological materials, with an emphasis on topological insulators and Weyl semimetals. First, we introduce the extraordinary physical features of single-layer topological insulators associated with electron transport, charge-spin interconversion, and unique spin textures and subsequently present our SOT results for topological materials mainly for Bi2Se3. This material shows pronounced SOT with the in-plane and out-of-plane component due to the spin momentum locking and hexagonal warping effect, respectively. The SOT can be efficiently modulated by varying the film crystal directions or by interface engineering between Bi2Se3and a ferromagnet. Thereafter, room-temperature magnetization switching by the electron-mediated or magnon-mediated spin torque is demonstrated in topological insulator-based devices, and the switching current density JCis on the order of ∼105A/cm2, which is approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that in heavy metals. Second, we summarize our SOT results in Weyl semimetals. Due to the broken crystal symmetry, Weyl semimetals (e.g., WTe2) can show an additional sizable out-of-plane spin polarization, which can be detected by electrical and optical techniques. Therefore, the Weyl semimetals can possess unconventional out-of-plane damping-like SOT, which will facilitate the field-free magnetization switching. The interface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is observed in Weyl semimetal/ferromagnet heterostructures, which can affect the domain wall motion. We also demonstrate the energy-efficient SOT-induced magnetization switching in Weyl semimetal-based devices. Third, we discuss the advances in SOT devices with wafer-scale topological materials prepared by industry-compatible techniques such as magnetron sputtering and chemical vapor deposition. These films may have stoichiometry similar to that of single-crystalline topological materials and SOTs as large as in single-crystalline topological materials. Finally, we present our perspectives for practical applications using this emerging family of quantum materials. We anticipate that this Account will deepen the understanding of SOT on topological materials, and our insights will guide the design and applications of high-performance topological material-based SOT devices.","Wang, Yi;Yang, Hyunsoo",Journal,Accounts of Materials Research,2022-10-28,Centre for Advanced 2D Materials;National University of Singapore;Dalian University of Technology,

The STEAM learning performance and sustainable inquiry behavior of college students in China,"Teacher education students, as an important reserve in the field of education, their growth and development are related to the future of science, economy, sustainable development of education. Through participation in the educational practice of STEAM, which integrates science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics is more beneficial for them to acquire 21st century skills like communication, collaboration, learning innovation and critical thinking. However, little has been seen about the use and effectiveness of short videos in STEAM education activities and how they can be used to support and promote teacher education students STEAM learning performance and sustainable inquiry behaviors. Therefore, this study combines the framework of triadic reciprocity determinism theory and technology acceptance theory to propose six research hypotheses and develop a research model to explore the relationship between collaborative self-efficacy (CS-E), perceived usefulness (PU) of short videos, perceived ease of use (PEOU), STEAM learning performance and teacher education students’ sustainable inquiry behavior. To achieve the purpose of this study, this study used purposive sampling and invited teacher education students from five classes of preschool education at a university in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR), China, to participate in this study. A total of 8 h of instructional guidance was provided over a four-week period, in which participants used short videos for collaborative group learning and independent inquiry and applied STEAM concepts to kindergarten science activities. Participants’ STEAM performance was measured and surveyed during the fourth week. The results of the study validation showed that (1) teacher education students CS-E had a positive effect on the PU and PEOU of short videos; (2) Teacher’s education students PEOU of short videos had a positive effect on usefulness; (3) Teacher’s education students PU and PEOU of short videos had a positive effect on STEAM learning performance; (4) Teacher’s education students’ STEAM learning performance had a positive effect on sustainable inquiry behavior.","Nong, Liying;Liao, Chen;Ye, Jian Hong;Wei, Changwu;Zhao, Chaiyu;Nong, Weiguaju",Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,2022-10-20,Hezhou University;Guangxi University of Foreign Languages;Beijing Normal University;Kindergarten Training Center Ministry of Continuing Education,Chinese teacher education student ;  collaborative self-efficacy ;  perceived ease of use of short videos ;  perceived usefulness of short videos ;  STEAM learning performance ;  sustainable inquiry behaviors
Modern computational methods for rational enzyme engineering,"Biocatalysis is a thriving field of research because of the vast, environmentally friendly impact that enzymes have on industry and biotechnology. However, in most production lines, the use of enzymes is unfeasible as a result of low enzyme stability or low catalytic rates or simply because no enzyme catalyzes the desired reaction. Rational enzyme engineering promises to allow a widespread use of enzymes in industry, helping the transition to a greener economy. Computational methods are assuming an ever-growing role holding great value in guiding and rationalizing experimental campaigns and drastically improve their chances of success. We focus on the industrial and biotechnological applications of enzymes, on their potential to be of critical importance in the much-needed transition to a greener global economy, on the barriers preventing them from being attractive in many industrial fields, and on the role that computational prediction methods have had and will have to provide solutions to overcome them.","Ferreira, Pedro;Fernandes, Pedro Alexandrino;Ramos, Maria João",Journal,Chem Catalysis,2022-10-20,Universidade do Porto,biocatalysts ;  computational biochemistry ;  enzyme engineering ;  SDG9: Industry innovation and infrastructure
Spurring inclusive entrepreneurship and student development post-C19: synergies between research and business plan competitions,"Purpose: Academic innovation strives to benefit from an ample talent pool, and entrepreneurship and research competitions constitute an integral part of the effort. This prompts discussions about how to optimize the impact of interdisciplinary learning, especially for less-traditional participants. The main purpose of this article is to describe how synergies between research and business plan competitions can facilitate inclusive engagement and enhanced development of transferable skills. Design/methodology/approach: A case illustration addresses the following questions: (1) what skills can be enhanced through a single project toward parallel participation in research and business plan competitions?

What I discovered in a design school that many in computing don't know and some may not accept,"In this keynote address I will contrast the residue of structured methods in Software Engineering, (not yet fully purged by agile practices) with the realities of creative design work (as evidenced in a half century of consistent empirical research). Examples of this residue, which obstructs innovation, include sequence, separated poorly interfaced phases, closed windows, premature overspecification, and prioritising procedure over design quality. Creative studio-based practices avoid these by coalescing concurrent unique progressions of design work that deliver unexpected innovations through generous creative confidence. Despite continuous empirical confirmation of the effectiveness of lightly managed creative practices, they remain unattractive within engineering fields that value control, measurement, systematic rigour, certainty, and predictability of outcomes and resources. A reluctance to relax on these values and accept trust, vision, opportunistic confidence, uncertainty, and unpredictability is understandable. Despite the highly creative insights and framings that underpin outstanding science and engineering work, scientific values focus more on validation than on conception and imagination. We need to complement scientific and engineering values with proven studio-based creative practices. This involves accepting multi-perspective concurrent engineering practices that are progressed by strategic vision, continuous connections across perspectives, critical reflection, and systematic tracking of the status of design work. In this keynote summary, I briefly introduce key aspects of both concurrent unique progressions of design work and the exercise of generous creative confidence, supported by examples of novel worth-focused approaches and resources that can support strategic creative approaches to innovation for interactive digital artefacts.","Cockton, Gilbert",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-10-17,University of Sunderland;University of Northumbria,concurrent engineering ;  creative design practices ;  design arenas ;  reflection ;  strategic design ;  wicked problems
How does digital finance influence green technology innovation in China? Evidence from the financing constraints perspective,"Green innovation activities of enterprises often fall into the dilemma of financing constraints. Hence, it is urgent that the financial system develops and becomes innovative, especially for a developing country like China. Existing literature mainly explores the influencing factors of green innovation from the environmental regulation, economic growth and government subsidies perspective. However, few papers critically study how digital finance influences green innovations. To explore the internal influencing mechanism of digital finance on the quantity and quality of green technology innovation, panel data of 271 prefecture-level cities from 2011 to 2019 in China is used. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical research, we get the following conclusions. First, digital finance can improve the quantity and quality of green technological innovation, which has become a significant driving force for green innovations in China. The results are still robust after the endogeneity tests. Second, the results of heterogeneous analysis indicate that the different dimensions of digital finance can improve green innovations. They include breadth of coverage, depth of use, and degree of digitization. The positive effect of digital finance is most substantial in eastern cities, followed by central cities, and weakest in western cities. Third, digital finance indirectly improves green innovation mainly by alleviating financing constraints. Our empirical results provide policy enlightenment for realizing the coordination of China's urban digital transformation and green economic development.","Lin, Boqiang;Ma, Ruiyang",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2022-10-15,Xiamen University;Innovation Laboratory for Sciences and Technologies of Energy Materials of Fujian Province (IKKEM),Digital finance ;  Financing constraints ;  Green technology innovations ;  Influencing mechanism analysis
Research progress on the biosynthesis and metabolic engineering of the anti-cancer drug camptothecin in Camptotheca acuminate,"Camptothecin (CPT), a well-known natural anti-cancer drug, is produced from woody plant Camptotheca acuminata. Up to now, two CPT-derivatives, irinotecan and topotecan, have been used to treat various cancers all over the world, and more than a dozen camptothecin analogues are in different stages of clinical research and development. The source of camptothecin mainly depends on the extraction from the fruits and barks of C. acuminata to meet the huge clinical demand, which undoubtedly increases the logging of this CPT-producing plant resource. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the content of camptothecin in C. acuminata using metabolic engineering strategies for the sustainable development of medicinal source plants. The camptothecin biosynthesis pathway is complex and only the functional genes that catalyze the biosynthesis of central intermediate strictosidinic acid and CPT-derivatives have been partially resolved. Thus, this review mainly summarized the anti-tumor mechanism and application of camptothecin drugs, the tissue differential distribution and extraction of camptothecin, the biosynthetic genes of camptothecin and its derivatives in C. acuminate. In addition, the application of camptothecin metabolic engineering in CPT-producing plants was also prospected. This review provided assistance for increasing camptothecin content and C. acuminata germplasm innovation using camptothecin metabolic engineering technologies.","Fan, Xiaoxuan;Lin, Xinting;Ruan, Qingyan;Wang, Jingyi;Yang, Yinkai;Sheng, Miaomiao;Zhou, Wei;Kai, Guoyin;Hao, Xiaolong",Journal,Industrial Crops and Products,2022-10-15,Zhejiang Chinese Medical University,Camptotheca acuminata ;  Camptothecin biosynthesis ;  Metabolic engineering strategies ;  Plant secondary metabolism ;  Transcriptional regulation

Tales from Corrodia,"In our continuous strive to expand, improve and ever develop this world, it is important to take a step back and consider: what might come of this? Is this truly a sustainable solution? Could it be misused or even abused? What will the future be like, with this innovation in it? Or, at a larger scale, what could a world be like, hundreds of years from now, given the speed of technological advance that we have today? What might happen if this technology - computer science, biotech, mechanical engineering, nanotech, medicine, space travel, all of it - goes haywire? Tales from Corrodia is my way of exploring these issues. On the surface it is art; macro photographs of rust and grime combined with short texts describing what I see in the image. Below the surface, it is a discussion on technology and its place in the future, a story about use, misuse and misunderstanding of tech and science. See the full collection on Instagram, #talesfromcorrodia. Together, the fictions about Corrodian life form a compelling speculative fiction. Corrodia is a place full of mystery and wonder, but also danger. Throughout its desolated lands, artifacts from more prosperous times are scattered, some of which are useful, some of which are just alien. Biomodified beings roam the lands as a testament of ancient breeding experiments. Semi-sentient mechanical creatures can be found here and there, albeit most of them have broken down over the ages. Several different people, races and sentient species live side by side and just like in the here-and-now some live rural low-tech lives whereas others have access to very advanced technology. Overseeing it all is the secretive Order, having access to what is seemingly magic ... or? Corrodia is not our world - but our world could become like Corrodia. There are several ways to work with speculative fictions. One can start with a speculative fiction as inspiration and design for it ([1], [2]), and then use the designs to drive discussion or provoke thoughts. Or, one can use speculative fictions in themselves as a discussion tool for participatory design or decision making (e.g. [3], [4], [5]). In my classes, we instead start out with the already existing Corrodian artifacts as inspiration. Then we back-cast them into our near-present, asking ourselves what they were from the beginning, before centuries of abandonment and tinkering skewed them into what they have become in Corrodia. What was the original use, and which underlying motivations or needs might have driven the development of such a thing? Students create these near-future design concepts which then become speculative designs in themselves, asking ""Are we close to designing something similar soon or even now, and if so, what might the consequences be?""The exercise forms the basis for in-depth discussions on how technology might be used, misused, misunderstood or even abused over time, and it gives students and other designers a thinking tool for considering their own future designs, namely the question: How will this end up in Corrodia?","Lyckvi, Sus",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-10-08,,critical design ;  critique ;  design fiction ;  design teaching ;  Speculative design ;  speculative fiction
Briefing: Rethinking urban infrastructure from an ecological perspective in a post-Covid-19 world,"Urban areas continue to change in response to climatic, engineering and socio-economic changes. Covid-19 exacerbated this by forcing many people to reflect on the composition of their local environment and evaluate the quality, quantity and provision of nature within urban areas. As a consequence of Covid-19 built infrastructure specialists have been further challenged to consider more ecologically focussed approaches to development that work within existing development frameworks. To achieve this, engineers, planners, architects and the environment sector should work more effectively to exchange knowledge, share best practice and create new practices that align engineered solutions with environmentally focussed design and management. It also requires a more nuanced appreciation of the elemental and thematic understandings of urban nature, which are often absent from development plans. If cities are to become more sustainable, a more holistic approach to development that integrates ecologically sensitive design with engineering innovation is needed. As a consequence, there is the potential to future-proof urban areas against the problems associated with health, climatic and economic change.","Mell, Ian",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Engineering Sustainability,2022-10-08,The University of Manchester,construction ;  development ;  green infrastructure ;  health ;  urban

"Erosion by Design: Rethinking Innovation, Sea Defense, and Credibility in Guyana","This essay explores the intersecting socio-material and ethical demands that engineers confront in adapting sea defenses to climate change in Guyana. It focuses on the tensions in climate adaptation that create the possibilities for theorizing innovation as a key theme of counter-modernities in the Anthropocene. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, oral histories, and archival research, I show that engineers' decision-making regarding whether or not to innovate sea defenses is a fraught process dependent upon processes of erosion and the ontological (in)stability of specific infrastructures known as groynes. To cope, engineers produce what I call innovation narratives to describe how obstacles to climate adaptation are created by combinations of neocolonial empire, shapeshifting ecologies, inconsistent maintenance programs, and fiscal debt. At the same time, their efforts signal an emerging global politics of credibility that is reinforced by desires for more inclusive forms of governance rather than brute power or capitalization.","Vaughn, Sarah E.",Journal,Comparative Studies in Society and History,2022-10-05,"University of California, Berkeley",climate adaptation ;  cultures of engineering ;  Guyana ;  historical time ;  innovation ;  knowledge economies ;  soil erosion
MO-DM Tool: Improving teams' engagement with Motivation-Oriented Decision-Making,"A significant part of Software Engineering students' academic and professional life involves working on projects in collaboration with their peers. They will form teams and perform on many software-related projects. Studies based on a systematic literature review and experimental results in a multidisciplinary tech-based innovation course with undergraduate students from Computer Engineering and Computer Science indicate difficulties in two significant activities in collaborative work: decision-making and reaching consensus. These recurrent difficulties negatively affect learners' motivation and engagement throughout the project's life cycle, besides other losses. This article aims to present a tool based on a model called MO-DM (Motivation-Oriented Decision-Making) proposed in doctoral research to address these hardships. It enables a new project view of members' motivation and engagement, considering all the choices made along the project journey. The tool is grounded on EVC (Expectancy-Value-Cost) model, using it in a new way. Decisions like ""What programming language should we use?""are observed from the perspective of ""Which programming language can bring more engagement and motivation to the majority of the team?"". This view makes it possible to identify which students are more susceptible to being demotivated and disengaged in each step, and actions can be performed to mitigate these effects. Teams can make more engaging and motivating choices by picking the ones that will positively affect most of the group, enhancing the chances of successful projects. MO-DM tool is under preliminary tests with satisfactory results. Many decision-making situations where motivation and engagement are concerns can benefit from MO-DM.

Benefits and Difficulties of Gender Diversity on Software Development Teams: A Qualitative Study,"There is a known and established gender imbalance in software engineering structures. The discussions about gender diversity in Software Engineering are on the table; however, which are the benefits and the difficulties people in software development teams see in gender diversity? For this work, we conducted a survey to qualitatively understand the perceived benefits and difficulties of gender diversity in software development teams. We found out that gender-diverse workplaces are prone to have better ideas sharing, better decision making, creativity, and innovation. Respondents mentioned that some companies worked to improve the hiring process to be more gender-inclusive. Women's support and inspiration were shared, and some men reported being touched by the subject and diligently are deconstructing their prejudice and misconceptions about women in technology. There are also difficulties. It is common to see only one woman in teams or just a few. More than that, no other gender than men and women, so the white, cisgender man is the pattern most of the time. The same pattern repeats itself in leadership positions leading to male protectionism and privileges. Additionally, other dimensions of diversity pervaded the answers, like intersectionality, race/ethnicity, ageism, and a less explored point: social vulnerability.","Kohl, Karina;Prikladnicki, Rafael",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-10-05,Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul,Diversity ;  Empirical Research ;  Gender ;  Qualitative ;  Software Engineering
Use Cases for Software Development Analytics: A Case Study,"Context Software engineering activities provide practitioners with large volumes of data that software analytics tools can use for many purposes, including defect prediction and effort estimation. However, the adoption of such tools depends on the information they provide and the real needs of practitioners. While existing research has focused on what developers need, the needs of managers are not well understood. Aims This study provides an in-depth analysis of the information needs of software practitioners from one organization that performs research, development, and innovation projects with industry partners. Understanding these practitioners' needs enables the development of better analytics solutions to support managerial decision-making. Method We interviewed practitioners in leadership positions and analyzed the collected data using Grounded Theory coding techniques, i.e., open and selective coding. Results We identified 19 software analytics use cases and classified them into four dimensions: quality, people, project management, and knowledge management. We also elicited several indicators to meet the identified use cases and captured key aspects concerning the organization's analytics scenario. Conclusions Although our results are particularly relevant to organizations similar to the one in which we conducted the study, they aim to serve as input for implementing new analytics solutions by practitioners and researchers in general.","Rique, Thiago;Dantas, Emanuel;Perkusich, Mirko;Gorgônio, Kyller;Almeida, Hyggo;Perkusich, Angelo",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-10-05,Universidade Federal de Campina Grande,indicators ;  information needs ;  software analytics ;  use cases

Towards a Human-Centred Framework for Smart Digital Immersion and Control for Cultural Heritage Applications,"The emergence of technological innovations in disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IOT) has introduced opportunities to enhance the traditional user experience. The potential of these opportunities has yet to be fully explored particularly within the cultural heritage sector where immersive technologies can benefit both the user and the heritage site. A potentially unforgettable user experience can be offered in an immersive environment and these technologies can also be used to rebuild locations under threat to ensure they can be accessed in the future (Garlandini, 2021). The intention of this paper is to critically analyse the emergence of Industry 5.0 and the implementation of personalisation in a machine learning system. It is important to thoroughly evaluate the aspects of AI technologies and the IOT that can be used to support personalisation. An element of blockchain technology known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) which was developed in the recent past may have the potential to address ongoing challenges in digital curation and this research paper will provide an evaluation of this technology. It is crucial for all the technologies mentioned to work together to produce a system that aligns with the traditional human-centred philosophy and is inclusive to all participants.","Murphy, Cian;Carew, Peter J.;Stapleton, Larry",Conference Proceeding,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2022-10-01,South East Technological University,Artificial Intelligence ;  Cultural Heritage ;  Industry 5.0 ;  Internet of Things ;  NFTs
"Design, Manufacture, and Perform of First Electronic Seismic Sensor Dilatometer in Project of Tehran Metro line 6 as a Rapid Environmentally Friendly in-situ Test with Less Soil Disturbance","The soil's physical and mechanical properties are obtained through laboratory or insitu tests. The dilatometer is an in-situ tool in rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering, and is widely used in developed countries. In the advanced version of this device, a geophone receives ground vibration. Thus Vs 1 could be obtained at the depth of the blade. This research work investigates the feasibility and performance of the first electronic seismic sensor due to its lower cost, more life span, more sensitivity instead of the geophone, and the ability to transfer signal. These changes make it an online tool connected to Arduino2, a platform so the digital or analog result could be transferred automatically. The test is carried out under construction of Bahar Shiraz station of Tehran Metro Line 6 at the depth of 30 m. The hammer generates a shear wave, and after amplification, the received signals are measured with the software. The shear wave velocity at the test site is obtained at 504 m/s. The result compared to Vs reported geotechnical investigation done by “Darya-Khak-Pey consulting engineers” for Metro line 6 shows a 10% deviation. It is suggested to conduct more comparative tests to check the results and calibrate. Using an 801-S sensor with more life span (of more than 60 million times) and the ability to connect to the internet with an Arduino board is the innovation applied to introduce a new generation of this tool in the engineering world.","Tehrani, Ali Dadkhah;Shirinabadi, Reza",Journal,Journal of Mining and Environment,2022-10-01,"Islamic Azad University, South Tehran Branch",801-S Sensor ;  Flat Dilatometer ;  Geo-technics ;  In-situ Test ;  Shear Wave Velocity
A Model for Countering the Information and Technical Threats of Intellectual Capital Management of Innovation-Oriented Systems in the Engineering Sector,"The modern economy is characterized by a sharp increase in the role of non-material factors (information and knowledge) in ensuring the competitiveness of individual enterprises and institutions, as well as national economies as a whole. Under these conditions, the ability to create, use and increase intellectual capital is the basis for the economic growth of engineering business entities. The main purpose of the study is to model the counteraction to the main threats of intellectual capital for innovation-oriented systems in the engineering sector of the economy. The relevance of the study is given by the fact that the formation and use of technical, economic, industrial, and other types of knowledge, the totality of which forms intellectual capital, is becoming an urgent problem for modern systems tuned to innovative development. The threats to managing the intellectual capital of innovation-oriented systems are now the most significant, since the achievement of the ultimate goals of the system itself depends on the efficiency of the use of intellectual capital. Taking this into account, intellectual capital is becoming a real and valuable target of criminal encroachments today, which requires scientists to form a clear model for countering these goals. The research methodology involves the use of mathematical methods of information support for the process of counteracting the negative impact of threats. According to the results of the study, we presented the modeling process. As a result, a model was built to counteract the main threats of intellectual capital for innovation-oriented systems in the engineering sector of the economy. Further research requires the construction of a mathematical mechanism for responding to new challenges to the intellectual capital management system for innovation-oriented systems.","Yemelyanov, Volodymyr;Nikonenko, Uliana;Sytnyk, Yosyf;Okhrimenko, Ihor;Shulga, Anastasia",Journal,Ingenierie des Systemes d'Information,2022-10-01,Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University;Lviv Polytechnic National University;Ukrainian Academy of Printing;Kyiv Cooperative Institute of Business and Law,engineering ;  innovation ;  intellectual capital ;  model ;  systems
"STEM, STEAM and Makerspaces in Early Childhood: A Scoping Review","STEM has emerged as a key area of importance for children, highlighting the value and relevance of integrated understandings of science, technology, engineering and mathematics in both educational contexts and everyday life. The need for innovation and creativity is also recognised, which emphasizes the important role the arts can play as STEM is extended into STEAM. This scoping review investigated what is known about STEM, STEAM and makerspace experiences and opportunities for children aged birth to eight. The review found that early childhood experience with STEM, STEAM and makerspaces is an emerging field of research. Findings suggest that STEAM holds more relevance to learning and experiences in the early childhood years, and perhaps across the lifespan. The review also highlights the need to shift the starting point to the earliest of years and create greater intentionality in STEAM experiences with infants, toddlers and preschool aged children, recognizing the relevance of STEAM and maker mindsets in the lives of young children. Additionally, the scoping review identified the value of informal and community contexts as a means to invite broader participation. Such opportunities provide scope to challenge inequity in opportunity and to overcome intergenerational aversion towards STEM/STEAM-related learning. Further research is needed to understand the professional learning needs of early childhood educators and facilitators of STEAM and makerspace experiences.","Johnston, Kelly;Kervin, Lisa;Wyeth, Peta",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-10-01,University of Wollongong;Queensland University of Technology,early childhood ;  education ;  makerspaces ;  play-based learning ;  STEAM ;  STEM ;  young children
A Two-Stage Method for Weak Feature Extraction of Rolling Bearing Combining Cyclic Wiener Filter with Improved Enhanced Envelope Spectrum,"Due to the interference of various strong background signals, it is often difficult to extract effective features by using conventional methods such as envelope spectrum analysis when early weak fault arises in rolling bearing. Inspired by the current two main research directions of weak fault diagnosis of rolling bearing, that is, the enhancement of impulse features of faulty vibration signal through vibration analysis and the selection of fault information sensitive frequency band for further envelope spectrum analysis, and based on the second-order cyclostationary characteristic of the vibration signal of faulty bearing, a two-stage method for weak feature extraction of rolling bearing combining cyclic Wiener filter with improved enhanced envelope spectrum (IEES) is proposed in the paper. Firstly, the original vibration signal of the rolling bearing’s early weak fault is handled by cyclic Wiener filter exploiting the spectral coherence (SCoh) theory and the noise components are filtered out. Then, SCoh is applied on the filtered signal. Subsequently, an IEES method obtained by integrating over the selected fault information sensitive spectral frequency band of the SCoh spectral is used to extract the fault features. The innovation of the proposed method is to fully excavate the advantages of cyclic Wiener filter and IEES simultaneously. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by simulation firstly, and vibration signals collected from accelerated bearing degradation tests and engineering machines are used to further verify its effectiveness. Additionally, its superiority over the other state-of-the-art methods is also compared.","Jia, Lianhui;Jiang, Lijie;Wen, Yongliang",Journal,Machines,2022-10-01,Huazhong University of Science and Technology;China Railway Group Limited,cyclic Wiener filter ;  cyclostationarity ;  feature extraction ;  IEES ;  rolling bearing ;  vibration analysis ;  weak fault
Reconstruction of Rural Settlement Patterns in China: The Role of Land Consolidation,"Taking the supplement of the quantity and quality of cultivated land in rural settlements as the departure point, this paper discusses the spatial and temporal integration reconstruction method of rural settlements. The disorderly expansion of residential areas in Pinggu District, Beijing, China has led to the erosion of high-quality cultivated land in the region and the advantages of mountain resources have not been fully utilized in this area. Therefore, Pinggu District was selected as the research area. Using the spatial analysis function in GIS, this paper uses the comprehensive correction method of the per capita construction land standard and the neighborhood substitution method to analyze the quantitative potential of rural settlements to supplement cultivated land and the qualitative grade of cultivated land after arrangement. A combination of exclusion matrices are employed to identify the spatial and temporal arrangements of rural settlements. The research shows that the effective cultivated land area of rural settlements in Pinggu District is 514.24 ha, and the coefficient of increasing cultivated land is 9.25%. Rural residential areas in the district are divided into priority sorting area, key sorting area, moderate sorting area, and restricted sorting area; they account for 18.13%, 21.10%, 20.85%, and 39.93% of the total area, respectively. According to the regional characteristics and dominant factor of the different consolidation areas, corresponding consolidation goals, models, and engineering measures are proposed to enrich the theory and approach to village planning and to provide a reference for practitioners engaged in regional rural land consolidation. The innovation of this study is putting forward the consolidation objectives, models and engineering measures based on the regional characteristics and leading factors of different land consolidation areas. This study has reference significance for the formulation and implementation of regional rural settlements consolidation planning and the policy of increasing and decreasing urban and rural construction land.","Cui, Jichang;Qu, Yanbo;Li, Yan;Zhan, Lingyun;Guo, Guancheng;Dong, Xiaozhen",Journal,Land,2022-10-01,Shandong University of Finance and Economics;Nanjing Agricultural University,China ;  cultivated land ;  land consolidation ;  pattern reconstruction ;  Pinggu District ;  rural settlements
Numerical Investigation of the 6-DOF Seakeeping Performances of the KCS Containership,"The topic of the present paper subscribes to one of the most challenging themes that are nowadays under the spotlight of the scientific community.

Bonding of Steel Bars in Concrete with the Addition of Carbon Nanotubes: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Advances and innovations in science and engineering have been increasingly supported by nanotechnology, and the modification of cementitious materials by nanoengineering is an expanding field. With this perspective, this paper aims to elucidate the behavior of steel bars in concrete with the addition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a function of the characteristics of the cement-based material, the dispersion techniques and dosage of CNTs, the bond tests and specimen geometry, and the rebar characteristics. To reach this proposed goal, the ProKnow-C methodology was applied to select the most relevant publications from the last ten years, and then seven articles were fully analyzed. The results of the present systematic review of the literature revealed both consolidated knowledge and gaps to be filled in future research, as the need to study the chemical effect of adding these nanomaterials for improving steel–concrete adhesion, the bonding of thin bars in concrete, and the real influence of anchorage length on the steel–concrete bond, regardless of the use of CNTs, is vital.","Reis, Elvys Dias;Resende, Heron Freitas;Ludvig, Péter;de Azevedo, Rogério Cabral;Poggiali, Flávia Spitale Jacques;Bezerra, Augusto Cesar da Silva",Journal,Buildings,2022-10-01,Federal Center for Technological Education of Minas Gerais,bond strength ;  cement-based materials ;  pull-out test ;  reinforced concrete
A Conceptual Framework for BIM Process Flow to Mitigate the Causes of Fall-Related Accidents at the Design Stage,"Safety training is essential in enhancing safe environments, attitudes, and employee safety behaviour. It has been recognized that the construction industry must tackle the inefficiencies of conventional safety training methods. Using innovative training practices for construction workers is one of the most effective ways to improve safety performance. There is a lack of a standard framework and of necessary information for building information modelling (BIM) process flow needed by designers and safety and health officers to aid construction workers’ safety and job hazard identification (JHI) at the design stage. This study aims to create a framework for BIM process flow to minimize the causes of fall-related accidents in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. This framework was developed based on an integrative review approach and other empirical findings. The connection of the different components makes up the framework. This research recommends practical enhancements, innovation, and adjustments to construction employees’ safety training and JHI. One of the suggested framework’s research advantages is that it evolved through expert validation and contains the necessary components to facilitate practical construction safety training and JHI. These components could serve as a starting point for developing guidelines for practical safety training and JHI.","Rafindadi, Aminu Darda’u;Shafiq, Nasir;Othman, Idris",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-10-01,Bayero University;Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS,BIM process flow ;  building information modelling (BIM) ;  construction ;  fall-related accidents ;  framework development ;  safety training
Principles of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in STEM Education: Using Expert Wisdom and Research to Frame Educational Practice,"Developing teacher knowledge, skills, and confidence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is critical to supporting a culture of innovation and productivity across the population. Such capacity building is also necessary for the development of STEM literacies involving the ability to identify, apply, and integrate concepts from STEM domains toward understanding complex problems, and innovating to solve them. However, a lack of visible models of STEM integration has been highlighted by teachers as a challenge to successfully implementing integrated STEM education in schools. Problem Based Learning (PBL) has been well-established in higher education contexts as an approach to learning in the STEM disciplines and may present an effective way to integrate knowledge and skills across STEM disciplines in school-based STEM education and support the development of students as capable, self-directed learners. However, if PBL is to effectively contribute to STEM education in schools and build teacher capacity to teach STEM, then this approach needs to be better understood. This paper aims to generate a set of principles for supporting a PBL model of STEM education in schools based on insights from the literature and expert focus groups of PBL professionals. Four principles of PBL emerged from the data analysis: (a) flexible knowledge, skills, and capabilities; (b) active and strategic metacognitive reasoning; (c) collaboration based on intrinsic motivation; and (d) problems embedded in real and rich contexts. The study outcomes provide evidence-informed support for teachers who may be considering the value of adopting a PBL approach in school-based STEM education.","Smith, Kathy;Maynard, Nicoleta;Berry, Amanda;Stephenson, Tanya;Spiteri, Tabetha;Corrigan, Deborah;Mansfield, Jennifer;Ellerton, Peter;Smith, Timothy",Journal,Education Sciences,2022-10-01,The University of Queensland;Monash University,PBL ;  problem-based learning ;  professional development ;  STEM ;  teacher development
"What Determines BIM Competition Results of Undergraduate Students in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry?","Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become the development trend in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. BIM discipline competition is an effective way for students of AEC-related disciplines to integrate theory with practice, and it is a key link to cultivate qualified BIM practitioners. This study takes participants of the 8th National College BIM Graduation Design Innovation Competition as the research objects. The Technology Acceptance Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior are combined to build a driving factor model of the competitions. Contestants of the competition were asked to complete online questionnaires, and 451 valid samples were finally obtained. Structural Equation Modeling was used to fit the theoretical model, and it was found that: Behavioral Intention to use BIM is directly and positively affected by Attitude, Perceived Behavioral Control, and Perceived Usefulness, as well as indirectly and positively affected by Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Eased of Usefulness. Competition Results is directly and positively affected by Behavioral Intention to use BIM, Perceived Behavioral Control, and Facilitating Conditions. It is also indirectly and positively affected by Attitude, Perceived Behavior Control, Perceived Usefulness, and Perceived Eased of Usefulness. The results show that the situation of students’ participation in BIM competition can be optimized by increasing the publicity and promotion of BIM and related policies, strengthening the construction of supporting teaching facilities, building the integrated curriculum system of BIM technology, and strengthening teacher training. This study provides a theoretical reference for further BIM practice, and it would help improve the corresponding teaching organization and enhance the internal drive of students’ BIM learning.","Ao, Yibin;Peng, Panyu;Li, Jiayue;Li, Mingyang;Bahmani, Homa;Wang, Tong",Journal,Behavioral Sciences,2022-10-01,Faculteit Bouwkunde van de TU Delft;Chengdu University of Technology;Sichuan College of Architectural Technology,behavioral intention ;  BIM ;  competition results ;  technology acceptance model ;  theory of planned behavior
Applying Natural Language Processing and TRIZ Evolutionary Trends to Patent Recommendations for Product Design,"Featured Application: The research may be applied to computer-aided innovation system to assist product design process. Traditional TRIZ theory provides methods and processes for systematic analysis on engineering problems, which can improve the efficiency of solving problems. However, the effect of solving problems is not necessarily guaranteed, and depends on the user’s profession and experience. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology to apply evolutionary benefits in the 37 trend lines developed by TRIZ researchers to assist in intelligently screening relevant patents applicable to the content of the product design. In such a way, the efficiency of problem solving and product design quality may be improved more effectively. First, the patent database is used as the training dataset, words and sentences in the patent documents are analyzed through natural language processing to obtain keywords that may be related to evolutionary benefits. Using word vectors trained by Doc2vec, the semantic similarity can be calculated to obtain the similarity relationship between patent text and evolutionary benefit. Secondly, the goals of the product development project may make be related to the evolutionary benefits, and then applicable patent recommendations can be provided. The proposed methodology may achieve the purpose of intelligent design assistance to enhance the product development process and problem-solving.","Liu, Tien Lun;Hsieh, Ling Hsiang;Huang, Kuan Chun",Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2022-10-01,Chung Yuan Christian University,evolutionary benefits ;  natural language processing ;  patent analysis ;  TRIZ evolutionary trends
A Systematic Review of the Relationship between Geotechnics and Disasters,"Landslides, earthquakes, and other natural events can change the landscape and generate human and economic losses, affecting transportation and public service infrastructure. In every geotechnical project, the investigation phase plays a fundamental role in reducing the risk of occurrence and mitigating catastrophes. As a result, governments have created entities to study disasters and identify triggering factors that generate huge losses worldwide. This research aims to conduct a systematic review of the relationship between geotechnics and disasters through bibliometric techniques, scientific production evaluation, and case studies analysis to recognize key topics, methods, and thematic development of the research worldwide. The research methodology consisted of three steps: (1) Database analysis, selection, and combination, (2) bibliometric analysis, and (3) systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The systematic review with bibliometric analysis collected data from 1973 to 2021, with 1299 academic publications indexed in the Scopus and WoS database. These results indicated a growing trend of annual publications on disasters and their relationship with geotechnical studies, highlighting current issues and technological innovation. The main research trends in disaster risk assessment were topics mainly linked to landslides, earthquakes, liquefaction, and inappropriate analysis models with applications of geophysical methods, laboratory tests, remote sensing, and numerical models.","Solórzano, Joselyne;Morante-Carballo, Fernando;Montalván-Burbano, Néstor;Briones-Bitar, Josué;Carrión-Mero, Paúl",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-10-01,Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral Ecuador;Universidad de Almería,bibliometric analysis ;  geotechnical engineering ;  landslides ;  natural events ;  systematic review
Fabrication and Testing of Multi-Hierarchical Porous Scaffolds Designed for Bone Regeneration via Additive Manufacturing Processes,"Bone implants or replacements are very scarce due to the low donor availability and the high rate of body rejection. For this reason, tissue engineering strategies have been developed as alternative solutions to this problem. This research sought to create a cellular scaffold with an intricate and complex network of interconnected pores and microchannels using salt leaching and additive manufacturing (3D printing) methods that mimic the hierarchical internal structure of the bone. A biocompatible hydrogel film (based on poly-ethylene glycol) was used to cover the surface of different polymeric scaffolds. This thin film was then exposed to various stimuli to spontaneously form wrinkled micropatterns, with the aim of increasing the contact area and the material’s biocompatibility. The main innovation of this study was to include these wrinkled micropatterns on the surface of the scaffold by taking advantage of thin polymer film surface instabilities. On the other hand, salt and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) particles were included in the polymeric matrix to create a modified filament for 3D printing. The printed part was leached to eliminate porogen particles, leaving homogenously distributed pores on the structure. The pores have a mean size of 26.4 ± 9.9 μm, resulting in a global scaffold porosity of ~42% (including pores and microchannels). The presence of nHA particles, which display a homogeneous distribution according to the FE-SEM and EDX results, have a slight influence on the mechanical resistance of the material, but incredibly, despite being a bioactive compound for bone cells, did not show a significant increase in cell viability on the scaffold surface. However, the synergistic effect between the presence of the hydrogel and the pores on the material does produce an increase in cell viability compared to the control sample and the bare PCL material.","González-Henríquez, Carmen M.;Rodríguez-Umanzor, Fernando E.;Acuña-Ruiz, Nicolas F.;Vera-Rojas, Gloria E.;Terraza-Inostroza, Claudio;Cohn-Inostroza, Nicolas A.;Utrera, Andrés;Sarabia-Vallejos, Mauricio A.;Rodríguez-Hernández, Juan",Journal,Polymers,2022-10-01,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile;CSIC - Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Polimeros (ICTP);Universidad de Santiago de Chile;Universidad de Chile;Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana;Universidad San Sebastián,additive manufacturing ;  ATRP synthesis ;  bone scaffold ;  salt leaching ;  wrinkled micropatterns
"Environmental regulation, R&D investment, and green technology innovation in China: Based on the PVAR model","The unreasonable economic development model of human beings has caused the environmental pollution problem to become increasingly serious. In order to achieve a positive relationship and interaction between environmental regulation, research and development (R&D) investment, and green technology innovation, and effectively solve the “strange circle” problem between high-quality economic development and environmental pollution in China and even the world, this paper takes the panel data of industrial enterprises above designated size in Chinese mainland 31 provinces from 2009 to 2019 as a research sample. The comprehensive index of R&D investment and green technology innovation was established by the entropy method, and the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model was constructed from the dynamic endogenous perspective, and the dynamic interaction and regional heterogeneity between environmental regulation, R&D investment, and green technology innovation were empirically analyzed by using impulse response function and variance decomposition. We obtain the following findings: (1) Environmental regulation has a two-way interaction relationship with R&D investment and green technology innovation, and R&D investment has a promotion effect on the “green degree” of technological innovation, but its role is still weak and has lagging characteristics. (2) There is significant regional heterogeneity in the dynamic responses of the eastern, central and western parts of China. (3) In the long run, environmental regulation has a “negative crowding out effect” on R&D investment in the central region, and the phenomenon of “central collapse” still exists but will gradually weaken. Environmental regulation has a “positive innovation compensation effect” on green technology innovation. Green technology innovation and R&D investment have an obvious “Pareto improvement” effect on environmental regulation, especially in the eastern region. The conclusions of this study help to clarify the dynamic interaction between environmental regulation, R&D investment, and green technology innovation, further improve environmental regulatory policies and green technology innovation R&D decision-making, and provide an effective way to achieve green and sustainable development in China and other parts of the world.","Zhang, Yueting;Chen, Huaichao;He, Zhimin",Journal,PLoS ONE,2022-10-01,Taiyuan University of Technology,
A novel biodegradable polymer scaffold for in vitro growth of corneal epithelial cells,"The shortage of donor corneal tissue worldwide has led to extensive research for alternate corneal equivalents utilizing tissue engineering methods. We conducted experiments using Poly D, L lactic acid polymer along with a copolymer (Eudragit) in varying concentrations to create a biodegradable scaffold suitable for in vitro growth of corneal epithelial stem cells. It was found that stable, spherical, and porous microparticles can be prepared by combining PDLLA and Eudragit RL100 polymers in the ratio of 90:10 and 70:30. The microparticles can then be fused to form scaffold membranes with porous architecture and good water retention capacity at room temperature using methanol, which can withstand handling during transplantation procedures. The scaffolds made using a 70:30 ratio were found to be suitable for the promotion of growth of laboratory corneal epithelial stem cell lines (SIRC cell lines). This innovation can pave way for further developments in corneal stem cell research and growth, thus providing for viable laboratory-derived corneal substitutes.","Bhardwaj, Kanika;Sridhar, Uma",Journal,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,2022-10-01,ICARE Eye Hospital and Postgraduate Institute,Corneal epithelial stem cell culture ;  microparticle ;  polymer ;  scaffold ;  tissue engineering
Design of network security storage system based on under cloud computing technology,"Computer networks are frequently utilised today. Along with the convenience, internet viruses and attackers are a concern point for users. Currently, it has been challenging to meet the demands of standard defence measures in the fight over network security threats. As a result, high-quality network storage systems can be progressively improved in order to satisfy the requirements of security of computer networks under the cloud computing paradigm. Its cloud administrations were open whenever and anyplace customers required them. As an outcome, shoppers are allowed to buy anything that IT administration they need, and they don't need to stress over how simple things can be managed. The far off server is utilized in another data stockpiling processing engineering that is viewed as an Internet age. Guaranteeing security, material at asset suppliers' destinations is a test that should be tended to in cloud innovation. Therefore, this research suggests developing development for security of information storing with a variety of tasks, wherein information is mixed and partitioned into various code outlines and dispersed across numerous supplier places, as opposed to dependence on a single supplier for information putting away. This assistance was used to enhance the new construction's anticipated security, adaptability, or unchanging quality.","ThiBac, Do;Minh, Nguyen Hieu",Journal,Computers and Electrical Engineering,2022-10-01,University of Information and Communication Technology;Institute of Cryptographic Science and Technology,"Encryption method, network, information ;  Network security ;  Storage, cloud computing"
Green technology innovation spillover effect and urban eco-efficiency convergence: Evidence from Chinese cities,"Urban eco-efficiency, as an indicator to evaluate urban sustainability, has attracted increased attention, and green technology innovation has been proved to be an effective method to promote eco-efficiency. However, due to regional inequality, the level of eco-efficiency and green technology innovation vary in different cities, which is not conducive to overall development and should be dealt with. Thus, this study explores the influencing mechanism of green technology innovation spillover effect on urban eco-efficiency convergence with mathematical analysis, proposes an SBM model with undesirable outputs to evaluate Chinese cities' eco-efficiency from 2004 to 2018, judges cities' spatial correlation based on Moran's I index, and applies spatial Durbin model to investigate green technology innovation's direct and spillover effects on urban eco-efficiency convergence with time and regional differences. The results show that although there are large spatial differences in Chinese urban eco-efficiency, the overall urban eco-efficiency has improved gradually, and green technology innovation spillover effect can promote urban eco-efficiency convergence, but the degrees differ in time and region. The results of this study can be useful for solving the problem of unequal regional and urban eco-efficiency development by managing the distribution and transfer of green technology innovation in cities.","Shang, Hua;Jiang, Li;Pan, Xianyou;Pan, Xiongfeng",Journal,Energy Economics,2022-10-01,Shanghai University of Electric Power;Dalian University of Technology,Convergence ;  Green technology innovation ;  Spatial Durbin model ;  Spillover effect ;  Undesirable output SBM model ;  Urban eco-efficiency

Research status and future prospects of space structure health monitoring,"Space structures are the main form of long-span, large-space, and large-area building structures, which are widely used in national infrastructure and urban construction, and their structural safety is of paramount importance. Space structure health monitoring (SSHM) accurately obtains structural responses through sensing technology, reflects the performance state of the structure in real-time, and provides a scientific basis and guidance for the construction, operation, and management decision of space structures. After years of research and engineering practice, wireless-sensor technology based on the internet of things has been developed, which is suitable for large-span space structures. Multi-dimensional data analysis theory has been proposed, and the large-scale applications have been implemented in major projects such as the National Stadium, the National Speed Skating Oval, and the Beijing Daxing International Airport Terminal Building, the research progress has been achieved. By systematically summarizing the current research and applications of SSHM, the characteristics of SSHM are clarified, and the current research situation of the sensing technology is reviewed around the multi-dimensional sensing of load and response, as well as the large-area transmission networks. The monitoring data analysis theories are summarized, including structural load analysis, response analysis, and structural condition assessment. Meanwhile, future research directions are foreseen based on the integration of big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, aiming to further promote the innovation and development of SSHM.","Luo, Yaozhi;Zhao, Jingyu",Journal,Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao/Journal of Building Structures,2022-10-01,Zhejiang University,data analysis theory ;  engineering application ;  sensing technology ;  space structure ;  structural condition assessment ;  structural health monitoring
Startup Ethics: Ethically Responsible Conduct of Scientists and Engineers at Theranos,"Studies of ethical challenges that can confront practicing scientists and engineers in the entrepreneurial stage of the overarching research-and-innovation process are virtually non-existent. This paper explores ethical challenges that arose at a specific entrepreneurial startup: Theranos, the defunct blood-testing company. The fundamental ethical responsibilities of scientists and engineers (FERSEs) offer a framework useful for evaluating the conduct of practicing scientists and engineers from an ethical responsibility perspective. Questionable conduct by Theranos’s former top managers has been widely discussed. However, the fact that a number of Theranos scientists and engineers responded to ethical challenges in several phases of the innovation/entrepreneurial stage with ethically responsible conduct has gone largely unrecognized. Ten mini cases involving these practitioners are discussed. Their deeds reflect different harm-prevention strategies. The Theranos case suggests several ethics-related takeaways for scientists and engineers who work or may work in technical startups. Familiarity with the FERSEs and knowledge of the ethical challenges, ethically responsible conduct, and harm-prevention strategies exhibited in the Theranos case provide valuable intellectual resources for startup scientists and engineers who aspire to be ethically responsible professionals.","McGinn, Robert E.",Journal,Science and Engineering Ethics,2022-10-01,Stanford Engineering;UCSF School of Medicine,Ethically responsible conduct ;  Fundamental ethical responsibilities of scientists and engineers ;  Harm-prevention strategies ;  Startup ethics ;  Technical startups ;  Theranos
Digital Health Applications in Oncology: An Opportunity to Seize,"Digital health advances have transformed many clinical areas including psychiatric and cardiovascular care. However, digital health innovation is relatively nascent in cancer care, which represents the fastest growing area of health-care spending. Opportunities for digital health innovation in oncology include patient-facing technologies that improve patient experience, safety, and patient-clinician interactions; clinician-facing technologies that improve their ability to diagnose pathology and predict adverse events; and quality of care and research infrastructure to improve clinical workflows, documentation, decision support, and clinical trial monitoring. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated shifts of care to the home and community dramatically accelerated the integration of digital health technologies into virtually every aspect of oncology care. However, the pandemic has also exposed potential flaws in the digital health ecosystem, namely in clinical integration strategies; data access, quality, and security; and regulatory oversight and reimbursement for digital health technologies. Stemming from the proceedings of a 2020 workshop convened by the National Cancer Policy Forum of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, this article summarizes the current state of digital health technologies in medical practice and strategies to improve clinical utility and integration. These recommendations, with calls to action for clinicians, health systems, technology innovators, and policy makers, will facilitate efficient yet safe integration of digital health technologies into cancer care.","Parikh, Ravi B.;Basen-Enquist, Karen M.;Bradley, Cathy;Estrin, Deborah;Levy, Mia;Lichtenfeld, J.

Clinical research in radiation oncology: how to move from the laboratory to the patient?,"Translational research in radiation oncology is undergoing intense development. An increasingly rapid transfer is taking place from the laboratory to the patients, both in the selection of patients who can benefit from radiotherapy and in the development of innovative irradiation strategies or the development of combinations with drugs. Accelerating the passage of discoveries from the laboratory to the clinic represents the ideal of any translational research program but requires taking into account the multiple obstacles that can slow this progress. The ambition of the RadioTransNet network, a project to structure preclinical research in radiation oncology in France, is precisely to promote scientific and clinical interactions at the interface of radiotherapy and radiobiology, in its preclinical positioning, in order to identify priorities for strategic research dedicated to innovation in radiotherapy. The multidisciplinary radiotherapy teams with experts in biology, medicine, medical physics, mathematics and engineering sciences are able to meet these new challenges which will allow these advances to be made available to patients as quickly as possible.","Potiron, V.;Delpon, G.;Ollivier, L.;Vaugier, L.;Doré, M.;Guimas, V.;Rio, E.;Thillays, F.;Llagostera, C.;Moignier, A.;Josset, S.;Chiavassa, S.;Perennec, T.;Supiot, S.",Journal,Cancer/Radiotherapie,2022-10-01,Institut de Cancérologie de l’Ouest;Unité en Sciences Biologiques et Biotechnologies;Laboratoire de Physique Subatomique et des Technologies Associées,Drug ;  Hypoxia ;  Medical physics ;  Radiobiology ;  Translational research
Patent representation learning with a novel design of patent ontology: Case study on PEM patents,"Under the background of innovation-driven knowledge economy globalization, comprehensive and insightful patent technology information mining can help enterprises win the first-mover advantage in the increasingly fierce technology competition. However, existing machine learning-based methods do not entirely incorporate the characteristics of patent technology of technology composition and technology association at the micro-level and macro-level, making it difficult to mine detailed and comprehensive patent information. To fill this research gap, firstly, we conduct a comprehensive analysis from the micro-level technology composition perspective of patent documents and the macro-level technology association perspective of patent data involved in the technology field, and then we design a novel patent ontology that includes the entity of patent, function, solution and application field. Secondly, we create a patent heterogeneous network with the help of the proposed patent ontology and the technology association. Finally, to fully use the patent technology characteristics, we develop a heterogeneous graph embedding algorithm to embed this information into the patent representation, and the experiments done on non-perfluorinated proton exchange membrane patent data show that our method produces better patent representation than the comparable models. Furthermore, we utilize the patent representation to perform case study to confirm the method's reliability and practicability.","Zhai, Dongsheng;Zhai, Liang;Li, Mengyang;He, Xijun;Xu, Shuo;Wang, Feifei",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-10-01,Beijing University of Technology,Heterogeneous graph embedding ;  Patent ontology ;  Patent representation ;  Technology association ;  Technology composition
Biotechnology and health: Issues and perspectives,"Cell therapy is a technological breakthrough in medicine. It is essential in many fields, including oncology with CAR-Ts or in regenerative medicine for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or musculoskeletal conditions with mesenchymal stromal cells. These therapeutic cells are called Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) and include all processes including cells manipulated to obtain reprogramming (iPS), to induce gene expression or, by genome editing, to modify the expression of a gene. Finally, it is essential to develop new 3D printable cellular supports. These biomaterials in the form of bio-inks can be printed and take the desired shape of the target tissue before being colonized by the cellular elements necessary for their biological functions and thus replacing the failing organ. All these new technologies generate innovation and the development of the biomedicines of tomorrow. The creation of a national sector around biotechnologies and access to industrial bio-production platforms is essential if we wish to control access to these treatments and their costs. Finally, it is essential to have recourse to highly qualified health personnel for the handling, administration, and monitoring of biomedicines in our hospitals. These new biotherapies will profoundly modify the care of patients in all areas, change medical practices but with a considerable societal impact. Thus, the development and clinical research on cellular biotherapies constitute essential challenges in health but with a significant ethical, societal, and economic impact for Europe.","Jorgensen, C.",Journal,Bulletin de l'Academie Nationale de Medecine,2022-10-01,"Cellules Souches, Plasticité Cellulaire, Régénération Tissulaire et Immunothérapie des Maladies Inflammatoires;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Montpellier",Biotherapy ;  Biothérapie ;  Genome editing ;  IPS ;  IPS ;  Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells ;  Regeneration ;  Régénération ;  Stromal mésenchymateux/cellules souches ;  Édition du génome
Framing Professional Learning Analytics as Reframing Oneself,"Central to imagining the future of technology-enhanced professional learning is the question of how data are gathered, analyzed, and fed back to stakeholders. The field of learning analytics (LA) has emerged over the last decade at the intersection of data science, learning sciences, human-centered and instructional design, and organizational change, and so could in principle inform how data can be gathered and analyzed in ways that support professional learning. However, in contrast to formal education where most research in LA has been conducted, much work-integrated learning is experiential, social, situated, and practice-bound. Supporting such learning exposes a significant weakness in LA research, and to make sense of this gap, this article proposes an adaptation of the Knowledge-Agency Window framework. It draws attention to how different forms of professional learning locate on the dimensions of learner agency and knowledge creation. Specifically, we argue that the concept of 'reframing oneself' holds particular relevance for informal, work-integrated learning. To illustrate how this insight translates into LA design for professionals, three examples are provided: first, analyzing personal and team skills profiles (skills analytics); second, making sense of challenging workplace experiences (reflective writing analytics); and third, reflecting on orientation to learning (dispositional analytics). We foreground professional agency as a key requirement for such techniques to be used effectively and ethically.","Shum, Simon Buckingham;Littlejohn, Allison;Kitto, Kirsty;Crick, Ruth",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,2022-10-01,UCL Knowledge Lab;University of Technology Sydney;Wild Learning,dispositional analytics ;  learning analytics (LA) ;  professional learning ;  reflection ;  self-assessmentÂ technologies ;  skills analytics ;  writing analytics ;  Â Agency
Does industrial robot application promote green technology innovation in the manufacturing industry?,"Manufacturing green technology innovation is important in achieving climate goals and is the key in promoting sustainable economic development. Using the industrial robot data and manufacturing green technology innovation data from 34 countries from 1993 to 2019, this paper reveals the mechanism and heterogeneity of the application of industrial robots (IRA) affecting green technology innovation (GTI) in the global manufacturing sector. The results indicate the following: (1) The IRA significantly promotes GTI, and the endogenous and robustness tests show that the results are robust. (2) The IRA promotes GTI with a dual-channel mechanism—the mediating effect of green R&D investment and the moderating effect of environmental regulation. (3) There is two-dimensional heterogeneity in terms of the application industries and regions in terms of the green technology innovation effects of industrial robot applications. (4) In addition, the implementation of Industry 4.0 is in favor of the stimulating effects of industrial robots on green technology innovation. Finally, valuable policy advices are proposed based on the empirical results.","Lee, Chien Chiang;Qin, Shuai;Li, Yaya",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-10-01,Jiangsu University;Nanchang University,Green technology innovation ;  Industrial robot ;  Manufacturing ;  Mediation effect model ;  Moderation effect model
Surface engineering using PDMS and functionalized nanoparticles for superhydrophobic coatings: Selective liquid repellence and tackling COVID-19,"Recently, synthesis and design of bioinspired nanostructured coated surfaces with exceptional selective liquid repellency (superhydrophobicity) have been a fascinating area of research because of their excellent utility in various applications from our daily life to industry level. In this context, superhydrophobic coatings by the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) along with functionalized nanoparticles have been reported widely for oil/water separation, antimicrobial ability and antiviral surface coatings to prevent the transmission of contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PDMS is mechanically stable and highly flexible silicone polymer and can be irreversibly bound to various types of surfaces in order to provide superhydrophobicity. This review highlights the latest innovations in the research area of PDMS based nano-engineered superhydrophobic coatings on various surfaces. Particular attention has been paid toward the application of such superhydrophobic surfaces for the separation of oily contaminants from water as well as antimicrobial and antiviral efficacy in order to reduce the transmission of toxic pathogens including contagious COVID-19. Technical breakthrough and mechanistic concepts behind the success of PDMS based superhydrophobic coatings have been reviewed and discussed in these selected applications. It is expected that this study will be highly useful to lead future research in order to tackle the transmission of viral outbreaks in the coming future similar to the currently ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.","Singh, Arun K.",Journal,Progress in Organic Coatings,2022-10-01,"Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University), Mullana",COVID-19 ;  Oil/water separation ;  Polydimethylsiloxane ;  Special wettability ;  Superhydrophobic engineered coatings
Knowledge for a warmer world: A patent analysis of climate change adaptation technologies,"Technologies can help strengthen the resilience of our economy against existential climate-risks. We investigate climate change adaptation technologies (CCATs) in US patents to understand (1) historical patterns and possible drivers of innovation; (2) scientific and technological requirements to develop and use CCATs; and (3) CCATs’ potential technological synergies with mitigation. First, in contrast to mitigation, innovation in CCATs only slowly takes off, indicating a relatively low awareness of investors for solutions to cope with climate risks. We discuss how historical trends in environmental regulation, energy prices, and public support may have contributed to patenting in CCATs. Second, CCATs form two main clusters: science-intensive ones in agriculture, health, and monitoring technologies; and engineering-intensive ones in coastal, water, and infrastructure technologies. Analyses of technology-specific scientific and technological knowledge bases inform directions for how to facilitate advancement, transfer and use of CCATs. Lastly, CCATs show strong technological complementarities with mitigation as more than 25% of CCATs bear mitigation benefits. While not judging about the complementarity of mitigation and adaptation in general, our results suggest how policymakers can harness these technological synergies to achieve both goals simultaneously.","Hötte, Kerstin;Jee, Su Jung",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-10-01,Oxford Social Sciences Division;University of Bradford School of Management;University of Oxford;Universität Bielefeld,Adaptation ;  Climate change ;  Innovation ;  Patent data ;  R&D policy ;  Technology–science interactions
Water governance diversity across Europe: Does legacy generate sticking points in implementing multi-level governance?,"The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to protect and improve water quality across Europe through an integrative and multi-level water governance approach. The goal is to ensure that water quality in Europe meets good ecological status by 2027. Whilst the WFD has been hailed as a cornerstone for governance innovation in water management, most EU member states (MS) still struggle to achieve good ecological status of their waters. The realignment to a multi-level governance structure under the WFD is discretionary, and has generated diversity in WFD multi-level governance implementation approaches and final governance arrangements across MS. This diversity may contribute to low goal achievement and weak compliance. This paper investigates how visual impressions of legislative structure across nine MS can illustrate and contribute to understanding the differences in multi-level implementation of WFD and associated water protection directives. We explore, in-depth, the drivers of visual differences in Portugal, Germany (Lower Saxony) and France. We hypothesise that many of the challenges of WFD implementation, and resulting governance arrangements can be explained in terms of the legacy effects of previous water governance choices. With this conceptual framework of investigating the history and legacy, we found the three in depth studies have had different starting points, paths, and end points in their water governance, with sticking points influencing the decision-making processes and compliance required by the WFD. Sticking points include the complexity of existing water governance structures, lobbying by different sectors, and the mandatory WFD timeline for implementation. Portugal had to resolve its focus on water infrastructure and engineering to enable a re-focus on water quality. France and Portugal experienced ‘top down’ governance at different points in time, slowing the shift to a multi-level governance system. Lower Saxony, representing just one of 16 federal state systems in Germany, highlighted the complex historic governance structures which cannot easily be restructured, generating a layering effect where new governance systems are fitted to old governance systems. We conclude that there is a need to implement a hybrid approach to water governance and WFD implementation including decentralisation (discretionary) to ensure collaboration and engagement of stakeholders at the local level. This hybrid governance system should run in parallel with a centralised (mandatory) governance and regulatory system to enable national environmental standards to be set and enforced. Such systems may provide the best of both worlds (bottom-up involvement of stakeholders meeting top-down goal achievements) and is worthy of further research.","Rowbottom, Jenny;Graversgaard, Morten;Wright, Isobel;Dudman, Karl;Klages, Susanne;Heidecke, Claudia;Surdyk, Nicolas;Gourcy, Laurence;Leitão, Ines Amorim;Ferreira, António Dinis;Wuijts, Susanne;Boekhold, Sandra;Doody, Donnacha G.;Glavan, Matjaž;Cvejić, Rozalija;Velthof, Gerard",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2022-10-01,"Johann Heinrich von Thünen Institute;Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Belfast;Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra;Univerza v Ljubljani;Aarhus Universitet;University of Oxford;University of Lincoln;Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu;Universiteit Utrecht;BRGM;Wageningen University & Research",Compliance ;  Diffuse water pollution from agriculture ;  Governance arrangements ;  Policy implementation ;  River basin approach ;  Sticking points ;  Water quality
Gender inequities in medical research funding is driving an exodus of women from Australian STEMM academia,"Universally, women are under-represented in senior academic leadership in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM). Successful funding outcomes are a critical point in career progression, to continue both a scientist’s research but also for their retention within the STEMM workforce. A common explanation for the lower success rate of women in securing funding is that fewer women apply for funding. However, this does not adequately explain the gender inequities in funding outcomes, both in terms of fewer funded applications and also of reduced funding awarded per grant, resulting in less overall success. Gendered funding outcomes occur within academic institutions and peak funding bodies due to historical, systemic conscious and unconscious biases during peer review. As a cumulative bias over a woman’s research career, this results in women being under-represented in STEMM and the loss of their contributions to medical research, reducing innovation through a lack of diverse workforces.","Borger, Jessica G.;Purton, Louise E.",Journal,Immunology and Cell Biology,2022-10-01,University of Melbourne;Monash University;St Vincent's Institute,academia ;  bias ;  funding ;  gender ;  STEMM ;  women
A new index-based hyper-heuristic algorithm for global optimisation problems,"In this research study, a new combination search algorithm, based on indexing its constituent processes, is proposed to solve global optimisation problems. As optimisation problems become more complex, especially real-world problems, the use of higher-performance algorithms has become essential. One of the techniques that lead to design of an algorithm with stronger strategies in exploration and exploitation, as well as a better balance between these two strategies, is the appropriate combination of parent algorithm processes. The proposed algorithm was developed using a new innovation with the help of the supply-demand-based optimisation and the Harris hawks optimisation algorithms processes as parent algorithms. In this algorithm, the local and global search sections of its parent algorithms, are separated, and then based on a new indexing method in each iteration, according to the current population indexing, a global search and a local search are selected from the processes of its parent algorithms, and then the current population is updated with two selected sections. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving well-known standard benchmark problems and in solving real-world engineering problems have been tested and validated by statistical tools. The results of the research study show that the proposed algorithm can provide very effective results compared to other competing algorithms as well as its parent algorithms in many tests. The results show that the proper combination of optimisation algorithm processes can be used as a technique to design more powerful algorithms to solve global optimisation problems, especially complex real-world problems.","Hasanzadeh, Mohammad Reza;Keynia, Farshid;Hashemipour, Maliheh",Journal,IET Software,2022-10-01,"Graduate University of Advanced Technology;Islamic Azad University, Kerman Branch",combination in meta-heuristic algorithms ;  improving meta-heuristic strategies ;  indexing in meta-heuristic algorithms ;  indexing meta-heuristic processes ;  performance indices and evaluation
Bringing together the whats and hows in the service innovation literature: An integrative framework,"The concept of service has gone through both evolutionary and revolutionary changes, but this has had little effect on the way reviews portray service innovation research. Our paper is the first to investigate whether and how different conceptualizations of service influence the formation of perspectives on studying and practicing service innovation. Combining an exploratory content analysis with a thorough examination of 886 articles on service innovation published from 1981 to 2019, we suggest a novel integrative framework for the multiple perspectives on service innovation. We outline new service development, service engineering, service infusion, service design, service reconfiguration and service integration as autonomous, yet interconnected, perspectives, each with its own research focus, logic and vocabulary. This integrative framework can assist with defining research questions and designing innovation studies, as well as selecting approaches to managing innovation. We also argue that the main obstacles to the progress of service innovation research are lexical cross-contamination, parallelism in approaches, the gravity of the new service development perspective and the legacy of new product development. To overcome these challenges, we encourage a more distinct pluralism of perspectives and demonstrate possibilities for meaningful conversations across them.","Kurtmollaiev, Seidali;Pedersen, Per Egil",Journal,International Journal of Management Reviews,2022-10-01,Kristiania University College;University of South-Eastern Norway;NHH Norwegian School of Economics,

"Metal matrix nanocomposites in tribology: Manufacturing, performance, and mechanisms","Metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) become irreplaceable in tribology industries, due to their supreme mechanical properties and satisfactory tribological behavior. However, due to the dual complexity of MMNC systems and tribological process, the anti-friction and anti-wear mechanisms are unclear, and the subsequent tribological performance prediction and design of MMNCs are not easily possible: A critical up-to-date review is needed for MMNCs in tribology. This review systematically summarized the fabrication, manufacturing, and processing techniques for high-quality MMNC bulk and surface coating materials in tribology. Then, important factors determining the tribological performance (mainly anti-friction evaluation by the coefficient of friction (CoF) and anti-wear assessment with wear rate) in MMNCs have been investigated thoroughly, and the correlations have been analyzed to reveal their potential coupling/synergetic roles of tuning tribological behavior of MMNCs. Most importantly, this review combined the classical metal/alloy friction and wear theories and adapted them to give a (semi-)quantitative description of the detailed mechanisms of improved anti-friction and anti-wear performance in MMNCs. To guarantee the universal applications of these mechanisms, their links with the analyzed influencing factors (e.g., loading forces) and characteristic features like tribo-film have been clarified. This approach forms a solid basis for understanding, predicting, and engineering MMNCs’ tribological behavior, instead of pure phenomenology and experimental observation. Later, the pathway to achieve a broader application for MMNCs in tribo-related fields like smart materials, biomedical devices, energy storage, and electronics has been concisely discussed, with the focus on the potential development of modeling, experimental, and theoretical techniques in MMNCs’ tribological processes. In general, this review tries to elucidate the complex tribo-performances of MMNCs in a fundamentally universal yet straightforward way, and the discussion and summary in this review for the tribological performance in MMNCs could become a useful supplementary to and an insightful guidance for the current MMNC tribology study, research, and engineering innovations.

Examining Client-Vendor Relationship in the Outsourcing of a Work Environment Virtualisation: An Activity Theory Perspective,"This study provides an insight into the duality of client and vendor relationship (CVR) in information technology (IT) outsourcing by adopting a composite view of a subject in activity theory analysis. Evidence in the literature shows a trend that outsourcing relationships have become strategic assets with clients scouting for not only technical outcomes but for business ideas and innovation from their suppliers. Whilst extant literature demonstrates the critical role of outsourcing relationships in outsourcing success and value, the research on IT outsourcing has largely examined outsourcing relationships in general, focusing on the factors, challenges and a one-sided view of the CVR and providing no insights on the relationship between the client and vendor from a composite perspective. To explore this, our study employed an interpretive qualitative case study method and activity theory as the lens. Drawing on hermeneutics to analyse the data, the findings show the need for activity theory to cater for the duality of subjects in a collaborative way. Implications of the study for practice and policy are then provided.","Effah, John;Adam, Ibrahim Osman",Journal,Information Systems Frontiers,2022-10-01,University of Ghana Business School;University for Development Studies Ghana,Activity theory ;  Client-vendor relationship ;  Developing country ;  Outsourcing ;  Work environment virtualisation
The impact of women as human capital on perceiving sustainable development in Egyptian industry,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of women as human capital on sustainable development in the Egyptian community factories. Presently, sustainability has become one of the targets all over the world, especially the Egyptian strategy that focuses more on women’s empowerment as human capital. There is a positive trend among organizations, governments and communities to focus more on the lead of sustainability in all our daily activities and business activities. Design/methodology/approach: Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to gather data from 100 engineers (50 women and 50 men) employees of Egyptian factories and industries located in Egypt. To analyze, the collected data, regression analysis and correlation coefficient were employed to examine the study objectives and questions. A statistical Package for Social Sciences has been used for data analysis. Findings: Results reveal that there is a direct positive relationship between women as a capital and sustainable development with its four interrelated pillars (economic, social, environmental and education) in a positive and significant way and the three factors of Human Capital (leadership and motivation, qualifications and satisfaction and creativity). Research limitations/implications: The findings only apply to the sample (engineering women, men) that has participated in the questionnaire in the Egyptian factories. More research would be recommended in terms of further research study, highlighting the role of women in other categories in the STEM field as they are the human capital crucial for sustainable development and highlighting its impact on the Egyptian sustainable strategy 2030. Practical implications: Although the Egyptian strategy reinforces gender equality and gaining more roles for women in the Egyptian community, there is still absence of women in factories and science. Based on the findings, there are three concerns that must be addressed: First, opportunities need to be embedded in the factories for more women, especially in engineering categories. Second, authorities must encourage human capital development for women. Third, there is a strong need to create responsible leadership between all human capitals which are especially important in areas of industry. Social implications: Egyptian factories need to support women’s enthusiasm for innovation, continuously advance science and engineering, foster a business environment that fosters the coexistence of science and technology, the economy and society, support enterprise transformation and optimize the industrial structure of Egyptian industry. Simultaneously, it should encourage and promote the transformation of female achievements and strengthen the role of women leadership enterprises in Egyptian society. In order to promote the ideas of women, more money must be spent on scientific research, human capital must be allocated more effectively and fresh momentum for sustainable economic growth must be generated. It must expand training investment, encourage high-quality human capital and remove the bottleneck. Originality/value: This paper is unique in presenting women as human capital in Egyptian society and reflects its impact on sustainable development pillars. Although much literature and study is dealing with the two topics of human capital and sustainable development separately or with links to other topics, they have not been dealt with together and there is a scarcity in the literature related to these topics focusing on women separately.","Shaaban, Safaa",Journal,Management and Sustainability:,2022-09-30,The British University in Egypt,Factory in Egypt ;  Human capital ;  Sustainable development ;  Women empowerment
A Research on Technology Innovation and Efficiency Improvement Correlation with Bank Performance Based on Data Envelopment Analysis,"Technology evolution plays an important role in current commercial banking industry. Identification on the impact of technology innovation and efficiency improvement is essential for commercial bank operating performance. For his purpose, based on the measurement on technology innovation and efficiency improvement indexes of Chinese commercial banks with the method of non-parametric Malmquist Data Envelopment Analysis, fixed effect panel data models are constructed to empirically analyze the relevance between technology innovation, efficiency improvement and bank performance with 41 Chinese commercial banks. Correlation analysis results show that technology innovation can promote the Chinese commercial bank performance significantly, but the positive correlation impact effect varies from different types of commercial banks; the improvement of scale efficiency is positively correlated with the performance of both the giant State-Owned banks and the regional commercial banks; while the improvement of pure technical efficiency shows no significant performance influence over all types of commercial banks in China.","Zhou, Zhigang",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-09-28,Wuhan Business University,Chinese Commercial Bank ;  Commercial Bank Performance ;  Data Envelopment Analysis ;  Efficiency Improvement ;  Innovation and Efficiency Measurement ;  Technology Innovation

A state-of-the-art review and prospect of gas hydrate reservoir drilling techniques,"Securing energy means grasping the key link in the national development and security strategy. Under the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, the overall tendency of energy development is to increase the proportion of natural gas while stabilizing oil consumption, and the global primary energy is entering the era of natural gas. Gas hydrate in deep seabed shallow strata and extremely cold permafrost regions has piqued the interest of researchers due to its abundant resources, widespread distribution, and high energy density. Although the drilling of hydrate wells is still fraught with unknowns and challenges due to the technological barriers between countries, complex on-site working conditions, and unique physical chemical properties, accumulation forms, and occurrence characteristics of gas hydrate, more than ten successful trial productions around the world have opened the door of hope for the development of this potentially new energy. The gas hydrate reservoir drilling technique is the frontier and hotspot of scientific and technological innovation and competitiveness around the globe today, reflecting the level of oil and gas technical advancement. At the national level, it possesses strategic and revolutionary features. Innovative drilling techniques, scientific well location layout, appropriate wellbore structure and well trajectory design, efficient drilling fluid, qualified drilling and completion equipment, and successful pressure-temperature preserved coring may all provide a strong guarantee for the successful completion of gas hydrate wells. This review comprehensively reviews the drilling techniques and engineering measures that can be used to develop gas hydrate. It focuses on the research advancement of important hydrate drilling technologies and the enlightening significance of these developments in the application of hydrate drilling. This work will deliver valuable experience as well as comprehensive scientific information for gas hydrate exploration and drilling.","Wei, Na;Pei, Jun;Zhao, Jinzhou;Zhang, Liehui;Zhou, Shouwei;Luo, Pingya;Li, Haitao;Wu, Jiang",Journal,Frontiers in Earth Science,2022-09-27,Chongqing University;Southwest Petroleum University China;State Key Laboratory of Natural Gas Hydrate,challenge ;  drilling equipment ;  drilling fluid ;  drilling technique ;  gas hydrate ;  hydrate reservoir ;  pressure coring technique ;  wellbore structure
Cyclic Voltammetry Study of Noble Metals and Their Alloys for Use in Implantable Electrodes,"Innovation in the application and miniaturization of implantable electrodes has caused a spike in new electrode material research; however, few robust studies are available that compare different metal electrodes in biologically relevant media. Herein, cyclic voltammetry has been employed to compare platinum, palladium, and gold-based electrodes' potentiometric scans and their corresponding charge storage capacities (CSCs). Ten different noble metals and alloys in these families were tested under pseudophysiological conditions in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Charge storage capacity values (mC/cm2) were calculated for the oxide reduction, hydrogen adsorption, hydrogen desorption, and oxide formation peaks. Five scan rates spanning 2 orders of magnitude (10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 mV/s) in both sparged and aerated environments were evaluated. Materials have been ranked by their charge storage capacities, reversibility, and trends discussed. Palladium-based alloys outperformed platinum-based alloys in the sparged condition and were ranked equally as high in the aerated condition. The Paliney 1100 (Pd-Re) alloy gave the highest observed calculated CSC value of 0.64 ± 0.02 mC/cm2in the aerated condition, demonstrating 73 ± 5% reversibility. Trends between metal electrode families elicited in this study can afford valuable insight into future engineering of high performing implantable electrode materials.","Puglia, Megan K.;Bowen, Patrick K.",Journal,ACS Omega,2022-09-27,"Deringer-Ney, Inc.",
Mechanistic Principles for Engineering Hierarchical Porous Metal-Organic Frameworks,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have generated tremendous research interest in the past two decades, due to their high surface areas, tailorable active sites, and tunable structures. Hierarchical porous MOFs (HP-MOFs) with two or more pore systems are particularly attractive, benefiting from improved active site accessibility and enhanced mass diffusivity in applications involving bulk molecules. This review outlines the mechanistic principles used for the rational design of HP-MOFs, current techniques used to measure their hierarchical porosities, as well as their emerging applications. We then critically summarize the current challenges in this field and provide a contemporary perspective on the technological innovations that would address current synthetic challenges in the field of HP-MOFs. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth understanding of the formation mechanisms, materials chemistry, and structural and chemical properties of HP-MOFs while exploring ways to enhance the performance of current MOF materials in a range of fields.","Liu, Min;Zu, Lianhai;Hudson, Zachary M.",Journal,ACS Nano,2022-09-27,University of Melbourne;The University of British Columbia,"biological applications ;  catalysis ;  energy production and storage ;  gas sorption, X-ray diffraction/scattering ;  guest encapsulation ;  hierarchical porous metal-organic frameworks ;  scanning/transmission electron microscopy"
"Study on the Coupling Interaction of Green Technology Innovation, New Energy Industry Agglomeration and Carbon Emission Efficiency","This study examines the relationship between green technology innovation, new energy industry agglomeration and carbon emission efficiency from 2008 to 2019 in 30 provinces in China (apart from Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan). According to the study, the mean value of the three couples' average coupling coordination degree is between 0.03 and 0.49, which means that they are still in the maladjustment stage and on the verge of forced coordination. And the dynamic PVAR model is further established to study and conclude that green technology innovation is fostered by carbon emission efficiency, which is also boosted by new energy industry agglomeration. However, there is no correlation between green technology innovation and new energy industry agglomeration, and the three systems have not formed a good circular driving effect temporarily.","Wang, Yubo;Cheng, Shiyun",Conference Proceeding,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2022-09-26,Hubei University of Technology,carbon emission efficiency ;  coupling coordination degree ;  Green technology ;  new energy industry ;  PVAR model ;  super-SBM model
Polymeric nanotechnologies for the treatment of periodontitis: A chronological review,"Periodontitis is a chronic infectious and inflammatory disease of periodontal tissues estimated to affect 70–80 % of all adults. At the same time, periodontium, the site of periodontal pathologies, is an extraordinarily complex plexus of soft and hard tissues, the regeneration of which using even the most advanced forms of tissue engineering continues to be a challenge. Nanotechnologies, meanwhile, have provided exquisite tools for producing biomaterials and pharmaceutical formulations capable of elevating the efficacies of standard pharmacotherapies and surgical approaches to whole new levels. A bibliographic analysis provided here demonstrates a continuously increasing research output of studies on the use of nanotechnologies in the management of periodontal disease, even when they are normalized to the total output of studies on periodontitis. The great majority of biomaterials used to tackle periodontitis, including those that pioneered this interesting field, have been polymeric. In this article, a chronological review of polymeric nanotechnologies for the treatment of periodontitis is provided, focusing on the major conceptual innovations since the late 1990s, when the first nanostructures for the treatment of periodontal diseases were fabricated. In the opening sections, the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontitis and the anatomical and histological characteristics of the periodontium are being described, along with the general clinical manifestations of the disease and the standard means of its therapy. The most prospective chemistries in the design of polymers for these applications are also elaborated. It is concluded that the amount of innovation in this field is on the rise, despite the fact that most studies are focused on the refinement of already established paradigms in tissue engineering rather than on the development of revolutionary new concepts.","Uskoković, Vuk;Pejčić, Ana;Koliqi, Rozafa;Anđelković, Zlatibor",Journal,International Journal of Pharmaceutics,2022-09-25,College of Engineering;University of Pristina - Kosovska Mitrovica;University of Nis Medical Faculty;Universiteti i Prishtinës;TardigradeNano LLC,Alveolar bone ;  Cementum ;  Drug delivery ;  Gingiva ;  Guided tissue regeneration ;  Nanoparticles ;  Periodontal ligament
Barrel Distortion Correction for Digital Optic-Based Motion Tracking in Ship Hydrodynamic Model Experiments,"In hydrodynamic ship-model experiments, motion tracking of ship model trajectory is employed to predict the maneuverability of the ship when operating in its actual environment. There are some systems for motion tracking, such as inertial measurement unit, radar, laser, and infrared sensors. The system has proven reliable, however, the disadvantage is that they are all relatively expensive. This paper proposes a low-cost digital optic-based motion tracking system using consumer-grade video camera. In order to examine the accuracy of the system, some experiments to apply the method were carried out in maneuvering offshore engineering basin at the Indonesian Hydrodynamics Laboratory, The National Agency for Research and Innovation. To cover a broader area of the trajectory, a wide-angle camera lens was utilized, consequently, the image recorded by the camera experienced a barrel distortion. As a reference for the measurements, gridlines spaced 2 meters apart were drawn on the floor of the basin. Using the grid pattern, the distortion was corrected by finding the relationship between the grid pattern in the object space and in the distorted image. A fourth-order polynomial regression was applied to solve the problem. The results showed that the method was effective for correcting distorted images with a relative standard error of 0.42%.","Irawanto, Z.;Ariana, I.

A review of latest trends in bridge health monitoring,"Structural damage is inherent in civil engineering structures, and bridges are no exception. It is vital to monitor and keep track of damage in bridge structures as a result of multiple mechanical, environmental and traffic-induced factors. Monitoring the formation and propagation of structural damage is also pertinent for enhancing the service life of bridges. Bridge health monitoring (BHM) has always been an active research area for engineers and stakeholders. While all monitoring techniques intend to provide accurate and decisive information on the remaining useful life, safety, integrity and serviceability of bridges, maintaining uninterrupted operation of a bridge relies strongly on understanding the development and propagation of damage. BHM methods have been extensively researched on bridges over the decades, and new methodologies have started to be used by domain experts, especially within the last decade. Emerging methods, as the products of technology advancements, have resulted in handy tools that have been quickly adopted by bridge engineers. State-of-the-art techniques such as lidar, photogrammetry, virtual reality, augmented reality, digital twins, computer vision, machine learning and deep learning are now integrated parts of the new-generation of BHM operations. This paper presents a brief overview of these latest BHM technologies.","Catbas, Necati;Avci, Onur",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Bridge Engineering,2022-09-12,Benjamin M.

"Erratum: Celebrating the Next Generation of Women in Computational Chemistry to Increase Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Respect (Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling (2022) 62:13 (3133-3134) DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00663)","There is an increasing number of excellent women at the graduate and postdoctoral level who require support and mentorship to pursue a successful academic career.1 Despite their talent, women remain under-represented in science, with a gender gap particularly evident in the fundamental sciences and technology.2 An exclusion culture and gender bias can be considered at the basis of this phenomenon, with family and care commitments contributing to the loss of talented women along the academic path. Nevertheless, the perspectives and creativity of women have been shown to contribute to important scientific discoveries. Visionary women have transformed the way we look at genetic information, from the groundbreaking work of Rosalind Franklin to understand DNA and RNA3 to the latest most exciting discoveries by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier to edit genes.4 Inspiring pioneers in computational chemistry include Mary Ann Mansigh Karlsen, who worked as a computer programmer with Berni Alder and Tom Wainwright in the early implementation of molecular dynamics in the midtwentieth century.5 As scientists, we know that diversity enhances creativity, and we should be excited about the prospect of creating new knowledge in a scientific environment that welcomes diversity. The American Chemical Society (ACS) is pursuing several activities to mentor and inspire the next generation of women. In particular, the computational chemistry community has been very active in supporting research, mentorship, and networking of young women. The “Women Make Computational Chemistry (COMP)” has been the first symposium dedicated to young women students and postdocs pulling together established women leaders in computational/theoretical chemistry and the next generation of young women scientists.6 “Women Make COMP” was tremendously successful among young women scientists who could recognize themselves in a strong supportive community. These difficulties can be even more severe for women of color, who also are experiencing the difficulties that women face in academia. These include difficulties in pursuing higher education, including social, economic, and cultural exclusions, which results in few women of color in academics. A study by Gretter et al.7 revealed that the lack of experience in computations and coding is dramatically affecting minority students, resulting in African Americans making up less than 9% of the science and engineering workforce. Despite these struggles, women of color have made impressive contributions to science and technology.9 Black women have been instrumental in winning the space race. Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson were three mathematicians of African American background, who worked as “human computers” at NASA during the space race. Katherine Johnson calculated rocket trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions8,9 but was not allowed to join meetings with men until her scientific skills were fully recognized. Dorothy Vaughan was a NASA pioneer who faced racial segregation and had to overcome prejudice, before becoming a leading scientist processing aeronautical research data.10 She was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal post-mortem. Mary Jackson was NASA’s first black female engineer,11 becoming a role model and championing women of color in STEM. In recognition of her contribution and effort to increase diversity, the Washington, DC headquarters of NASA has been renamed the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters. These extraordinary women show us the potential of women of color in science. THE CREATIVITY, TALENT, AND LATERAL THINKING, WITH RESPECT TO CANONICAL OPINIONS, OF WOMEN OF COLOR CAN TRANSFORM CONVENTIONS AND IDEAS, ULTIMATELY FOSTERING INNOVATION. Following the example of “Women Make COMP”, the ACS recently organized the “Black, Indigenous, and People of Color Make COMP” symposium, dedicated to Black, Latinx, and Native American young scientists. Established leaders with African American, Hispanic, and Native American backgrounds shared their career experiences and offered guidance. It was the first time that such a one-on-one mentorship was offered to young people of color in the field of computational/theoretical chemistry. This should be only the beginning of a long-term commitment of the scientific community, which should focus on measures we can take to overcome the hurdles that underrepresented minorities are facing in science. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Respect (DEIR) is a core value of the ACS. The cover of the DEIR issue of the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling is a handmade painting depicting a woman of color and her extraordinary brain power. With this issue of JCIM, we aim to celebrate the creativity and talent of women of color in computational chemistry.","Palermo, Giulia",Journal,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,2022-09-12,Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering,

An investigation of humble leadership on scientific creativity from the multi - level perspective,"The relationship between humble leadership and creativity is an emerging research topic in the context of organizational change, but most of the previous studies were limited to a single level. We argue that it is necessary to distinguish between individual - focused and team - focused humble leadership and their unique influences on individual and team level scientific creativity to fully understand how team leaders stimulate science and technology innovation effectively. Using multi - level data from 404 science and engineering undergraduates of 100 science and technology innovation teams across 78 universities in China, we examine the independent and interactive effects of multi - level focused humility leadership on individual and team scientific creativity. The results show that: at the individual level, individual - focused humble leadership has a positive effect on individual scientific creativity, which is mediated by individual perspective taking. At the team level, team - focused humble leadership has a positive effect on team scientific creativity, and team perspective taking mediates this positive effect. Furthermore, team perspective taking constructs a cross - level situational factor, which not only moderates the effect of individual perspective taking on individual scientific creativity, but also moderates the indirect effect of individual - focused humble leadership on individual scientific creativity through individual perspective taking. The above effects are stronger when team perspective taking is high. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Li, Hai Hong;Zhang, Jian Wei;Zhou, Yu Fan;Xuan, Xing Yu;Zhao, Hui",Journal,Studies in Science of Science,2022-09-01,Shandong University of Finance and Economics;Qingdao University;Henan Normal University;Shanxi University of Finance and EcoNomics;Beijing Institute of Technology,humble leadership ;  multilevel model ;  perspective taking ;  scientific creativity

Emerging Technological Frameworks for the Sustainable Agriculture and Environmental Management,"The global human population is constantly increasing whereas the agricultural land resources are declining for reasons of urban settlements and industrial growth. This has certainly strained the agricultural sector for increased annual yields, especially under the changing climate. To accomplish the rising demand of consumers’ for food, feed and fiber, up to 70% upsurge in the crop production is farsighted by 2050. For this purpose, the accessible resources of the modern agriculture have been harnessed mainly through conventional genetics approaches in the past decades. Presently, the advent of state-of-the-art biotechnologies is addressing such field challenges for continuous ‘agricultural success’. Here, we deliberate about the resourceful agricultural practices by the durable alliance of i) molecular breeding, genetic-engineering (GE) and gene-editing technologies for increased crop yields and decreased biotic/abiotic stress-mediated agricultural losses, and ii) environment resilience including solutions to make all aspects of our lives sustainable. We also provide an overview of the ecological affability of engineered crop events worldwide; and also the deployment of biotechnology methodologies to address challenges in the sustainability of renewable resources including biomass to biofuel, and bioremediation processes. Further, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-empowered solutions to crop challenges is revolutionizing the prevailing agri-resources and providing a roadmap to the next-generation crop management and environment resilience. In order to enhance the agricultural production under continuously changing climate, and to achieve the environmental sustainability goals, various technological field-innovations have been discussed, and research gaps are identified for future research developments.","Chaudhary, Bhupendra;Kumar, Vijay",Journal,Sustainable Horizons,2022-09-01,Shivaji College;Gautam Buddha University,Agriculture ;  Artificial Intelligence ;  Bioenergy ;  Biofuels ;  Environment ;  GM crops

Mechanism analysis of catastrophic instability of drilling shaft lining based on Python language,"Vertical instability of drilling shaft lining is a mechanical problem with gradual change to abrupt change. How to combine traditional mechanical model with modern mathematical methods to achieve quantitative research on this instability mechanism analysis is the theoretical innovation on vertical stability of drilling shaft lining structure and the research content of this paper as well. When the shaft suspended and sunk to the bottom of the well, a certain amount of elastic potential energy is accumulated. At this time, the state of stable equilibrium is dynamic, and the shaft may tilt, slip, or even lose stability., and strengthened monitoring and effective prevention is necessary. In this paper, based on the theory of catastrophe and the mechanics model of shaft wall suspension and subsidence, the total potential energy function and the cusp catastrophe model for vertical instability of shaft lining were established. According to the equilibrium surface and bifurcation point equation of the model, the quantitative determination conditions of the instability are given. The results show that the values of the control variables m and n directly determine the stable equilibrium state of the shaft wall. When Δ>0, the control variable (m,n) falls outside the bipartite point set, the system is located at the upper and lower blade of the equilibrium surface, and the shaft structure is in a stable equilibrium state. When Δ<0 the control variable (m,n) falls inside the bipartite point set, the system is located at the middle of the equilibrium surface, and the shaft structure is in an unstable equilibrium state. When Δ= 0, the control variable (m,n) falls on the boundary of the bipartite point set and the structure is in a critical stable equilibrium state. Furthermore, based on thecritical condition of stable equilibrium, the critical depth formula of vertical instability of shaft lining full and non-full water is established. At the same time, in order to popularize the engineering application of the catastrophic model analysis method, the flow chart of instability analysis and judgment is established by using Python language, which provides the theoretical basis for monitoring and forecasting and well type parameter optimization. Combined with an engineering example, it is found that the critical depth based on catastrophe theory in this paper is 0.396% and 7.15% different from those obtained by energy method respectively under full water and non-full water condition. Therefore, the study method of shaft lining structure stability based on catastrophe theory can effectively explain the vertical instability of shaft lining structure.","Liu, Jimin;Liu, Yuanfei;Fu, Xiaochang",Journal,Meitan Kexue Jishu/Coal Science and Technology (Peking),2022-09-01,Anhui University of Science and Technology,critical depth ;  cusp catastrophe theory ;  Phthon language ;  shaft lining instability ;  vertical instability
Assessment of urban rainfall runoff technological readiness level improvement and challenges in technological development produced by “Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment”,"This article carefully sorted out the key technologies of urban runoff pollution elimination researched or developed by the “National Science and Technology Major Project of China: Water Pollution Control and Treatment” in “Eleventh Five-Year Plan” and “Twelfth Five-Year Plan”. According the readiness assessment results of these key technologies, the level of development of urban runoff pollution control technology in China and the challenges it faced were discussed, which will provide effective guidance for further promoting the development of urban rainfall runoff pollution control technology and technical support for the construction of sponge cities, the treatment of black and odorous water bodies, and the improvement of urban water environment. The evaluation results showed that a lot of research work in the field of urban rainfall runoff pollution control technology has been carried out in China. Most of single key technologies which had been developed and applied had reached level 7 readiness, which could solve the problem of urban rainfall pollution to a certain extent in China. In the urban rainfall runoff pollution control technology system, the supporting technology system had a readiness 4th level, reaching the stage of system development and verification, enabling systematic engineering design to reduce integration risks. The system readiness of four key technical links and urban rainfall runoff pollution control technology series had reached 3rd and 2nd level, respectively. In terms of technical links and series, only systems, design and development strategies were formed to reduce system integration risks to a certain extent and form combined technologies.

The European Education Initiative as a Mitigation Mechanism for Energy Transition,"The transformation of the European energy sector is becoming a priority for the European Union. This is indicated, for instance, in the European Union strategy known as the European Green Deal. According to the Green Deal, the area of ‘research and innovation’ is one which can counteract climate change. Universities can play a significant role in this by adopting a pedagogical approach aimed at mobilizing the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship in young professionals. In addition to modifying curricula related to mining, energy, and environmental engineering, i.e., activities in recognized, traditional schemes, one prospective tool may be the involvement of students and PhD candidates in European initiatives such as the InnoEnergy PhD School (which is funded by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology). This paper aims to discuss the InnoEnergy PhD School programme as a possible instrument for mitigating the negative effects of energy transformation. The article analyzes the programme using a case study method, including surveys and open interviews. The paper draws attention to and highlights the role of human resources in the field of education and the stimulation of innovation, as well as the need to strengthen the business component in the education of PhD candidates.","Kowalska, Natalia;Brodawka, Ewelina;Smoliński, Adam;Zarębska, Katarzyna",Journal,Energies,2022-09-01,Główny Instytut Górnictwa;AGH University of Krakow,energy transformation ;  European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) ;  Green Deal ;  InnoEnergy ;  innovative education initiatives
Post-COVID-19 Transition in University Physics Courses: A Case of Study in a Mexican University,"The extended confinement imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns resulted in the imposition of online education for two years. Many students experienced their transitions to higher educative levels during this time, surely losing some academic learning as a consequence. On the other hand, this context could have promoted different types of competencies, until recently not explored, as a function of students’ personalities or academic profiles. Physics teaching is among those areas which have changed from its traditional methods during this period. The return to school during the ‘New Normal’ has resulted in certain concerns about students’ adaptability due to their possible lack of learning over this time. We analyse, in the current research, the transitions of three generations crossing several pandemic stages during their time participating in university physics courses during the first year, a common entry point for engineering programs. In addition, we analyse several academic traits as causal factors of academic success in order to understand how performance could be affected during online education and during the ‘New Normal’. The results highlight a general high level of adaptation for the most of the students, but still, some of them were affected in terms of the functioning of their learning styles or regarding their personality profiles. Notably, no meaningful losses were detected among the last transition; instead, several interesting aspects were found relating to academic profile appearing to have an effect on the students’ performance during the first transition to online education, and then during the second transition back to face-to-face education in the ‘New Normal’.","Delgado, Francisco",Journal,Education Sciences,2022-09-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,COVID-19 ;  educational innovation ;  face-to-face education ;  higher education ;  online education ;  physics ;  ‘New Normal’ transition
Experiential Learning in Biomedical Engineering Education Using Wearable Devices: A Case Study in a Biomedical Signals and Systems Analysis Course,"Biomedical engineering (BME) is one of the fastest-growing engineering fields worldwide. BME professionals are extensively employed in the health technology and healthcare industries. Hence, their education must prepare them to face the challenge of a rapidly evolving technological environment. Biomedical signals and systems analysis is essential to BME undergraduate education. Unfortunately, students often underestimate the importance of their courses as they do not perceive these courses’ practical applications in their future professional practice. In this study, we propose using blended learning spaces to develop new learning experiences in the context of a biomedical signals and systems analysis course to enhance students’ motivation and interest and the relevance of the materials learned. We created a learning experience based on wearable devices and cloud-based collaborative development environments such that the students turned daily-life scenarios into experiential learning spaces. Overall, our results suggest a positive impact on the students’ perceptions of their learning experience concerning relevance, motivation, and interest. Namely, the evidence shows a reduction in the variability of such perceptions. However, further research must confirm this potential impact. This confirmation is required given the monetary and time investment this pedagogical approach would require if it were to be implemented at a larger scale.","Montesinos, Luis;Santos-Diaz, Alejandro;Salinas-Navarro, David E.;Cendejas-Zaragoza, Leopoldo",Journal,Education Sciences,2022-09-01,Aston Business School;Summa Health System;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud TecSalud,biomedical engineering ;  educational innovation ;  engineering education ;  experiential learning ;  higher education ;  wearable devices ;  wearable technology
Visual Communication in Shared Mobility Systems as an Opportunity for Recognition and Competitiveness in Smart Cities,"Due to the intensive development of urbanization and digitization, the number of smart cities in the world is growing. Along with their exposure, more and more challenges are facing the service providers of the various types of systems offered in their area. These types of services include shared mobility systems that, as an alternative to transport by own vehicle, are becoming one of the leading promoted forms of mobility. Because of the prioritization of shared mobility solutions, more and more operators appear on the smart city markets, which is associated with many challenges related to the increased competition among service providers. One of the challenges is the appropriate visibility of the brand and vehicles in urban transport systems. This aspect, despite its high applicability, constitutes a research gap among world studies. Aiming to fill this gap, this article was dedicated to the issues of perception of visual communication by operators of shared mobility services. As part of the research, an expert study was conducted among representatives of shared mobility services operating in Poland. The expert survey was conducted with the Computer-Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) technique. The results of the research show that visual communication is not used quite correctly by operators. Although operators use single visual communication practices, overall consistency is lacking, which would add value to the brand. This article supports operators looking to expand their shared mobility services. What is more, it is also a response to the research gap regarding visual communication and its perception from the point of view of smart cities.","Turoń, Katarzyna;Kubik, Andrzej;Ševčovič, Martin;Tóth, János;Lakatos, András",Journal,Smart Cities,2022-09-01,Budapest University of Technology and Economics;Silesian University of Technology;Univerzita Komenského v Bratislave,civil engineering and transport ;  innovations ;  management ;  mobility management ;  shared mobility ;  smart cities ;  smart living ;  smart transportation and mobility ;  transport resilience ;  visual communication
State-of-the-art on theories and applications of cable-driven parallel robots,"Cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) is a type of high-performance robot that integrates cable-driven kinematic chains and parallel mechanism theory. It inherits the high dynamics and heavy load capacities of the parallel mechanism and significantly improves the workspace, cost and energy efficiency simultaneously. As a result, CDPRs have had irreplaceable roles in industrial and technological fields, such as astronomy, aerospace, logistics, simulators, and rehabilitation. CDPRs follow the cutting-edge trend of rigid-flexible fusion, reflect advanced lightweight design concepts, and have become a frontier topic in robotics research. This paper summarizes the kernel theories and developments of CDPRs, covering configuration design, cable-force distribution, workspace and stiffness, performance evaluation, optimization, and motion control. Kinematic modeling, workspace analysis, and cable-force solution are illustrated. Stiffness and dynamic modeling methods are discussed. To further promote the development, researchers should strengthen the investigation in configuration innovation, rapid calculation of workspace, performance evaluation, stiffness control, and rigid-flexible coupling dynamics. In addition, engineering problems such as cable materials, reliability design, and a unified control framework require attention.

Polymer Foam Concrete FC500 Material Behavior and Its Interaction in a Composite Structure with Standard Cement Concrete Using Small Scale Tests,"This paper focuses on the investigation of the material properties of FC500 foam concrete. Innovation is very important for the solution of cast-in-place concrete forms in practice today. Part of its innovative construction application is the possibility of using foam concrete in a composite structure and the use of its mechanical properties in the load-bearing parts of civil engineering structures. The method of detecting the mechanical properties of foam concrete by using non-standard cantilever test is also innovative. Here, an advanced approach of modelling specimens using powerful computational systems based on the finite element method is used. This modern material is researched especially for its use in transportation structures. For its application, it is necessary to define its resistance to mechanical loads. The main content of the research consists of correlations between experimental measurements and analytical and numerical results. This is the principle of quasi-linear identification of the non-linear behavior of polymeric cementitious porous material during tests on specimens. The focus of the research is an extensive experiment: measurements of the deformation of the specimens until failure. The following methods were chosen to investigate the material properties: small cantilever test, standard tensile test and compression test. The cantilever test was performed for the individual components of the FC500 composite and cement concrete, but also as a compact composite. Numerical simulation models were developed to correlate the individual results in order to validate the uniaxial test results. The conclusions of the research led to the definition of standardized stress–strain diagrams of the FC500 material for compression and especially tension. This is a definition of the behavior of this polymer composite, usable for the development of numerical models of full-scale structures. The results of the research will be applied in the development of national standards for the use of advanced materials in transportation structures (cycle paths, parking lots, traffic playgrounds, lightly trafficked forest roads and trails, etc.).","Papán, Daniel;Ďugel, Daniel;Papánová, Zuzana;Ščotka, Martin",Journal,Polymers,2022-09-01,University of Žilina,analytical model ;  cement concrete ;  experimental measurement ;  numerical model ;  polymer foam concrete ;  stress–strain diagram
Release of Energy from Groundwater/with Reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> Emissions of More Than 50% from HVAC in the Extension and Revitalization of the Former Palace of the Sobieski Family in Lublin,"The direct release of energy from the groundwater under the building of the Sobieski Family Palace in Lublin, Poland, and the obtainment of heat and cooling energy for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning systems (HVAC) provide an opportunity to reduce electricity and heat consumption and to limit CO2 emissions by 15–50%. The upgrade to the Sobieski Family Palace and the addition of new educational and administrative functions require state-of-the-art, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly solutions such as Fuel Cells and Hydrogen for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (FCH HVAC) systems. As part of the program “Research for high-quality air in architecture and urban studies,” carried out since 2018 at the Institute of Architecture Planning, Department of Contemporary Architecture, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture of the Lublin University of Technology, in 2021, further research was carried out in order to prepare for the potential implementation in 2022 of the project entitled “Development and Upgrade of the Former Sobieski Family Palace in Lublin. The main body of the building—educational and administrative function,” whose chief designer was Architect J. Wrana, Lublin University of Technology, 2021. The objective of this paper is to identify technologies and solutions specifically designed for HVAC systems in upgraded and renovated historic buildings. This paper is also a call for cooperation among institutions, scientists, higher education institutions, as well as an expression of appreciation for the immense energy stored in groundwater. This energy not only has the lowest carbon footprint but also is the only generally accessible large storage source from which we were unable to obtain ecologically pure energy before the introduction of FCH technology.","Wrana, Jan;Struzik, Wojciech;Kwiatkowski, Bartłomiej;Gleń, Piotr",Journal,Energies,2022-09-01,Politechnika Lubelska;Sanitary Engineer “WAKAD”,CO  reduction 2 ;  innovation ;  new technologies ;  very low operating costs
Bioavailability Enhancement Techniques for Poorly Aqueous Soluble Drugs and Therapeutics,"The low water solubility of pharmacoactive molecules limits their pharmacological potential, but the solubility parameter cannot compromise, and so different approaches are employed to enhance their bioavailability. Pharmaceutically active molecules with low solubility convey a higher risk of failure for drug innovation and development. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and several other parameters, such as drug distribution, protein binding and absorption, are majorly affected by their solubility. Among all pharmaceutical dosage forms, oral dosage forms cover more than 50%, and the drug molecule should be water-soluble. For good therapeutic activity by the drug molecule on the target site, solubility and bioavailability are crucial factors. The pharmaceutical industry’s screening programs identified that around 40% of new chemical entities (NCEs) face various difficulties at the formulation and development stages. These pharmaceuticals demonstrate less solubility and bioavailability. Enhancement of the bioavailability and solubility of drugs is a significant challenge in the area of pharmaceutical formulations. According to the Classification of Biopharmaceutics, Class II and IV drugs (APIs) exhibit poor solubility, lower bioavailability, and less dissolution. Various technologies are discussed in this article to improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs, for example, the complexation of active molecules, the utilization of emulsion formation, micelles, microemulsions, cosolvents, polymeric micelle preparation, particle size reduction technologies, pharmaceutical salts, prodrugs, the solid-state alternation technique, soft gel technology, drug nanocrystals, solid dispersion methods, crystal engineering techniques and nanomorph technology. This review mainly describes several other advanced methodologies for solubility and bioavailability enhancement, such as crystal engineering, micronization, solid dispersions, nano sizing, the use of cyclodextrins, solid lipid nanoparticles, colloidal drug delivery systems and drug conjugates, referring to a number of appropriate research reports.","Bhalani, Dixit V.;Nutan, Bhingaradiya;Kumar, Avinash;Singh Chandel, Arvind K.",Journal,Biomedicines,2022-09-01,Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR);Central Salt & Marine Chemicals Research Institute;Indian Institute of Technology Bombay;RMIT University;Faculty of Medicine,BCS classification ;  bioavailability ;  crystal engineering ;  dissolution ;  drug conjugates ;  encapsulation ;  low water solubility ;  micelles ;  micronization ;  nanoparticles ;  solid dispersion ;  solid lipid nanoparticles ;  solubility
Current Challenges and Future Research Directions in Augmented Reality for Education,"The progression and adoption of innovative learning methodologies signify that a respective part of society is open to new technologies and ideas and thus is advancing. The latest innovation in teaching is the use of Augmented Reality (AR). Applications using this technology have been deployed successfully in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education for delivering the practical and creative parts of teaching. Since AR technology already has a large volume of published studies about education that reports advantages, limitations, effectiveness, and challenges, classifying these projects will allow for a review of the success in the different educational settings and discover current challenges and future research areas. Due to COVID-19, the landscape of technology-enhanced learning has shifted more toward blended learning, personalized learning spaces and user-centered approach with safety measures. The main findings of this paper include a review of the current literature, investigating the challenges, identifying future research areas, and finally, reporting on the development of two case studies that can highlight the first steps needed to address these research areas. The result of this research ultimately details the research gap required to facilitate real-time touchless hand interaction, kinesthetic learning, and machine learning agents with a remote learning pedagogy.","Iqbal, Muhammad Zahid;Mangina, Eleni;Campbell, Abraham G.",Journal,Multimodal Technologies and Interaction,2022-09-01,University College Dublin,AR learning ;  AR technology ;  Augmented Reality ;  blended learning ;  collaborative learning ;  e-learning ;  kinesthetic learning ;  STEM
Research on Mesoscale Nucleation and Growth Processes in Solution Crystallization: A Review,"In recent studies, the existence of mesoscale precursors has been confirmed in crystallization. Different from the classical crystallization theory, which only considers the sequential attachment of basic monomers (atoms, ions, or molecules), the nonclassical crystallization process involving precursors such as prenucleation clusters, nanoparticles, and mesocrystals is more complicated. The mesoscale structure is important for the quantitative description and directional regulation of the solution crystallization process. It is necessary to explore the mechanism by the mesoscale scientific research methods on the base of traditional chemical engineering and process system engineering research methods. Therefore, the paper reviews several representative nonclassical nucleation and growth theories, mainly including two-step nucleation theory, prenucleation clusters theory, particle agglomeration theory, amorphous precursor growth theory, particle attachment growth theory and mesocrystal growth theory. Then, the mesoscale structure and its spatiotemporal dynamic behavior are discussed, and the application of the EMMS model in the nucleation and growth process is analyzed. Finally, we put forward our views on the prospect of the paradigms and theoretical innovations of using mesoscale methods in crystal nucleation and growth.","Wang, Xiaowei;Li, Kangli;Qin, Xueyou;Li, Mingxuan;Liu, Yanbo;An, Yanlong;Yang, Wulong;Chen, Mingyang;Ouyang, Jinbo;Gong, Junbo",Journal,Crystals,2022-09-01,East China Institute of Technology;Tianjin University;Haihe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations;Ltd.,EMMS model ;  growth ;  mesoscale ;  nucleation ;  precursor

Finally, the prospect of intelligent science and technology in civil engineering is outlined: establishing intelligence theory for civil engineering in pure data-driven and physical machine learning paradigms based on the existing knowledge system; developing an intelligent agent and its theoretical system with self-learning ability; eventually creating self-evolving virtual scientists to discover new mathematical methods and physical laws.","Xu, Yang;Jin, Xiaowei;Li, Hui",Journal,Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao/Journal of Building Structures,2022-09-01,Harbin Institute of Technology,artificial intelligence ;  intelligent agent for civil engineering ;  meta-scientist ;  physical machine learning
Key Success Factors for the Development of Innovative Antibiotic Replacement Products to Accelerate Growth in Broilers,"The issue of drug-resistant bacteria and the ban on antibiotic growth has encouraged research into new additives for the broiler chicken industry, from the point of view of environmental, social, governance sustainability, and material sciences management. This study aimed to examine the newest innovative antibiotic replacement products using a mixed method of planning and development schemes. Firstly, the qualitative method was conducted to evaluate the voices of 15 key users to examine product composition through an engineering technique and the quality function deployment (QFD) method. A prototype was proposed, containing a combination of nutraceuticals, including medium-chain fatty acids, short-chain fatty acids, oregano essential oil, and sweet basil essential oil, delivered in drinking water and as a feed additive through nanostructure lipid carrier (NLC) technology. The quantitative research summarized the compositions in terms of improving the growth performance of poultry, based on 280 responses. By using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the key factors of a successful antibiotic replacement are that they should be standardized and must follow regulations, be perceived as easy to use, satisfy performance expectations, address industry concerns, be innovative, offer an appropriate product and physical characteristics to the farm, and be presented alongside sales opportunities and marketing. It is concluded that such a hybrid of product development and innovation will lead to novel and appropriate products in the marketplace.","Supchukun, Kitti;Yata, Teerapong;Israsena Na Ayudhya, Praima;Angkanaporn, Kris",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-09-01,Chulalongkorn University,antibiotic replacement ;  broiler ;  drug resistances ;  key success factor ;  product planning

Medtech innovation guide: an empiric model to support medical technology innovation,"Innovation has become increasingly important for most industries to cope with rapid technological changes as well as changing societal needs. Even though there are many sectors with specific needs when it comes to supporting innovation, the medical technology sector is facing several unique challenges that both increases the lead-time from idea to finished product and decreases the number of innovations that are developed. This paper presents a proposed innovation guide that has been developed and evaluated as a support for the innovation process within medical technology research. The guide takes the unique characteristics of the medical technology sector into account and serves as a usable guide for the innovator. The complete guide contains both a structure for the process and a usable web application to support the journey from idea to finished products and services.

How does renewable energy technology innovation affect the upgrading of industrial structure? The moderating effect of green finance,"In the context of sustainable development, the renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) may have a potential impact upon the industrial structure upgrading, while green finance will play a moderating part. This paper studies the role of green finance and renewable energy technological innovation on industrial structure in China. We found that RETI has contributed significantly to the adjustment of industrial structure. The research results of PVAR (Panel Vector Autoregressive) model further prove this dynamic and continuous positive promotion. The threshold regression results indicate that with the improvement of green finance, there is a non-linear relationship between RETI and industrial structure. In areas where green finance is relatively low, RETI can inhibit the upgrading of industrial structure. When the degree of green finance development is relatively high, the influence of RETI on industrial structure is remarkably positive. Heterogeneity analysis shows that in eastern China, renewable energy technological innovation has significantly promoted the industrial structure upgrading. Therefore, policy makers should take various measures to expedite the green finance development and strengthen the green finance support to renewable energy technology innovations.

Research primarily calculates the cross-section efficiency from a static perspective or the network efficiency alone; however, few studies have considered dynamic characteristics and the network structure of the innovation process simultaneously. To address this gap, this paper employs slacks-based dynamic network data envelopment analysis to calculate the overall, intertemporal, and divisional green technology innovation efficiency covering China's 30 provinces over 2012–2019. The results indicate that (1) a strong spatial dependence of efficiency scores exists, accounting for 60 % of the aggregate statistics. (2) China's overall scores are low, and inefficient regions need to improve efficiency by at least 31.41 % to become efficient. (3) Economically developed regions, provinces with advanced manufacturing, and nonresource-based areas have relatively high scores. (4) The period scores fluctuate greatly up and down around the overall scores, showing a significant spatial imbalance within consecutive multiple periods. (5) Regarding divisional scores, the internal structure of green technology innovation efficiency in China is inferior in R&D and superior in commercialization. Generally, policy-makers should improve local conditions for green technology innovation efficiency.","Wang, Qian;Ren, Shuming",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-09-01,Dalian University of Technology,Dynamic DEA ;  Green technology innovation efficiency ;  Network DEA ;  Regional study ;  Slacks-based measure
How Effectively Do We Communicate? An Analysis of Team Reflexivity in Transition and Action Phases of Team Collaboration,"Background: Communication is the backbone of effective collaboration, enabling project success; yet, engineering projects often fail due to poor communication. Specifically, engineering teams may benefit from reflexivity interventions to improve decision making, problem solving, innovation, and performance. In this study, we focus on team reflexivity in direct application to engineering project management to identify reflexivity processes that facilitate effective communication. Literature review: Although research has shown that team reflexivity interventions - elicited through communication - can improve team interaction and performance, little empirical evidence exists into the temporal dimensions across the action and transition phases of team reflexivity processes. Research questions: 1. How is team reflexivity expressed through text-based communication? 2. How and when do team members shift between reflexivity processes over time, especially across and between transition and action phases? Research methodology: We analyzed collaborative activity among 62 four-person teams in a computer-simulated microworld across two scenarios. The reflexivity processes exhibited during interaction were identified and analyzed using statistical and content analysis. Results and discussion: Analyses indicated that team reflection promoted discussions about key issues, facilitated frequent process shifts among transition and action phases, and resulted in overall better performance. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the importance of team reflexivity interventions in engineering project teams to strategically guide members to improve planning, responding, and quality of attention devoted to long-term outcomes. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the importance of deep structured team reflexivity through process shifts to help members understand strategies and goals, and develop shared objectives in complex environments.","Weger, Kristin;Leder, Sheri;Mesmer, Bryan;Menon, Vineetha;Schaub, Harald",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication,2022-09-01,The University of Alabama in Huntsville;Universität Bamberg,Action phase ;  communication ;  process shifts ;  team reflexivity ;  transition phase
Measuring the effects of green technology innovations and renewable energy investment for reducing carbon emissions in China,"This paper uses panel data on renewable energy in China. Thus, the current analysis fills the gaps by examining the relationship between green technology innovation and renewable energy and CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2018. The current study examines all concerns connected to panel data analysis with advanced panel estimators, such as cross-sectional dependence, stationarity, variation in slope parameters, and structural break. Our findings show that test results reveal that green technology innovation and renewable energy have a negative and considerable influence on CO2 emissions in the long run. Moreover, the short-run relationship of green technology innovation, on the other hand, is not significant—as evidenced by the findings of robustness tests such as AMG and CCEMG. Other empirical results revealed that GTI, REN and NEN significantly reduced local CO2 emission, while POP and PI had no obvious reduction effects on CO2 emissions. Different GTIs had the same spatial “symbiotic effects” on CO2 emission reduction in the short term, showing positive spatial spillover reduction effects. Lastly, we conclude that the use of green technology innovation has positive externalities. Some policies to assist green innovation technologies and renewable energy resources have been suggested for the Chinese government to enact.","Kuang, Hewu;Akmal, Zeeshan;Li, Feifei",Journal,Renewable Energy,2022-09-01,Guangdong University of Finance;South China Agricultural University;Lancaster University;South China Normal University,CO  emissions 2 ;  Environmental degradation ;  Green technology innovations ;  Panel model ;  Renewable energy
Sustainable food cold chain logistics: From microenvironmental monitoring to global impact,"Food cold chain logistics (FCCL) is a systematic engineering process involving the use of a low-temperature environment to maintain the quality and safety of perishable food and reduce food loss and waste (FLW). From a mechanism perspective, FCCL must balance resource costs for a required level of food quality and safety with the costs of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the context of global warming, the sustainability trade-off between FLW and environmental impact has recently become an important topic in research on efficient, green FCCL. This is mainly reflected in technological innovation, management optimization, and policy responses. With a focus on three levels (micro, meso, macro), this review analyzes current research areas and the gaps and challenges of FCCL in microenvironmental monitoring, life cycle assessment (LCA), and global impact. Future trends pertaining to FCCL in technology, management, and industry and sustainable development are also summarized. Future trends involving sustainable FCCL must be intelligent, systematic, and low carbon. Industry empowerment through next-generation information technologies (e.g., IoT, AI, big data, blockchain) will promote the multidimensional perception, real-time information transmission, and sustainable control of microenvironmental monitoring, as well as support LCA management transformation from fragmentation to system integration. From a macro level, due to the serious global loss of perishable food, the FCCL scale demand is growing greatly, causing a huge environmental burden. Global cooperation, low-carbon consensus, and appropriate policies will become the basis for promoting sustainable FCCL development.","Chen, Qian;Qian, Jianping;Yang, Han;Wu, Wenbin",Journal,Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety,2022-09-01,Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,environmental monitoring technology ;  food cold chain logistics ;  food loss and waste ;  greenhouse gas ;  life cycle assessment ;  sustainability
"FIEMA, a system of fuzzy inference and emission analytics for sustainability-oriented chemical process design","In the quest to achieve sustainable development goals, developments in sustainability-oriented chemical process design are key to innovation in the chemical industry, especially important for processes aiming for sustainable fuels. One of the greatest challenges is the difficulty of modeling the highly complex interactions among the design variables, such as catalyst technology attributes, and greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the computational aids crucial to deal with the complexity of chemical processes require data that is either unavailable or uncertain at an early stage of design. The multistage integrated system for sustainable design proposed in this paper boosts these computational aids by applying data science techniques to allow uncertainty to be handled more efficiently, thereby facilitating the modeling of the interactions between the properties of new materials or processes and sustainability indicators. In this system, current data connectivity methods are used to find paths of correlation among catalysts properties and greenhouse gas emissions. The key feature of the proposed system relies on the integration through multiple stages of Fuzzy Inference systems and a data-driven technique for Emissions Analytics, FIEMA.1 The algorithm in FIEMA provides a semi-supervised learning approach to emission analytics: it determines data clusters by a C-means algorithm and subsequently builds fuzzy sets for multiple stages of input–output inference. The proposed FIEMA system was demonstrated in an effort to determine the optimal configurations of the properties of catalysts to minimize the probability of associated greenhouse gas emissions for a methanol production process. The results showed the potential of this approach to reduce the search space of catalyst material designs by suggesting promising configurations for oxygen storage capacity, mechanical strength, lifetime, size, and poisoning level. The research impacts of this study contribute to the development of clean fuels by a computationally-efficient system for early design, and by the determination of catalysts development paths that assure an actual reduction of the life-cycle emissions.","Guzman-Urbina, Alexander;Ouchi, Kakeru;Ohno, Hajime;Fukushima, Yasuhiro",Journal,Applied Soft Computing,2022-09-01,Tohoku University,Data clustering ;  Emission analytics ;  Fuzzy systems ;  Sustainability engineering
Artificial Intelligence in Construction Projects: A Systematic Scoping Review,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in construction projects has surged in recent years and is believed to represent a significant potential for increasing productivity and efficiency in the industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art view of the field by conducting a review of publications concerning the topic of AI in construction and comparing the findings to previously conducted reviews. This paper provides an overview of the recent and current uses of AI in construction projects, through a descriptive analysis of the characteristics and contents of 86 peer-reviewed articles from 2015 to 2020. Although the application of AI in the industry is not entirely new, construction appears to currently be behind other industries in terms of adopting and adapting to AI. The results show that a wide range of research is conducted on AI in construction projects. A limited number of publication channels and authors stand behind a significant part of the reviewed publications. Most studies are conceptual or use a mixed-methods research design. The research addresses several areas of application, but there is a predominance of quantitatively based subfields of construction, such as estimation and cost control, logistics, planning, and scheduling. Future research should focus on developing holistic and process-oriented frameworks for projects to move from ambition to practice. Findings can inform the future development and implementation of AI in the construction industry context. For researchers, this study identifies areas in need of further attention and examines possibilities for future exploration of multidisciplinary approaches that combine construction engineering, project management, AI, and social science. For practitioners, the study highlights current trends and work within the field, providing an overview of the potential for pilot studies, tests, and innovations.","Bang, Sofie;Olsson, Nils",Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Project, and Production Management",2022-09-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,artificial intelligence ;  construction projects ;  literature review ;  scoping review
How Customer Demand Reactions Impact Technology Innovation and Security,"Innovation is a very important concern for both managers and governmental policy makers. There is an important interplay between security and technology innovation that is largely unrecognized in the literature. This research considers the case where technology innovation in the form of additional product features increases demand through greater functionality. However, the likelihood of a security breach increases with the number of product features as the features interact in unintended ways, thereby increasing the attack surface. Using a two-stage game, we demonstrate how potential demand changes (from direct risk or externalities) impact firm technology innovation strategy. The analysis shows that the type and extent of customer demand reaction has a significant impact on innovative feature development. This research identifies two potential impacts on the level of innovation that can be strategically managed - the impact of externalities on demand and industry risk - explaining how these forces alter the level of innovation in the product ecosystem. Additionally, high-security development is disincentivized, and leads to a type of competitive behavior where the opportunity window for high-security development for all firms is small.","Lisa Yeo, M.;Rolland, Erik;Ulmer, Jacquelyn Rees;Patterson, Raymond A.",Journal,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,2022-09-01,"School of Engineering;Ohio University College of Business;Haskayne School of Business;California State Polytechnic University, Pomona",direct-risk ;  externalities ;  game theory ;  Innovation ;  risk ;  security breach
Economic and environmental impacts of public investment in clean energy RD&D,"Learning curve theory has been adopted for investigating the relationship between technological learning and technology cost developments. The aim of this paper is to explore the impacts of public investment in clean energy research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) on future technology cost developments by using a two-factor learning curve approach. Learning-by-deploying and learning-by-researching were chosen as the main sources of learning. The focus is on onshore wind and solar photovoltaics in the United States of America. By using publicly available data, we estimated learning-by-deploying rates of 31.4% and 27.6%; and learning-by-researching rates of 2.3% and 4.7% for onshore wind and solar PV, respectively. By adopting a logistic curve approach, an additional $1322 and $819 mil. were forecast to be spent by 2050 in RD&D for onshore wind and solar PV, respectively. We explored the plausible long-term effects of diverse RD&D investment scenarios on electricity generation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using a system dynamics model. The findings reveal that public investment in RD&D for clean energy technologies may play a key role in the pace of capital cost reductions and technology diffusion. However, relatively little long-term effects of RD&D efforts alone were found on market dynamics and GHG emissions.","Castrejon-Campos, Omar;Aye, Lu;Hui, Felix Kin Peng;Vaz-Serra, Paulo",Journal,Energy Policy,2022-09-01,University of Melbourne,Clean energy ;  Energy RD&D ;  Innovation diffusion ;  Knowledge stock ;  Learning curve ;  Technological Learning
Promotion incentives and air pollution: From the political promotion tournament to the environment tournament,"Chinese officials play an important role in air pollution control. This paper used a sample of 282 prefecture-level cities in China to discuss the impact of promotion incentives of officials on air pollution from the perspectives of heterogeneity, mechanism and spatial effects. We found that the promotion incentives of officials reduced air pollution, and GDP per capita had positive moderating effects. The effects of promotion incentives were more significant in cities with less air pollution, in the central and western regions, for officials with higher education levels, or years after 2007. The promotion incentives could promote the development of green finance and green technology innovation, both of which were conducive to mitigating air pollution. Using the dynamic spatial Durbin model (DSDM), we found that the promotion incentives had negative spatial spillover effects. The promotion incentives in surrounding cities reduced air pollution in the local city; however, it had only short-run effects and no long-run effects.","Yin, Lihui;Wu, Chuanqing",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2022-09-01,Wuhan University,Air pollution ;  Dynamic spatial durbin model ;  Green finance ;  Green technology innovation ;  Promotion incentives of officials
Progress in paper-based analytical devices for climate neutral biosensing,"Disposable diagnostics is ramping up the development of green practices for healthcare. Paper is an excellent natural substrate for emerging low-cost, ecologically acceptable analytical devices. Flexibility, three-dimensional fibre structure, mechanical characteristics, ease of manufacturing and customization are the key advantages of cellulose as preferable materials for green analytical devices. This article overviews the advances in paper-based optical and electroanalytical devices, including manufacturing, validation of functions, detection methodology, and applications. The renewable resources hold the potential to accomplish the biodegradable analytical techniques due to their climate neutral waste management. The paper-based electrodes have demonstrated excellent performance for diagnostics while being eco-friendly at the same time. Therefore, the forthcoming sustainable diagnostics approaches require integrating paper-based analytical devices (PADs) built out of disposable electrodes. The diverse green materials and methods facilitate climate neural point-of-care products for the net-zero market. Numerous researches have been conducted in recent years to develop innovative technologies capable of analysing clinical samples quickly, accurately, simply, and sensitively, with the primary objective of offering competent tools for illness diagnosis and treatment efficacy follow-up. The micro-PADs show excellent abilities for quick onsite diagnostics within μ-level detection range. The sensitivity, stability, and reliability of analytical devices are the essential factors enabling larger-scale production and commercialization. The projected fabrication and analytical methods in the direction of paper-based devices could be nicely and reliably utilized for understanding and adaptation of climate neutral diagnostic technologies in healthcare sector. This detailed article discusses the sustainable framework that integrates green bioelectronics and sensor technologies adhering to diverse functionality for health and the environment.

Tailored surface textures to increase friction—A review,"Surface textures with micro-scale feature dimensions still hold great potential to enhance the frictional performance of tribological systems. Apart from the ability of surface texturing to reduce friction, surface textures can also be used to intentionally increase friction in various applications that rely on friction for their adequate functioning. Therefore, this review aims at presenting the state-of-the-art regarding textured surfaces for high-friction purposes. After a brief general introduction, the recent trends and future paths in laser surface texturing are summarized. Then, the potential of surface textures to increase friction in different applications including adhesion, movement transmission and control, biomimetic applications, and road-tire contacts is critically discussed. Special emphasis in this section is laid on the involved mechanisms responsible for friction increase.

Opportunities and potential of green chemistry in nanotechnology,"Green chemistry and nano-engineering are aimed at increasing products efficiencies in the chemical supply chain and reducing health and environmental hazards. This study stresses how principles and measurements of green chemistry can affect, from design through disposal, the complete life cycle of a chemical. Nanotechnology, as a rapidly developing field, provides an educational framework for investigating the influence and implementation of Green Chemistry in the real world. Both are propelled by a wide range of inventiveness, and both are intended to usher in a new era of technological advancement. In this paper, the application and impact of modern green technologies, as well as future potential for transdisciplinary interaction, are discussed. The 12 Green Chemistry Principles, initially published in 1998, give a framework accepted by not only chemists, but also designers and policymakers. The implementation of the principles was prompted by decades of inadvertent environmental harm and the effects on human health from chemical production and use of dangerous chemicals. But the principles for the synthesis and manufacture of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are employed for more than decades. Even while the entire scientific community promotes advancements in nanotechnology, there remain considerable research gaps and a possibility for safe, responsive application of ENMs’ great economic, social and environmental benefits. In the context of the notion of the ‘Green Economy’, the social relationship and economic between the environment and economy can be properly managed. The green nanotechnology concept intends to use nano-innovation in materials science and engineering to support the construction and maintenance of a society to generate energy-efficient products and processes that are environmentally and economically sustainable.","Soni, Ruma Arora;Rizwan, Mohd Aseel;Singh, Surinder",Journal,Nanotechnology for Environmental Engineering,2022-09-01,Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology;Dr. S.

Category innovation in the software industry: 1990–2002,"Research Summary: This study investigates category innovation, when firms introduce a new label to pioneer a market category. I propose two antecedent pathways. The first is based on firms' material developments. Firms that combine categories in their products and technologies are more likely to use category innovation to communicate their position is not peripheral, but at the center of an emerging category. The second is contextual, in response to category leniency, when a market category has ambiguous social meaning. Central and peripheral firms in lenient categories use category innovation to send a clearer signal of their position. These pathways are countervailing: the more lenient a firm's categories, the weaker the relationship between category combination and category innovation. Exploratory analyses show category innovation is associated with firm success. Managerial Summary: Firms use category labels to communicate the market they are in. This article studies the linguistic tactic category innovation: when firms introduce a new label to signal the firm is carving out a new market. I find firms use this tactic when they (a) develop novel, category-combining products that do not fit into existing markets, or (b) are in a market that is not well-defined (a lenient market category). I also find that for firms in lenient markets, the relationship between novel products and category innovation weakens. Preliminary evidence uncovers an association between firms that use category innovation and their likelihood to IPO, suggesting this linguistic tactic may be part of successful firm strategies.","Pontikes, Elizabeth George",Journal,Strategic Management Journal,2022-09-01,UC Davis Graduate School of Management,ambiguity ;  categories ;  category innovation ;  combination ;  labels ;  leniency ;  markets ;  patents ;  software ;  strategic positioning
Knowing too much? On bias due to domain-specific knowledge in internal crowdsourcing for explorative ideas,"Internal crowdsourcing utilizes a firm’s employees, of which many have a strong understanding of the domains in which the firm operates, for contributing with, developing and evaluating ideas. On the one hand, these employees can use their domain-specific knowledge to identify the value of what may seem a far-fetched solution to the average employee. On the other hand, previous research has shown that employees typically evaluate ideas in their domains less favorably if they do not align with ongoing exploitation activities. Hence, this study focuses on whether a higher degree of relevant domain-specific knowledge makes employees participating in internal crowdsourcing prefer exploitative solutions when evaluating ideas. An empirical study of an online platform for firm-internal innovation in a multinational engineering company showed that employees who only infrequently participated in internal crowdsourcing mostly contributed to and evaluated ideas within their own domain. Employees who frequently participated also contributed to and evaluated ideas outside their own domains. By statistically analyzing group differences during idea evaluation, we show that employees participating infrequently favor exploitable solutions, whereas employees participating frequently are more uncertain. The former difference is only seen concerning ideas that require domain-specific knowledge to understand, but the latter is observed for all types of ideas. This study makes three substantial contributions. First, employees with domain-specific knowledge, through their preference for exploitative solutions, bias the outcome of internal crowdsourcing when idea evaluation requires domain-specific knowledge. Second, this bias is aggravated by the overall higher level of uncertainty displayed by employees participating frequently in internal crowdsourcing and thereby tend to reach out to other domains. Third, in order to mitigate this, bias management can build engagement in internal crowdsourcing through idea challenges that do not require domain-specific knowledge and consider avoiding employees with a strongly associated domain knowledge for idea evaluation.","Asplund, Fredrik;Björk, Jennie;Magnusson, Mats",Journal,R and D Management,2022-09-01,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),

Evaluate this parameter can be using different approaches. This article analyzes the innovative activity of civil engineering. Several directions for assessing innovative activity were identified. The first direction is the activity of venture investors, the second is the dynamics of granting patents in the field of civil engineering. Based on the analyzed data it has been proposed technique for determining the innovative potential of the industry. The main conclusion, based on the results of the study, is that venture capital does not strongly influence innovative activity in the field of civil engineering. At the same time, the number of patents issued in Russia and in the world in this direction is above average, which indicates the demand for innovations in the construction industry.","Ruposov, V.

How Do Engineering Application-oriented Universities Position And Strategize with External Actors? A Relational Dynamics Perspective,"The breakpoints of innovation chains, especially those between basic and applied research caused by imperfect systems and underlying mechanisms, has remained an outstanding problem in the transfer and transformation of scientific and technological achievements. This is partly because industries and universities can not achieve smooth coordination and deep integration as they share different functional architectures and value propositions. Henceforth, China has set up a large number of so-called “Application-oriented Universities (AOUs)” in recent years, with an aim to solve aforementioned deficiencies and to promote local industrial economies. Nevertheless, while the central government has set a clear vision when proposing this term of AOUs, it failed to give an clear definition and connotation. As a result, AOUs were stuck with problems such as a lack of resources, vague positioning, homogeneous development with “Research-oriented Universities (ROUs)” directly affiliated to the central government and weak local embeddedness in their early stage of development and performed far below expectations. Until recently, AOUs has gradually found their positioning and ways of strategizing during the process of integration and experiment with industries, ROUs, and governments by forming a symbiotic and complementary relationship, and thereby made up for the breakpoints of innovation chains to a great extent. Based on this, from the perspective of relational dynamics, this study focuses on how Chinese engineering AOUs participate in the process of transfer, transformation and diffusion of scientific and technological achievements. Taking Shanghai University of Engineering Science and Anhui Institute of Information Technology as research cases, this study discusses how AOUs in China manage to find suitable ways of positioning and strategizing with the policy guidance and resource support of two tiers of governments - central and local respectively. Also, this study explores the dynamic mechanisms underlying the change of relationships between AOUs and ROUS in the same region from competition to commensalism. This study clearly depicts the “bridge” function served by AOUs as well as the complementary effects between AOUs and ROUs in the process of transfer and transformation of scientific and technological achievements. After these, the conceptual connotation and functional architectures of AOUs can be further clarified, which can provide reference for the development of AOUs in China and even all over the world.","Qiao, Yingying;Chen, Guangpei",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,Case study ;  Commensalism ;  Engineering Application-oriented Universities ;  Relational Dynamics
"Progress and prospects of carbon dioxide capture, EOR-utilization and storage industrialization","Carbon dioxide capture, EOR-utilization and storage (CCUS-EOR) are the most practical and feasible large-scale carbon reduction technologies, and also the key technologies to greatly improve the recovery of low-permeability oil fields. This paper sorts out the main course of CCUS-EOR technological development abroad and its industrialization progress. The progress of CCUS-EOR technological research and field tests in China are summarized, the development status, problems and challenges of the entire industry chain of CO2 capture, transportation, oil displacement, and storage are analyzed. The results show a huge potential of the large-scale application of CCUS-EOR in China in terms of carbon emission reduction and oil production increase. At present, CCUS-EOR in China is in a critical stage of development, from field pilot tests to industrialization. Aiming at the feature of continental sedimentary oil and gas reservoirs in China, and giving full play to the advantages of the abundant reserves for CO2 floodin huge underground storage space, surface infrastructure, and wide distribution of wellbore injection channels, by cooperating with carbon emission enterprises, critical technological research and demonstration project construction should be accelerated, including the capture of low-concentration CO2 at low-cost and on large-scale, supercritical CO2 long-distance transportation, greatly enhancing oil recovery and storage rate, and CO2large-scale and safe storage. CCUS-EOR theoretical and technical standard system should be constructed for the whole industrial chain to support and promote the industrial scale application, leading the rapid and profitable development of CCUS-EOR emerging industrial chain with innovation.","Yuan, Shiyi;Ma, Desheng;Li, Junshi;Zhou, Tiyao;Ji, Zemin;Han, Haishui",Journal,Shiyou Kantan Yu Kaifa/Petroleum Exploration and Development,2022-08-23,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;China National Petroleum Corporation,carbon capture ;  carbon dioxide ;  carbon storage ;  CCUS-EOR ;  enhanced oil recovery ;  industrialization ;  oil displacement ;  transportation
Incorporation of Matching Networks Fundamentals into State-of-the-Art Technology for Electrical Engineering Designs in General and RF-Microwaves Circuits in Particular using Smith Charts and MATLAB,"In order to conduct applied research and carry out innovation in Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMIC) Design and Fabrication technology, theoretical instructions in MMIC, Radio Frequency (RF), and Microwave electronics course work must integrate fundamentals in research investigations. The analytical calculations are carried out with adequate graphical tools such as Smith Charts and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools like Microwave Office. In order to validate the design from its conception to layout, consummate simulations have been carried out ready for fabrication. In Microwave solid-state circuits and their applications at the monolithic stage, basically involves the design of Input Matching Networks (IMN), Output Matching Networks (OMN) as well as the Inter-stage Matching Networks (ISMN). MMIC modeling in the design of high power amplifier involves scaling transistor sizing so as to improve transistor gain and minimize losses. The authors propose an innovative method of inferring Smith Charts obtained in Advanced Design System (ADS) and then validating them with Matlab codes in an academic setting which includes the EECE.5170-MMIC Design and Fabrication, and EECE.5050-Microwave Electronics courses. It incorporates thorough class room understanding of (1) Transmission Line theory fundamentals, (2) MMIC Design, and (3) Smith Charts, which are of vital importance to create perfectly matched networks in the designs. A case study of designing a high power amplifier involving IMN, OMN and ISMN are presented and validated using Matlab codes.

The Evolution of Multi-Site Combined REU/RET Program: From In-Person to Virtual to Hybrid,"In 2018, the Smart City Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) (SCR2) Mega-Site program was launched, aiming to improve the participation and graduation rates of post-secondary students of underrepresented and minority groups in the field of Engineering. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the SCR2 program has been successfully conducted for the last three years, engaging a consortium of 14 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 1 Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, is the lead institution for this program. The SCR2 program is designed to engage underperforming REU students in research opportunities demonstrated to improve students' retention and graduation rates. In addition, teachers from local community colleges and high schools are recruited in this program as RET participants. The experience of RET participants in hands-on engineering research projects helps them encourage their students to pursue engineering as a career. The SCR2 program offers summer research experience (eight weeks for students and six weeks for teachers) focusing on smart and connected cities. In this paper, we present our learnings from the last three years of the SCR2 program, which will inform the progress of engineering education and training in the United States. While the 2019 SCR2 program was able to offer on-campus research experience and mentorship for the REU/RETs, the 2020 program had to go virtual to accommodate the extraneous circumstances posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this transition, the 2020 program engaged 32 undergraduates and 12 teachers, who successfully participated in 12 research projects across three host sites. Learning from the experience of the summer 2020 virtual program, the 2021 SCR2 program was redesigned as a hybrid program and was able to bring six host sites together, offering 18 projects in which 47 undergraduates and 23 teachers participated. One major success of the program was the positive impact of remote learning on both students and teachers. Despite the hybrid nature of the program, students excelled in their technical skills due to the effective collaboration using video conferencing tools. However, during the post-program survey, one primary concern was reported regarding the reduced participation of women students in the program. Simultaneously, the women participants reported less satisfaction and reduced confidence and knowledge gain than men. The transition of the SCR2 program from on-site to online and finally hybrid model exemplifies how innovation in engineering education can overcome the challenges posed by the health crisis. However, it is evident from the assessment results that more attention is needed concerning the experience of women in the program to improve their sense of belongingness in the field of engineering.","Nyarko, Kofi;Alam, Tasmeer;Fathima, Hashmath;Attia, John Okyere;Albin, Sacharia",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,
Supporting an Alternate PhD Pathway in STEM: Findings from a Qualitative Study of Students and Faculty,"PAtENT (Pathways to Entrepreneurship) is a pilot program for an alternate pathway allowing doctoral candidates in STEM programs to satisfy capstone degree requirements by applying for patents. This model and the PAtENT program aim to bring greater alignment between doctoral degrees and the rapidly changing employment landscape, and have the potential to modernize the STEM Ph.D. In order to create flexible pathways to doctoral degrees that catalyze innovations, institutional support is needed to sustain exploratory and interdisciplinary research. A total of seven faculty and four graduate students participated in a qualitative study of PAtENT to address the overall research questions of a) what appeals to you about this alternative pathway, and b) what is needed to support alternative pathways in STEM doctoral degrees? This short paper describes the pilot program, its context, and presents findings from the qualitative study that inform next steps for all institutions interested in advancing research innovations in STEM educational practice.","Rorrer, Audrey;Pugalee, David K.;Srinivasan, Kamalapriya;Ramaprabhu, P.;Xu, T.;Uddin, M.;Cherukuri, H.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,
Experiential Entrepreneurship in Food Engineering: Student Perspectives on Three Student-Initiated Ventures,"This paper presents exemplary cases of learning entrepreneurial mindset from an institution that provides faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students separate theory-driven trainings in entrepreneurship and subsequent opportunities to practice experiential learning of entrepreneurship together. A sequence of project-based learning courses in engineering brings together faculty and students to work in multi-disciplinary teams. Students gain experience solving practical, open-ended engineering problems and developing professional skills throughout their studies. Opportunity identification, feasibility analysis, product development, professional communication, leadership, and teamwork are emphasized. Both faculty mentors and students build foundations in the entrepreneurial mindset via training certificates and funding programs offered by the institution through a dedicated center in innovation and entrepreneurship. By leveraging support from these programs, student-initiated ventures become viable. Research project-based courses, accessible laboratories, and trained faculty provide an enabling environment for students to accelerate their entrepreneurial experiences. Herein, a snapshot of three concurrent student-initiated ventures into food engineering is captured via case reports. The student leaders of these ventures offer different approaches to ideation and venture initiation, especially representing three successive cohorts of students - a third-year, a fourth-year, and a newly graduated engineering student. Their backgrounds and visions vary, and the changing world, including last year's COVID-19 pandemic and research lab shutdown, impacts them in different ways. Yet, these students share a drive to innovate and make the most of available opportunities. The perspectives of these students on the engineering entrepreneurship education they receive through this institution will help to develop future projects and entrepreneurship programs.","Atsu, Prince Mensah;Chang, Skye P.;Donahue, Chancellor;Patterson, Robert;Thompson, Gary Lee",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Rowan University,
Implementing Digital Learning to Enhance Post-Pandemic Civil Engineering Teaching,"Civil engineering education needs to be adapted to accommodate the technological innovations and promote a culture of innovation. Future civil engineers should learn new knowledge and skill to use the emerging technologies, such as online learning tools, smart devices, remote control technology and so on. Current research suggests that replacing the traditional lecture-type instruction with interactive technological tools may enhance students' learning. The rapid transition to online learning during the COVID-19 lockdown triggered a boost of technology adoption among higher education instructors. For more than two years into the pandemic, the effect of digital learning on higher education has been remarkably profound. We are going through a change that has not happened for decades in traditional classrooms and a new digital world is forming. The pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of digitized learning modes, such as live-streaming videos, recorded videos, video conferences, screen sharing, 3D graphics, online chatting, cloud file storage and transfer. Both instructors and students are getting used to technology adoption in the classroom instruction. The advantages of technology use in teaching, such as time flexibility, accessibility and convenience, are evident. As we expect a light at the end of tunnel for the pandemic, it is of tremendous interest to know how digital learning will impact post-pandemic classroom instruction. In this paper, the effect of digital learning on civil engineering classroom instructions during the pandemic time are studied, and surveys were conducted in three civil engineering courses over the four consecutive semesters from Spring 2020 to Fall 2021, and the quantitative survey results are analyzed and compared. Effective strategies to improve the post-pandemic civil engineering classroom instructions are proposed according to the survey results and classroom observations. The digital learning approaches are proven very effective and preferred by the students and the instructors to supplement the in-person lectures.","Bao, Amanda",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,civil engineering ;  digital learning ;  pandemic
Digital transformation in engineering education: a gap between teaching and management,"Since the emergence of industry 4.0, digital tools have been employed in digital transformation (DT) processes in companies and organizations both public and private. Universities have been working on the incorporation of these new paradigms into their study curriculum, seeking to train engineers in a comprehensive manner for the current job market. The School of Engineering from a private university in Chile, enjoying the highest enrollment numbers in engineering careers nationwide, has made innovations in its curriculum in order to incorporate DT across all of its subjects. Professionals by and large acknowledge the importance of DT, while those associated to professional training recognize as necessary its inclusion in the curriculum. However, in recent years with the appearance of Covid19, online teaching through LMS became necessary, and it was subsequently noted that not all professors were able to adequately adapt to the use of available technologies for their online classes. There was thus a need to to identify this gap that could indicate weaknesses in the curricular innovation process to include DT and would thus allow the creation of improvement guidelines in relation to the preparation of the teachers involved. This present study aims to look into perceptions held by School of Engineering professors regarding the importance DT and any barriers had on the use of digital tools in relation to their reaching. Surveys were applied to ascertain professors' perception regarding DT usefulness and to determine how much they actually use digital tools, using quantitative data analysis methods. Preliminary research results show a gap in taking-up basic technology that professors employ in their class, even though they acknowledge the importance of incorporating DT in the curriculum. Implications are discussed in relation to possible strategies that the School of Engineering may have in improving DT uptake, not only at the level of the curriculum, but also from each teacher in their classroom.","Rivero, Inesmar Carolina Briceno;Truyol, Maria Elena",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Universidad Andrés Bello,digital transformation ;  education ;  gap ;  innovation ;  LMS
Innovating Through a Pandemic: Zooming in on the Sustainable Lessons Learned in Engineering Education,"Necessity is the parent of invention. Everyone in higher education experienced that proverb firsthand these past two years. Now, it is time to understand which of those inventions should live on and which will only be a footnote. Our need drove major educational redesign - our need was the catalyst - with online learning our only option, we developed new approaches to meet our students' learning, engagement, and retention needs. Project-based design courses were particularly challenging, owing to their specific mix of student collaboration and design-and-build pedagogy. This evidence-based practice paper investigates the pivot to the pandemic world of online-only availability and what can be retained from the experience to enhance student learning in future engineering education courses. First, it looks at the necessary changes to an experiential project-based inquiry course for first-year students. Second, this paper looks at the adaptations in a microcontroller-based first programming course with a final design project. Both courses are moderately large (~100-200 students/year) and are enrolled by a wide variety of science, engineering, and design majors at the University of Minnesota (a large public research university.) Three key adaptations from these two courses show potentially lasting promise. The first is utilizing individual projects where students collaboratively support each other's projects (from ideation to implementation). The second is the use of static, responsive, and teleconference- based video submissions for project check-ins, reports, and design reviews. The final is using online communications tools, including Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and particularly the Discord service. Student ratings of teaching, comments, usage reports, and self-reflections are analyzed. While the data are far from conclusive due to pandemic impacts, they give us confidence that these changes helped students and faculty weather the pandemic storm and provide us with innovations that we can harness in a more normal environment.","Orser, David John;Francis, Lorraine;Sartori, John;Dukart, Kyle;Hultman, Brody;Linderman, Lauren;Penn, R.

The Impact of Students' Grit & Project Ownership on Students' Learning Outcomes in Maker-based Cornerstone Engineering Design Courses,"The increasing presence of makerspaces in university campuses is encouraging engineering educators to incorporate making activities and projects to their curriculum. Making activities and projects allow engineering educators to offer students authentic, experiential learning opportunities that foster collaboration, creativity and innovation and can help students develop critical skills such as teamwork, problem solving, research, and entrepreneurial, leadership and management skills. This current study explores the impact of students' grit and project ownership on their learning outcomes over and beyond students' Big-Five personality traits in a cornerstone engineering design course that is based on making projects. The results indicate that grit as a higher-order construct is not associated with students' academic success or level of contribution in their team's projects in a collaborative, authentic learning environment. Also, the results indicate that the personality traits of agreeableness, extraversion along with students' adaptability to changes in life circumstances is associated with their development of intellectual and emotional ownership of their making projects. However, project ownership was not associated with students' academic success or level of contribution to their team's projects.","Jalal, Mohamed",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,Engineering Design Education ;  Grit ;  Maker Education ;  Maker Movement ;  Project Ownership
PHYSICS APPLICATIONS: THEIR IMPACT ON STUDENTS' MOTIVATION AND PERSPECTIVE OF STEM,"In physics classes, the pedagogical implementation of activities based on real life problems has been proved fundamental in the knowledge acquisition from behalf of the students. As many generations before them, today's students have a very significant restlessness related to the practical application of their knowledge. Being able to relate classroom contents with their professional, or even day-to-day lives, can never be underestimated in the students' learning, but this doesn't mean it is any less of a challenge for teachers. It is important to understand the relation between practical knowledge and the intrinsic motivation in the students. A student that understands that his learning goes beyond a single class (or a single topic) and that has a better understanding of the practical applications is going to be motivated and therefore, more willing to learn new concepts. The authors have designed and implemented an activity in which they present a simplified version of a stay-cable bridge. The physics students would create a pre-design of the structural elements based on their knowledge of Newton's First Law of Movement viewed in class and compare their results with a structural model in a software. The activity is similar to the exercises that Civil Engineer students face in their studies. The objective is to show them how the book-based problems seen in physics (or even in math) are just the first step they have to take in order to understand a much larger amount of concepts once they've reached a college level of physics or even in their future jobs as engineers. In this paper, the authors are going to present a qualitative investigation of the student's perception of the real-life activity. The objective of this research is to find out if this activity has had an impact on the student's ability to see the bigger picture of their studies and, by consequence, increase their motivation to study the topic. This investigation will be based on high school students, specifically 12th grade. These students are a year away from entering college and choosing their career path, so the understanding of the purpose of their current high school studies is highly relevant.","Hernandez-Sanchez, Monica Daniela;Macias-Gonzalez, Sally;Iturbe-Sanchez, Erick;de Jesús Barragán-Cruz, Armando;Carrasco, Luis Horacio Hernandez",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,Educational innovation ;  educational narrative ;  K-12 ;  physics education ;  STEM
The Connotation and Structure of intrapreneurs' competence: An empirical analysis based on UCINET and questionnaire survey,"Employee intrapreneurship is a bottom-up commercial activity carried out by individuals relying on existing organizations and has gradually become one of the research themes in the cross-field of organizational behavior and entrepreneurial management, but there is a relative lack of research on how colleges and universities can cultivate the competence of intrapreneurship among college students. This study focuses on the question of “what is the connotation and structure of the intrapreneurs' competence”, uses the content analysis method to analyze the intrapreneurs' competence based on the existing literature and obtains 22 core competency elements, and based on 22 core competency elements distributes 270 questionnaires to conduct empirical research on the composition of intrapreneurs' competencies. The study found that intrapreneurs' competence is composed of four aspects: innovation competence, team leadership competence, individual characteristics, and risk management competence. This study deepens people's understanding of the connotation and structure of the intrapreneurs' competence in China, and to some extent promotes universities to discover and cultivate intrapreneurs' competence in college students.","Deng, Yongxin;Shi, Wei",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,China University of Mining and Technology,Connotation and Structure ;  Intrapreneurs' Competence ;  Questionnaire ;  UCINET
An infrastructure 3D-lab based on virtual visits at Call of Duty Warzone to Develop Student's Competencies During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The didactic methods in the teaching of Engineering, Architecture, and Construction (EAC) are changing. The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), Virtual Reality (VR), and if we add to this a video game such as Call of Duty: Warzone (CoD: WZ) for educational purposes, the benefits of this could be explored. Until now, the advantages of BIM, VR, and video games have been studied separately, however, there is no evidence of an approach that implements all three technologies. The research in this study consists of the development of a methodology for the implementation of a user-friendly application of the Infra-3D-Lab software with specific pedagogical objectives for EAC education. This study based on the development of high-tech educational tools aims to: 1) make more effective use of learning hours through playful interaction with BIM, VR, and CoD: WZ models; 2) improve skills and concepts that are difficult to explain theoretically and 3) evaluate the functionality of the learning environment. The implementation of this technological tool is developed in the context of EAC's national higher education programs at a university in Mexico. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using a remote collaborative tool Infra-3D-Lab as a teaching method for EAC. Additionally, this study shows that the learning experience can be enhanced using other technology tools such as Unreal Engine and Revit.","Ballinas-Gonzalez, Romeo;Macias, Raul Garibay;Masforrol, Juan Pablo Garrido;Rodriguez-Paz, Miguel X.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,BIM for education ;  CoD: WZ for education ;  engineering education ;  higher education ;  innovation in education ;  VR for education
21st Century Engineering Learning and Teaching: Malaysia Perspective and Direction,"Engineering education in Malaysia has been recognized by the Washington Accord (WA) since 2009. The International Engineering Alliance continuously updates the requirements for the Program Learning Outcomes according to the needs of the current and future global graduating engineers that member countries of the WA must fulfill. Recent requirements emphasize lifelong learning, complex problem solving, engineering activities, and computing and digital tools capabilities geared towards developing engineering graduates ready for 21st century challenges. When brought upon engineering educators, these increasing requirements posed a dilemma because most are not trained to educate students beyond what they have experienced in their previous formal learning processes, which may be irrelevant for today's learners. In a survey conducted by the UK Royal Academy of Engineering, engineering knowledge and skills are the topmost needed challenges to meet the needs of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Thus, to transform engineering education in Malaysia, the gap between the needs of the current and future engineering requirements, with the current engineering education practices, must be determined. Hence, this study aims to identify the gaps in Malaysian engineering education towards preparing 21st century ready educators, study the transition of engineering educators in their attempt to implement innovative education, and finally develop a framework for transforming engineering education through the infusion of innovative teaching and learning to support the development of the future-ready educators. The study uses a mixed-method research design to identify the gaps through document analysis, interviews, questionnaire surveys, and focus group discussions (FGD) among engineering education providers and industry players. The data will be analyzed and triangulated to chart the gaps in engineering education toward preparing 21st century educators. Later, this result will be used to develop the directions, actions, and transformation framework. The findings from this study will be used to formulate Malaysian national policy for transforming future-ready engineering educators who can excel and be on the leading edge of knowledge, innovation, and humanistic values to develop quality engineers in the 21st century.

"WIP: Teams for Creating Opportunities for Revolutionizing the Preparation of Students (TCORPS) at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&M University","This work in progress (WIP) paper describes a National Science Foundation funded RED (Revolutionizing Engineering Departments) Adaptation and Implementation (A&I) grant focused on changing the culture of a large traditional mechanical engineering department at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and is an adaptation of the “Additive Innovations” model developed by Arizona State University in their RED project[1]. The TAMU RED project is focused entirely on culture change via faculty development, with the goal of shifting from a culture where teaching is secondary to research and courses evolve via sporadic, undocumented, individual innovations to a culture that recognizes teaching's role in both faculty and student success and encourages a sustained process of incremental improvement and responsiveness to student learning through experimentation, measurement, and sharing. Two key levers in this culture change are (a) a faculty development series focused on innovation and data-driven change and (b) the creation of communities of practice[] or “soft wired'' teams that support each other and sustain incremental change across semesters as faculty cycle in and out of courses. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to enhance a departmental culture in Mechanical Engineering where faculty regularly discuss current curricular effectiveness and are empowered to develop pedagogical innovations that enable all students and faculty to thrive.","Edoga, Emma;Bergman, Mindy;Hipwell, M.

Augmenting undergraduate Engineering Technology education through applied research,"The Center for Innovation and Design was established to serve multiple purposes; 1) To serve Northwest Indiana's industry and community through a multi-prong approach. 2) to augment students' educational experience with real world experiential learning through providing them space that will foster innovation and entrepreneurship. This Center goal was also to help PNW to further have its footprint in the community and the industry it serves and to achieve its strategic goal of helping the economic development of the region. The projects that have been completed in this Center have accomplished what the center was created for. The Diorama project gave students an opportunity to research and learn about their subject area, working on a real-life project, while helping a Northwest Indiana's community foundation, representing an iconic factory, to produce a Diorama for their local museum to be showcased permanently in 2022. The reverse engineering of a capper project helped students from several disciplines to do an industry project, learning practical applications of subjects learned at PNW, while helping a local medium-size company solve its problem. Finally, the Hydrobike project was a great experience for students to work with a national association in their field to design a product that could benefit a feeder college and its students.","Latif, Niaz;Zahraee, Mohammad A.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,College of Technology,
Additive Manufacturing-Enabled Modular Drone Design Development by Multidisciplinary Engineering Student Team,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is recognized as a transformative approach to prototyping and manufacturing by all sectors of industry, especially the aerospace industry, which has lead the adoption of AM for critical end use parts. In academia, AM has also received great deal of interest as a vehicle to improve design and manufacturing education and facilitate student innovation. The objective of this effort is to improve the readiness and diversity of the engineering workforce in the aerospace industry, which is experiencing critical scarcity in talent. We engaged a multidisciplinary team of minority engineering students in the design and manufacture of a modular quadcopter drone driven by AM. The modular drone focus provides a suitable context for the implementation of experiential learning, which is proven to support the development of practical student research and engineering design skills. Design thinking was used to drive the developments needed to achieve a modular drone that can be easily customized and reconfigured for different applications. With the design flexibility offered by AM, students designed and built drone arms that can be quickly detached and assembled, both structurally and electrically in one-step while avoiding the need for soldering electric connections at nodes. They also developed an optional propeller guard, which can be compactly packed, if not needed, as well as a concept for a 3D printed power distribution board to replace standard commercially available boards. An additional objective of the project is to arm students with desirable soft skills such as interdisciplinary team skills, leadership, lifelong learning, and entrepreneurship mind set. To guide students in this project, a multidisciplinary team of faculty mentors met with the student team once a week to advice on technical issues and provide general direction and context. The students' work schedules were deliberately selected to maximize overlap between team members with the aim of facilitating effective communication and cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. Furthermore, to build self-confidence, promote experiential learning and develop leadership skills, the students were encouraged to take full ownership of the development process by giving them the latitude needed to find for themselves what works and what does not. Through a focus group with the participating students, an independent external evaluator found that the project context and mentoring approaches helped them experience the benefits of AM, improved their understanding of real-life engineering product development as well as their engineering courses. It also helped them better understand entrepreneurship and the importance of effective communications and leadership.","Akasheh, Firas;Ndoye, Mandoye;Shannon, David;Pippins, Ryan;Thompson, Eugene;Carter, Adrian;Baker, Stephen;Guiseppi, Brandon Martin",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,
The Social Dimensions of Learning: facilitating social Dynamics for a more engaged student in a K12 Pre-Engineering Program [Work in Progress],"This is a Work in Progress: This qualitative-context sensitive study followed two cohorts of students (ages 14 to 18) undertaking a pre-engineering summer program at a selective university in Santiago de Chile. Participants were hosted in the FabLab belonging to the program in engineering design and innovation. The targeted participants of this program entailed diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Some middle and high schoolers belonged to families with no university professionals and some did. The program provided scholarships to all of those who were not able to submit a payment. Under a socio-constructivist theory, this study looked to understand the multiple social elements that played a role in learning. Elements involved teamwork and its related skills, co-regulation and collaborative learning processes, role models, and the formation and negotiation of identity in the learning process. This qualitative case study involved an exploratory phase where an ethnographic approach was undertaken, as well as a more structured qualitative research approach with participant observation and interviews. To identify salient themes, data collected was analyzed using Grounded Theory. Preliminary results showed how students perceive this program through comparing and reproducing the vocabulary and emotions of their past school-experiences. Additionally, role models were perceived through binary lenses in which some student monitors assumed the role of “equals” and others were perceived as traditional and strict teachers.","Ortiz, Andrea;Kang, Michelle;Goni, Julian;Miranda, Constanza",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,

"Research on the Construction of Artificial Intelligence and Human Language Lab in China's Universities: Progress, Challenges and Prospects","Information technology has been currently required to support learning transformation and innovation, so as to build a new ecosystem of artificial intelligence (AI) education. One of the core intelligences of AI is language intelligence, and the combination of AI and human language is a new stage and inevitable trend of foreign language education. AI and human language lab, as the practical products of AI in the field of information-based language teaching, provide ideas for AI to promote language teaching reform. Based on the practice of the Artificial Intelligence and Human Languages Lab of Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU•AI), this paper discusses the progress and challenges faced by Chinese universities in the field of language teaching, and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions. Officially established in December 2019, the BFSU • AI focuses on the research of language teaching based on AI, and promotes the breakthroughs in frontiers' language research. In this paper, a case study method is used to investigate the practice of BFSU • AI. Based on the interviews with a manager and teachers of BFSU•AI and the analysis of relevant policy documents on the construction of AI in China, this paper summarizes the characteristics of AI and human language lab in Chinese colleges and universities. In the context of globalization, how to carry out effective language teaching is an important challenge for China to cultivate international talents. In the future, China's AI laboratory should pay attention to the integration of technology and culture in the teaching environment of language teaching, strengthen the connection between institutions and scholars in construction, and deepen the research in the theoretical and applied area. This paper aims to enrich the research results of AI in the field of language teaching, promote the training of China language talents and the construction of teaching staff, and provide China experience and model of information-based language teaching.","Lu, Xi Xi",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,AI and human language lab ;  Artificial Intelligence ;  Challenge ;  China ;  Progress ;  Prospect
Conceptualizing First Principles Thinking in Engineering Education,"This research paper provides a case study of a large Engineering Science program, with a particular focus on perceptions and practices related to first principles thinking from alumni, faculty and students. As part of a broader project designed to realign program goals, practices and outcomes, this study included semi-structured interviews and focus groups, designed to understand how program stakeholders conceptualize first principles thinking, and how they perceive the benefits or utility of such an approach. Through the historical analysis of the engineering curriculum, a key tension identified is the focus on foundational mathematics and science, which is contrasted with a focus on professional practice and the applications of engineering work. An interest in emphasizing mathematics and science led to the launch of a number of undergraduate and graduate programs around the world in Engineering Science, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and the persistent inclusion of a comprehensive foundation in mathematics and science in engineering programs. This foundation has enabled a focus on first principles as part of the teaching and learning discourse in some engineering programs. More recently, first principles thinking has also been discussed in the popular technology discourse as connected to innovation. Here, it is described as a method used to identify and reason from the most fundamental truths in our knowledge base to support problem solving and innovation. While many stakeholders have a vague awareness of first principles thinking as a philosophy of knowledge construct, there is a gap in conceptualizing this in the engineering and education literature. Thematic analysis was used to identify several key findings. First, while some stakeholders viewed first principles thinking as a learning and problem solving strategy, others tied the practice to the disciplinary knowledge itself, for example, key theories and equations and their derivations. While these two conceptualizations are related, the latter provides less room for transfer to the engineering problem solving process, and stakeholders expressed an interest in building this opportunity to transfer the skill to other engineering contexts. Second, different stakeholders viewed the utility of the approach differently; for example, while alumni articulated the benefits of building first principles reasoning as a skill, students felt that the practice was more tied to a career in research and less useful in other engineering settings. Third, students in particular noted the challenge in maximizing the learning benefits associated with first principles thinking with the heavy workload and knowledge base in engineering. These results provide some avenues for the examination of first principles thinking in engineering education, particularly in considering the interplay between disciplinary knowledge and learning skills, and the need to balance first principles thinking with other considerations in the curriculum. We hope this work will open the door to future inquiry about the value of first principles thinking in the development of life-long learning and innovation in engineering. Furthermore, reconciling the historical focus on fundamental math and science in engineering with a more contemporary view on first principles thinking should be considered.","Moozeh, Kimia;Romkey, Lisa;Dawe, Nikita;Khan, Rubaina",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,First Principles Thinking ;  Learning ;  Qualitative Analysis ;  Teaching
Infusing Entrepreneurship into Engineering Design Curricula to Promote Inventiveness: A Student-Centered Approach to Inclusive Innovation,"The broad fields of engineering design and entrepreneurship education have, in recent years, combined in novel ways to create interdisciplinary, real-world curricular experiences in higher education and K-12. Depending on the elements included from engineering design and entrepreneurship methodologies, some curricula espouse a more inventive focus, where problem identification and solution finding are likely to result in the creation of something novel, useful, and non-obvious. While some programs and curricula identify specifically as “invention education,” we contend that the student learning experience exists on a continuum, ranging from less to more inventive, irrespective of the self-applied label. Even at the intersection of engineering design and entrepreneurship, a fertile ground for inventiveness, some curricular experiences are more inventive than others. Curricula that explicitly encourage inventive products and habits provide agency for students to build their own future and to develop ways of thinking and working that will support their success in life. Specifically, students engage unique skillsets, mindsets, and interests which enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for underrepresented students who are more likely to be excluded when analytical skills are prioritized over inventiveness and cultural assets. This hypothesis is backed by preliminary data from inventive curriculum research which shows higher levels of participation in invention activities from underrepresented groups relative to typical rates in engineering programs. In this paper, we propose a definition of inventiveness to describe both attributes and student work products. We contrast inventiveness with analytical skills where methods and outcomes are typically known. To explore opportunities for inventiveness in curricula, subject matter experts evaluated 23 activities common in engineering design and entrepreneurship curricula and rated their expected student work outcomes with respect to inventiveness and analytical skills. We also evaluated nine problem statements from engineering design coursework with respect to their potential for resulting in inventive and analytical student work products. We contend that the inclusion of curricular elements that rate higher with respect to inventiveness are more likely to promote student engagement, particularly from underrepresented groups. This analysis may be applied when considering whether a curriculum is sufficiently promoting and rewarding inventiveness or inventive practices. We assert that as students advance from secondary to post-secondary schools and into multiple career pathways, their capacity and interest in engaging in innovation, invention, and entrepreneurial ecosystems will increase, thereby increasing equity in the designed world by empowering all student voices.","Moore, Roxanne;Flynn, Leslie;Couch, Stephanie;Detchprohm, Nisha;Eagle, W.

Customer-Driven approach in Entrepreneurship Innovation,"New ideas and new products are the major strengths for revenue growth in today's vibrant commercial setting. The growing popularity of customer-orientated technological innovation has led to different approaches that feature customer involvement in new product development. The transition from an old model with no or little customer involvement to a customer-based approach that values customer feedback on innovations requires more attention to competitors in the field as their products are based on similar concepts. Innovation based on the customers' needs is a more commercially beneficial and interactive approach to fulfill the market need. Importantly, involving customers in the innovation process requires a new set of concerns, concepts, and decision-making: customers have a lot of options, and companies have to compete for business ever more intensely. When preparing a survey for market research, the main goal should be to validate consumer needs and willingness to buy the product. Determining the demographic to which the product appeals to can narrow down a target market and the features of the product that interest customers. Additionally, customer surveys, market analysis, and business plans are some important elements for success. How to conduct market research is especially vital. This article will focus on successful market research methods, sample survey questions, survey samples, results, and an analysis of productive innovations. New product designs developed by undergraduate students using market research will also be summarized. In addition, this work teaches students to master various skills, such as research, persistence, design, construction, and technical writing.","Maheswaran, Bala;Shen, Dongye;Wang, Yankai;Patel, Maulik;Chung, Taiki;Lee, Grant;Griffin, Thomas;Li, Haoran;Patel, Jaison;Ãrjan, Jåthun;Opet, William;Sarna, Asees Singh",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,College of Engineering,
A Holistic Design Approach for Integrated Learning in Manufacturing Education,"Manufacturing makes a tremendous contribution to the U.S. economy by increasing gross domestic product and creating high-paying jobs as well as supporting all other sectors. The integrated nature of manufacturing is evident in its symbiotic relationship with innovation, national security, and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Moreover, manufacturing is increasingly important to the balanced education of engineers in all disciplines. However, today's manufacturing is undergoing the greatest change in more than 100 years, and the current skills gap causes serious concerns about the ability of manufacturers to fill critical positions. Manufacturing needs a well-trained workforce that possesses skills like problem-solving and critical thinking to make effective decisions at all stages of the manufacturing process. One of the fundamental skills is to make good decisions at early stages that facilitate, not impede, the manufacturing process down the road. Traditional curricula designs tend to focus on a specific discipline, creating a silo effect rather than viewing manufacturing as a connected, systemic process needing decisions made with respect to the entire product development life cycle. This study investigates this belief by 1) examining if students understand product manufacturing as a connected, systemic process, 2) exploring in which manufacturing knowledge area, if any, students are deficient, and 3) analyzing if these knowledge gaps exist for both engineering and business students. To study these possible gaps, this research proposes a holistic design approach for manufacturing education to provide students with an integrated view of how products in the real world metamorphose from an idea into the hands of end-consumers. A dynamic decision making framework integrating product manufacturing topics across engineering and business courses is developed to highlight system thinking and decision making in the context of the entire product life cycle (i.e., product design, manufacturing process, manufacturing system, and business process). Utilizing the Understanding by Design model, we first established clear learning objectives associated with students' basic understanding of manufacturing knowledge in connection with product development life cycle based on Bloom's taxonomy (i.e., remember and understand). Next, the team created an assessment to collect acceptable evidence for the defined learning outcomes. Finally, learning modules were created by an interdisciplinary team of instructors to introduce the related manufacturing topics. A pilot study with current engineering and business undergraduate courses was conducted and pre- and post-survey data was collected and analyzed. The results of the study and insights from the research team are provided at the end of the paper.","Aqlan, Faisal;DiFrancesca, Daniell;Dunsworth, Qi;Prabhakar, Chetan;Swinarski, Matthew;Rasouli, Mohammad",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,Bloom's taxonomy ;  decision making ;  Manufacturing ;  product development life cycle ;  system thinking
Development of A Bootcamp for Freshman Student Success During COVID-19 Transition,"Results from internal assessments show that passing rates in introductory courses as well as retention rates of first-year students in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, a predominantly Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), significantly dropped with the advent of COVID-19. Such results and trends provide an overall perspective on the academic preparation of incoming students. There is a high concern that the necessary skill set (e.g., adaptability, persistence, and performance) of the new cohort, who are primarily underrepresented Hispanics from underserved and challenged communities from the Rio Grande Valley, is not optimal for the rigor of engineering education. To this end, an onboarding bootcamp for incoming and transfer students was created to bridge the transition from secondary education to higher education by priming students to overcome academic deficiencies, develop a critical skills portfolio, learn problem-solving techniques, build a sustainable community of mentoring support with faculty and students, and provide a template to sustain academic and professional success during their undergraduate education. This research-to-practice paper presents the bootcamps' design process steps: curricular analysis, identification of areas of opportunities, skills inventory, and blueprinting process, as well as its initial implementation in the mechanical engineering program. In this regard, the bootcamp was organized over a week span with hands-on engineering activities, faculty and student talks, and engineering lab tours; and was based on a design thinking approach. Daily activities were structured based on challenge-based instruction, innovation, design, and mentoring, and focused primarily on promoting critical thinking, being assertive in the face of adversity, making informed decisions, and prioritizing tasks. Results indicate that the bootcamp increased student confidence and established a valuable network system amongst other findings. Future work will focus on expanding the bootcamp to include students from other engineering and computer science departments and to offer the template to institutions with similar academic challenges.","Hernandez, Noe Vargas;Marquez, Eleazar;Fuentes, Arturo A.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,
Investigating the Impact of Arts on Student Learning by Introducing Glass Science in the Materials Engineering Curriculum,"The research will create an academic program (curricular and co-curricular components) that integrates art concepts into an undergraduate engineering program. The goals of the program are increased student innovation, creativity, collegiality, and entrepreneurship, all while broadening the undergraduate talent pool. The programmatic elements are focused on integration of arts in STEM (i.e. STEAM) to achieve the stated goals. The centerpiece is the infusion of STEAM content into laboratories and courses distributed throughout a model engineering program in Metallurgical Engineering. Curricular modifications will be facilitated through involvement of a Resident Artist who will be embedded within the academic program. The research is evidence-based and builds on prior NSF Course Curricular and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) research that involved highly successful curricular and co-curricular programming associated with integration of blacksmithing into an undergraduate Metallurgical Engineering degree program. A rigorous external assessment of the research will be conducted and includes the use of a variety of assessment tools including Herrmann Brain Dominance Inventory, Small Group Instructional Diagnosis (SGID), and student focus groups. Preliminary results from the SGID and student focus group surveys report positive results with the modified curricula that has been integrated into the initial course, Introduction to Metallurgical Engineering. Student surveys were performed with a primary focus on student advancement in areas of creativity, innovation, and technical knowledge. The self-efficacy studies illustrate a general increase in the students' perception of their creative skills and technical knowledge.","Donovan, Katrina;Kellar, Jon J.;West, Michael;Degen, Cassandra M.;Kellogg, Stuart D.;Mitchell, Deborah Jean;Whitehead, Matthew",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,Art + Engineering ;  Innovation ;  NSF IUSE ;  STEAM ;  STEM Education ;  Women in Engineering
The Brain Trainer,"The recent dramatic advancements in neuroscience have coincided with the computer revolution. The computer revolution has generated numerous key innovations that are applicable to the neuroscience field. That is, inexpensive and powerful microprocessors, accessible coding languages, and electronic components that are both affordable and modular. The field of neuroscience has benefited from these advances in several ways. Alzheimer's is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, often affecting people over the age of sixty five. Although there is still no cure for this disease, many studies over the years have shown that brain exercises can help maintain basic cognitive skills for Alzheimer's patients. While there are many different brain exercises that already exist, most of them either don't offer many levels of difficulty, are difficult to carry, or are not accessible for some patients. This paper proposes a design for the Brain Trainer: an educational gaming device for Alzheimer's patients, that is portable, engaging, and easy to operate. It has three different types of cognitive exercises, all of which have different levels of difficulty, which can help maintain cognitive function. The exercises also display scores and changes in performance. Furthermore, the results could be compared to existing tests to gather data on the exercises' effectiveness. While there is room for improvement in terms of cost and durability, the Brain Trainer met our goal of providing an effective brain-training game for Alzheimer's patients. In addition, this project teaches students to master various skills, such as research, persistence, design, construction, and technical writing. The skills learned by this project were invaluable and important experiences within engineering. This Brain Trainer project not only provides students with more valuable information about engineering design process, but also is capable of educating the everyday person about the basics of engineering as well as the importance of an innovative approach.","Maheswaran, Bala;Hansen, Jack;Langenbach, Kendrick;Primoff, George;Kim, Seungeun",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,College of Engineering,
A Conscious Research Implementation: Research Integration in the Classroom,"The American Society for Engineering Education's Engineering Technology Council advocates The degree is engineering technology, the career is engineering™. However, motivating and supporting Engineering Technology students to persist in pursuing a career in engineering continues to be a significant educational challenge. The researchers have identified an area that appears to be lacking but has the potential to support students as they navigate this and other challenges. This paper is the first of many that will explore the integration of research in an applied program. While future work will include the construction and implementation of a novel framework on Conscious Research (CR), this work verifies the level that research is implemented in the classroom so that additional work to implement the CR framework can be further defined. The researchers suggest that faculty can provide substantially more effective and engaging instruction in freshman through senior courses when students are continuously involved in the use of research throughout the educational experience. For example, the CR cycle can be used to formulate a question, conduct a literature survey, re-formulate the question, propose a solution, an improvement, or an updated approach, design/build/implement the proposed approach, and present to others. In this cycle, the search for discovery and innovation materializes. This preliminary work investigates the use of research materials, introduction of practices, and those performing this kind of work in the classroom, at every level. This study is done at a large research institution where research is pervasive throughout and there are many engineering technology students. Researchers chose the Student Perception of Research Integration Questionnaire (SPRIQ) to assess student perception of research in their learning environment. The first step in assessing the implementation of CR in a program. The results from this assessment will provide an understanding of how research is utilized in engineering technology programs with the basic assumption that the utilization of research attracts, motivates, and engages students and faculty alike in a sustainable culture of excellence vertically within each program, horizontally across engineering technology, and upwardly to the graduate program. The result of engaging in critical research is a better-prepared graduate to enter the engineering profession or advance to graduate school and tackle the demands of the 21st-century engineering industry.","Al Abdul Raheem, Yasmine;Jarrett, Joel Enrique;Lucietto, Anne M.;Barbieri, Enrique",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,
Assessing Awareness level of Engineering Graduate Students about Innovation Commercialization at Historically Black Colleges and Universities,"Previous research attests to the fact that universities have unique strength that allows them to play a significant role in the process of innovation commercialization. Innovation commercialization seeks to transform products/services from the laboratory to the marketplace or the end-user. The number of commercialized innovations by Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) - originally established mainly as teaching and blue-collar trade institutions to educate African Americans - is significantly lower than their non-HBCUs counterparts (specifically, Predominately White Institutions - PWIs). This is largely because HBCUs have been traditionally under-served and under-resourced. To bridge this gap, HBCUs are promoting entrepreneurial training and mindset through changes in engineering education programs and curriculum. For instance, federally funded programs like the National Science Foundation (NSF) Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) and NSF I-Corps promote the education and training of innovators on commercialization of innovations at HBCUs. Little Research has been done to investigate the level of awareness of engineering graduate students at an HBCU. The purpose of this study is to assess the level of awareness of engineering graduate students at an HBCU about innovation commercialization. In this study, we conducted a survey using a questionnaire-based data collection method that focused only on engineering graduate students at the University of the District of Columbia. We used both binary and ordinal scales, where we ask questions first using a binary scale, such that If an answer is “Yes” then we follow it with another question using an ordinal scale that is whether awareness level is low, average, or high. The study population of interest includes 15 engineering graduate students at the institution. The results from this study have been analyzed using participants' responses to the questionnaire and aggregating these responses to identify patterns. The results showed general low level of awareness and understanding of innovation commercialization processes. These patterns will be discussed in detail to illuminate the level of awareness about innovation commercialization in HBCUs. We are using the results of this study to provide useful guidelines and framework for HBCUs leadership to initiate programs to promote innovation commercialization, especially for engineering innovators. We intend to conduct further surveys in another study to cover engineering undergraduate students and subsequently faculty and administrative staff of an HBCU, to assess their level of awareness of innovation commercialization.","Addo, Sampson;Tyagi, Pawan;Mutunga, Eva",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,engineering education ;  engineering student ;  Historically Black Colleges ;  innovation commercialization ;  Universities (HBCUs)
There and Back Again: Lessons Learned from Facilitated Faculty Discussions on the Move Online and then Back Face to Face,"In this Lessons Learned paper, we explore the themes uncovered from a series of facilitated faculty discussions on moving their course back to face to face teaching after the switch to online. The Institute for Engineering Education and Innovation (IEEI) at Texas A&M University (TAMU) administrates over 100 faculty whose primary department appointments and teaching assignments are in either engineering or education. Over the last two years, IEEI hosted numerous conversations for faculty members to share experiences, research, and assessments of teaching successes and concerns as they changed instructional modalities, both with the initial move online and the subsequent move back face to face. From these conversations, faculty agree that some things during the move to online instruction, such as office hours, video archives of lectures, and some activities in break-out rooms appear to enhance student learning. Yet data showed that students believed the online experience was less desirable than face to face courses. Now that we have had a near complete semester where most classes were required to be held in the face to face mode, we are hosting conversations with faculty to understand the changes they are now making to their teaching because of the experiences from online instruction. The results will be shared as a “lightning talk”.","Watson, Karan;Hammond, Tracy Anne;Thomas, Shawna;Shryock, Kristi J.;Brooks, Randy Hugh;Lightfoot, Robert;Jaison, Donna;White, Lance Leon Allen",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,
Culture and the development of a unique sub-system for the education of engineers for industry in the U.K.: A historical study. Part 1. The culture,"This evidence based study is derived from other work in progress related to the history of engineering education in the UK. Its interest lies in the fact that in 1955/56 the British government created a sub-system of higher technological education in England and Wales that had as its objective, the education of highly qualified engineers and applied scientists for manufacturing industry. This sub-system came to an end in 1964/5. While it could have been the subject of an official evaluation, it was not. However, fortuitously, it was established during a period increasing interest in research in higher education, and several researches addressed various aspects of the system that, accidentally, make a retrospective, but partial informal evaluation possible.. The discussion is presented in two papers because of the structure of the conference, and the need to provide the detailed explanation of the cultural system in which the development took place which would be of substantial length. That is the purpose of this, the first paper. Together these papers have a secondary function of showing factors that contributed to the success and failure of a major innovation in order that the mistakes made will not be repeated in the future: that is to foster learning of the collective past. Their final purpose is more international collaboration among engineering educators and its research fraternity. Since the social forces (attitudes, beliefs and values) at work in society ultimately determine the success or failure of educational innovations, part 1 (this paper) shows the importance of social class in what is valued and not valued in the English educational system. The academic is preferred to the vocational. Grammar schools and universities are associated with the academic. Technical and further education colleges with the vocational. The antecedent philosophy driving this innovation in degree level technological education, as expressed in the 1945 report of the Percy Committee on Higher Technological Education placed the Colleges of Advanced Technology (CATs) created in 1955/6 firmly in the vocational sector. The results of the investigations carried out in the CATs reported in part 2 (the second paper) showed that schoolteachers and their pupils tended to view the CATs as second class citizens: that most students had good experiences of industrial training although many believed it could be improved, and that the curriculum offered tended to model that found in the universities. The Robbins Committee believed that the curriculum offered was of degree level standard and recommended that the CATs be given university status, which they were in 1964/5. For the convenience of the reader part 1 is preceded by a list of abbreviations, and a time line. The research for the papers summarised in part 2 took place between 1960 and 1965. A note on problems of presenting studies about non-American systems of engineering and technological education at ASEE conferences is included in the introduction to part 1.","Heywood, John",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,
Research Experiences for Teachers in Simulation and Visualization for Innovative Industrial Solutions,"An NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site has been established at Purdue University Northwest to involved high school teachers and community college instructors in industrial research involving numeric simulation, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), as well as interactive simulator development using the Unity 3D game engine. A cohort of 11 teachers participated during the summer of 2021 and included teachers and instructors from Indiana and Illinois high school teachers and community colleges. Research projects involved industrial collaborations with local steel industry partners. The project kicked off with a 6-week in-person research experience hosted at the Center for Innovation through Visualization and Simulation (CIVS) at Purdue University Northwest. The teachers worked with faculty and research staff mentors and graduate students on research projects in the areas of blast furnace/environmental using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, reheat furnace efficiency using CFD, overhead crane stress using finite element analysis (FEA), and safety training using interactive visualization. Each research project included research mentor staff, graduate and undergraduate students, as well as collaboration with steel industry partners. In addition to the research outcomes, each teacher also developed a lesson plan and education module which will be hosted online for use by other educators. Lesson plans involved a variety of topics programming activities for computer science and related classes, chemistry and environmental activities, math and statistics analysis, and engineering. Each lesson plan also involved some form of activity involving computer simulation and/or interactive visualization. Surveys measured teacher's self-efficacy in a number of areas including research literature review, design, data collection and analysis, communication of research results, ability to relate real world research problems to teaching, and use of simulation and visualization tools for research and teaching. There was a measured improvement between pre-summer experience and post-summer experience in all categories, with the largest improvements involving ability to discuss research ideas and ability to use simulation/visualization tools for research and teaching. Follow-up activities are ongoing during the teacher's academic school year, including assistance from the RET to carry out implementation of the lesson plans in the classroom, field trips, networking activities, presenting research career information to students, and surveying students on their interest in pursuing STEM activities and related careers.","Moreland, John;Okosun, Tyamo;Silaen, Armin;Toth, Kyle Alexander",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,
Lived Experiences that Influence How Women Engineering Majors Describe Themselves as Creative,"Engineering is a creative profession where diverse perspectives of both men and women are crucial to the field. The importance of better understanding the pipeline of female students into engineering, and the path to their success in the major is evident. In 2017, women comprised approximately 20% of engineering graduates, up from 18% in 1997, and 15% never entered the engineering workforce. In 2019, women comprised 48% of the workforce, 34% of the STEM workforce, and only 16% of practicing engineers, a 3% increase from 2009. In an effort to better understand these disparities, this mixed methods research investigated the creative self-efficacy (CSE) of women engineering majors and their beliefs about creativity in relation to lived experiences and explores the research question: In what ways do undergraduate women engineering students describe their creativity and how their lived experiences influenced their decision to major in engineering? The researchers investigated the lived experiences of women engineering students before they entered the engineering major in relation to the way they described themselves as creative. A survey of CSE and beliefs about creativity was administered to 121 undergraduate women engineering students who volunteered for this study. Interviews were conducted of 15 participants selected from survey results with different levels of CSE who met the researcher's criteria for success in the engineering major. The findings of this study lead to several conclusions: (1) students' descriptions of themselves as creative corresponded more with the arts than to innovation in engineering; (2) students who described themselves as less creative: (a) had a lower level of CSE; (b) had a greater exposure to engineering in high school through engineering-centered courses and clubs; (c) had a family member who worked in the profession; (d) described more negative classroom experiences at all educational levels that involved intimidation, isolation, and gender-bias.","Delahanty, Christine Michelle;Silverman, Jason",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Area Coordinator of Science and Engineering,
Divergent thinking in engineering: Diverse exploration is key to successful project outcomes,"Engineers have the power to drive innovation and rethink the way the world is designed. However, a key practice often absent from engineering education is facilitating innovation and considering diverse perspectives through divergent thinking. We define divergence in engineering practices as exploring multiple alternatives in any stage of engineering processes. Currently, engineering education and research focuses on divergence primarily in the generation and development of design solutions, supported by idea generation methods such as Brainstorming and Design Heuristics. But in practice, there are many other opportunities throughout an engineering project where engineers may find it useful to explore multiple alternatives. When does divergent thinking take place during engineering problem solving as it is currently practiced? We conducted 90-minute semi-structured interviews with mechanical engineering practitioners working in varied setting to elicit their experiences with divergent thinking taking place in their engineering projects. The initial results document divergent thinking in six different areas of engineering design processes: 1) problem understanding, 2) problem-solving methods and strategies, 3) research and information gathering, 4) stakeholder identification, 5) considering potential solutions, and 6) anticipating implications of decisions. These findings suggest engineers find divergent thinking useful in multiple areas of engineering practice, and we suggest goals for developing divergent thinking skills in engineering education.","Murphy, Laura;Clancy, Shannon M.;Daly, Shanna;Seifert, Colleen M.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,
Encouraging Underrepresented and Entrepreneurial-Minded Postdocs in High-Tech Startups,"When starting small businesses, particularly in high-tech sectors, women and underrepresented minority groups face additional hurdles in securing funding and investment. Not only is such a discrepancy in investment socially unjust, but it deprives the US of the advantages in innovation and global competition that could stem from widening participation in innovative sectors. Yet, despite efforts to provide targeted support to women and underrepresented minority-owned businesses, more remains to be done to close the investment gap. The US Small Business Administration (SBA) provides more than $3.5 billion in funding [1] to over 5,000 startups per year through its Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. Moreover, the Small Business Act provides these programs with a mandate to target women and underrepresented minority groups. Despite this, only 15% of those funds went to minority-owned companies [2]. The private sector tells a similar story. Diversity VC, a nonprofit partnership promoting diversity in Venture Capital, reported in 2019 that in a comprehensive survey [3] of around 10,000 founders receiving venture capital backing, only 9% were women and a mere 1% were Black. In order to i) accelerate innovation, ii) increase participation of under-represented minorities in new startups, and iii) ensure US competitiveness in the global market, the National Science Foundation (NSF) introduced the Small Business Postdoctoral Research Diversity Fellowship (SBPRDF) program in 2010 and selected the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) to administer it. The SBPRDF placed postdoctoral Fellows with high-tech start-up companies, allowing Fellows to learn to collaborate in a multidisciplinary environment and develop an understanding of the expectations and constraints involved in successful entrepreneurship. In return, the Fellows applied their academic expertise to the important work of product realization in a globally competitive market. In 2019 NSF/IIP (Industrial Innovation and Partnerships) selected ASEE to administer the Innovative Postdoctoral Entrepreneurial Research Fellowship (IPERF) program as a successful extension to the previous SBPRDF grant. The overarching goal of the IPERF program is to emphasize and strengthen the entrepreneurial development of underrepresented Fellows, advance best practices in postdoctoral programs, and significantly expand the participation of underrepresented scholars in innovative research and technology entrepreneurship. The IPERF grant is committed to providing professional experiences for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in innovative start-ups and more industry-oriented research to encourage their own entrepreneurship. In addition to enhancing the quality of on-the-job training and mentoring provided to the Fellow by the host company, ASEE started a new professional development series designed to address the obstacles that have historically limited access to venture capital by underrepresented groups.","Levitin, Rachel;Ivanitzki, Teddy;Johnson, Rashida",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,NDSEG,
Factors Influencing the Choice of the Industrial Engineering Undergraduate Program,"Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions a person makes. The literature reports various investigations of the factors comprising students' career decisions, including educational and career aspirations, socioeconomic status, ability, parental encouragement, college attributes, and financial limitations. Some research suggests that these factors change during the school trajectory. Other studies state that the most critical factors are academic reputation followed by employment records. Literature also reports that parents, friends, guidance teachers, visiting recruiters, and school advisors most influence a person's institutional selection (in the presented order). Our ongoing research identifies the main factors influencing undergraduate industrial engineering choices at a multi-campus, private university in Chile. The university's industrial engineering discipline has two undergraduate programs, Civil Industrial Engineering and Industrial Engineering. Since we acknowledge that many factors may affect students' career choices and institutions, we sent a survey to determine the influence level of those factors on those students in the industrial engineering undergraduate programs at this university. Three hundred seventy-six industrial engineering students participated. Our findings were like other studies, which had differences among the program categories. From the results, we will focus our future work on what should be the program's admission strategies and how resources can be maximized. In addition, we will identify the primary factors for the university's other engineering undergraduate programs and then cluster them to create a profile of the prospective students.","Leal, Danilo;Zavala, Genaro",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Universidad Andrés Bello;Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Engineering and coordinator of the financial and economic track at Andrés Bello University Chile,College Choice ;  educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Industrial Engineering ;  STEM education ;  Undergraduate
"“Everything sucked... for everyone”: Narrative of a Student Journeying Through Engineering Before COVID-19, During COVID-19, and Beyond","This paper reports on the final year of the project, CAREER: Actualizing Latent Diversity: Building Innovation through Engineering Students' Identity Development (NSF EEC 1554057). Engineering has a history of attracting and graduating look-a-like and think-a-like engineers. Those who look or think like a “stereotypical engineer” may feel more welcome in engineering and may be why engineering has attracted and graduated similar students. This research project considered the unique ways of being, thinking, and knowing-what we call latent diversity-that can be highlighted and valued. Students' latent diversity may or may not align with the values in engineering education that focus on a social/technical dualism, meritocracy, and rigor, which are built-in Whiteness and masculinity. Students, particularly minoritized students (i.e., women, Black, Indigenous, and Latinx students), may feel pushed out of engineering or they may feel the need to conform to these values to fit in. These messages create an engineering education that limits who can be an engineer as well as how these engineers are prepared to solve complex engineering problems. In this paper, we use an example of one student, John, and how he navigated his experiences through engineering over four years. We discuss how key themes of mental health and neurodiversity intersect with his identity development as an engineer over time as well as overlap and were complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We use this rich, single case as an example of how the mixed methods research in this study provides a nuanced understanding of students' trajectories in engineering. We also discuss the implications of this work for inclusive teaching and provide connections to existing resources and tools developed from the research project.","Clements, Herman Ronald;McIntyre, Brianna;Rohde, Jacqueline;Perkins, Heather Lee;Castillo, Andrea;Melo, Joana Marques;Godwin, Allison",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,,
Applying an Entrepreneurial Mindset to Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences in STEM,"Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE) can provide every student in the classroom with an authentic learning experience. The Cultivating a Culture of Entrepreneurial Mindset and Undergraduate Research (CEMUR) project at California State University, Chico (Chico State), funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions program, created the CURE-e, which combines CUREs with developing an entrepreneurial mindset (EM) to enhance connections between scientific inquiry and solving real-world problems with the hope of engaging students in lower-division stem courses and improving persistence and retention especially with under-represented groups. A summer week-long training program for faculty from the university's three STEM-based colleges was developed that focuses on teaching the CURE model as well as developing the entrepreneurial mindset. Faculty redesign learning outcomes and syllabi that focus on a research goal as well as identify a customer or potential innovation that has broad interest and value. The first year was a pilot introduction with three faculty from three different disciplines, mathematics, computer science, and biology. Each implemented the CURE-e with their own unique approach appropriate to what research is in their own areas. The second-year cohort included 10 faculty participants. Data is just beginning to be analyzed, but preliminary results indicate students are better engaged and have a stronger science identity.

Orchestrating a culture-aligned adoption and adaptation of an instructional innovation: A story of an engineering professor's pedagogical decisions between innovation and school culture,"Engineering education researchers and practitioners have driven instructional innovation in undergraduate engineering instruction. Much of the research about educational innovation has focused on undergraduate classrooms in large enrollment courses and/or research-intensive institutions. Propagation of innovations across settings, especially those quite unlike the original context, has received less attention in the literature. This includes liberal arts institutions, which collectively educate a large number of undergraduate engineering students in various contexts. Therefore, this study focuses on the implementation of an instructional innovation in a liberal arts institution that started a new engineering program to educate a regional engineering workforce. This qualitative study documented the experiences of one engineering instructor who adopted and adapted a blended learning environment for undergraduate dynamics designed to promote active and collaborative learning in undergraduate engineering courses. We analyzed interviews, documents, artifacts, visual materials, and field notes to examine the propagation of the instructional system in context with cultural features in local institution settings. Our findings show how an engineering instructor orchestrated a culture-aligned adoption and adaptation of an instructional innovation. Using reflective practice, the research participant adapted the implemented innovative instruction to their hands-on institution culture, such as adjusting expectations in content, adapting resources to students' individual needs, adjusting uncertainty of problem solving, and adapting to a hands-on institution culture. This research highlights the important role of institutional culture in local adaptations of educational innovations, and it provides the community with an expanded way to think about innovation propagation. Improving teaching and learning has been an important issue in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Alternative to traditional engineering instruction that focused on delivering content knowledge, researchers have promoted active learning that focus on increasing student participation and engagement learning [1], [2]. However, despite consistent efforts to disseminate active learning pedagogies, traditional lecture still dominates undergraduate STEM education [3]. Many researchers contend that various challenges hinder instructors from adopting using research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) due to student resistance, limited time for course preparation, and lack of institutional support and rewards [4] - [6]. To promote the use of RBIS for instructors, Froyd et al. [7] maintain that researchers aim to implement RBIS to fit local contexts through collaboration with potential adopters. They emphasized the importance of fit in local context and individual instructors' decisions to adopt and adapt the original RBIS. However, despite their attentions to general needs in local context for instructional innovation, little attention was paid to what specific local context were associated with individual instructors' instructional adaptation. The aim of this study was to explore an engineering instructor's pedagogical decisions between innovation and institutional culture.","Lee, Yonghee;Evenhouse, David Allen;Berger, Edward J.;Rhoads, Jeffrey F.;Deboer, Jennifer",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Engineering Education,
Building bridges industry-university: Successful stories of professionals in mining towards increasing women participation,"Chile is one of the leading mining countries globally, and one of its expectations is to increase the number of women participating in this industry. To that aim, it is essential to study the strengths of the academic programs to offer guidance to bridge the gender gap, eliminate gender stereotypes, increase the number of women who complete their undergraduate programs in mining or metallurgy, and incorporate woman them into the industry (promotion). This study analyzes professionals' perspectives in this area to propose actions to increase female students' interest and integration into the mining industry. We focus on knowing the story of successful professionals who have assimilated into the industry and gathering their recommendations to increase women's participation in mining programs and jobs. Our research is a cross-sectional diagnostic study of the labor integration of women in mining and metallurgy professions. We interviewed professionals in the industry and the university to obtain their perceptions of activities or initiatives that will increase the percentages of women in mining fields. The study consisted of semi-structured interviews with professionals to learn how they entered their professions and what can be done to increase the participation of women in the mining industry. The interviewees were primarily 1) mining industry professionals, 2) academic program managers, and 3) part-time academicians and industry workers. The study results yielded initiatives and actions to be implemented by the industry, academia, and joint efforts. The action plans will promote the integration of women into the workplace and the championing by experienced leaders in the industries to boost women's participation. The story of successful professionals and their perspectives on women's labor integration into the mining and metallurgic professions are the basis of industry-university activities to promote women's orientation toward labor issues and professional development.","Diaz, Nivia;Dominguez, Angeles",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Universidad Andrés Bello,educational innovation ;  gender equality ;  higher education ;  mining industry ;  women in engineering ;  women's labor integration
Fostering the Deliberate Development of Creative Engineers,"This is not debated: Engineers must create innovative solutions to face challenges today and into the future. Creativity is a key attribute in The Engineer of 2020 and is central to the American Society of Civil Engineer's Body of Knowledge, 3rd Edition. What is debated is how to develop creativity within engineering students. In previous literature, a two-pronged approach has been described. First, develop creative skills in coherent steps and, secondly, create communities which support and validate creative growth. This paper strives to operationalize this approach by providing examples from across academia for doing both. After describing potential sources of individual and institutional resistance to deliberate development of creativity within engineering students the paper summarizes proven methods from the literature to address both elements of the approach. Methods to develop creativity skills within engineering courses are described. These vary from short exercises that take little class time to employ to longer, full-class activities. Exemplar programs and institutions which have cultivated a culture which values and celebrates creativity and innovation within their engineering students and faculty are showcased. This paper is not a research paper - it does not test a specific approach or method. Instead, it summarizes the literature to provide a practical reference for faculty members and organizational leaders who desire to make the development of creativity a more central element of the education of the engineering students they shepherd. While written by civil engineers and drawing largely from the literature from civil engineering educators, the methods described apply broadly to all engineering educators.","Bruhl, Jakob C.;Klosky, James Ledlie;Surovek, Andrea E.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Civil Engineering Academy;Civil Engineering,
Work in Progress: Examining the Experiences of Racially Minoritized Engineering Faculty in Entrepreneurship Programming,"In recent years, interest in entrepreneurship education to advance technological innovation has grown significantly. Drawing from the business community, entrepreneurship education programs have been introduced to broader communities, including research and science. As these efforts have expanded, so has an interest in cultivating a pipeline that considers diversity, equity, and inclusion. The purpose of this study is to use Critical Race Theory to examine how entrepreneurship programs can foster an inclusive environment through understanding the perceptions of racially minoritized engineering faculty (i.e., persons who identify as African American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American/Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) of an entrepreneurship program. Seven racially minoritized engineering faculty of an entrepreneurship training program participated in 60-minute semi-structured interviews to understand their sense of belonging in the program and their experiences related to respect and inclusion in the program. Two themes emerged from the data: 1) reducing structural barriers and rectifying harsh climate conditions can improve participants' overall sense of belonging and 2) representation of racially minoritized populations can be improved through more inclusive recruiting and marketing efforts. Overall, this research aims to inform practices that advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM entrepreneurship programming.","Jackson, Jocelyn;Gilbert-Sovern, Jesse;Huang-Saad, Aileen;Mondisa, Joi Lynn",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,"Northeastern University;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Engineering Faculty ;  Entrepreneurship ;  I-Corps ;  Inclusion
Effectiveness of Research and Practice on the Improvement of Scientific Literacy Based on Extra-curricular Learning -A case of a certain Engineering College in China,"University innovation is a crucial component of building an “innovative country.” The innovation of university students constructed the university innovation system. Therefore, cultivating undergraduate students' ability towards scientific literacy and creating an innovative environment is especially crucial. To address the problem of undergraduates' lack of self-innovation consciousness and scientific research ability in the conventional talent training process that focuses on intensive lectures and is evaluated by the paper test. In this article, through literature research and case studies, taking a certain engineering college located in Beijing, China as an example, a series of programs were implemented, including training of scientific research skills, research interest group discussions, and training of scientific research projects. Two hundred forty undergraduates of the same grade are randomly selected and divided into three classes to cultivate scientific research literacy in different extra-curricular learning modes. Afterward, tracking, comparing, and analyzing the practical data of those undergraduate students for three-year extra-curricular learning reveals the outstanding achievements yielded from a series of China's policy-driven university training programs and the improvement of university students' scientific research capabilities. This article puts forward a “trinity system” development scheme and mode and Carries out innovative talent training engineering practice by studying and analyzing the orienting and results under different training modes. More specifically, inspiring students' enthusiasm by taking practical projects training; building the whole-process progressive training modes of centralized teaching, self-study, student seminars, and project training as the core to improve their scientific literacy. The scientific research atmosphere is enhanced and constructed to collectively drive individual development and form a sense of innovation in virtuous competition and cooperation. This study exhibited the effective practice for improving undergraduates' scientific literacy and the construction of the innovation environment, also provided reference for exploring the establishment of a multi-dimensional evaluation model for assessing students, cultivating top-notch innovative talents, and promoting the development of the overall innovation ability of the university.","Liang, Banglong;Chang, Haojing",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Beihang University,China's policy-driven university training programs ;  extra-curricular learning ;  program comparison ;  Scientific literacy
Online Robotics Project-based Learning Approach in a First-year Engineering Program,"A first-year mandatory engineering project-based course aimed at developing an engineering mindset was taught through students engaging in active learning strategies built on the design-thinking framework by Ulrich and Eppinger. Course outcomes were achieved via students' participation in the fabrication of an autonomous robotic vehicle facilitated through practical hands-on activities, group discussions, and laboratory modules. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this formerly in-person course adopted a synchronous teaching model and used online instructional tools for lectures, group activities, and project support. The robotic project helped introduce students to engineering principles by employing multi-developmental phases for creating a robot. The teaching approach also provided students an engineering design experience while working in interdisciplinary teams with members serving unique engineering roles such as design, hardware, software, project, or testing lead. Students were required to design and fabricate a relevant prototype for stakeholders and, while doing so, learn and acquire essential competencies and skillsets relevant to engineering professions. Course methodology involved weekly assignments and the acquisition of project kits by individual students. The engineering mindset was assessed through content knowledge of inclusive modules in electronics, programming, 3D printing, innovation, and data analysis assignments. Learning outcomes include using software, hardware-based technologies, and research-based inquiries to design, fabricate, test, and improve an autonomous robot. Measurement of these outcomes was accomplished through course assessments, student evaluations, and the final project showcase results. This remote course structure fostered an engineering mindset, technical know-how, innovation and promoted essential competencies like teamwork, leadership, and critical thinking. Despite the pandemic-transformed pedagogy, students acquired relevant toolsets for manufacturing, synthesis, analysis, and technology that support engineering solutions.","Akintewe, Olukemi;Sotillo, Walter Alejandro Silva",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2022-08-23,Instruction,
Making to the Future: An Innovative Approach to Undergraduate Science Education,"“Making' - a hands-on practice of creating technology-based artifacts typically involves integrating electronics, programming, or 3D printing. This paper describes the targeted infusion of “making” into undergraduate STEM education as an approach to encourage innovation while building capacity in the 21st-century technical STEM skills of engineering and design. “Making' has the potential to impact self-efficacy and building capacity in technical STEM skills among underrepresented and underserved science majors. To investigate how “making” experiences are received by Underrepresented Minority (URM) students at an Historically Black College or University (HBCU), we applied and received funding through the National Science Foundation HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project (TIP) mechanism. The infusion included “making” instructional practices and Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) into two undergraduate biology courses. Assessment data indicates the targeted - infusion courses were well-received by these communities with females exceling in iteration and communication of engineered designs.","Key, S.

Innovations in Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure: Tackling local and global challenges in cities,"Traditional engineering approaches alone (gray infrastructure) are not able to meet all the challenges of sustainability posed by growing urban population and consumption. Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) can provide cost-effective treatments, and help the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, knowledge concerning how to innovate GBI strategically in cities remains limited. Together with the others in the special issue, this article aims to enhance understanding of the potential of city-based GBI to tackle local and global challenges practically, and provide theoretical discussions on sustainable transitions and future research on urban GBI. Via envisioning and implementation of integrated urban innovations for GBI, the ecosystem services derived from these nature-based solutions can contribute directly and indirectly to SDG achievement at various scales by increasing water and food security, reducing energy consumption, as by supporting urban biodiversity, health, and life quality. GBI can also contribute to discussions related to such emerging concepts as circular economy, urban transitions, and smart cities.","Puppim de Oliveira, Jose A.;Bellezoni, Rodrigo A.;Shih, Wan yu;Bayulken, Bogachan",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2022-08-15,Girne American University;Fundacao Getulio Vargas;Ming Chuan University;Fudan University,Biodiversity ;  Climate change ;  Green and Blue infrastructure ;  Innovation ;  Nature-based Solutions ;  SDGs ;  Sustainability transitions ;  Urban

Design thinking traits and cognitive passive resistance: mediating effect of linear thinking,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to theoretically link design thinking with behavioural strategy, using empirical results that relate three cognitive dimensions: design thinking personality traits, cognitive passive resistance and linear thinking, and, consequently, determine: if there is a negative relationship between design thinking traits and cognitive passive resistance and if this relationship is mediated by linear thinking. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative methodology of covariance-based structural equation modelling. The data were collected from a three-scale, self-completed questionnaire, which was constructed using the existing modelling of the academic literature. The questionnaire was validated by confirmatory factor analysis and applied to a sample of 342 professional engineering and business graduates in Colombia. Findings: The results of the structural equation modelling demonstrate a negative relationship between design thinking traits and cognitive passive resistance, and this relationship is mediated by linear thinking. These findings link design thinking and behavioural strategy and build new foundations for future studies, providing further theoretical support to the academic literature’s discussion of the relationship between design thinking and theories of managerial practices and innovation management. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is the subjectivity of the answers because of potential bias from the respondents in completing the questionnaire. Another limitation is that the research was conducted only in the context of Colombia, so it is recommended that other studies be carried to generalise the results. This study has several theoretical implications. This study contributes to existing research on design thinking, evidencing a promising field of study to support it theoretically, such as the behavioural strategy. This study also contributes to the literature on innovation management deepening into a field of study that has received less attention in the literature, such as passive cognitive resistance to innovation. Likewise, this study presents a theoretical contribution to the dual process of cognition, proposing a new dimension to the construction of the multidimensional concept of nonlinear thinking. This study also contributes to the behavioural strategy field, evidencing a growing area of application in strategic management, such as design thinking. Finally, this research also proposes the development of a new research avenue about the concept of knowledge hiding as a possible source of innovation resistance. Practical implications: This research also has implications for business and engineering education and practice. This study’s results suggest that before implementing an organisational initiative such as design thinking, which seeks to change people's behaviour, it is necessary to approach it as a cognitive process and develop strategies to mitigate passive cognitive resistance to change. This research’s results also present implications for business and engineering education, evidencing the need to include other perspectives of thinking that allow non-designers to develop creative thinking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first quantitative study on design thinking as a business management concept using linear thinking of non-designers to relate design thinking traits with cognitive passive resistance. This research provides theoretical and empirical support for framing design thinking within the field of behavioural strategy.","Giraldo Ospina, Juan Miguel;Guevara Sánchez, Daniel Eduardo",Journal,Management Research Review,2022-08-12,CENTRUM PUCP Escuela de Negocios,Behavioural strategy ;  Cognitive biases ;  Cognitive passive resistance ;  Cognitive styles ;  Design thinking traits ;  Linear thinking ;  Strategic management
Electrocatalytic green ammonia production beyond ambient aqueous nitrogen reduction,"Ammonia (NH3), the second highest produced chemical in the world, is dominantly used for fertilizer production to underpin the modern agriculture, and recently attracts increasing interest as an energy-dense, carbon-neutral carrier for renewable energy. The present Haber-Bosch process for NH3 production is energy-, emission-, and capital-intensive. Therefore, recent research efforts have been devoted to developing efficient alternatives with decreased carbon emissions, higher compatibility with renewables, and flexible operation. Electrocatalysis technologies represent a crucial role and great potentials, especially the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). However, the achieved performance is still far from feasibility due to the intrinsic limitations from nitrogen activation and reaction system. In this Review, we first discussed the roadmap towards green NH3, critically assessed the challenges of NRR, and then focused on several emerging strategies beyond conventional catalyst design and engineering under ambient aqueous conditions, including electrolyte effect, operation pressure, Li-mediated reaction, reactor innovation, new N-transformation reactions, and redox-mediated catalysis.","Yao, Dazhi;Tang, Cheng;Wang, Pengtang;Cheng, Hui;Jin, Huanyu;Ding, Liang Xin;Qiao, Shi Zhang",Journal,Chemical Engineering Science,2022-08-10,South China University of Technology;The University of Adelaide,Electrocatalysis ;  Electrolyte effect ;  Green ammonia ;  Nitrogen reduction

Application and Practice of Virtual Reality Technology in the Intelligent Reading Promotion of Ancient Books,"[Purpose/Significance] Rare ancient books are an important carrier of Chinese culture. At present, the focus of ancient books research has been on the original and regenerative protection, while the conservation of inheritance is relatively lagging behind, and the role of the promotion of ancient books reading has not been fully played. The emergence of virtual reality (VR) technology provides a new idea and method for the intelligent transformation of ancient book reading promotion, which is of great value to the construction of a library's intelligent knowledge service system and the innovation of the service mode. With the help of VR technology, the intelligent reading promotion of ancient books shows the characteristics of ""narrative presentation scene"", ""reading service immersion"" and ""reading space humanization"". [Method/Process] In order to provide reference for the research and development of intelligent reading in the new era, this paper first discusses the concept ""gene"" of intelligent reading of ancient books enabled by the VR technology, and summarizes the application scenarios of the VR technology in the promotion of intelligent reading of ancient books, combined with the National Library of China's specific case on ""VR panorama cultural classics"". Then the application path of VR technology was put forward enabling the intelligent reading and promotion of ancient books. To this end, this paper first summarizes the concept ""genes"" of intelligent reading promotion from a macro perspective, and then analyzes the application scenarios of VR technology in the promotion of intelligent reading of ancient books based on the investigation of the application cases of ""VR + ancient book reading promotion"". It analyzes the construction practice of ""VR Panorama Cultural Classics"" in the National Library of China from four perspectives of content narrative, visual presentation, empathy mechanism and communication strategy, to construct a ""VR and ancient books"" reading promotion path. The content narrative of ""VR panoramic cultural books"" should focus on activating characteristic collection's historical materials and recording key historical moments. In the aspect of visual presentation, it should pay attention to excavating the elements of characteristic cultural scene and reconstructing the landscape scientifically and rigorously. In terms of the mechanism of empathy, the focus should be put on the use of the block type structure to present the history panorama, and the use of typical characters to compose stories. When it comes to communication strategy, it should pay attention to jointly creating a new pattern of ""library +"" by combining online and offline multi-screen media. [Results/Conclusions] A library should first pay attention to narrative expression, and the control of the narrative logic of ancient book stories. Second, the library should pay attention to scene perception and explore the presentation mode of panoramic vision threshold. Third, attention should be paid to top-level design and giving play to the guiding force of ancient books' cultural engineering. Fourth, the library should pay attention to cross-border cooperation and adhere to the concept of library reader service. In the promotion of reading ancient books, full consideration should be given to the particularity of ancient books resources and existing reading difficulties. In the process of content dissemination, the focus should be on contructing a model through ring upon ring decomposing and progressively thinning method, and taking targeted measures from the aspects of top-level design, strengthening demonstration, building benchmarking, series construction, cross-border cooperation, building platforms, strengthening perception and strengthening ethical supervision, so as to promote the intelligent reading and promotion of ancient books.","Zhou, Xiaoying",Journal,Journal of Library and Information Science in Agriculture,2022-08-05,National Library,ancient books ;  intelligent reading ;  reading promotion ;  virtual reality (VR)
A Conceptual Framework for Collaborative Development of Intelligent Construction and Building Industrialization,"Digitalization drives the arrival of the era of intelligent construction, which greatly affects the development of construction industrialization. Due to the collaborative barriers between intelligent construction and building industrialization (ICBI), it is difficult for construction enterprises to participate in the actual engineering projects in this work. Achieving the collaborative development of ICBI has become a way to transform and upgrade the construction industry, and it has attracted more and more attention. However, the existing literature lacks consensus on the collaborative development of ICBI affecting the construction industry. In order to promote the theoretical research on the collaborative development of ICBI, this paper proposes a “mi” shaped conceptual framework so that readers can understand the operation law of ICBI collaboration and promote its healthy development. Therefore, based on the synergy theory, this paper extracts the contents of stakeholders’ collaboration, industrial collaboration, structural collaboration, construction technology upgrading, factor endowment upgrading, innovation service upgrading, and construction process upgrading. These seven items are summarized into four dimensions: dual drive, resource supply, collaborative operation, and trust guarantee, which indicate the direction of ICBI collaborative development. The research results will help to realize the industrialization of new buildings and promote the sustainable development of the construction industry.","Guo, Zhenxu;Li, Lihong",Journal,Frontiers in Environmental Science,2022-08-04,Central South University;Shenyang Jianzhu University,building industrialization ;  collaborative development ;  construction enterprises ;  digitization ;  dimensions ;  intelligent construction ;  synergy
"Integrating Data Science and the Internet of Things Into Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics Education Through the Use of New and Emerging Technologies","This paper reports on the implementation of a collaborative approach to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education within the context of a college of education and an elementary school in Ireland. The project is novel in that it explores a transdisciplinary approach of supporting STEAM education in a school, using data science and an Internet of Things (IoT) based Environment Monitoring System. This case study contributes to an emerging field of research within STEAM that is informed by practice with emphasis placed on the value of collaboration and transdisciplinary pedagogical approaches. The multi collaborators included lecturers from a college of education with expertise in STEM and Visual Arts education, creative professionals (artists, scientists, and architects), teachers, students, and children. Encompassing all the mentioned stakeholders was important and placed transdisciplinarity at the core of the learning. Qualitative data was collected using questionnaires, focus groups and interviews to research how the participants interpreted their experiences and what meaning they attributed to their experiences. It was found that a program of STEAM education integrating new and emerging technologies with data science and the IoT can promote and encourage the delivery of a transdisciplinary model of STEAM education and the overall reconceptualization of how individual subject areas are taught at elementary level. Innovative data capturing technologies, exploring real-life data within their local educational contexts can positively impact children and teachers’ knowledge and skills in STEAM supporting the development of artistic concepts, engineering habits of mind, imagination, and creativity. The success of the project can be attributed to the collaboration between various stakeholders in the design and implementation of the project.

THE EXPERIENCE OF PRACTICING THE THOUGHT OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE-ENGINEERING SCIENCE IS THE SOURCE OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING,"Mr. Che-Min Cheng had been actively practicing and advocating Mr. Hsue-Shen Tsien’s engineering science thought throughout his life. He himself had also inherited and carried forward engineering science, which is of great practical significance to the promotion of technological innovation in China. Firstly, this paper expounds the definition, methodology and characteristics of engineering science, emphasizing that proposing new solutions is the core content of engineering science and addressing the role of engineering scientists in technological innovation. Secondly, the paper interprets the role of engineering science in technological innovation by analyzing several engineering cases, e.g. the use of explosion methods to deal with underwater foundations, the related techniques in the construction of the Three Gorges coffer. The paper clarifies the theoretical basis and engineering science nature of numerical simulation, in which how to select generalized variables and construct the structure of the solutions is the extremely creative work. The core of the continuous discontinuous simulation method is to construct mutable generalized variables in time domain. Several simulation cases that embody engineering science methodology are listed. The paper also introduces how to systematically practice the methodology of engineering science in the study of key mechanical problems in landslide disaster prevention, expounds the uniqueness of inversion and the feasibility of combining monitoring and numerical simulation, and gives the concept of progressive failure and rupture degree. Finally, based on the cognition of developing high-pressure unloading ore pulverization technology, the paper proposes several engineering scientific research directions for the development of rock physics.","Li, Shihai;Zhang, Li",Journal,Lixue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics,2022-08-01,Institute of Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences,blast ;  continuous discontinuous ;  engineering science ;  numerical simulation ;  technological innovation

Research progress in digital twin technology for geotechnical engineering,"With respect to the digital twinning technology for geotechnical engineering, the development status of digital twinning, three-dimensional geological modelling, building information modelling (BIM), simulation analyzing and geotechnical calculating and other related issues in the world nowadays were introduced. The weak aspects in multi-source heterogeneous data fusion, multi-dimensional information model construction, and integration of both geological model and structure model were then identified. A research approach, guided by theoretical innovation, based on data fusion, centered on model integration, exported by professional analysis and focused on platform construction, was further put forward to promote the growth of geotechnical engineering digital twin technology. Some key research directions for the future were elaborated at last from five aspects, including geotechnical engineering digital twin theory and methodology, geotechnical engineering data structure extension based on industrial foundation class (IFC standard), building of design-construction integrated unified BIM model, design-construction collaborative simulation and calculation, and multidimensional internet of things (IoT) sensing and data fusion.","Chen, Jian;Sheng, Qian;Chen, Guoliang;Wu, Jiaming",Journal,Huazhong Keji Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Natural Science Edition),2022-08-01,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Ningbo University of Technology;Wuhan Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences;China-Pakistan Joint Research Center on Earth Sciences;Hubei Key Laboratory of Geo-Environmental Engineering;China Railway Siyuan Survey and Design Group Co.

Multidisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Collaboration in Nature-Based Design of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism,"Multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary collaboration (TDC) continue to address complex societal problems such as sustainable development, global environmental change, and public health challenges. Nature-based design (NBD) methods including biomimicry, biomorphism, biophilia, bio-utilization and zoomorphism are essential for the design of the sustainable built environment (SBE). Currently, there is no transdisciplinary collaboration framework (TCF) to support the NBD of the SBE. The first step to fill this gap is through systematically exploring the applications of multidisciplinary research (MDR) in building design and by conducting a case study on the challenges to the MDR in the application of NBD methods for the SBE in the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Science at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK. The systematic literature review and the survey results of academics on MDR collaboration showed a lack of transdisciplinary research (TDR) due to limited communication between disciplines. The research findings showed a lack of communication between academia and the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to advance NBD innovations for the SBE. The findings indicated that a TCF for research on NBD is needed to support knowledge exchange within academia and with industry for reducing the negative impacts of the building industry. Findings from the current research and future research will be used to develop and test a general TCF and then to develop a TCF for the NBD of the SBE aligned with the RIBA Plan of Work.","Butt, Anosh Nadeem;Dimitrijević, Branka",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-08-01,University of Strathclyde,multidisciplinary collaboration ;  nature-based design ;  sustainable built environment ;  transdisciplinary collaboration
Pedagogical Model for Raising Students’ Readiness for the Transition to University 4.0,"The study goal was to analyze the impact of using modern technologies and pedagogical innovations based on the University 4.0 model on the educational process effectiveness, the development of professional competencies (in humanities and engineering) and skills in students (abstract-logical thinking, critical thinking, strategic thinking, imagination, creativity, motivation), and learners’ readiness and motivation to shift to University 4.0. The experiment was conducted in the Al-Farabi Kazakh National University among 464 undergraduate students of different academic years. All the study respondents were distributed into two groups, one of which did not change the training program (control group), and the other studied under the program grounded on the University 4.0 model using modern technologies (experimental group). According to the results of the survey addressed to the students of both groups after the experiment ended, the indicators for all parameters were higher among the individuals of the experimental group. The practical significance of the results obtained and further research prospects are in the possibility of using the developed training program in different universities and departments worldwide to compare both students’ readiness for the transition to University 4.0 and the program’s impact on educational outcomes.","Jugembayeva, Bakytgul;Murzagaliyeva, Aliya;Revalde, Gita",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-08-01,Al Farabi Kazakh National University;Riga Technical University,abstract-logical thinking ;  creativity ;  critical thinking ;  imagination ;  modern technologies
The Impact of Digital Finance on Green Total Factor Energy Efficiency: Evidence at China’s City Level,"The rapid development of digital finance has delivered significant benefits, such as sustainable development and economic growth. We explore the relationship between digital finance and green total factor energy efficiency (GTFEE) for the first time, filling a gap in the existing literature. This paper uses dynamic panel models to explore digital finance’s impact on GTFEE at the Chinese city-level panel data from 2011 to 2018. The results show that digital finance can significantly improve urban GTFEE, and the findings remain robust with various tests. Second, the mechanism analysis indicates that digital finance can improve GTFEE by promoting urban green technology innovation and industrial structure upgrading. Further study shows that digital finance has a better effect on the improvement of GTFEE in central and western cities, small cities and non-resource-based cities, but has no significant or small impact on GTFEE in eastern cities, large cities and resource-based cities, reflecting the inclusiveness of digital finance.","Liu, Yang;Xiong, Ruochan;Lv, Shigong;Gao, Da",Journal,Energies,2022-08-01,Huazhong University of Science and Technology;Wuhan University of Science and Technology,digital finance ;  green technology innovation ;  green total factor energy efficiency ;  industrial structure upgrading
Digital Innovation Enabled Nanomaterial Manufacturing; Machine Learning Strategies and Green Perspectives,"Machine learning has been an emerging scientific field serving the modern multidisciplinary needs in the Materials Science and Manufacturing sector. The taxonomy and mapping of nanomaterial properties based on data analytics is going to ensure safe and green manufacturing with consciousness raised on effective resource management. The utilization of predictive modelling tools empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) has proposed novel paths in materials discovery and optimization, while it can further stimulate the cutting-edge and data-driven design of a tailored behavioral profile of nanomaterials to serve the special needs of application environments. The previous knowledge of the physics and mathematical representation of material behaviors, as well as the utilization of already generated testing data, received specific attention by scientists. However, the exploration of available information is not always manageable, and machine intelligence can efficiently (computational resources, time) meet this challenge via high-throughput multidimensional search exploration capabilities. Moreover, the modelling of bio-chemical interactions with the environment and living organisms has been demonstrated to connect chemical structure with acute or tolerable effects upon exposure. Thus, in this review, a summary of recent computational developments is provided with the aim to cover excelling research and present challenges towards unbiased, decentralized, and data-driven decision-making, in relation to increased impact in the field of advanced nanomaterials manufacturing and nanoinformatics, and to indicate the steps required to realize rapid, safe, and circular-by-design nanomaterials.","Konstantopoulos, Georgios;Koumoulos, Elias P.;Charitidis, Costas A.",Journal,Nanomaterials,2022-08-01,National Technical University of Athens (NTUA);Innovation in Research & Engineering Solutions (IRES),artificial intelligence ;  data-driven engineering ;  in silico design of materials ;  machine learning ;  manufacturing ;  nanomaterials
FTCN: A Reservoir Parameter Prediction Method Based on a Fusional Temporal Convolutional Network,"Predicting reservoir parameters accurately is of great significance in petroleum exploration and development. In this paper, we propose a reservoir parameter prediction method named a fusional temporal convolutional network (FTCN). Specifically, we first analyze the relationship between logging curves and reservoir parameters. Then, we build a temporal convolutional network and design a fusion module to improve the prediction results in curve inflection points, which integrates characteristics of the shallow convolution layer and the deep temporal convolution network. Finally, we conduct experiments on real logging datasets. The results indicate that compared with the baseline method, the mean square errors of FTCN are reduced by 0.23, 0.24 and 0.25 in predicting porosity, permeability, and water saturation, respectively, which shows that our method is more consistent with the actual reservoir geological conditions. Our innovation is that we propose a new reservoir parameter prediction method and introduce the fusion module in the model innovatively. Our main contribution is that this method can well predict reservoir parameters even when there are great changes in formation properties. Our research work can provide a reference for reservoir analysis, which is conducive to logging interpreters’ efforts to analyze rock strata and identify oil and gas resources.","Zhang, Hongxia;Fu, Kaijie;Lv, Zhihao;Wang, Zhe;Shi, Jiqiang;Yu, Huawei;Ge, Xinmin",Journal,Energies,2022-08-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);Sinopec;Qingdao),permeability ;  porosity ;  reservoir parameter prediction ;  temporal convolutional network ;  water saturation
“Seeing and Being Seen” or Just “Seeing” in a Smart Classroom Context When Videoconferencing: A User Experience-Based Qualitative Research on the Use of Cameras,"This research examines the form in which undergraduates use video cameras during videoconferencing class sessions in a Smart Classroom context and, more specifically, the reasons why a considerable number of students opt to turn off their cameras when videoconferencing during the sessions while others keep them on. The study was carried out in an institution that had previously switched from face-to-face teaching to an Emergency Remote Teaching solution, initially adopted in 2019–2020 to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Findings suggest that using cameras when videoconferencing is associated with increasing and enhancing the interaction between the student and the rest of the class, although not all students agreed with this conclusion. In addition, having the video cameras switched fomented socialization and improved the overall online learning experience for students. However, the surveyed students pointed out diverse negative elements, such as why they had to turn on their personal cameras, privacy concerns, and limitations derived from the available technology infrastructure, in addition to other factors such as distractions, anxiety, and cognitive load. This work discusses how these elements can influence the well-being and the user experience of the students, both positively and negatively.","Petchamé, Josep;Iriondo, Ignasi;Azanza, Garazi",Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022-08-01,Universitat Ramon Llull;Universidad de Deusto,cognitive load ;  COVID-19 pandemic ;  Emergency Remote Teaching ;  face-to-face ;  smart classroom ;  user experience ;  videoconferencing ;  well-being
Circles of Care for Safety: A Care Ethics Approach to Safe-by-Design,"Safe-by-Design is an approach to engineering that aims to integrate the value of safety in the design and development of new technologies. It does so by integrating knowledge of potential dangers in the design process and developing methods to design undesirable effects out of the innovation. Recent discussions have highlighted several challenges in conceptualizing safety and integrating the value into the design process. Therefore, some have argued to design for the responsibility for safety, instead of for safety itself. However, this idea has not been developed further. In this article, we develop an approach to Safe-by-Design, grounded in care ethics, which builds on the idea of designing for responsibility and can deal with the complexity that is inherent to the conceptualization of safety. We describe five ways in which care ethics contributes to the conceptualization of Safe-by-Design: (1) It suggests the development of ‘circles of care’ in which stakeholders share the responsibility for safety; (2) it recognizes the importance of considering safety as something that is situated in the surroundings of a technology, instead of as a property of the technology itself; (3) it acknowledges that achieving safety is labour that requires an ongoing commitment; (4) it emphasizes that the way in which we relate to technology impacts its safety; and (5) it recognizes the role of emotions in assessing safety. All these elements combined lead to a broader understanding of safety and a philosophically more substantial and practically more appealing conceptualization of Safe-by-Design.","Baas, Lieke;Metselaar, Suzanne;Klaassen, Pim",Journal,NanoEthics,2022-08-01,University Medical Center Utrecht;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Athena Instituut;Amsterdam UMC - University of Amsterdam,Care ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Risk ;  Safe-by-Design ;  Safety engineering ;  Uncertainty
Natural Killer Cell-targeted Immunotherapy for Cancer,"Natural Killer (NK) cells were initially described in the early 1970s as major histocom-patibility complex unrestricted killers due to their ability to spontaneously kill certain tumor cells. In the past decade, the field of NK cell-based treatment has been accelerating exponentially, hold-ing a dominant position in cancer immunotherapy innovation. Generally, research on NK cell-medi-ated antitumor therapies can be categorized into three areas: choosing the optimal source of allogeneic NK cells to yield massively amplified “off-the-shelf” products, improving NK cell cyto-toxicity and longevity, and engineering NK cells with the ability of tumor-specific recognition. In this review, we focused on NK cell manufacturing techniques, some auxiliary methods to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of NK cells, chimeric antigen receptor NK cells, and monoclonal antibodies targeting inhibitory receptors, which can significantly augment the antitumor activity of NK cells. Notably, emerging evidence suggests that NK cells are a promising constituent of multi-pronged therapeutic strategies, strengthening immune responses to cancer.","Tang, Jingyi;Zhu, Qi;Li, Zhaoyang;Yang, Jiahui;Lai, Yu",Journal,Current Stem Cell Research and Therapy,2022-08-01,Sichuan Fine Arts Institute;Xinjiang Medical University;Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,cancerous cells ;  chimeric antigen receptor ;  genetic engineering ;  immunotherapy ;  inhibitory checkpoints ;  NK cells

Entrepreneurial university icon: Stanford and Silicon Valley as innovation and natural ecosystem,"The author explicates the cultural DNA and take-off trajectory of an exemplary entrepreneurial university and its emerging focus on sustainability. Entrepreneurial initiatives, emanating from the engineering school in the late 19th century, spread to the physical sciences in the 1930s and to the biological sciences and medicine by the 1970s. A concerted and compressed academic development strategy sought researchers with related interests across disciplines, assuming that teaching could be diversified from these critical cores. A multi-pronged financial strategy included attracting federal research funds, leasing university land, technology transfer income and endowment from gifts and equity in university-originated firms in varying past and future proportions. Bottom-up initiatives proliferated, filling technology transfer and start-up support gaps in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Recently, some innovation initiatives have been shuttered as the Administration has tacked towards addressing climate change though a microscopic initiative. Given an institutionalized and legitimated culture and infrastructure of entrepreneurship and innovation, these dual institutional logics operate in tandem symbiosis, mutually fructifying each other.","Etzkowitz, Henry",Journal,Industry and Higher Education,2022-08-01,International Triple Helix Institute,entrepreneurial culture ;  Entrepreneurial university ;  innovation ;  Stanford University ;  sustainability
Technological innovation efficiency and its impact factors: An investigation of China's listed energy companies,"This study empirically examines the technological innovation efficiency (TIE) and its influencing factors using a multiple input–output stochastic frontier analysis model and a fixed-effect model on a sample of China's listed energy companies between 2008 and 2017. The results revealed the following. (1) The number of patents and research and development investments of China's listed energy companies increased rapidly. However, the overall TIE level of these energy companies was far lower than that of the effective state and showed a downward trend. (2) For the enterprise classification samples, the TIE of state-owned and foreign energy enterprises was lower than that of private energy enterprises, and the TIE of new energy enterprises was higher than that of traditional energy enterprises. (3) For the patent classification samples (IPC1, IPC2, and IPC3), only an increase in IPC2 (the number of patents in fixed buildings, mechanical engineering, heating, weapons, and blasting fields) helped increase the TIE of energy enterprises. (4) Government subsidy and financial leverage are positive factors, while financing constraints, market uncertainty and asset size are negative factors for increasing the TIE of energy enterprises.","Piao, Zhefan;Miao, Binbin;Zheng, Zihan;Xu, Feng",Journal,Energy Economics,2022-08-01,"School of Economics, Zhejiang University;Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics",Energy companies ;  Patent classification ;  SFA model ;  Technological innovation efficiency
"Insulating materials for realising carbon neutrality: Opportunities, remaining issues and challenges","The 2050 carbon-neutral vision spawns a novel energy structure revolution, and the construction of the future energy structure is based on equipment innovation. Insulating material, as the core of electrical power equipment and electrified transportation asset, faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The goal of carbon neutral and the urgent need for innovation in electric power equipment and electrification assets are first discussed. The engineering challenges constrained by the insulation system in future electric power equipment/devices and electrified transportation assets are investigated. Insulating materials, including intelligent insulating material, high thermal conductivity insulating material, high energy storage density insulating material, extreme environment resistant insulating material, and environmental-friendly insulating material, are categorised with their scientific issues, opportunities and challenges under the goal of carbon neutrality being discussed. In the context of carbon neutrality, not only improves the understanding of the insulation problems from a macro level, that is, electrical power equipment and electrified transportation asset, but also offers opportunities, remaining issues and challenges from the insulating material level. It is hoped that this paper envisions the challenges regarding design and reliability of insulations in electrical equipment and electric vehicles in the context of policies towards carbon neutrality rules. The authors also hope that this paper can be helpful in future development and research of novel insulating materials, which promote the realisation of the carbon-neutral vision.","Li, Chuanyang;Yang, Yang;Xu, Guoqiang;Zhou, Yao;Jia, Mengshuo;Zhong, Shaolong;Gao, Yu;Park, Chanyeop;Liu, Qiang;Wang, Yalin;Akram, Shakeel;Zeng, Xiaoliang;Li, Yi;Liang, Fangwei;Cui, Bin;Fang, Junpeng;Tang, Lingling;Zeng, Yulin;Hu, Xingtao;Gao, Jiachen;Mazzanti, Giovanni;He, Jinliang;Wang, Jianxiao;Fabiani, Davide;Teyssedre, Gilbert;Cao, Yang;Wang, Feipeng;Zi, Yunlong",Journal,High Voltage,2022-08-01,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou);UConn College of Engineering;Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology;Wuhan University;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna;Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier;ETH Zürich;Tsinghua University;Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Chongqing University;Tianjin University;Sichuan University;Peking University;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;Northwestern University;Bagley College of Engineering;The University of Manchester;Chinese University of Hong Kong;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China;Pennsylvania State University;Jiangsu Jinxin Electric Appliance Co.

Post-vaccination infection rates and modification of COVID-19 symptoms in vaccinated UK school-aged children and adolescents: A prospective longitudinal cohort study,"Background: We aimed to explore the effectiveness of one-dose BNT162b2 vaccination upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, its effect on COVID-19 presentation, and post-vaccination symptoms in children and adolescents (CA) in the UK during periods of Delta and Omicron variant predominance. Methods: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 115,775 CA aged 12-17 years, proxy-reported through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. We calculated post-vaccination infection risk after one dose of BNT162b2, and described the illness profile of CA with post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to unvaccinated CA, and post-vaccination side-effects. Findings: Between August 5, 2021 and February 14, 2022, 25,971 UK CA aged 12-17 years received one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. The probability of testing positive for infection diverged soon after vaccination, and was lower in CA with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination reduced proxy-reported infection risk (-80·4% (95% CI -0·82 -0·78) and -53·7% (95% CI -0·62 -0·43) at 14–30 days with Delta and Omicron variants respectively, and -61·5% (95% CI -0·74 -0·44) and -63·7% (95% CI -0·68 -0.59) after 61–90 days). Vaccinated CA who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta period had milder disease than unvaccinated CA; during the Omicron period this was only evident in children aged 12-15 years. Overall disease profile was similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated CA. Post-vaccination local side-effects were common, systemic side-effects were uncommon, and both resolved within few days (3 days in most cases). Interpretation: One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 90 days in CA aged 12-17 years. Vaccine protection varied for SARS-CoV-2 variant type (lower for Omicron than Delta variant), and was enhanced by pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severity of COVID-19 presentation after vaccination was generally milder, although unvaccinated CA also had generally mild disease. Overall, vaccination was well-tolerated.

Microbial experimental evolution in a massively multiplexed and high-throughput era,"Experimental evolution with microbial model systems has transformed our understanding of the basic rules underlying ecology and evolution. Experiments leveraging evolution as a central feature put evolutionary theories to the test, and modern sequencing and engineering tools then characterized the molecular basis of adaptation. As theory and experimentations refined our understanding of evolution, a need to increase throughput and experimental complexity has emerged. Here, we summarize recent technologies that have made high-throughput experiments practical and highlight studies that have capitalized on these tools, defining an exciting new era in microbial experimental evolution. Multiple research directions previously limited by experimental scale are now accessible for study and we believe applying evolutionary lessons from in vitro studies onto these applied settings has the potential for major innovations and discoveries across ecology and medicine.","Jagdish, Tanush;Nguyen Ba, Alex N.",Journal,Current Opinion in Genetics and Development,2022-08-01,University of Toronto;Harvard University,
"Scaffolding technologies for the engineering of cultured meat: Towards a safe, sustainable, and scalable production","Background: Cultured meat aims to solve the current sustainability and environmental issues of conventional livestock husbandry by converging tissue engineering practices with food innovation science to recapitulate the components and structure of animal-derived meat. To this end, various scaffolding technologies were adopted and developed to support the cultivation, expansion, and differentiation of cells using edible, low-cost, and sustainable materials and methods. The cell-scaffold constructs can benefit different processing strategies that include structuring approaches and additives to generate final cultured meat products. Scope and approach: In this paper, we elaborate on the main considerations for the design of scaffolds for cultured meat applications, review the leading scaffolding technologies, and discuss their current or potential application for the engineering of cultured meat. Key findings and conclusions: The extensive research efforts in recent years attest to the boundless potential of novel cultured meat scaffolds. Moreover, different scaffolding technologies originally developed for tissue engineering can be adapted to cultured meat by using edible materials and avoiding toxic crosslinkers and reagents throughout all of the development steps, thus ensuring compliance with food and safety regulations. Altogether, the combination of tissue engineering and food science technologies holds the promise of technologically and commercially viable scaffolds towards the realization of the cultured meat vision.","Levi, Shira;Yen, Feng Chun;Baruch, Limor;Machluf, Marcelle",Journal,Trends in Food Science and Technology,2022-08-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Bioprinting ;  Cultivated meat ;  cultured meat ;  Electrospinning ;  Microcarriers ;  Scaffolding
"Agglomeration spillover, accessibility by high-speed rail, and urban innovation in China: A focus on the electronic information industry","This study examines the impacts of different sources and types of agglomeration economies on urban innovation in the context high-speed rail (HSR), using the Electronic Information (EI) industry in China as an example. The impacts of inter-city access to different innovation factors such as knowledge sources (e.g., universities/research institutions), human capital (e.g., scientific/technical workers), input suppliers (e.g., producer services) and final markets through HSR networks are explored while local agglomeration effects and local proximity to HSR stations are controlled. Historical courier routes and stations and landform characteristics are used to construct instruments for endogenous HSR accessibility measures. Results indicate that local agglomeration benefits such as overall urban size, level of industrialization specialization and local access to top science/engineering universities/research institutions and producer service suppliers are positively associated with innovation performance in the EI sector. When longer travel time thresholds (e.g., >2 h) are applied, inter-city access to knowledge sources, human capital, producer services and final customers through HSR network yields significant impacts on innovation outputs of Type-II large cities (population in 1–3 million).","Hou, Yuting",Journal,Habitat International,2022-08-01,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Agglomeration economies ;  Electronic Information (EI) industry ;  High-speed Rail (HSR) ;  Inter-city accessibility ;  Urban innovation
Can the ecological environment reverse feed renewable energy technology innovation? -- Heterogeneity test from the Yangtze River Economic Belt,"This study uses panel data from 112 cities in 11 provinces and municipalities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) from 1998 to 2019. This study uses a spatial measurement model to test the reversal feeding effect (RFE) of the ecological environment (EE) on renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) in each area of the basin. The results showed that there is a gradual decrease in the strength of RFE from west to the east and a certain lag period. The RFE mechanism had regional heterogeneity. For eastern cities, industrial advancement, financial development, and resident consumption, together with EE, were significantly reverse-feed RETI. For central cities, it is mainly reflected in the interaction of EE on FDI and industrial advancement. For western cities, EE affects infrastructure investment and government R&D, thereby reversing feeding RETI. The results from the decomposition of spatial effects showed that the RFE of eastern cities in the integration process was not limited to the local area but also has a demonstration effect on neighbouring areas. The RFE in the central cities is limited to local areas due to the “Nimbyism” (Not in My Back Yard). “Race-to-top” among western cities can only produce an RFE in the local area but has a restraining effect on neighbouring areas.","Yan, Xiang;Bai, Jiancheng;Zhang, Yueyan;Hu, Shiliang",Journal,Renewable Energy,2022-08-01,Yancheng Teachers University;Nantong University;Hohai University;Southwest Jiaotong University,Ecological environment ;  Renewable energy technology innovation ;  Reverse feeding effect ;  Yangtze River Economic Belt
Is technological innovation a driver of renewable energy?,"This study unveils the causality between technology innovations and renewable energy in Germany. The discussion about technology innovations and renewable energy is beneficial because the country is most innovative and pursuing ambitious energy transition goals. The results of complete sample causality show that technology innovations significantly impact renewable energy. The rolling window method accounts for structural changes when examining the causal connection between technology innovations and renewable energy. The findings show that technology innovation drives renewable energy positively and negatively across multiple sub-samples. Similarly, renewable energy has a considerable effect on technology innovations in sub-samples, implying that advancement in renewable energy translates into increased spending on technology innovation.

Platform Provider Roles in Innovation in Software Service Ecosystems,"Following a new innovation strategy, software vendors move their software onto their software service platforms and open up their platforms to third-party software service vendors. Although many studies state that enlarging the scope of software service offerings is the goal of the platform providers, only a few studies have focused on the roles that the platform providers take on to achieve the goal. These studies identified that the platform providers not only manage the platform but also promote and regulate third-party software. In this article, we extend this research by analyzing the activities of how platform providers promote innovation. For the analysis, we use empirical data about software services gathered from AppExchange of Salesforce. The analysis identifies the clusters and positions of software services of Salesforce and third-party vendors in the software service network. Our analysis results show that Salesforce promotes innovation by provisioning software services that are in core positions or that are bridges between service clusters. Third-party vendors release software services that are complementary to those of Salesforce. Overall, the results suggest that platform providers need to position strategically their software services to build successful software ecosystems, and that research on innovation needs to analyze the roles and efforts of the platform providers in detail.","Kim, Kibae;Altmann, Jorn",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-08-01,SNU College of Engineering;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Open innovation ;  platform leadership ;  Salesforce.com ;  social network analysis ;  software industry ;  software services ;  software-as-a-service
Challenges and Research Directions in Crowdsourcing for Engineering Design: An Interview Study With Industry Professionals,"Crowdsourcing is an emerging paradigm in engineering design for open innovation. It offers various benefits to crucial aspects of design innovation, such as generating diverse design ideas and engaging consumers. However, crowdsourcing initiatives for engineering design are prone to failures if the complex nature of engineering design processes is not accounted for. For example, the initiative can fail if design solutions do not achieve the required quality, which, in turn, is influenced by factors such as domain knowledge, problem complexity, and incentive structures. Thus, there lies a need to systematically design crowdsourcing initiatives. In this article, the authors build on an existing framework for designing crowdsourcing initiatives in an engineering design context. They do so, by conducting an interview study with industry professionals with product design experience. The authors investigate the challenges experienced by these professionals for adopting crowdsourcing initiatives for engineering design. Through the study, research opportunities are identified that expand and aid the adoption of the framework. The authors discuss relevant literature for the identified research directions and frame the research gaps that need to be pursued. The authors conclude by encouraging academic communities to pursue collaborative efforts toward enabling systematic design of crowdsourcing initiatives for engineering design.","Shergadwala, Murtuza;Forbes, Hannah;Schaefer, Dirk;Panchal, Jitesh H.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-08-01,University of Liverpool;Purdue University,Crowdsourcing ;  engineering design ;  interviews ;  research opportunities
Biological Dark Matter Exploration using Data Mining for the Discovery of Antimicrobial Natural Products <sup>#</sup>,"The discovery of novel antimicrobials has significantly slowed down over the last three decades. At the same time, humans rely increasingly on antimicrobials because of the progressive antimicrobial resistance in medical practices, human communities, and the environment. Data mining is currently considered a promising option in the discovery of new antibiotics. Some of the advantages of data mining are the ability to predict chemical structures from sequence data, anticipation of the presence of novel metabolites, the understanding of gene evolution, and the corroboration of data from multiple omics technologies. This review analyzes the state-of-the-art for data mining in the fields of bacteria, fungi, and plant genomic data, as well as metabologenomics. It also summarizes some of the most recent research accomplishments in the field, all pinpointing to innovation through uncovering and implementing the next generation of antimicrobials.","Rivera-Chávez, José;Ceapǎ, Corina Diana;Figueroa, Mario",Journal,Planta Medica,2022-08-01,"Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Quimica",antimicrobial resistance ;  data mining ;  genome exploration ;  metabologenomics ;  natural products
Presenting a Hybrid Scheme of Machine Learning Combined with Metaheuristic Optimizers for Predicting Final Cost and Time of Project,"A primary task to a project manager is to ensure that the project proceeds timely and on the budget. Earned value management (EVM) is the most common method to evaluate and further predict a project in terms of time and cost. Because of poor accuracy in forecasting different durations, the application of the EVM for schedule performance prediction has been limited. Therefore, in this paper, the Kalman filter was used to analyze the data and compare the results with those of a few hybrid machine learning (HML) techniques. The innovation of this study comes in the face of the prediction of the project time and cost by efficient machine learning algorithms based on some directly measurable variables. For this purpose, 398 data points from five different dam projects were used to predict two output variables by hybrid schemes of multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm combined with the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), herein referred to as MLP-GA and MLP-PSO, respectively. Four input variables, namely earned schedule (month), earned value ($), actual progress (%), and actual cost (%), were considered for time prediction, and the time (month) was considered as an input variable for cost prediction. The results showed that early warnings for the risk of delay in project schedule and cost were generated in months 1 and 8 by the MLP-PSO, months 1 and 11 by the MLP-GA, and rather months 7 and NV (no value) for the Kalman filter, indicating the fast operation coupled with high accuracy of the HML algorithms, as compared to the Kalman filter. In addition, the two HML algorithms were compared based on statistical error indices to determine the best one. After reviewing the results, the MLP-PSO was found to outperform the MLP-GA in terms of convergence rate and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous studies have used the proposed hybrid algorithms (MELM-PSO and MELM-GA) for forecasting, simultaneously, the time and cost as two critical parameters in the project management, indicating the novelty of our research.","Bakhshi, Reza;Moradinia, Sina Fard;Jani, Rasool;Poor, Ramin Vafaei",Journal,KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering,2022-08-01,"Islamic Azad University, Tabriz Branch",Artificial intelligence ;  EVM ;  Hybrid machine learning ;  Kalman filter ;  Project cost ;  Project time
"Scientists wanted? A literature review on incentive programs that promote pro-environmental consumer behavior: Energy, waste, and water","This paper presents a systematic review of the research literature that applies quantitative techniques to inform incentive programs and policies promoting pro-environmental behavior and technology adoption among individual consumers. The paper points out that, while the number of active incentive programs is large, there is a dire need for scientific advances that could increase their impact in calculated ways. The expertise of the operations research and management science community, as well as industrial, systems, civil, and environmental engineering experience, appears to be particularly well suited to support such effort. The review covers the research work performed in three areas of practical importance: efficient energy consumption, waste management, and stormwater management.

"The nexus of financial development, technological innovation, institutional quality, and environmental quality: evidence from OECD economies","The present study investigates the effect of institution quality, technological innovation, and financial development on environment quality using 37 OECD nations from 1998 to 2018. The cross-sectional dependence (CD) and Lagrange multiplier (LM) techniques are used to measure the cross-sectional dependence. The second-generation panel unit root tests and panel cointegration tests are applied to examine the unit-root properties and long-run association existence between variables. Finally, we employed the two-step (SYS-GMM) methodology to estimate the coefficient values. The findings showed that financial development has a positive effect on selected carbon (CO2) emission dimensions. When the moderating term is introduced, it was identified that institutional quality and technology innovation conditioning effects are crucial between financial development and CO2 emission. Our evidence-based study provides significant results for technology innovation and institutional quality moderating role in reducing CO2 emissions in OECD economies. Our findings are also robust to alternative measures, which could be useful for policymakers to formulate long-term and short-term strategies and policies for a better sustainable environment.","Jianguo, Du;Ali, Kishwar;Alnori, Faisal;Ullah, Sami",Journal,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2022-08-01,"Shandong University, Weihai;Jiangsu University;King Abdulaziz University",CO  emissions 2 ;  Financial development ;  Institutional quality ;  OECD ;  SYS-GMM ;  Technological innovation
Review of bike-sharing system studies using bibliometrics method,"Compared to motorized modes, bike-sharing systems (BSSs) are generally recognized as an environmentally friendly mode of transport and mobility. Due to the advantages and benefits of BSSs, they have spread globally in the past decade. The mapping knowledge domain (MKD) technique is an important tool for bibliometric analysis that can directly reflect the development status and trends in a research field and has been extensively applied in natural science, medical science, engineering and technology, humanities and the social sciences. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of the development trend in bike-sharing studies taken from Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection articles published between 2010 and 2020 using the MKD software tool VOSviewer and CiteSpace. The results show that the topics of the cited documents can be divided into three categories: (a) development, operation mode and lessons learned; (b) BSS static rebalancing problem; (c) spatiotemporal characteristics and demand prediction. Next, we conduct document co-citation analysis and keyword co-occurrence analysis to visually explore the research trends in bike-sharing studies. Our results also find that, (a) bicycle rebalancing problem, (b) travel behavioral movements and barrier, (c) impact factors and characteristics of the internal usage demand, (d) innovation and sustainability for BSSs in the future, and (e) built environment and land-use, are the five major research areas and interests for bike-sharing studies. Finally, examining the trends in BSSs studies by identifying keyword bursts allows an on-demand characteristics analysis based on multisource data fusion technology. This study expands the application field of the MKD analysis method and promotes the development of BSSs against a background of new technology innovation.","Zhou, Jibiao;Guo, Yanyong;Sun, Jian;Yu, Erze;Wang, Rui",Journal,Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering (English Edition),2022-08-01,Tongji University;Southeast University;Ningbo University of Technology;China'an University;Ltd.,Bibliometric analysis ;  Bike-sharing system ;  CiteSpace ;  Mapping knowledge domain ;  Visualization ;  VOSviewer
LOGISWARM: A low-cost multi-robot testbed for cooperative transport research,"An increased demand in the market for various commodities, especially FMCGs (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) requires warehouses to stock up an increased number of items which keep renewing rapidly. Conventional methods of warehouse logistics employ mixed use of human labor and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) which involve a lot of cost for running and maintenance, and come with a number of limitations. Hence, technological innovations such as a group of robots, can be used to assist warehouse logistics in a novel and efficient manner. This paper presents a low-cost multi-robot testbed - LOGISWARM, a model which can be used to study how a group of robots can be employed for warehouse logistics and related applications. Each robot in the system is called a BudgeBOT, which is a two-wheeled differential drive robot. A feedback system consisting of overhead camera(s) is also used to constantly monitor and correct error(s) which arise during the transportation of payload. LOGISWARM can act as a research platform which can be used to develop and study multi-robot cooperative transport mechanisms and their behavior for different payload form factors, robot configurations, and applications; alongside being inexpensive, easy to develop and resistant to overall system failure.","Gupta, Shreshtha;Shekhar, Shashank;Karpe, Kedar;Ghosh, Aninda;Js, Gautham;Srinivas, Pranav;Kumar, Mayank;Sharma, Preshit;Sinha, Avinash;Singh, Kushagra;Ramamoorthy, Kumar;Dhanalakshmi, Samiappan",Journal,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2022-08-01,SRM Institute of Science and Technology,Automated guided vehicles ;  BudgeBOT ;  LOGISWARM ;  Multi-robot testbed
Assessment of the advancement of market-upstream innovations and of the performance of research and innovation projects,"The assessment of the advancement of technological innovations at their development stage is a difficult task, but important to judge on the performance of innovation projects. Assessments have so far been made by assessing technical characteristics, subjectively, or by counting patents. This paper proposes an approach to assess the advancement of market-upstream innovations directly and objectively, through the advancement of their technological maturity. On this basis, also the innovation performance of larger projects that were put in place to progress one or several innovations, can be assessed. The paper presents an exploratory qualitative multi-case study of 54 innovative technologies at different maturity levels, that were developed in 5 market-upstream large technological research and innovation projects with mostly engineering and IT dimensions, funded by the European Union's Research and Innovation Programmes under its sub-programme “Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies”. From extensive documentation and data from interviews, a refined technology readiness scale and a scoring method that reflects the increase in the required efforts to advance the maturity of the innovations is developed. The findings provide groundwork for future research on market-upstream innovation and how the innovation performance of projects can be measured at the early stages of the innovation process.","Klessova, Svetlana;Engell, Sebastian;Thomas, Catherine",Journal,Technovation,2022-08-01,Université Côte d'Azur;Technische Universität Dortmund,Innovation ;  Innovation performance ;  Innovative technologies ;  Market-upstream ;  Maturation ;  Project ;  R&D ;  Technology readiness levels
Uncertainty and learning in a technologically dynamic industry: Seed density in U.S. maize,"The large and sustained yield gains achieved since the introduction of maize hybrids in the 1930s (about 1.8 bushels per acre per year) have been accompanied by a remarkably parallel and steady increase in seeding density. This increase occurred in an environment characterized by rapid technological innovation, including genetic engineering, and commercial hybrid varieties with short life cycles. An important question, then, is whether and how breeders and farmers have learned about the optimal planting density. In this paper, we use unique and detailed U.S. farm-level data, consisting of more than 400,000 planting choices from 1995–2016, to assess the nature of learning about seeding density. Importantly, we control for unobserved confounders through both hybrid and farm-level fixed effects. We find that the variance in planting rates for a given hybrid has decreased over time, and that farmers tend to plant a given variety at higher rates over time. This is consistent with Bayesian learning in which risk-neutral farmers possess priors consistently below the true optimal rate. We cast doubt on risk aversion as a credible explanation for this finding by analyzing the contrasting evolution of soybean planting rates (a crop with exogenously different agronomic determinants of seed density). We interpret our results as evidence of inertia: the initial bias in maize farmers' priors is tilted towards the optimal planting rates of varieties planted in the past. One implication of the finding that farmers historically underinvested in seeding rates is that eliminating this tendency could result in productivity gains.","Perry, Edward D.;Hennessy, David A.;Moschini, Gian Carlo",Journal,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,2022-08-01,Iowa State University;Kansas State University,Bayesian learning ;  inertia ;  maize hybrids ;  productivity ;  seeding density ;  uncertainty
Procedure for the Determination of the Student Workload and the Learning Environment Created in the Power Electronics Course Taught Through Project-Based Learning,"Contribution: In the research presented in this article, a procedure for determining student workload has been designed, tested, and validated. This procedure also makes it possible to analyze how different teaching variables are affected by workload and to visualize the learning environment generated in the course. Background: When the project-based learning (PBL) methodology is used in a course, if the students' workload is not properly planned and controlled, important variables in the educational environment, such as the teaching organization and the students' approach to learning, can be affected. The PBL methodology may even become unfeasible as it affects the other courses with which it shares year and semester. This justifies the need to know the student workload of a subject. The previous research has presented procedures for establishing student workload. However, they use questionnaires with a high number of questions. A questionnaire with many questions affects the reliability of students' answers. The questionnaire presented in this article reduces the number of questions without affecting the results obtained and it is easily applicable to other courses. Research Questions: The questions to be answered in this research are: 1) is the workload of the students, when using the PBL methodology in a course, in line with the one established in the syllabus? and 2) is the learning environment created in the course as expected? Methodology: The methodology used to obtain the necessary data is based on students completing weekly surveys, two critical incident questionnaires (CIQs), and a final survey. The aim was always to minimize the number of questions to be answered, ensuring that the data collected provided a true picture of the workload and the educational environment. Findings: The analysis of the data obtained by applying the procedure provides mechanisms to control the workload, ensure involvement and motivation, improve students' academic results and show the learning environment created in the course. The implementation of this method, during three academic years, has allowed to test its effectiveness, validate some of the initial hypotheses, and confirm the conclusions of some previous studies.","Herrero-De Lucas, L.

Systematizing serendipity for big science infrastructures: The ATTRACT project,"Big Science Research Infrastructures (BSRIs) are tremendous sources of ‘deep-tech’ with the potential to foment alternative commercial applications in diverse industries. Yet, cultivating novel applications of BSRI technologies is not straightforward due to misalignment between their scientific mission, large technological risks, market uncertainties, and long development times. Given these challenges, research is needed to understand if- and how-serendipitous innovations can be purposefully developed from BSRIs. In this study, we analyse ATTRACT, a novel initiative funded by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program, which funded 170 projects with €100,000 each to develop a proof-of-concept commercial application of BSRI technologies within one year. Our analysis of this dataset identifies three modes employed by researchers to come up with alternate applications: (1) combining different technologies, (2) applying technology into a different field, and (3) using artificial intelligence or machine learning. In a second step, we conducted multinomial logistic regressions using the project data, expert evaluations, and a questionnaire to identify the antecedents associated with the pursuit of each of the three modes. Our findings suggest that scientists and engineers develop many new ideas about novel potential applications of BSRI technologies in their daily work. The main value of ATTRACT is in facilitating project development through financial resources, brokering relationships with industrial partners, and facilitating the applications of technologies in domains outside of the immediate purview of BSRIs.","Wareham, Jonathan;Pujol Priego, Laia;Romasanta, Angelo Kenneth;Mathiassen, Thomas Wareham;Nordberg, Markus;Tello, Pablo Garcia",Journal,Technovation,2022-08-01,"Universitat Ramon Llull, ESADE;IESE Business School;Organisation Européenne pour la Recherche Nucléaire;Technical University of Denmark",Big science ;  Deep tech ;  Innovation policy ;  Serendipity
From Acquaintances to Partners in Innovation: An Analysis of 20 Years of Design Thinking's Contribution to New Product Development,"Scholars have suggested that design thinking (DT) should form an integral part of the new product development (NPD) process. However, the contribution of DT to NPD over the past years is yet to be synthesized. In this article, we develop a conceptual framework categorizing how DT contributes to NPD, and present a map to visualize how research in the area of DT in NPD has evolved over the past 20 years. A systematic analysis of 89 journal papers published between 2000 and 2020 helped to generate a conceptual framework, which provides a typology for discussing the growing state of the art of DT in NPD. The study enhances the academic debate by providing a holistic perspective on how DT contributes to the NPD ecosystem and offers directions for future research for the next 20 years.","De Paula, Danielly;Cormican, Kathryn;Dobrigkeit, Franziska",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-08-01,Hasso-Plattner-Institut für Softwaresystemtechnik GmbH;University of Galway,Design engineering ;  engineering education ;  innovation management ;  product design ;  product development ;  research and development management ;  user-centered design
Design Thinking in Digital Innovation Projects - Exploring the Effects of Intangibility,"The locus of innovation has shifted from mechanical advances to digital solutions. By emphasizing the importance of user needs, Design Thinking is apt to develop human-centered innovation, including digital solutions. Using two representative examples from 21 Design Thinking projects spanning the gamut of mechatronic to fully digital solutions, we report on critical incidents as opportunities and challenges of applying Design Thinking in a digital context. In the case of mechatronic solutions, we identified opportunities related to improved collaboration and higher quality prototyping as well as in innovative business models, which in turn created challenges in managing stakeholders. In the fully digital context, we observed opportunities in improved needfinding and the ability to offer individualized products. Conversely, we uncover difficulties in imagining digital features, estimating their feasibility, and correctly setting the fidelity of prototypes. Based on these observations, we discuss the intangibility of digital artifacts as enabler and inhibitor of Design Thinking in a digital context.","Przybilla, Leonard;Klinker, Kai;Lang, Michael;Schreieck, Maximilian;Wiesche, Manuel;Krcmar, Helmut",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-08-01,Technische Universität Dortmund;Technische Universität München;Msg Nexinsure Ag,Creativity ;  design engineering ;  design tools ;  innovation management ;  project management ;  research and development management ;  technological innovation

The Effects of Knowledge Spillovers and Accelerator Programs on the Product Innovation of High-Tech Start-Ups: A Multiple Case Study,"The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (KSTE) explores the effects that new knowledge and proximity have on the exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities and the resultant creation of start-ups. This paper aims to identify the types of knowledge spillovers that affect entrepreneurs in the early stages of start-up development. A conceptual model is proposed, using a multi-case study approach involving high-tech start-ups that have attended accelerator and incubator programs in Greater London, United Kingdom. The research involved 32 semistructured interviews with chief executive officers and cofounders of start-up companies. Our findings suggest that entrepreneurs are influenced by various forms of knowledge spillover which assist in determining the strategic decision of the company, in terms of formation, including partnerships or alliances, allocation of Research and Development budgets, and engagement in product innovation. Further observations confirm that high-tech start-ups focus on a fast pace of constant product innovation to cover identified gaps in the market. One significant finding is that start-ups use various technological platforms to access knowledge spillovers which challenge the ideas of geographical proximity present in existing KSTE understanding.","Cuvero, Marco;Granados, Maria Luisa;Pilkington, Alan;Evans, Richard David",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-08-01,Westminster Business School;Brunel University London,Absorptive capacity ;  accelerator programs ;  entrepreneurship ;  high-tech start-ups ;  knowledge spillovers ;  product innovation
Damping Characteristics and Identification Methods for Long-span Bridges: A Review,"The continuous increase in bridge spans, innovations in structural systems and the application of lightweight high-strength materials have led to a decline in damping for long-span bridge structures. Consequently, it has intensified vibration sensitivity of bridges to dynamic loads, such as wind, vehicles, and earthquakes. This article is intended to summarize recent research findings on damping characteristics and identification methods for long-span bridges, and to promote progress in excitation technology and damping identification techniques. The review is organized in four aspects. Firstly, a systematic examination of the structural damping theories and a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of damping characteristics for long-span bridges are presented. Secondly, an extensive summary of the working principles, excitation systems, and application status of long-span bridge excitation technology are provided. Thirdly, the research progress of time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency domain methods for long-span bridge damping identification based on ambient excitation is deeply analyzed, and the latest achievements in the areas of intelligent, automated, and uncertainty quantification of damping identification are systematically elaborated; in addition, the damping identification methods based on forced vibration and their application status are summarized. Lastly, the paper identifies directions for further research in four areas: damping theory, excitation technology, sensing systems, and identification methods. The findings from this review offer a theoretical foundation for the development of damping theory and identification method for long-span bridge structures. In addition, it is helpful to determine the suitable value of the structural damping for dynamic analysis of long-span bridges, and it may serve as a valuable reference for design and intelligent operation and maintenance of long-span bridges.","Chen, Zheng Qing;Hua, Xu Gang;Feng, Zhou Quan;Gui, Bing;Zhang, Ji Ren",Journal,Zhongguo Gonglu Xuebao/China Journal of Highway and Transport,2022-07-31,China Communications Construction Company Limited;Hunan University;Key Laboratory for Wind and Bridge Engineering of Hunan Province,bridge engineering ;  damping characteristics ;  damping estimation methods ;  excitation technology ;  review ;  structural damping

Literature Study on the Effect of Blockchain Usage on Cryptocurrencies Looks at Comparisons of Previous Research,"With the advancement of information and communication technology (ICT) and technological innovation, the learning ecosystem has changed greatly facilitating open and distance learning systems (ODL) in providing education anywhere at any time in meeting the changing learning needs in modern society. Blockchain is currently attracting attention as an innovative technology to change the future, has emerged as a new paradigm of financial markets. A blockchain is a distributed ledger created by blocks containing details of transactions connected in chronological order to form a series of chains. Blockchain is designed to store and use a cryptocurrency called bitcoin securely. Cryptocurrency is a virtual currency that operates in a blockchain-based decentralized system. Cryptocurrency transactions are conducted peer to peer (P2P) without the intervention of financial intermediaries. The increasing interest in cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology of blockchain is also reflected in the entry of regular businesses into the crypto world by using token hype prices (HYPE) or token inflated prices to profit. Therefore, the focus in this study is to compare the influence of blockchain usage on cryptocurrencies looking at previous research.","Sidiq, Muhammad Iqbal;Roth, William Stanley;Rusmanto, Toto",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-07-07,Bina Nusantara University,Blockchain ;  Cryptocurrency ;  Systematic Literature Review
Efficient Photoinduced Thermocatalytic Chemiluminescence System Based on the Z-Scheme Heterojunction Ag<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf>/Ag/Bi<inf>4</inf>Ti<inf>3</inf>O<inf>12</inf>for H<inf>2</inf>S Sensing,"Cataluminescence as a highly efficient gas transduction principle has attracted wide attention among research in environmental monitoring and clinical diagnosis with increasing awareness of human safety. Nowadays, the development of innovation sensing systems and the construction of the sensing mechanism to improve the analytical performance of compounds remain a major challenge. Herein, we construct an advanced photoinduced thermocatalytic chemiluminescence (PI-TC-CL) gas-sensing system via the introduction of a Z-scheme heterojunction Ag3PO4/Ag/Bi4Ti3O12to achieve higher efficient detection of H2S. The unique electron transport path of the Z-scheme heterojunction and the LSPR effect of Ag nanoparticles fascinate the generation of the photoinduced electron-hole pair on the surface of catalysts when stimulated by LED lamps and slow down the recombination of electron-hole pairs under thermal conditions. Thus, based on the cooperative effect of the Z-scheme heterojunction AgPO/Ag/BTO and PI-TC-CL system, we have successfully established an efficient H2S CTL detection system, which has a response three times higher than that on the traditional CTL system and even 45 times higher than that on BTO and ranges among the best of the state-of-the-art CTL performance in H2S detection with the linear range of 0.095-8.87 μg mL-1and a limit of detection of 0.0065 μg mL-1. Besides, to explore the gas-sensing mechanism, the synergetic effects of photoinduction and thermal catalysis are investigated thoroughly via conductivity and electrochemical experiments. This research provides a new perspective of engineering highly efficient catalysts and ingenious sensor systems through designing the nanostructure of materials and synergism catalytic mechanism.","Hu, Jiaxi;Song, Hongjie;Chen, Cheng;Zhang, Lichun;Sun, Mingxia;Lv, Yi",Journal,Analytical Chemistry,2022-07-05,"Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Technology, Ministry of Education;Sichuan University",
"At the nexus of science, engineering, and medicine: Pasteur's quadrant reconsidered","There has been a sea change in the scientific world, advanced even more rapidly by the recent compounded public crises. Accelerated discovery, and impact from such discoveries have come from convergence approaches across disciplines, sectors, institutions, and the multiple communities seeking the common goal of innovations that transform. The classic simultaneous pursuit of fundamental understanding and application has been termed Pasteur s quadrant, where use-inspired basic research occurs. In the classic schematic developed by Donald Stokes, three quadrants represent research approaches using a 2D plane in which the vertical dimension represents the quest for understanding (basic research) and the horizontal dimension represents the consideration of use (applied research). The three outer quadrants are Bohr s (pure basic research), Edison s (pure applied research), and Pasteur s (useinspired basic research). Viewing each of these axes as a continuum, we label the previously unnamed but contributory cell as the Innominate quadrant, where a nonzero amount of discovery and applied research also has value in generating scientific tools, novel processes or products that inform the other quadrants. More importantly, a reimagined Pasteur s quadrant schema shows a third dimension of Transformations over Time, occurring through a continuous fluid interchange among the quadrants. Transformative innovations may originate from any single quadrant. While work in Pasteur s quadrant has been shown to be highly productive, a dynamic fluid interchange among the quadrants is often involved and generates transformative advances at a faster rate. This should inform how we fund science, engineering, and medicine and educate the next generation of innovators.","Pettigrew, Roderic I.;Cooke, John P.",Journal,PNAS Nexus,2022-07-01,Texas A&M University;Houston Methodist,

The use of the Arduino microcontroller and its sensors are widely used for the design of different prototypes, due to their low cost, in addition to having simple programming and open-source software. For the present research, an educational prototype, was developed which performs an acid-base volumetric titration in an automated, way which is made up of mechanical, electrical, as well as 3D printing parts, in consequence can be implemented and improved in engineering careers where chemistry is a fundamental subject.","Díaz, Sara Marcela Arellano;Chávez, José Luis Hurtado;Abonce, Alejandro Ruelas;Flores, Fabiola Estefanía Tristán",Journal,Educacion Quimica,2022-07-01,Tecnológico Nacional de México en Celaya,Arduino ;  Chemistry ;  Prototype ;  Teaching
Immersive Virtual Environments' Impact on Individual and Collective Creativity A Review of Recent Research,"This paper explores the recent advances in research concerning the impact of immersive virtual environments affordances on the expression of users' creativity at individual and team levels. While the top virtual reality (VR) application areas are entertainment and gaming, simulation and training for professionals, research in the domain of the psychology of creativity and VR is advancing rapidly in Europe. Indeed, between 2014 and 2021, 72% of publications in this domain resulted from European research in diverse fields such as engineering, design, music composition, art-making, and so forth. These studies took advantage of advanced VR affordances, such as head and hand motion trackers to synchronize an avatar in real-time, live streaming of a video into a VR headset screen to create artwork, etc. Four main topics were explored: (a) new creativity techniques involving a virtual upgrade of traditionally used techniques, virtual sketching and prototyping, as well as sophisticated interactive virtual menus and motion tracking systems, (b) the right digital self-representation for enhancing creativity and the degree to which users identify with the “persona avatar” in the context of user-centered innovations, (c) the impact of physical and social virtual contextual cues on creative performance, and (d) the perception of virtual reality by creativity and innovation professionals. Our review confirms that VR supports greater creative performance at individual and collaborative levels as well as enjoyment and fun. However, as rich and varied as this literature has become, it presents major methodological limitations that should be addressed in future research.","Bourgeois-Bougrine, Samira;Bonnardel, Nathalie;Burkhardt, Jean Marie;Thornhill-Miller, Branden;Pahlavan, Farzaneh;Buisine, Stéphanie;Guegan, Jérôme;Pichot, Nicolas;Lubart, Todd",Journal,European Psychologist,2022-07-01,"École d’ingénieurs CESI;Université Gustave Eiffel;Centre de Recherche en Psychologie de la Connaissance, du Langage et de l'Émotion;University of Oxford;Université de Paris",immersive virtual environments ;  persona avatars ;  self-perception ;  users-centered creative design ;  virtual creativity techniques
Architectural fabrication of multifunctional janus nanostructures for biomedical applications,"The domain of Janus nanoparticles (JNPs) has seen a surge in research and development during the last decade. JNPs are anisotropic composite innovations with remarkable characteristics that depict a peculiar class of particles, which integrate the features and functions of multiple materials into a single unit. Janus particles are superior prospects for several high-end applications due to their possible modifications by ""click chemistry"". JNPs offer new possibilities by combining the features of components. Janus nanoparticles can pack multiple pharmaceuticals and imaging contrast agents simultaneously since they have a distinct chemical configuration on different sides. As a result, they become ideal for administration and bioimaging at once. They have sparked interest due to their exceptional architecture and their potential implications in science and engineering, biological application, and most notably, theranostics. The emphasis of this review is on the latest advancement in the fabrication and implementation of innovative Janus nanoparticles, along with their spectacular performance in therapeutic delivery applications.","Harini, Karthick;Girigoswami, Koyeli;Ghosh, Debanjana;Pallavi, Pragya;Gowtham, Pemula;Girigoswami, Agnishwar",Journal,Nanomedicine Journal,2022-07-01,Chettinad Academy of Research and Education;Georgia Southern University,Biomedical applications ;  Janus ;  Multifunctional ;  Nanoparticles
Improvement of capacity and safety protection technology for long-distance water delivery projects in cold regions,"The long-distance water delivery is the important measure to solve the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and to ensure the major strategic layout of the national water resources in China, and it is worthy of the name lifeline project Water delivery canals in Northwest China face the Most harsh natural conditions such as extreme cold, abnormal drought and complex geological environment, which may result in frequent disasters such as frost heave, water swelling and salt swelling. Accordingly, the watersupply efficiency of the canals is affected and their operational safety is threatened, which greatly hinders the sustainable development of the local society and economy. The National Key Research and Development Program of China during the 13th Five-Year Plan period ""Long-distance water supply engineering capacity improvement and safety assurance technology in alpine regions"" was implemented. Based on the large water supply canal inNorthern Xinjiang, the program aims at the efficient utilization of water resources to ensure the safety of water supply and to realize the disaster prevention and Mitigation. After the joint researches for nearly four years, a series of innovations were achieved in the deterioration mechanism of water delivery canals in cold regions, the upgrading and transformation technology of canal anti-freezing, the control technology of low-temperature operation of canals, and the safety guarantee and risk prevention and control technology of canals cold in alpine regions. The relevant achievements have been widely used in large-scale water supply projects in Northern Xinjiang, and have achieved significant social, economic and environmental benefits, with broad application prospects and great significance.","Cai, Zheng Yin;Zhang, Chen;Zhu, Xun;Huang, Yin Hao;Wang, Yi",Journal,Yantu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering,2022-07-01,Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute,cold region ;  deterioration mechanism ;  frost heave ;  low-temperature operation ;  water delivery canal
New prevention and treatment techniques and their applications to landslides and engineering slopes of expansive soils,"Expansive soils are widely distributed in China, especially in the regions with high population density. Characterized by the well-known 'three properties', i.e., swelling-shrinkage, cracking and over-consolidation, the expansive soils are highly susceptible to climate change and engineering activities, and thus can easily cause landslides. Due to the lack of consideration to the interactive 'three properties' of the expansive soils, the traditional techniques can hardly be effective for the treatment of expansive soil landslides and engineering slopes, leaving the latter known as 'cancer' that imperils the safety of engineering projects. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the National Key Research and Development Program of China “New prevention and treatment techniques and their applications to landslides and engineering slopes of expansive soils” was approved. With special attention to the interactive 'three properties' of the expansive soils, the program has made series of innovations including the instability mechanism and the key disaster factors of expansive soil landslides, multi-field information monitoring and early warning techniques, 'surface-shallow-deep' integrated and ecological reinforcement technique, health diagnosis and rapid restoration techniques for slope protection structures. These techniques are integrated as a technical system and have been implemented in three engineering demonstrations. The relevant achievements have provided new theories, techniques and construction methods for treating the landslides and engineering slopes of the expansive soils. Meanwhile, they have achieved significant social, economic and environmental benefits, with broad application prospects.","Ye, Wei Min;Kong, Ling Wei;Hu, Rui Lin;Zha, Fu Sheng;Shi, Sheng Wei;Liu, Zhang Rong",Journal,Yantu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering,2022-07-01,Tongji University;Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences;Institute of Geology and Geophysics Chinese Academy of Sciences;Hefei University of Technology;Wuhan Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences,engineering demonstration ;  expansive soil ;  health diagnosis and repair ;  monitoring and warning ;  prevention technique ;  safety assessment
Innovations in prediction theories and prevention technologies for deformation-induced failure process of high earth and rockfill dams,"China is the country with the largest amounts of high earth and rockfill dams in the world. Complex construction conditions and severe operation environment lead to great technical challenges in their construction and long-term safety guarantee. The main research results of the National Research and Development Program of China during the 13th Five-Year Plan period “Key technologies for construction and long-term safety protection of extra-high earth-rock dams under complex conditions” are introduced as follows: the mechanism of particle breakage on deformation of dams, flow rules during loading and creeping of rockfill materials as well as the damage process of in-situ structures of overburden soils are revealed, and the constitutive theories that can be used to predict the deformation developing process and distribution of dam body and foundation are established accordingly. The numerical methods for complex contacting problems and initiation and development of 3D cracks in high earth and rockfill dams are developed based on the computational contact mechanics. The practical consolidation theory of unsaturated soils is developed to simulate the deformation-seepage coupling effects during the whole life spans of high earth and rockfill dams. A new thermo-mechanical coupled method is proposed to account for the temperature-induced stress and damage of concrete slabs in concrete-faced rockfill dams. A high performance software platform is established to simulate the whole process including dam filling, impoundment and operation of high earth and rockfill dams. A series of techniques and measures preventing and controlling the deformation-induced damage processes are suggested for extra high earth and rockfill dams under complex conditions.","Chen, Sheng Shui",Journal,Yantu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering,2022-07-01,Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute,computational theory and method ;  deformation and damage ;  high earth and rockfill dam ;  prevention technology
Research on the low carbon transformation path of power generation under the goal of carbon neutralization,"The goal of ""carbon peak and carbon neutral"" points out the direction and path for the low-carbon transformation and scientific and technological innovation in China′s power generation field. Under the background of the innovative development of the global energy and power industry, the development of power generation towards low-carbon, clean, intelligent, electrification, marketization and internationalization will become an inevitable trend. The current situation, existing problems and future technological development path of low-carbon transformation scientific and technological innovation in the field of power generation in China were analyzed in the direction of clean and efficient coal power generation, renewable energy power generation, nuclear energy, advanced energy storage and hydrogen energy. In order to adapt to the new power system based on new energy, the traditional main power supply gradually changes to the basic power supply in China′s coal-fired power units. However, most of the domestic units are designed according to the basic load, and the key indicators such as load regulation range and load change rate are far behind those of abroad. In addition, there are still the problems of low efficiency and high carbon emission of old units. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the research on flexible and intelligent power generation, ultra-high parameter coal-fired power generation, new and efficient coal-fired power generation, and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies. The hydropower technology in China has been improved in an all-round way and formed the integration capacity of whole industrial chain. However, it also needs to make efforts in high head, large capacity and ultra-low head generator units, safe and efficient operation and smart power stations. The wind power technology in China has made comprehensive research, deployment and breakthroughs in wind turbine design and manufacturing, wind farm development and operation and maintenance, equipment testing and certification, and standard system construction, and it also needs to tackle the key problems in the direction of large-scale, lightweight and low-cost wind power generation, promote the application of next-generation information and communication technology, and improve the localization rate of key components. The photovoltaic power generation technology in China is basically synchronized with the world. High efficiency and low cost are its main technical direction. The solar thermal power generation technology in China lags behind foreign countries with respect to systematic design and integrated operation, and it is necessary to develop solar thermal power generation technology with large capacity, high parameters, long-time heat storage and low cost. The geothermal power generation and marine power generation technologies in China are in the stage of basic research or technology research and verification, technical research and engineering demonstration still need to be strengthened in the future. In terms of nuclear filed, China already has a complete nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear industry system, and nuclear power technology is in the forefront of the world, however, problems still exist in basic technology, process, materials, software and other aspects. It is also necessary to strengthen the research in advanced nuclear energy systems and comprehensive utilization of nuclear energy, adhere to the technical route of closed nuclear fuel cycle, and continuously improve the safety of nuclear energy utilization. In terms of energy storage technology, At present, China′s energy storage filed is moving towards large-scale development, but there is still a gap between the energy storage industry and the overall healthy development, and the energy storage technology still needs to be developed in the direction of safety, long life, low cost and large-scale. In terms of hydrogen energy technology, China has formed a complete industrial chain, but hydrogen mainly comes from gray hydrogen. In the future, the development of electrolytic water to produce green hydrogen technology supported by large-scale photovoltaic power generation or wind power generation will become the focus.","Hu, Daocheng;Zhang, Shuai;Han, Tao;Zheng, Xufan;Gu, Yongzheng;Xu, Dong",Journal,Clean Coal Technology,2022-07-01,CHN Energy;Ltd.;Ltd.,carbon neutralization ;  carbon peak ;  energy storage ;  hydrogen energy ;  low carbon transformation ;  nuclear energy ;  power generation ;  renewable energy

Analysis of Adaptability of the 32 m Simply-supported Box Beam Used in the 350 km/h High Speed Railway with Speed Increasing to 400 km/h,"Research purposes: The train speed of high speed railway is one of the important indicators to measure the development level of national railway and 400 km/h is the goal or development direction pursued by many countries. China Railway has organized the ""CR450 Scientific and Technology Innovation Project"" in 2021. Based on the test data of 32 m simply supported box beam of Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway in the speed range of 420 km/h of EMU, the adaptability of 32 m simply supported box beam used in the 350 km/h high speed railway to 400 km/h operation of EMU was done by the analyses of its natural frequency, vertical stiffness and dynamic response under the action of EMU. Research conclusions:(1)The measured vertical natural frequency of 32 m simply supported box beam is 6.68~7.03 Hz, which is greater than the fundamental frequency limit of 5.1 Hz determined by the relevant literature according to the 440 km/h simulation calculation. (2) The vertical stiffness of the 32 m simply supported box beam can ensure the safety and ride comfort of EMU running at 400 km/h. (3) The structure bearing capacity of the 32 m simply supported box beam meets the operating load requirement of EMU running at 400 km/h. (4) The maximum measured vertical vibration acceleration of 32 m simply supported box beam is 0.27 m/s2, which is less than limit value of 5.0 m/s2 specified in Code for Design of High Speed Railway. (5) Within the speed range of 420 km/h of the EMU, the measured wheelset lateral force of main line is generally less than 20 kN, the measured values of the lateral amplitude at the midspan of beam and the top of pier are small, and the measured lateral relative displacement of the rail support on both sides of the adjacent beam ends of the ballastless track is less than the limit value of 1 mm specified in Code for Design of High Speed Railway. The vertical and lateral stiffness of 32 m simply supported box beam used in the existing 350 km/h high speed railway can ensure the safety and ride comfort of EMU running at 400 km/h.

"Merging Plastics, Microbes, and Enzymes: Highlights from an International Workshop","In the Anthropocene, plastic pollution is a worldwide concern that must be tackled from different viewpoints, bringing together different areas of science. Microbial transformation of polymers is a broad-spectrum research topic that has become a keystone in the circular economy of fossil-based and biobased plastics. To have an open discussion about these themes, experts in the synthesis of polymers and biodegradation of lignocellulose and plastics convened within the framework of The Transnational Network for Research and Innovation in Microbial Biodiversity, Enzymes Technology and Polymer Science (MENZYPOL-NET), which was recently created by early-stage scientists from Colombia and Germany. In this context, the international workshop ""Microbial Synthesis and Degradation of Polymers: Toward a Sustainable Bioeconomy""was held on 27 September 2021 via Zoom. The workshop was divided into two sections, and questions were raised for discussion with panelists and expert guests. Several key points and relevant perspectives were delivered, mainly related to (i) the microbial evolution driven by plastic pollution; (ii) the relevance of and interplay between polymer structure/composition, enzymatic mechanisms, and assessment methods in plastic biodegradation; (iii) the recycling and valorization of plastic waste; (iv) engineered plastic-degrading enzymes; (v) the impact of (micro)plastics on environmental microbiomes; (vi) the isolation of plastic-degrading (PD) microbes and design of PD microbial consortia; and (vii) the synthesis and applications of biobased plastics. Finally, research priorities from these key points were identified within the microbial, enzyme, and polymer sciences.","Jiménez, Diego Javier;Öztürk, Basak;Wei, Ren;D.bugg, Timothy;Gomez, Carol Viviana Amaya;Galan, Felipe Salcedo;Castro-Mayorga, Jinneth Lorena;Saldarriaga, Juan Fernando;Tarazona, Natalia Andrea",Journal,Applied and Environmental Microbiology,2022-07-01,"Faculty of Science, Engineering and Medicine;Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria, AGROSAVIA;Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH;Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia;Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon GmbH;Universität Greifswald",biobased plastics ;  biodegradation ;  enzyme engineering ;  lignocellulose ;  microbial consortia ;  microbial evolution ;  microbiomes ;  plastic recycling ;  polyethylene terephthalate ;  polymer science
What do we know about students’ positioning in STEM? A systematic literature review,"The rise of the educational perspective STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in educational research and innovation has led to the publication of many studies on the evolution of student positioning towards STEM disciplines and activities. The aim of this study is to synthesize the major contributions of these investigations, which are developed within the compulsory school stage, focusing specially on interest, ability, self-efficacy, and aspirations. A systematic review of the publications in the literature of the last 10 years (2011-2021) has been carried out in the most relevant databases, following the PRISMA model (Moher et al., 2009). The thematic analysis of the 73 documents included confirms the diversity of approaches to the study of STEM identity, addressed from a disciplinary approach or as a global identity. Results also evince different limitations related to some constructs considered in STEM identity development that cause inequalities among the students. The mutual influence between the different constructs considered not only allows to deepen the characterization of students’ STEM identity, but also suggests several entry points for the development of strategies that can promote a development of a positive STEM identity.","Grimalt-Álvaro, Carme;Couso, Digna",Journal,Revista de Investigacion Educativa,2022-07-01,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona;Universitat Rovira i Virgili,Identification ;  Literature review ;  STEM Education ;  Students
Process View to Innovate the Management of the Social Housing System: A Multiple Case Study,"All countries recognize the right to adequate housing for all human beings. Yet, in many countries, social housing is in a critical state: most buildings need to be restored and better services should be guaranteed. Such actions should be part of a larger plan aimed to overcome the organizational and technological backwardness of the agencies that manage the social housing system. With a not large, but old public asset, the Italian context may represent an interesting case to start investigating difficulties and problems in the management of the social housing system that, as it occurs in most Mediterranean countries, arise when the public housing rental model is adopted. In the paper, a multiple case study on five Italian regional public Agencies responsible for the social housing system is discussed. In particular, the theoretical lens of process theory and ambidextrous business process management are adopted to study the Agencies’ “problematic situation” and identify innovative solutions to address it. The paper contributes to research and practice on process innovation and digital transformation of public administrations: three important lessons are derived and discussed also taking into consideration Industry 5.0, the vision on the future of industry recently proposed by the European Commission. Finally, the adoption of process theory combined with ambidextrous Business Process Management is an underexplored research method in the field of Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management (AEC/FM) research. The results reported in the study reaffirm the potential deriving from its adoption also in such a field.","Mangialardi, Giovanna;Corallo, Angelo;Lazoi, Mariangela;Scozzi, Barbara",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-07-01,Politecnico di Bari;Università del Salento,ambidextrous business process management ;  asset management ;  digital transformation ;  Industry 5.0 ;  process theory ;  social housing
An exploratory analysis of the response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in males and females,"Background: There are known differences in vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity by sex. Females have been shown to report greater reactogenicity and generate higher humoral and cellular immune responses than males following vaccination with several different vaccines. Whether this is also the case for COVID-19 vaccines is currently unknown, as COVID-19 vaccine study data disaggregated by sex are not routinely reported. Therefore, we have assessed the influence of sex on reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Methods: Vaccine efficacy was assessed in 15169 volunteers enrolled into single-blind randomised controlled trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in Brazil and the UK, with the primary endpoint defined as nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants were electronically randomised to receive two standard doses of vaccine or the control product. Logistic regression models were fitted to explore the effect of age and sex on reactogenicity, and linear models fitted to log-transformed values for immunogenicity data. Reactogenicity data were taken from self-reported diaries of 788 trial participants. Pseudovirus neutralisation assay data were available from 748 participants and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG assay data from 1543 participants. Findings: 7619 participants received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 7550 received the control. Vaccine efficacy in participants after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4243 females and 3376 males) was 66.1% (95% CI 55.9-73.9%) in males and 59.9% (95% CI 49.8-67.9%) in females; with no evidence of a difference in efficacy between the sexes (vaccine by sex interaction term P=0.3359). A small, statistically significant difference in anti-spike IgG was observed (adjusted GMR 1.14; 95% CI 1.04-1.26), with higher titres in females than males, but there were no statistically significant differences in other immunological endpoints. Whilst the majority of individuals reported at least one systemic reaction following a first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, females were twice as likely as males to report any systemic reaction after a first dose (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.37-2.77). Measured fever of 38°C or above was reported in 5% of females and 1% of males following first doses. Headache and fatigue were the most commonly reported reactions in both sexes. Interpretation: Our results show that there is no evidence of difference in efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in males and females. Greater reactogenicity in females was not associated with any difference in vaccine efficacy.

Sustainable Recognition Methods of Modeling Design Features of Light and Micro Vehicle-Mounted UAV: Based on Support Vector Regression and Kano Model,"In the era of Industry 4.0, intelligent algorithms provide an effective way to make design methods more sustainable through mining people’s demands continuously, especially in the field of evaluating and predicting the user preferences of phasic or interim design schemes. Vehicle-mounted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are of significance in mobility experience and traffic surveys. However, as a new type of product, UAVs lack general rules in modeling design and the process of development decision making presents some fuzzy characteristics, which make the evo-lution and iteration of modeling design more complex. Based on the theories of Kansei Engineering, this study utilized support vector regression (SVR) to establish a correlation model between design factors and preference degree. Because the perceptual evaluation knowledge is fuzzy and uncertain, the paper applied cross-validation and grid search methods to find the optimal parameters. The parameters of the SVR model were adjusted to meet the need for stable learning and for endurance of the noise from subjective experience data to improve the prediction effect and generalization ability. In addition, by means of the Kano model, the customers’ cognition of demand types was quantified to obtain the prioritization of UAV modeling design elements, as well as to compare with the preference scores to validate the feasibility of this research. It was found that the SVR model proposed in the study could effectively predict user preference (R2 = 0.763, RMSE = 0.057). For the UAVs with a higher preference score, the modeling characteristics were consistent with the attrac-tive, one-dimensional or must-be quality elements in the results of the Kano model, which verified the reliability of the study. The conclusion is expected to provide a sustainable design method for vehicle-mounted UAVs commonly used in citizen travel and outdoor activities.","Yang, Hao;Huo, Yunxiang;Jia, Ruoyu;Sha, Feng;Hu, Naiqi;Yu, Linglan;Wang, Yueran",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-07-01,Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts;North China University of Technology,design elements ;  Kano model ;  prediction model ;  preference degree ;  sustainable innovation ;  SVR ;  UAV
Biting Innovations of Mosquito-Based Biomaterials and Medical Devices,"Mosquitoes are commonly viewed as pests and deadly predators by humans. Despite this perception, investigations of their survival-based behaviors, select anatomical features, and biological composition have led to the creation of several beneficial technologies for medical applications. In this review, we briefly explore these mosquito-based innovations by discussing how unique characteristics and behaviors of mosquitoes drive the development of select biomaterials and medical devices. Mosquito-inspired microneedles have been fabricated from a variety of materials, including biocompatible metals and polymers, to mimic of the mouthparts that some mosquitoes use to bite a host with minimal injury during blood collection. The salivary components that these mosquitoes use to reduce the clotting of blood extracted during the biting process provide a rich source of anticoagulants that could potentially be integrated into blood-contacting biomaterials or administered in therapeutics to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Mosquito movement, vision, and olfaction are other behaviors that also have the potential for inspiring the development of medically relevant technologies. For instance, viscoelastic proteins that facilitate mosquito movement are being investigated for use in tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Even the non-wetting nanostructure of a mosquito eye has inspired the creation of a robust superhydrophobic surface coating that shows promise for biomaterial and drug delivery applications. Additionally, biosensors incorporating mosquito olfactory receptors have been built to detect disease-specific volatile organic compounds. Advanced technologies derived from mosquitoes, and insects in general, form a research area that is ripe for exploration and can uncover potential in further dissecting mosquito features for the continued development of novel medical innovations.","Dixon, Angela R.;Vondra, Isabelle",Journal,Materials,2022-07-01,Department of Biomedical Engineering;Northern Illinois University,bioinspiration ;  biomimetic microneedles and microprobes ;  insect eye ;  insect proboscis ;  insect saliva ;  insect-based olfactory sensor ;  insect-derived anticoagulants ;  insect-derived polymers ;  nanostructured superhydrophobic coating
Prediction of Potential Geothermal Disaster Areas along the Yunnan–Tibet Railway Project,"As China’s railways continue to expand into the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, the number of deep-buried long tunnels is increasing. Tunnel-damaging geothermal disasters have become a common problem in underground engineering. Predicting the potential geothermal disaster areas along the Yunnan–Tibet railway project is conducive to its planning and construction and the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—specifically, the industry, innovation and infrastructure goal (SDG 9). In this paper, the Yunnan–Tibet railway project was the study area. Landsat-8 images and other spatial data were used to investigate causes and distributions of geothermal disasters. A collinearity diagnosis of environmental variables was carried out. Twelve environmental variables, such as land surface temperature, were selected to predict potential geothermal disaster areas using four niche models (MaxEnt, Bioclim, Domain and GARP). The prediction results were divided into four levels and had different characteristics. Among them, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and kappa values of the MaxEnt model were the highest, at 0.84 and 0.63, respectively. Its prediction accuracy was the highest and the algorithm results are more suitable for the prediction of geothermal disasters. The prediction results show that the geothermal disaster potential is greatest in the Markam-Deqen, Zuogong-Zayu and Baxoi-Zayu regions. Through jack-knife analysis, it was found that the land surface temperature, active faults, water system distribution and Moho depth are the key environmental predictors of potential geothermal disaster areas. The research results provide a reference for the design and construction of the Yunnan–Tibet railway project and associated sustainable development.","Chen, Zhe;Chang, Ruichun;Guo, Huadong;Pei, Xiangjun;Zhao, Wenbo;Yu, Zhengbo;Zou, Lu",Journal,Remote Sensing,2022-07-01,Aerospace Information Research Institute;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chengdu University of Technology;International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals,geothermal disaster ;  Landsat-8 ;  niche model ;  sustainable development ;  Yunnan–Tibet railway
Carbon Capture and Storage: History and the Road Ahead,"The large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is becoming increasingly urgent in the global path toward net zero emissions; however, global CCS deployment is significantly lagging behind its expected contribution to greenhouse gas emission reduction. Reviewing and learning from the examples and history of successful CCS practices in advanced countries will help other countries, including China, to promote and deploy CCS projects using scientific methods. This paper shows that the establishment of major science and technology CCS infrastructures in advanced countries has become the main source of CCS technological innovation, cost reduction, risk reduction, commercial promotion, and talent training in the development and demonstration of key CCS technologies. Sound development of CCS requires a transition from pilot-scale science and technology infrastructures to large-scale commercial infrastructures, in addition to incentive policies; otherwise, it will be difficult to overcome the technical barriers between small-scale demonstrations and the implementation of million-tonne-scale CCS and ten-million-tonne-scale CCS hubs. Geological CO2 storage is the ultimate goal of CCS projects and the driving force of CO2 capture. Further improving the accuracy of technologies for the measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) of CO2 storage capacity, emission reduction, and safety remains a problem for geological storage. CO2 storage in saline aquifers can better couple multiple carbon emission sources and is currently a priority direction for development. Reducing the energy consumption of low-concentration CO2 capture and the depletion of chemical absorbents and improving the operational efficiency and stability of post-combustion CO2 capture systems have become the key constraints to large-scale CCS deployment. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is also important in order for countries to maximize fossil fuel extraction instead of importing oil from less environmentally friendly oil-producing countries.","Ma, Jinfeng;Li, Lin;Wang, Haofan;Du, Yi;Ma, Junjie;Zhang, Xiaoli;Wang, Zhenliang",Journal,Engineering,2022-07-01,Northwest University;Shaanxi Key Laboratory for Carbon Neutral Technology;National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technology,CCS research facility ;  Energy consumption ;  Monitoring ;  Net GHG emission reduction
"100 Years of Chromosome Research in Rye, Secale L.","Although microscopy and genetics were still in their infancy, there are cytological results produced a hundred years ago that are still relevant today. Since the 1920s, rye has been a subject of chromosome research. It started by plotting its mitotic and meiotic chromosomes to de-termine genome size. After controversial evidence, it became clear that the base number is n = 7. However, structural differences exist between species within the genus Secale. Some rye populations even carry accessory chromosomes evolutionary derived from the A genome. The development of tetraploid strains significantly promoted chromosome analysis. Various techniques have tried to stabilize the disturbed chromosome pairing of the induced tetraploids. Although slight improvements could be achieved, they did not lead to a breakthrough. However, the various an-euploid derivatives of the polyploids found major advances in the genetic analysis of rye. Tri-somics, telo-trisomics, and reciprocal translocation have served as important tools for gene map-ping. Since the 1970s, various chromosome banding techniques have stimulated scientific pro-gress. The seven haploid chromosomes could be diagnosed unequivocally, not only in S. cereale but also in related species. These findings led to a clear homoeologous assignment to the genomes of related grass species such as wheat, barley, rice, etc. Current applications of in situ fluorescence staining methods, such as GISH and FISH, allow even more precise results, depending on the specificity of the DNA samples. Advanced preparation techniques are supplemented by the variety of innovations in the field of molecular genome analysis. They replace complex cytological ex-aminations. In this way, introgressions can be safely detected by DNA markers and be much more detailed. In addition, CRISPR/CAS-mediated chromosome engineering will become an important method of the future.","Schlegel, Rolf",Journal,Plants,2022-07-01,Julius Kühn-Institut - Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants,chromosome ;  CRISPR/Cas ;  GISH ;  karyotype ;  meiosis ;  rye ;  Secale ;  tetraploidy ;  translocation ;  trisomics
"Empathy, persuasiveness and knowledge promote innovative engineering and entrepreneurial skills","An increasing number of experts considers that durable skills are needed to prepare the professionals that will tackle the challenges of the 21st century. However, a clear overview of which skills are the most relevant for specific learning outcomes has not been reached. In this work, we present a simplified conceptual framework for the training of engineers to be more innovative and entrepreneurial. We introduce three core components or ingredients: knowledge, persuasiveness and empathy. These ingredients can be used to initiate a necessary shift in how students are educated in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. A Challenge Based Learning context is proposed for developing persuasiveness and empathy as durable skills. We also present a six-step procedure as a guideline to turn the knowledge, persuasiveness, and empathy framework into actionable items. This framework enriches the toolbox of durable skills that needs to be taught during the educational process, and in the professional practice of (chemical) engineers. We propose to explicitly teach the importance of durable people-oriented skills in combination with technical courses, ideally spreading the focus over the whole curricula.","Fernandez Rivas, David;Husein, Sebastian",Journal,Education for Chemical Engineers,2022-07-01,Universiteit Twente,Education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  International transfer of knowledge ;  Research ;  Spin-off
"Science for whom? Examining the data quality, themes, and trends in 30 years of public funding for global climate change and energy research","Public spending for research and development is undoubtedly one of the most powerful tools for government policy in the areas of climate change and energy systems and technology innovation. However, existing datasets are currently fragmented, incomplete, and partial in their coverage. This study presents results from a more comprehensive, granular, and descriptive attempt to compile a dataset of global funding patterns on energy and climate research. To do so, it identified 114,201 potential projects funded by 154 research councils across 17 countries and the European Commission from 1990 to 2020 (with projected funding up until 2026). A smaller sample of 1000 illustrative projects were examined in greater detail. It finds that there are difficulties with accessible and available public data, including an inaccuracy of data on published websites or inadequate tracking and updating of project details. Research on energy and climate change is supported by a surprisingly broad base of inquiry, including research from the social sciences and economics but also the arts and humanities, engineering and technology, life sciences and medicine, and natural and physical sciences. Climate change adaptation research is the most funded general area, followed by climate mitigation via energy systems, transportation and mobility, geo/climate engineering, and industrial decarbonization. Funding has been allocated unevenly in favor of some specific technologies, e.g. resilience and adaption, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Publicly funded research benefits a very particular set of disciplines, e.g. communication studies, economics, computer science, and chemical engineering. Moreover, the funded projects reveal a striking diversity of methods, including literature reviews, surveys and original data collection, the development of intellectual property, case studies, qualitative research and energy modeling.","Sovacool, Benjamin K.;Daniels, Chux;AbdulRafiu, Abbas",Journal,Energy Research and Social Science,2022-07-01,University of Sussex Business School,Carbon dioxide removal ;  Climate policy ;  Energy policy ;  Funding patterns ;  Industrial decarbonization ;  Negative emissions ;  Public research and development (R&D) dynamics ;  Science policy
"Circular economy business models and technology management strategies in the wind industry: Sustainability potential, industrial challenges and opportunities","Circular business models, aimed at narrowing, slowing, and closing resource loops, can potentially generate significant economic and social benefits, promote resource security and improve environmental performance. However, within the wind power industry, sustainability research, including life cycle assessments, has been focused mostly on technology innovation at the material (e.g. permanent magnets), components (e.g. blades) or product level (e.g. new assets). Research analysing the implementation of circular business models in the wind industry is scarce. Such information could, however, support more robust decision-making in the development of system-level innovations for the deployment of more resource-efficient and sustainable wind energy infrastructure. Building upon practical methods for the identification, categorisation and characterisation of business models, 14 circular business models with application to the wind industry were comprehensively evaluated through the revision of 125 documents, including 56 journal papers, 46 industrial business cases and 23 wind technology management reports. Each circular business model is examined according to i) business offering and drivers, ii) value creation, delivery and capture mechanisms, iii) sustainability benefits and trade-offs, and iv) industrial challenges and opportunities. Accordingly, comprehensive guidelines to drive political (legislation design and implementation), industrial (technology and business innovation) and academic (further research) actions, are provided. Though the results are focussed on the wind industry, the general findings and recommendations are relevant across the renewable and low-carbon energy sector.","Mendoza, Joan Manuel F.;Gallego-Schmid, Alejandro;Velenturf, Anne P.M.;Jensen, Paul D.;Ibarra, Dorleta",Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2022-07-01,"Tyndall Centre;Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science;Mondragon Unibertsitatea;University of Leeds",Circular business model innovation ;  Circular economy ;  Life cycle thinking ;  Low-carbon infrastructure ;  Sustainability ;  Wind farms
"Renewable energy technology innovation, industrial structure upgrading and green development from the perspective of China's provinces","Based on panel data from 30 provinces and cities in China from 2013 to 2019, this paper analyses the impacts of renewable energy technology innovation and industrial structure upgrading on green development using a spatial Durbin model (SDM). The results show that renewable energy technology innovation has a significant positive impact on green development, the rationalization of the industrial structure has a significant positive impact on the green development of the region, and the advancement of the industrial structure has a significant negative impact on the green development of the region. This article further examines the interactions between renewable energy technology innovation and industrial structure upgrading and finds that the combined effect of renewable energy technology innovation and the rationalization of the industrial structure inhibited their respective positive impacts on green development, resulting in a 1 + 1<2 effect. That is, there is a mutually exclusive effect between the two variables. The joint effect of renewable energy technological innovation and the advancement of the industrial structure can promote the positive impact of renewable energy technological innovation on green development while restraining the negative effect of the advancement of the industrial structure. There is a complementary effect between the two variables.","Su, Yi;Fan, Qi ming",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-07-01,Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management;Harbin Engineering University,Advancement of industrial structure ;  Green development ;  Rationalization of industrial structure ;  Renewable energy technology innovation ;  Spatial Durbin model
5G roll-out failures addressed by innovation policies in the EU,"The 5G ecosystem in the EU is highly complex and multi-faceted with a range of competing interests and stakeholders and hence, makes the assessment of policy measures quite difficult. This paper attempts to clarify and make more accessible as well as tangible, which innovation ‘failures’ are applicable to the case of the roll-out of 5G in the EU and what innovation policy measures have been implemented to tackle them in the EU. Hence, we present an overview of the policy issues related to 5G roll-out found in the literature. This provides context to our research questions. Then, we outline the ‘failures’ that are relevant to the case of 5G roll-out. Adapting the innovation policy instruments taxonomy provided by Edler and Fagerberg (2017), subsequently, we give an overview of the in the EU implemented innovation policy measures and then ultimately outline how they relate to the failures. ‘Market failures’ were the least addressed by innovation policies of the EU, where the most important failures were the ‘System failures’ and the ‘Transformational Systems failures’. This paper hence attempts to provide a strong foundation in the analysis of 5G policies in the EU as well as providing insights as to which areas might require further policy action.","Blind, Knut;Niebel, Crispin",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-07-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI;Technische Universität Berlin,5G ;  Innovation policies ;  Market failure ;  System failure ;  Transformational system failure
"The dynamics of global public research funding on climate change, energy, transport, and industrial decarbonisation","This paper explores the funding trends, topical themes, and notable gaps in global public research funding across the areas of energy, climate change, transport, and industrial decarbonisation from 1990 to 2020. The paper organizes its analysis along the themes of financial and spatial patterns of funding, patterns of disciplinary funding, and the temporality (and shifting research priorities) within funding patterns. It finds that funding for energy and climate research remains concentrated within the European Commission, United Kingdom and United States. Climate change adaptation research is the most funded general area, and the specific topics of energy efficiency, climate resilience, and climate information systems, managing climate risks, energy storage, carbon dioxide removal and solar energy are the most funded technologies. There is significant diversity in the disciplines funded, with the social sciences supported almost as much as the engineering and physical sciences and meaningful amounts of funding disbursed to the arts and humanities and the life sciences. A large majority of projects identify themselves as transdisciplinary. The paper, lastly, discusses research gaps and future research questions.","AbdulRafiu, Abbas;Sovacool, Benjamin K.;Daniels, Chux",Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2022-07-01,University of Sussex Business School,Carbon emission ;  Climate change adaptation ;  Energy transitions ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Public research funding ;  Technology innovation
A seven-question based critical thinking framework for cultivating innovation talents in engineering research and its implementation perspectives,"The ability of research innovation is particularly important in the era of rapidly changing environment, challenges, and demands, where new knowledge, technologies, and unseen problems are emerging at an unprecedented speed. Engineering college students, especially postgraduate research students are well-trained with domain knowledge and technical skills to solve commonly known problems. However, the lack of a systematic critical thinking framework on research innovation prevents them from generating creative ideas, dealing with changes and new problems, and making step forward and groundbreaking innovations during their research program. This paper presents a seven-question based critical thinking framework, named “IDEA” catechism, which was proposed and implemented as a research training methodology in a research group at a Chinese higher education institution. Through the questions and answers (Q&A) process in the framework, engineering students can be better trained to deeply understand and critically scrutinize their research ideas and methods, and are eventually able to independently develop their own innovative ideas, especially leading them to do original study. The research group has been practicing this framework for several years and succeeded in developing a large number of distinctive innovation with national and international recognition, which were also collected as research cases.","Li, Yingguang;Liu, Changqing;Xu, Ke;Hao, Xiaozhong;Sui, Shaochun",Journal,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture",2022-07-01,Chengdu Aircraft Industrial (Group) Co.

Research on visual optimization design of machine-machine interface for mechanical industrial equipment based on nonlinear partial equations,"With the continuous development and progress of machinery and industry equipment, human-machine interface has become an important operation in industry equipment and has been widely used in aviation, monitoring, traffic, special engineering vehicles, and a series of complex fields. Through the human-machine interface information system, information and data are provided for operators s. As the human-machine interface information data of the mechanical equipment system are numerous, complex, and changeable, operators often make operation mistakes, misread and misjudge, and do not give timely feedback, resulting in task failure or, in serious cases, major mechanical faults and accidents. Therefore, the human-machine interface data information is screened, and the information useful for the operator is directly obtained according to the target set by the operator, so as to effectively solve the complex and changeable data information in the information system. Human-machine interface uses electronic communication technology, computer network technology, and database technology to expand and update machinery and industrial equipment. Among them, nonlinear partial differential equations comprise an important branch of equation in mathematics. In this paper, according to the nonlinear partial differential equations, we research and analyze the information system of the human-machine interface design field and solve the system of the cognitive load, which is too large, such as cognitive mismatch problem in the working mode of operating personnel, by satisfying the needs of different users. The human-machine interface of mechanical industrial equipment uses visual optimization design and innovation.","Yan, Yan;Zeng, Bin;Alqurashi, Fahad Abdullah;Shorman, Samer M.",Journal,Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences,2022-07-01,Applied Science University;King Abdulaziz University;Changsha College,human-machine interface ;  mechanical industrial equipment ;  nonlinear partial equation ;  visual optimization design
"Research universities, incubators of (urban) innovation","The intellectual might and the creative and innovative spirit of the faculty and students at our research universities play a key role in providing the basis for many inventions and innovations that address pressing problems of today’s society. Many universities have built the vibrant culture and the nurturing environment that supports academic innovation and entrepreneurship and they have developed mechanisms that encourage and incentivize the translation of research breakthroughs into new products and processes. Urban environments, particularly big cities, face unprecedented challenges to address the needs of its citizens as more and more people move from rural parts of the world to cities in search of a better life and more economic opportunities. Securing reliable transportation of people and goods, adequate electrical power and water to satisfy the needs of the growing urban population, addressing the ever increasing waste disposal needs, maintaining the health and wellness of the general population, but especially of older adults and people with disabilities require a new paradigm for urban science, engineering, and innovation. Many universities have responded to this challenge and have developed research pillars around the challenges and opportunities that complex urban systems pose.","Becker, K.",Journal,European Physical Journal: Special Topics,2022-07-01,NYU Tandon School of Engineering,
"Comparison of first-year student conceptions of their future roles as engineers between Belgium, Ireland, and The Netherlands","Recent research by KU Leuven showed that 33% of the engineering graduates in Flanders changed jobs in the first year, with 60% of those citing job content as a reason. Also, industry often reports that recent graduate hires lack the right skills for the job. It appears that students seem to enter the labour market less prepared both in perception and skill level. This study investigates the perceptions of first-year students on their future role and the competencies they need by developing an engineering role model on the business model of Tracey and Wiersema. The premise of the PREFER-model is that most vacancies for junior engineers fall into one of three roles: Product Leadership (i.e., focus on radical innovation), Operational Excellence (i.e., focus on process optimization), and Customer Intimacy (i.e., focus on client-tailored solutions). A survey was administered to first-year students from the three largest engineering degrees in Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands. A total of 197 students in Belgium (KU Leuven – Engineering Technology), 89 students in Ireland (TU Dublin – Engineering), and 372 students in the Netherlands (TU Delft – Aerospace Engineering) participated. In this survey, students were also asked to express their preference for three fictional job vacancies reflecting the three different roles. The results showed that first-year students do not have a clear view of the future and have an idealized perception of the engineering profession centred around the Product Leadership role. Students were also found to overestimate their level of preparedness when it comes to their mastery of competencies. It is suggested that having a discerning professional roles model as well as instruments that allow students to assess their role alignment and associated role competencies will help mitigate these issues.","Saunders-Smits, Gillian;Craps, Sofie;Carthy, Darren;Langie, Greet",Journal,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education,2022-07-01,"Faculteit Luchtvaart- en Ruimtevaarttechniek, TU Delft;KU Leuven;Technological University Dublin",employability ;  first-year students ;  Professional skills ;  student perception ;  survey
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PREREQUISITES OF STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT OF UNIVERSITIES IN THE CONDITIONS OF WAR AND POST-WAR PERIOD,"The purpose of the article is to study current social and economic prerequisites of the strategic development of higher educational institutions (universities) in the conditions of war and post-war period. The theoretical significance of the article is that, based on the authors’ analysis, the social and economic prerequisites for the strategic development of universities in the conditions of war and post-war period are characterized; a comprehensive analysis of political, economic, social and demographic and technological factors that cause opportunities/threats to the strategic development of universities is presented. The practical significances of the article are that the main challenges that will hinder the strategic development of universities in the conditions of war and post-war period were highlighted; strategic tasks for universities based on current peculiarities of social and economic environment are proposed. It is substantiated that in the process of strategic development of universities it is advisable to conduct an in-depth comprehensive analysis of political, economic, social and demographic and technological factors that directly affect or will likely affect their (universities) strategic goals and objectives. The method of PEST analysis was used to comprehensively characterize the set of the most significant factors of influence. It is determined that the significant political factors are large-scale military aggression of the Russian Federation, domestic political center-oriented processes and prevailing of populist paradigms, national policy on economic development/global leadership/competitiveness. Among the economic factors are significant losses of social and economic potential of the country's regions, significant destruction of infrastructure, loss of human potential due to external migration, rising unemployment, loss of export positions, relocation of business from the occupied territories. Among the social and demographic factors, it was substantiated significant migration flows, declining of pace of population reproduction, accelerating the aging process, increasing the share of single-parent families, the unity of Ukrainian society in the direction of countering the enemy, a high level of patriotism, the formation of a democratic political nation and civil society, responsibility, ability to radically change the further history of Ukraine. The key challenges that create opportunities/threats for the strategic development of universities are identified: the need to restore the material and technical base, human resources and research infrastructure of universities, bringing training programs in line with regional labor markets, introduction of retraining/adult training programs, optimization and reengineering of business processes, providing flexibility in responding to changing conditions, introducing the concept of result-based university management, increasing the level oftechnologization and digitalization of business processes, strengthening the research component in activities along with deepening the level of international partnership. Strategic vectors of development of universities during post-war period are proposed: the need to intensify cooperation with partners, focus on research aimed at overcoming the greatest societal challenges, involving a wide range of stakeholders in the process of co-production and innovation, building ""smart specialization"" of each university, implementation of certain principles (positioning of university, synergy, integration, technological development, involvement, optimality) in the process of strategizing, incorporation of ICT in order to improve internal business processes of universities, widespread implementation of the so-called partnership model of university management, implementation of communicative and information function in cooperation with refugees, accelerating training of engineering and technological specialties.","Borodiyenko, Oleksandra;Malykhina, Yana;Protopopova, Y.;Kim, K.;Malykhina, Valentina",Journal,Financial and Credit Activity: Problems of Theory and Practice,2022-06-30,"Municipal Establishment ""Kharkiv Humanitarian-Pedagogical Academy"" of the Kharkiv Regional Council;Institute of Higher Education of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine;Ukrainian State University of Railway Transport",institutions of higher education ;  post-war period ;  social and economic prerequisites ;  strategic development ;  strategic management ;  war
A Systematic Mapping of E-Learning Research: An Interdisciplinary and Multi-paradigmatic Perspective from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"E-learning research is a dynamic and ever-expanding interdisciplinary field. Research in this area is often conducted at the intersection of social science, cognitive science, learning sciences, as well as engineering and computer science. Common concerns in the field include ambiguity and confusion toward how best to approach methodological design as well as tensions around whether the field is coherent or fragmented. E-learning research has been characterized as a multi-paradigmatic knowledge field with distinct theoretical foundations and a horizontal knowledge structure composed of “specialist” languages. There has been a remarkable increase in systematic literature reviews in the field, representing a burgeoning research industry. Although there is a clear division between technical and social scientific approaches, there is a scarcity of literature which attempts to synthesize the evidence on how e-learning research is conducted across disciplines and within distinctive research communities from a multi-paradigmatic perspective. The objective of the current study is to systematically map research done in the field of e-learning in higher education at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) within the frame of an institutional analysis. The aim is to identify key features and distinctive approaches to research across disciplines in this area from a multi-paradigmatic perspective. A systematic mapping review has been conducted, synthesizing research published between 2015-2020 by authors affiliated with the UOC. The study identified 291 articles, the majority of which use quantitative approaches following both design-based research methods as well as design and development research aims across three distinct research areas (a) educational research, (b) discipline-based education research and (c) learning engineering research. Fragmentation was identified across distinct research areas and communities of practice, particularly between research aims and the methods used to achieve these aims. By empirically examining the claims about methodological capacity and coherence in e-learning research, recommendations are offered for reorienting the field by: (a) increasing interdisciplinary collaboration through integrated research agendas; (b) supporting the expanding profession of the ‘learning engineer’; and (c) promoting methodological capacity, clarity and innovation.","Peters, Mitchell;Perez-Navarro, A.;Fabregues, Sergi",Journal,Electronic Journal of e-Learning,2022-06-30,Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,e-learning ;  educational technology ;  interdisciplinary ;  research methods ;  systematic review
Progress and prospects of manufacturing technology for oil country tubular goods in China,"The main progress of localization technology of Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) in China is summarized, and the development direction of OCTG is put forward. In view of the bottlenecks and technical problems in China, such as a large amount of imported OCTG, low quality and performance of products, imperfect quality infrastructure of OCTG(including thread measurement, standardization, certification, inspection and testing), and difficulty in meeting the needs of oil & gas exploration and development, a new discipline of ""Petroleum Tubular Goods Engineering"" was established after more than 30 years of joint research. The theoretical and technical system of OCTG localization has been established. A complete set of technologies, such as smelting ultra-pure steel, high precision and high-efficiency hot rolling mills, high uniformity heat treatment, new design of special steels, composition/microstructure/properties and performance/process comprehensive control, premium connection design and processing, has been developed, breaking the foreign monopoly, and developing more than 60 kinds of new high-end OCTG products in 10 categories, with annual output reaching 5 million tons, OCTG has been basically localized and industrialized and exported in large quantities; The quality infrastructure of OCTG such as thread measurement, standardization, certification and approval, inspection and testing has been developed, which supports the effective localization and large-scale industrial application of OCTG. Great strides have been made in China's OCTG manufacturing and supporting technologies, resulting in significant economic and social benefits. Facing the new situation and challenges of China's oil and gas industry development, especially complex mechanical and chemical conditions such as ultra-deep, unconventional, offshore oil and gas development, underground coal gasification, in-situ shale oil conversion and natural gas hydrate exploitation, as well as ensuring the long-term safety and reliability of oil and gas wells and the demand of economic production, continuous innovation should be pursued to realize the self-reliance of key core technologies of OCTG in China. This will support and guarantee healthy development and lead technological progress in the oil and gas industry and related industries.","Feng, Yaorong;Li, Helin;Han, Lihong;Zhang, Zhonghua;Zhang, Chuanyou;Cheng, Haitao;Bai, Zhenquan;Tian, Yan;Shi, Xiaoxia;Xie, Junfeng;Le, Hong;Zheng, Mingke",Journal,Petroleum Science Bulletin,2022-06-29,"Baoshan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.;Tubular Goods Research Center of CNPC;Tarim Oilfield Company;Tianjing Pipe Corporation;Ltd.;Ltd.;Ltd.;PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company;PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company",casing ;  certification and accreditation ;  development direction ;  drill stem components ;  inspection and testing ;  manufacturing technology ;  oil industry tubular goods ;  petroleum tubular goods engineering ;  quality infrastructure ;  standardization ;  thread measurement ;  tubing

Life-based learning innovation through Android E-module to support long distance learning in 21<sup>st</sup>century,"The Covid-19 pandemic changed the technology transfer aspect to prepare in the educational field, particularly knowledge, skill, and technology-based management. The current problem is that educators tend to apply the conventional learning method on engineering drawing; thus, when Covid-19 requires long-distance learning, students cannot understand since they were used with face-to-face and practice learning. Another problem is a lack of interest and spirit during long- distance learning. The solution is to use a life-based approach to improve the android-based engineering drawing module to support long-distance learning in the 21st century and increase students' spirits during education. Generally, engineering drawing subject characteristic follows the application of life-based learning approach; and this research aimed to reach its purposes and improve the learning process quality and innovation.","Tjiptady, B.

Level of awareness of formwork design in the Ghanaian construction industry; enabling future technology application,"Purpose: In the Ghanaian construction industry (GCI), the option for stakeholders to adopt formwork design as a building construction requirement is uncommon place. This is due to the low level of awareness and practice of formwork design. As a result of this, there have been formwork accidents, cost and time overruns in construction. This paper aims to solicit the view of stakeholders on the awareness of formwork design practices in the GCI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted the interpretivism research philosophy and inductive reasoning. Through a semi-structured interview guide, data was collected. The data (interview) recorded was transcribed using the Amberscript web application. This study used thematic analysis in analyzing the data collected using Nvivo 10 software. Findings: The data collected from the 22 professionals indicated that the respondents were unaware of the concept of formwork design and its practice, neither could they speak to the existence of any specific regulation nor code of practice. However, the respondents established that there was a need to design formwork and stated some benefits of it. Originality/value: From the literature, little research has been done on formwork design and its context in the GCI is yet to be explored. This research attempts to fill this gap. The findings indicate that to practice formwork design, there must be education and training of human resources for formwork design, there must be a code of practice to guide the design process and legal backing through policies and regulations to mandate the design.","Boakye Danquah, Clement;Acheampong, Alex;Adjei-Kumi, Theophilus",Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2022-06-29,Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology,Architecture ;  Construction innovation ;  Design innovation ;  Engineering ;  Formwork ;  Ghanaian construction industry
Impact of cooperation flexibility on innovation flexibility in SMEs,"Research background:Flexibility has become a possible means for manufacturing companies to better compete in competitive markets. Furthermore, innovations are perceived as an important factor in company strategy, which can differentiate the company from the competition. Purpose of the article: This present study investigates the problems of cooperation flexibility and innovation flexibility in manufacturing companies among electrical engineering companies in the Czech Republic. The aim of this paper is to identify the impact of cooperation flexibility on innovation flexibility in small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Methods: A questionnaire addressed to SMEs in the form of the Likert scale was prepared to gather information about cooperation flexibility and innovation flexibility. All parts of the questionnaire were tested using Cronbach Alpha. Spearman correlation and regression analysis were used for analysis. Findings & value added: The results of the research show that external cooperation flexibility and internal cooperation flexibility is related to innovation flexibility in SMEs. Results of the research show that there is a positive relationship 1) between external cooperation flexibility and innovation flexibility and 2) between innovation flexibility and business performance at SMEs. The findings of the research contribute to an understanding of the relationship between cooperation flexibility, innovation flexibility and also innovation performance. The novelty value of this paper lies in its perception of flexibility as having two parts, namely external (with suppliers and customers) and internal cooperation flexibility. In addition, innovation flexibility was investigated in two fields, product, and accompanying services to products. The view mentioned provides a complex view of flexibility.","Tomášková, Eva;Kaňovská, Lucie",Journal,Equilibrium.

Research and engineering application of continuous-drive friction welding,"The friction welding (FW) technology is a kind of solid-phase hot pressing welding method applied to the connection of similar or dissimilar materials. During the FW process, welding heat is generated by the pressure and high-speed relative motion between the joint interfaces of the workpieces. After the joint interfaces and their neighborhood arrive at the thermoplastic state, the workpieces are pressed into a whole by upsetting. FW has a wide range of weldability (e.g., carbon steel, alloy steel, non-ferrous metals, other materials of the same kind, dissimilar metal materials, and metal and non-metal materials with completely different properties) and can obtain welded joints with excellent properties (closed to base metal) and fewer defects (e.g., cracks, pores, and segregation); thus, it has high reliability to welded joints. As its advantages, FW exhibits low energy consumption (i.e., 10%-20% of fusion welding), high efficiency (i.e., only a few seconds to realize an effective joining of the workpieces), and environmental friendliness (i.e., no welding rod, wire, flux, or protective gas and no arc, spatter, smoke, or slag as in fusion welding) and can easily realize automation and large-scale production. FW is widely used in high-tech manufacturing in various industries, including in the automobile, aviation, aerospace, nuclear energy, oil drilling, marine development, and electric power industries. On the basis of the classification and the brief description of FW, the present situation of the research, development, and application of the continuous-drive FW (CDFW) technology was comprehensively sorted out and analyzed in-depth in this paper. This study involved the CDFW process characteristics and main process parameters, process exploration, influence of the process parameters on welded joint properties, numerical analysis, simulations, process parameter optimization, CDFW process innovation for dissimilar metals and non-metallic materials, practical engineering applications, and welding equipment, among others. The aspects of the potential applications of the FW technology, core scientific issues, research and development of the novel FW equipment, numerical analysis and simulation, and combination with emerging technologies associated with the CDFW technology were also reviewed and discussed.","Zhang, Han;Zhu, Zhi Ming",Journal,Gongcheng Kexue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Engineering,2022-06-25,Tsinghua University;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China;The 32555th Unit of the People's Liberation Army of China,Application of friction welding ;  Continuous-drive friction welding ;  Finite element analysis ;  Friction welding equipment ;  Welding process parameters

Problems of financing research and construction works on Ukrainian enterprises,"The article is devoted to the problem of researching the prospects of financing research and development work at Ukrainian agricultural machine-building enterprises, which will accelerate scientific and technological progress in knowledge-intensive and promising areas of state development. It is proved that for the state funding of R&D at all stages becomes an unbearable burden for the state budget, resulting in irregular funding and the decline of research in the field of agricultural engineering. The essence of financing of innovations at the enterprise is characterized, that it is expedient to define as a complex of measures for maintenance of innovations and innovative activity by financial resources through methods and forms, ways of financing. The model of enterprise development management is built taking into account the vector of development, features of applied methods and management techniques, which will effectively predict the consequences of business process automation, reengineering of organizational management structure, information systems development, commercialization of intellectual capital. The need to solve the problems of R&D financing in the field of agricultural engineering, rational use of financial resources during the implementation of innovative development priorities of this subsector of mechanical engineering is proposed to be created at its level by creating a financing system. It is substantiated that the proposed innovation cluster as a new scientific and technological formation will contribute to the technological re-equipment of industrial enterprises, development of innovative infrastructure of the region, development of industrial production, agricultural sector, improvement of socio-economic situation in the region.","Palchevich, Galina T.;Sydorenko, Oksana V.;Panasiuk, Valentyna M.;Horlachuk, Mykola A.;Ivanova, Anna M.;Yazlyuk, Borys O.",Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2022-06-23,Central Ukrainian National Technical University;West Ukrainian National University;National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy,budget financing ;  financial support ;  information technology revolution ;  innovation activity ;  investment and innovation activity ;  non-state funds ;  research and development
Cognitive Strategy Prompts Creativity Triggers for Human Centered AI Opportunity Detection,"Creative problem solving and innovation powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires detection of user needs that can be reframed into data science problems. We propose a framework of 10 creativity triggers for creative human centered AI opportunity detection, based on research and categorization of information retrieval tasks and cognitive task analysis. The method aims to facilitate a dialog between data scientists and underrepresented groups such as non-technical domain experts. Impact on problem discovery and idea generation was evaluated in co-creation workshops. Results show that the method significantly increases ideas' scores on the appropriateness to a specific problem and their AI relevancy. Participants experienced the prompts as a helpful mental framework about AI methods and felt encouraged to decompose user stories into more detailed cognitive tasks that help data scientists relate ideas to high level data science methods.","Schleith, Johannes;Norkute, Milda;Mikhail, Mary;Tsar, Daniella",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-06-20,Thomson Reuters,AI opportunity detection ;  cognitive task analysis ;  design thinking
Building information modelling a key for construction industry recovery post-Covid-19,"Several countries have introduced and several kinds of research have discussed the performance of building information modelling (BIM) as an information technology trend. Despite its potential impact on construction performance, this concept has not attracted the attention of many countries such as Morocco. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) broke out when the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry was suffering from several shortcomings, mainly the poor technology exploitation cited in the literature. Although this has weakened the sector, it is a real opportunity to assimilate and understand the role of technology, particularly BIM. In this context, the main objective is to draw conclusions on the role of BIM during and after Covid-19 through the analysis of the AEC industry in Morocco and the benchmarking of BIM contributions during this health crisis. A qualitative approach was conducted, including the analysis of the pre-Covid-19, Covid-19 and post-epidemic phases and the benchmarking of the contribution of BIM. This study demonstrates the inevitability of adopting critical thinking when it comes to solutions about the evolution of the construction sector and the practical implications for a successful revival of the AEC industry post-Covid-19. It contributes to the body of knowledge on AEC in the face of this universal pandemic. The findings are relevant to all countries where information technology exploitation is absent or weak.","Idrissi Gartoumi, Khalil;Aboussaleh, Mohamed;Zaki, Smail",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Engineering Sustainability,2022-06-18,Université Moulay Ismaïl,"Building Information Modelling (BIM) ;  construction management ;  sustainability ;  UN SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities ;  UN SDG 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure"

Amine dehydrogenases: Current status and potential value for chiral amine synthesis,"Chiral amines are crucial precursors of various pharmaceutical drugs, fine chemicals, and bioactive molecules. Amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs) have attracted increasing attention for chiral-amine synthesis, with great potentials to overcome the shortcomings of conventional chemical methods. However, the narrow substrate scope and expensive cofactors required can be quite challenging for the AmDHs. A number of attempts have been made to improve AmDHs and their reaction systems. The available AmDHs are mainly obtained by the discovery of the natural AmDHs and the engineering of amino acid dehydrogenases. In this review, recent advances in the structures, mechanisms, and mutation studies of AmDHs are discussed in detail, facilitating the engineering of AmDHs more efficiently. Besides, various enzyme-coupled and immobilization strategies have been designed to optimize the AmDH-catalyzed reaction systems, not only achieving the cofactor regeneration but also enhancing the productivity. Future research directions for improving the performance and reaction system of AmDHs are evaluated.","Liu, Jianqiao;Kong, Weixi;Bai, Jing;Li, Yongxing;Dong, Lele;Zhou, Liya;Liu, Yunting;Gao, Jing;Bradshaw Allen, Ruth T.;Turner, Nicholas J.;Jiang, Yanjun",Journal,Chem Catalysis,2022-06-16,Faculty of Science and Engineering;Hebei University of Technology;Hebei University of Science and Technology,AmDHs ;  amine dehydrogenases ;  chiral amine ;  cofactor regeneration ;  mechanism ;  protein engineering ;  SDG9: Industry innovation and infrastructure ;  structure

The high-level autonomous and controllable (aviation) structural analysis CAE software is of great strategic significance to the leading innovation of aviation science and technology, and the integrity and safety of the equipment development system. By deeply combing the development process of domestic and foreign structural analysis CAE software deeply, this paper systematically analyzes the general development law of this software. Moreover, the challenges of this software are also pointed out from four dimensions, i.e. the complexity of the software itself, research and development cycle, the requirements of equipment, and the reliability. Meanwhile, the generalized connotation, overall idea and key technology of autonomous (aviation) structural analysis CAE software development are put forward from such three levels as the general analysis function group, special analysis tool chain and domestic data resource pool.

Heat transfer innovations and their application in thermal desalination processes,"The familiarity of mature thermal technologies for brine concentration and crystallization is likely to sustain their widespread deployment despite their high capital and operational (i.e., energy) costs relative to emerging non-thermal alternatives. This critical review and analysis evaluates the potential for recent innovations in manufacturing devices for improved heat and mass transfer to demonstrably reduce the lifecycle costs of these thermal desalination technologies. We identify three promising innovation applications, including novel heat transfer geometries enabled by additive manufacturing, emerging surface engineering methods to promote dropwise condensation, and new polymer-/polymer-composite-based heat transfer components. Based on the estimated cost and performance impacts of these material and process modifications, we find that polymer-/polymer-composite-based heat transfer devices have the largest potential to reduce the unit cost of water in the near term. Throughout the review, we also highlight remaining research gaps and unmet technoeconomic targets that would benefit from future investigation and collaboration between the heat transfer and desalination communities.","Liu, Tanya;Mauter, Meagan S.",Journal,Joule,2022-06-15,Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering,
Reinventing the Wheel: The Future Ripples Method for Activating Anticipatory Capacities in Innovation Teams,"Global and systemic sustainability challenges increasingly require innovation teams to incorporate holistic, long-term thinking into their ideation. Since a comprehensive foresight process would prove too burdensome, faster methods are needed. The Future Ripples method was devised to meet this need through reflective practice in four consecutive workshops. It builds on the well-known Futures Wheel foresight method, which offers a collaborative process for brainstorming consequences and impacts. Additionally, the new approach encompasses scanning for weak signals and trends while catering to innovation teams. Analysis of the workshop activities and outcomes suggests that the Future Ripples method can nurture the anticipation skills of innovation teams and help them develop diverse, novel, yet plausible futures. The paper also discusses the role of reflection, metaphors, and the balance between critical and creative thinking in developing holistic futures.","Epp, Felix Anand;Moesgen, Tim;Salovaara, Antti;Pouta, Emmi;Gaziulusoy, Idil",Conference Proceeding,DIS 2022 - Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference: Digital Wellbeing,2022-06-13,Aalto University,Anticipatory Capacity ;  Consequences ;  Foresight ;  Future Studies ;  Futures Literacy ;  Futures Thinking ;  Futures Wheel ;  Futures Workshop ;  Speculative Design ;  Technology Innovation
Classification of Software Engineering Contributions to Support Validation Techniques and Research Applications,"Science and thereby software engineering (SE) research enables progress and innovation. SE research has high economic relevance and serves as an enabler for innovations in other research fields as well. Researchers in this field perform many activities and face corresponding challenges. They have to design and conduct research, while deciding on an appropriate method design for a scientific or practical problem. They have to review research while critically assessing research outcomes in a systematic and comparable way. They have to search for research outcomes to find research gaps to build upon. Likewise, by finding related information, they are able to justify relevance of own research work. These searching processes are done via keyword-based searches while struggling with information overload due to immensely growing number of SE papers published every year. Thus, there is the need for conceptual approaches, automated mechanisms, and a rethinking about scholarly communication to support these research activities and challenges in an effective, efficient, and comprehensible way. There are a variety of available classifications for research methods in literature. Additionally, empirical standards for research methods are continuously developed and adapted from other research fields. However, there is no consistency in the covered research methods, nor in the used terminology as well as no systematic approach to structure this body of research knowledge (e.g., template research questions, research methods, validity threats, replication types). Therefore, this doctoral thesis will provide a unified classification scheme to describe the characteristics of SE research. This further enables classification of SE papers and a corresponding queryable knowledge management system and, thus, advance state of practice.","Kaplan, Angelika",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-06-13,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,empirical software engineering research ;  knowledge management system ;  machine learning ;  meta-research in software engineering ;  natural language processing
Nanocomposite DNA hydrogels emerging as programmable and bioinstructive materials systems,"The innovation of DNA hydrogels has led to the development of programmable nanocomposite DNA hydrogels that are now emerging as bioinstructive materials systems for fundamental and applied research at the crossroads of chemistry, materials, and biology. Due to the feasible synthesis of various colloidal materials and DNA-colloid conjugates, nanocomposite DNA hydrogels can be rationally designed and assembled with tunable physiochemical property as well as integrated functionalities, thereby responding to external physical cues, exhibiting catalytic activities, or acting as therapeutic agents. Furthermore, the implementation of such tailorable substrata enables grafting, colonization, and control of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells for cell-substrate engineering. It can be anticipated that the integration of nanocomposite DNA hydrogels with microfluidic systems or DNA surface technology might facilitate the development of modern integrated systems and platforms for widespread applications in materials and life sciences.","Hu, Yong;Fan, Chunhai",Journal,Chem,2022-06-09,Tongji University;Shanghai Jiao Tong University,bioinstructive materials ;  cell-substrate engineering ;  DNA hydrogels ;  nanocomposites ;  SDG3: Good health and well-being ;  self-assembly
TWO DECADES OF CROSS-BORDER INNOVATIVE RESEARCH: RETROSPECTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS,"In the last decade, human development has accelerated into a period of unprecedented rapid change — the tipping point at which artificial intelligence surpasses human intellect is about to be crossed. In this content, the trend of the past two centuries of increasing disciplinary differentiation due to the explosion of knowledge and the limitation of human intelligence is undergoing a fundamental reversal, that is, a shift toward innovation across disciplines that is driven by the discovery of the unknown and the creation of untapped problems. The ‘ zero-to-one’ innovation from the source eventually has a global historical impact and even changes the world. Any such innovation will inevitably encounter a ‘ valley of death’ in its 0-to-1 and the subsequent ""1-to-N"" phases. Each of them could be a long period of more than a decade [1]. Since the year 2000, my research has shifted from doing the best in traditional disciplines (mechanics, mathematics, material sciences) to cross-disciplinary original innovation. After 20 years of unremitting efforts, my team and I have, in a sense, crossed the valley of death from 0 to 1, and stepped into a new stage of development from 1 to N. We are now moving forward in a double helix manner in both ""structural superlubricity technology"" and ""cultivation of top innovative talents"". What played a unique and key role in this process is the two decades of education in my early life and the two-decade of research in mathematics and mechanics in the middle, from 1980 to 2000, as well as the innocent and fearless participation of students, and the deep collaboration with renowned professors and scholars across multiple disciplines. My cross-border research experience not only spans the entire STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), but also extends to more front-end innovative education and more back-end technology product development. I hope that my sharing will be a reference and inspiration for young researchers and students who embrace the dream of innovation from 0 to 1.","Zheng, Quanshui",Journal,Mechanics in Engineering,2022-06-08,Tsinghua University;X-Institute,academic development ;  cross-border research ;  cultivation of top innovative talents ;  innovation ;  structural superlubricity technology

It is not only a requirement for the partial fulfillment of an accredited university programme but also a method of assessing the students' general mastery of concepts, critical thinking, problem-solving, and transferable skills. Annually, final-year undergraduate students offering computing programmes in Uganda build innovative software solutions to real-world problems within and outside their community. Anecdotal evidence indicates that most of those innovations have the potential for commercialization and transformation into technology-based businesses. However, limited progress has been made to commercialize students' projects, and promising solutions are ""buried""within academic reports. To this end, our research aims to explain the challenges and opportunities in the commercialization of students' capstone projects across two (2) undergraduate computing programmes (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Bachelor of Information Technology) offered at Gulu University in Uganda. Using exploratory research design, we reviewed eighty-six (86) capstone projects, curricula, and a facilitated students & stakeholders' workshop report. This paper articulates factors hindering the commercialization of undergraduate software capstone projects and recommends mitigating measures. It also proposes a framework for extending capstone course design from a traditional curriculum structure to an inclusive industry and community-oriented approach capable of turning ideas into business start-ups. The findings from this research are expected to inform higher institutions of learning in Africa in developing novel pedagogical approaches for orchestrating (software) capstone project courses that are inclusive and profitable beyond the academic setting.","Ogenrwot, Daniel;Tabo, Geoffrey Olok;Aber, Kevin;Nakatumba-Nabende, Joyce",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-06-07,Gulu University;Makerere University,Capstone Projects ;  Commercialization ;  Software Engineering ;  Start-ups
"From the laboratory to the consumer: Innovation, supply chain, and adoption with applications to natural resources","We analyze the transition from innovative ideas to final marketed products. This transition occurs through two synergetic supply chains for innovation and products. Basic concepts are developed, tested, upscaled, and introduced to commercial use in the innovation supply chain. Then, the products are produced and delivered to the consumer through the product supply chain. We argue that product markets trace their birth to product innovations. These markets tend to start as noncompetitive, which rewards innovators. Credit access and risk determine the reliance on contracting and product diffusion over space and time. The innovation and product supply chains are encouraged and facilitated by public policies, such as support for research and education, intellectual property rights protection, low barriers to trade, science-based regulation, and well-functioning capital markets. We argue for multidisciplinary research incorporating knowledge from economics, business, and engineering to better understand the evolution of innovative companies and supply chains. This understanding will help the development of policies to address challenges of climate change and food security among others.","Zilberman, David;Reardon, Thomas;Silver, Jed;Lu, Liang;Heiman, Amir",Journal,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2022-06-07,Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics;University of Idaho;Michigan State University;Hebrew University of Jerusalem,adoption ;  innovation ;  marketing ;  policy ;  supply chain
Towards self-healing in water infrastructure systems,"With infrastructure systems growing increasingly complex and interdependent, the consequences of a system failure have the potential to be more devastating, and impact more users, than ever before. Self-healing systems, originally proposed as a solution to complexity in software-based systems, are those that can independently identify failure or degradation in the network and generate solutions to restore functionality, allowing the continued provision of services. The benefits of adopting a self-healing approach to infrastructure network management are obvious and abundant; network quality can be assessed and assured, threats can be swiftly identified and dealt with, resources can be assigned to optimise coverage under fluctuating demand and consumers can have confidence in the stability of the services that they use on a daily basis. This paper outlines the potential for self-healing within water infrastructure systems, a sector that has been slow to embrace system-wide approaches. A systematic review of the topic identifies emerging terminology and methods within the water domain, and the extent to which current research aligns with self-healing methodology is discussed. Finally, the steps that can be implemented to shift the water sector towards a self-healing perspective are explored through a case study of leakage management in water pipeline systems.","McMillan, Lauren;Fcabe, Liz Varga",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Smart Infrastructure and Construction,2022-06-06,University College London,infrastructure ;  innovation ;  maintenance & inspection ;  management ;  UN SDG 9: Industry ;  water supply

Factors influencing farmers' adoption of precision dairy technology,"Modern dairy industry has an urgent need to promote a sustainable development strategy in China. Among them, precision dairy technology can be one of the most important ways to realize the modern dairy industry. Farm management can be transformed from the group to the individual for high efficiency and production level. However, the current adoption of precision dairy technology was still lacking so far. Most research was focused on the influencing factors of technology application and development. Only a few explored the current adoption of precision dairy technology. This study aims to investigate the adoption behavior of precision dairy technology by dairy farmers. The research areas were selected as the dairy-producing bases in North China (Hebei Province, Henan Province, Shandong Province, and Shanxi Province). 345 valid samples were firstly collected for the latter use. A binary Logit regression was then used to construct the theoretical framework for the farmers' adoption of precision dairy technology, according to the farmers' behavior and innovation diffusion theory. The results showed that: 1) The adoption rates of automatic cup stripping, identification, milk recording, and estrus monitoring technology by dairy farmers were 64.9%, 57.7%, 56.2%, and 37.7%, respectively. 2) The non-adoption of new technologies was ever more costly for dairy farmers, particularly for the unaffordable investment in the early stage of technology. 3) All technology popularization levels, breeding scales, and average daily milk production presented a significant positive correlation on the adoption of four technologies. By contrast, there was a significant correlation with the other factors on the adoption of at least two technologies. Among the four technologies, the automatic cup stripping technology was the least affected by the breeding scale, policy subsidies, and technical training. The automatic identification technology was the most affected by the satisfaction of breeding income and education level. The automatic milk recording technology was the most affected by the average daily milk production, and policy subsidies without technical training. The automatic estrus monitoring technology was the least affected by the education level and average daily milk production without the policy subsidies, particularly the most influence from the breeding scale and technical training. Therefore, it is recommended to implement the different promotion measures for the four technologies. Specifically, the automatic cup stripping technology can be focused on small-scale farms, due to the least influence from the farming scale. The automatic estrus monitoring technology can be focused on large-scale breeding farms, technical popularization, and training for the strong skills of data management for the dairy farmers.","Qiuhong, Ren;Hua, Peng;Xiaoxia, Dong;Hongjie, Yang;Liyu, Zhang;Liwang, Li",Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2022-06-01,Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences;Statistical Information Division of the National Livestock Station,agriculture automation ;  application status ;  dairy farmers ;  influencing factors ;  precision dairy technology ;  the north China region

"Sources, ecological hazards and treatment technologies of microplastics in soil","This paper is the result of environmental geological survey engineering. [Objective]In recent years, ecological and environmental pollution caused by microplastics has attracted widespread interest. [Methods]This paper reviews recent progress in research on the sources and hazards of microplastics and detection and treatment technologies investigated in a large number of studies. [Results](1) The primary sources of microplastics in soil are the cracking of agricultural land film without efficient recycling, use of sewage sludge containing microplastics in agricultural production activities, and settling of microplastics from air to surfaces; (2) Microplastics in soil can adsorb heavy metals, antibiotics, and other pollutants, which can change the pH, bulk density, and physical and chemical properties of soil, affect the development of earthworms and other soil animals, and reduce the activities of crucial microorganisms involved in the soil nutrient cycle, thereby harming the soil environment; (3) No unified technical standard for microplastic separation and detection is currently available. Visual inspection and spectroscopic and thermal analysis techniques are the main methods for detecting microplastics. [Conclusions] Microplastics in soil prese nt varied levels of risk to the environment and health of animals and plants and threaten human health through the food chain. Future research can focus on blocking the sources of soil microplastics, the pollution mechanism of soil microplastics and heavy metal compound pollution, and innovations in soil microplastic detection technologies.","Yan, Yuchen;Yang, Zhongfang;Yu, Tao",Journal,Geology in China,2022-06-01,"School of the Earth Sciences and Resources;China University of Geosciences, Beijing",detection method ;  ecological risk ;  environmental geological survey engineering ;  microplastic ;  soil ;  source ;  treatment technology
A review on the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite solar cells,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention from the scientific community due to their low cost, high performance, and rapid increase in photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 25.5%. Compared with rigid perovskite solar cells, flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) deposited on polymer substrates are considered to be more suitable for commercial application with their intrinsic advantages in lightweight and bendability. However, a gap presents between the photovoltaic performance of FPSCs and rigid PSCs, and the mechanical instability of FPSCs is still a critical concern for commercial application. In this review, the recent research progress on improving the mechanical stability of FPSCs is summarized and discussed through two main aspects: particle regulation and structure innovation, which could provide valuable suggestions for future research efforts in this area and the engineering application of FPSCs. On the other hand, the research advances in FPSCs-based self-powering sensors are introduced and discussed, illustrating the next-stage breakthroughs, possible innovation designs, and future developments of FPSCs.","Zhang, Meihe;Li, Zhihao;Li, Honggang;Zhang, Chao",Journal,Advances in Mechanics,2022-06-01,Northwestern Polytechnical University,crack self-healing ;  flexible perovskite solar cells ;  high stretchability ;  mechanical stability ;  wearable self-powered sensor

Supramolecular Biomaterials in the Netherlands,"Synthetically designed biomaterials strive to recapitulate and mimic the complex environment of natural systems. Using natural materials as a guide, the ability to create high-performance biomaterials that control cell fate, and support the next generation of cell- and tissue-based therapeutics, is starting to emerge. Supramolecular chemistry takes inspiration from the wealth of noncovalent interactions found in natural materials that are inherently complex, and using the skills of synthetic and polymer chemistry, recreates simple systems to imitate their features. Within the past decade, supramolecular biomaterials have shown utility in tissue engineering and the progress predicts a bright future. On this 30th anniversary of the Netherlands Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering society, we briefly recount the state of supramolecular biomaterials in the Dutch academic and industrial research and development context. This review provides the background, recent advances, industrial successes and challenges, as well as future directions of the field, as we see it. Throughout this work, we notice the intricate interplay between simplicity and complexity in creating more advanced solutions. We hope that the interplay and juxtaposition between these two forces can propel the field forward. Supramolecular biomaterials based on noncovalent interactions hold the ability to rebuild some of the complexity of natural biomaterials in synthetic systems. While still in its infancy, the field is currently vigorously moving from fundamental experiments toward applications and products in the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine arena. Herein, we review the current state of the field in the Netherlands. While supramolecular biomaterials have incredible potential, systematic studies, balancing complexity and simplicity, efficient translation, and enhanced performance are all required for success of these strategies. As we move the field toward commercial solutions for clinical patients, we must also pay homage and remember the fundamental studies that allow these jumps in innovation.","Baker, Matthew B.;Bosman, Anton W.;Cox, Martijn A.J.;Dankers, Patricia Y.W.;Dias, Aylvin;Jonkheijm, Pascal;Kieltyka, Roxanne",Journal,Tissue Engineering - Part A,2022-06-01,SupraPolix BV;Xeltis B.V.;DSM Biomedical;Leiden Institute of Chemistry;Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Universiteit Twente;Universiteit Maastricht,biomaterials ;  supramolecular biomaterials ;  tissue engineering
Mathematics Anxiety and Self-Efficacy of Mexican Engineering Students: Is There Gender Gap?,"Studies have reported that there is a gender disparity wherein women do not study equally to men in bachelor’s degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) areas, although they lead the race of having a better terminal efficiency rate in higher education. This research explores engineering students’ math anxiety and math self-efficacy levels, aiming to determine if there is a gender gap for this specific population. Data were collected from 498 students using adapted items from existing surveys. These items were translated to Spanish, and validity tests were used to establish content validity and reliability. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to determine possible differences between male and female math anxiety and math self-efficacy levels. Male engineering students reported higher self-efficacy and lower math anxiety levels, and this difference was shown to be significant according to the MANOVA results. Findings of this research could help engineering educators to better understand how their students feel when they are practicing and performing math-related activities and what type of strategies could be designed when aiming to ameliorate female students’ math anxiety feelings.","Morán-Soto, Gustavo;González-Peña, Omar Israel",Journal,Education Sciences,2022-06-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez;National Institute of Sciences and Innovation for the Formation of the Scientific Community;Instituto Tecnológico de,educational innovation ;  gender equality ;  higher education ;  math ;  STEM education ;  women in science ;  women in STEM
A Stakeholder-Centered mHealth Implementation Inquiry Within the Digital Health Innovation Ecosystem in South Africa: MomConnect as a Demonstration Case,"Background: The internet is a useful web-based multimedia platform for accessing and disseminating information unconstrained by time, distance, and place. To the health care sector's benefit, the advent and proliferation of mobile devices have provided an opportunity for interventions that combine asynchronous technology-aided health services to improve the lives of the less privileged and marginalized people and their communities, particularly in developing societies. Objective: This study aimed to report on the perspectives of the different stakeholders involved in the study and to review an existing government mobile health (mHealth) program. It forms part of a study to design a re-engineered strategy based on the best demonstrated practices (considerations and methods) and learned experiences from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders within the digital health innovation ecosystem in South Africa. Methods: This study used an ethnographic approach involving document review, stakeholder mapping, semistructured individual interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations to explore, describe, and analyze the perspectives of its heterogeneous participant categories representing purposively sampled but different constituencies. Results: Overall, 80 participants were involved in the study, in addition to the 6 meetings the researcher attended with members of a government-appointed task team. In addition, 46 archived records and reports were consulted and reviewed as part of gathering data relating to the government's MomConnect project. Among the consulted stakeholders, there was general consensus that the existing government-sponsored MomConnect program should be implemented beyond mere piloting, to as best as possible capacity within the available resources and time. It was further intimated that the scalability and sustainability of mHealth services as part of an innovative digital health ecosystem was hamstrung by challenges that included stakeholder mismanagement, impact assessment inadequacies, management of data, lack of effective leadership and political support, inappropriate technology choices, eHealth and mHealth funding, integration of mHealth to existing health programs in tandem with Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals, integration of lessons learned from other mHealth initiatives to avoid resource wastage and duplication of efforts, proactive evaluation of both mHealth and eHealth strategies, and change management and developing human resources for eHealth. Conclusions: This study has only laid a foundation for the re-engineering of mHealth services within the digital health innovation ecosystem. This study articulated the need for stakeholder collaboration, such as continuous engagement among academics, technologists, and mHealth fieldwork professionals. Such compelling collaboration is accentuated more by the South African realities of the best practices in the fieldwork, which may not necessarily be documented in peer-reviewed or systematic research documents from which South African professionals, research experts, and practitioners could learn. Further research is needed for the retrospective analysis of mHealth initiatives and forecasting of the sustainability of current and future mHealth initiatives in South Africa.","Sibuyi, Idon Nkhenso;De la Harpe, Retha;Nyasulu, Peter",Journal,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2022-06-01,"Stellenbosch University, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences;Cape Peninsula University of Technology",digital health innovation ecosystem ;  global digital health index ;  mHealth ;  MomConnect ;  patient-facing eHealth ;  practitioner-researcher ;  principles of digital development ;  re-engineering in health services ;  stakeholder-centered design ;  strong structuration theory ;  sustainable development goals
"Women in Systems Science and Gender Parity: Why and How to Democratize the ""technology, Innovation, and Society Nexus""","A career in systems science offers exciting prospects as well as challenges around the world, which are often underexplored or unknown. Gender parity, diversity, inclusion, and equity are essential for knowledge production, systems science research, and innovation to be representative, democratic, and critically informed. By virtue of its focus on systems, omics science is ideally poised to understand and respond to systemic and structural issues that hinder gender parity, equity, and democracy in science and society. In this context, voices from women in systems science in resource-limited countries are often inaudible, a gap that this article aims to bridge. We present here some of the pressing issues and possible ways forward for equitable representation of women in science. We highlight emerging frontiers of systems science such as digital transformation, Industry 4.0, and cyber-physical systems where gender parity and equity are crucial. This article also examines some of the challenges faced by women scientists in Africa. All in all, much work is needed across communities and countries worldwide for diversity and gender equity in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM)-based programs. Adapting a critical lens that examines power asymmetries in STEM in Africa and around the world, and new ways of thinking for bringing women scientists in Africa to leadership positions in traditional STEM fields such as computer science and engineering where large gender equity gaps exist, is a timely and principled necessity in 21st century science and society.","Hamdi, Yosr;Mulder, Nicola;Abdelhak, Sonia",Journal,OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology,2022-06-01,"Institut Pasteur de Tunis;Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town",democracy ;  diversity ;  gender parity ;  social justice ;  STEM ;  women in science
Climate-Smart Holistic Management System Criteria’s Effectiveness on Milk Production in Lithuania,"One of the problematic sectors according to GHG (greenhouse gas) and ammonia (NH3) emission quantities is agriculture. Without endangering food production (and intensifying), GHG emissions come from all sources in animal husbandry. The aim of this study was to comprehensively reduce GHG emissions by applying a holistic process management model to one of the most popular cowsheds in Lithuania (260-seat boxing cowshed, cows are milked on site, computerized management of technological processes, productivity of 8600 kg of milk, barn system, and liquid manure). Considering the cow keeping technology applied on the farm, the equipment used, and the feed production and ration system, a model for the management of technological parameters of production processes was prepared for the farm. This model balanced trade-offs among animal welfare, cow productivity, production costs, and GHG and NH3 emissions. The aim of the research was the adaptation of the integrated model to fully control, manage, and optimize milk production processes through bio-and engineering innovations to implement climate-friendly feed production and feeding and feed rationing systems, to improve animal housing and working conditions, and to reduce GHG and NH3 emissions without increasing production costs. The environmental impact assessment was performed with SimaPro 9.1 process modeling software. Data from milk production, biomass cultivation, and feed preparation, transportation, and equipment were used from the Ecoinvent v3 database. Based on the LML-I calculation methodology, the effect of processes was determined. To quantify the potential emissions in the dairy farm, the emission factors were estimated using a life cycle assessment method per functional unit—1000 kg—of standardized milk. Grass silage, maize silage, and feed concentrate were found to account for the largest share of gas emissions—26.09% (107.39 kg CO2 eq. FU−1), 22.70% (93.44 kg CO2 eq. FU−1), and 21.85% (89.92 kg CO2 eq. FU−1) of the total CO2 emissions during the process, respectively. Considering the critical points of the classic SC scenario, the cultivation technology was adjusted, where 50% of N fertilizers were replaced by bioproducts (biological preparations). Both scenarios—classic SC (control variant) and Bio SC (variants using bioproducts)—were evaluated for comparison. The use of biopreparations in the categories reduced the environmental impact from 0.1% to 45.7% in dairy production technology grass silage, barley grain, hay production, and corn silage stocks. The carbon footprint of the sustainable bio-based milk production (0.393 kg CO2 eq. kg−1 FPCM (fat-and protein-adjusted milk)) was lower by 4.6% compared to the average Lithuanian classic dairy farm (0.412 kg CO2 eq. kg−1 FPCM). Based on this methodology, it is possible to assess many dairy farms and address critical points in an integrated way, which can help to improve the quality of dairy production and the environment.","Naujokienė, Vilma;Bleizgys, Rolandas;Venslauskas, Kęstutis;Paulikienė, Simona",Journal,Agriculture (Switzerland),2022-06-01,Vytautas Magnus University,fat-and protein-adjusted milk ;  GHG reduction ;  global warming potential ;  greenhouse gas ;  holistic management ;  milk production
ASAS-NANP symposium: Mathematical modeling in animal nutrition: Limitations and potential next steps for modeling and modelers in the animal sciences,"The field of animal science, and especially animal nutrition, relies heavily on modeling to accomplish its day-To-day objectives. New data streams (""big data"") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of ""new""modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: Technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-And-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine ""old""and ""new""modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained. In this review, we share our view on the current and future limitations of modeling and potential next steps for modelers in the animal sciences. First, we discuss the inherent dependencies and limitations of modeling as a human process. Then, we highlight how models, fueled by AI, can play an enhanced sustainable role in the animal sciences ecosystem.

Application Progress of Modified Chitosan and Its Composite Biomaterials for Bone Tissue Engineering,"In recent years, bone tissue engineering (BTE), as a multidisciplinary field, has shown considerable promise in replacing traditional treatment modalities (i.e., autografts, allografts, and xenografts). Since bone is such a complex and dynamic structure, the construction of bone tissue composite materials has become an attractive strategy to guide bone growth and regeneration. Chitosan and its derivatives have been promising vehicles for BTE owing to their unique physical and chemical properties. With intrinsic physicochemical characteristics and closeness to the extracellular matrix of bones, chitosan-based composite scaffolds have been proved to be a promising candidate for providing successful bone regeneration and defect repair capacity. Advances in chitosan-based scaffolds for BTE have produced efficient and efficacious bio-properties via material structural design and different modifications. Efforts have been put into the modification of chitosan to overcome its limitations, including insolubility in water, faster depolymerization in the body, and blood incompatibility. Herein, we discuss the various modification methods of chitosan that expand its fields of application, which would pave the way for future applied research in biomedical innovation and regenerative medicine.","Zhu, Yuemeng;Zhang, Yidi;Zhou, Yanmin",Journal,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2022-06-01,Jilin University,bone tissue engineering ;  cross-linking ;  modified chitosan ;  structure modification
Microfluidic Organ‐on‐a‐Chip System for Disease Modeling and Drug Development,"An organ‐on‐a‐chip is a device that combines micro‐manufacturing and tissue engineering to replicate the critical physiological environment and functions of the human organs. Therefore, it can be used to predict drug responses and environmental effects on organs. Microfluidic technology can control micro‐scale reagents with high precision. Hence, microfluidics have been widely applied in organ‐on‐chip systems to mimic specific organ or multiple organs in vivo. These models integrated with various sensors show great potential in simulating the human environment. In this review, we mainly introduce the typical structures and recent research achievements of several or-gan‐on‐a‐chip platforms. We also discuss innovations in models applied to the fields of pharmaco-kinetics/pharmacodynamics, nano‐medicine, continuous dynamic monitoring in disease modeling, and their further applications in other fields.","Li, Zening;Hui, Jianan;Yang, Panhui;Mao, Hongju",Journal,Biosensors,2022-06-01,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences,disease modeling ;  drug development ;  microfluidics ;  organ‐on‐a‐chip
An innovative geotechnical and structural monitoring system based on the use of NSHT,"The development of innovative early warning systems (EWS), structural health monitoring (SHM) and structural health monitoring and reinforcement (SHMR) systems is essential to prevent the occurrence of potentially dangerous events on engineering works, buildings and in the natural environment. Their effectiveness can be improved by using new generation sensors able to realize widespread, low-cost monitoring at increasing spatial and temporal resolution. The main aim of the research is, therefore, to develop a versatile strain transducer capable of monitoring elements of different nature such as slopes, buildings and linear infrastructures performing distributed real-time measurements. The paper introduces a new smart hybrid transducer (NSHT), a strain transducer belonging to the distributed optical fiber sensors family, appositely designed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional solutions. An experimental laboratory setup was arranged to test its reliability and a comparison between measurements retrieved by the NSHT and traditional devices were done. The results showed that the NSHT is able to perform strain monitoring with spatial resolution as high as 5 cm and accuracy comparable to that of the traditional devices. Finally, an integrated structural and geotechnical monitoring system architecture based on its use is proposed for the Petacciato site, where a deep-seated landslide affects the historical town and some infrastructures. To realize a single communication line in such a complex monitoring system, where multiple elements have to be monitored, a specific tool was also designed and tested, that allows the exact spatial identification of the various elements under observation. Although on-site validation is needed, these early results are encouraging and demonstrate that the NSHT is a low-cost transducer with great potential and that, looking forward, it can be used to increase the effectiveness of the existing EW, SHM and SHMR Systems. The development of systems involving NSHT also follows the new approach to innovation policy contributing to different points of the 2030 Agenda","Di Gennaro, L.;Damiano, E.;De Cristofaro, M.;Netti, N.;Olivares, L.;Zona, R.;Iavazzo, L.;Coscetta, A.;Mirabile, M.;Giarrusso, G.

4D printing technology in medical engineering: a narrative review,"The addition of the time dimension to three-dimensional (3D) printing has introduced four-dimensional (4D) printing technology, which has gained considerable attention in different fields such as medical, art, and engineering. Nowadays, bioscience has introduced some ideas which can be fulfilled by 4D printing. Blending time with variations caused by the situation has many beneficial aspects such as perceptibility and adaptability. Since 4D printing can create a dynamic structure with stimuli-responsive materials, the applications of smart materials, stimulus, and 3D printing are the effective criteria in 4D printing technology. Smart materials with their flexible properties can reshape, recolor, or change function under the effect of the internal or exterior stimuli. Thus, an attractive prospect in the medical field is the integration of the 4D printing approach along with smart materials. This research aims to show the most recent applications of 4D printing technology and smart materials in medical engineering which can show better prospective of 4D printing applications in the future. Also, it describes smart medical implants, tissue engineering, and bioprinting and how they are being used for the 4D printing approach in medical engineering applications. In this regard, a particular emphasis is dedicated to the latest progress in the innovation and development of stimuli-responsive materials that are activated and respond over time to physical, chemical, and biological stimuli and their exploitation through 3D printing methods to fabrication 4D printing smart parts such as intelligent tissue-engineered scaffolds, smart orthopedic implants, and targeted drug delivery systems. On the other hand, major challenges in this technology are explained along with some suggestions for future works to address existing limitations. It is worth noting that despite significant research that has been carried out into 4D printing, it might be more valuable if some investigation is done into 4D bio-printing applications and how this approach will be developed.","Sahafnejad-Mohammadi, Iman;Karamimoghadam, Mojtaba;Zolfagharian, Ali;Akrami, Mohammad;Bodaghi, Mahdi",Journal,Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering,2022-06-01,"Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch;University of Exeter;Deakin University;Coventry University;Nottingham Trent University",3D printing ;  4D printing ;  Medical engineering ;  Smart materials ;  Stimuli
Artificial intelligence in industrial design: A semi-automated literature survey,"In the era of industry 4.0, artificial intelligence (AI) may potentially be used to provide reasoning and decision support on engineering and technical challenges. The role of AI in industrial design, which is the practice of improving the function, value and aesthetics of products to optimise customer satisfaction, has not yet been extensively explored. To effectively synthesise the existing literature, an unsupervised learning-enabled review methodology is proposed in this study. Important journals and articles are identified by using k-means clustering, and the relevant articles are analysed by using co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrence analyses. Six clusters of the body of knowledge are then extracted, and naming of the clusters is assisted by using document summarisation and evaluation. Consequently, six intellectual cores related to AI in industrial design are formulated: (i) supply chain perspectives on product design and innovation, (ii) manufacturability and performance of new product development, (iii) intelligent tools and systems for industrial design and engineering, (iv) applied intelligence for product and service innovation, (v) industry 4.0 technologies for design and manufacturing, and (vi) blockchain-enabled artificial intelligence in industry 4.0. Future research trends on sustainable design, trust in AI, and emerging technology integration towards the next-generation AI in industrial design are discussed.","Tsang, Y. P.;Lee, C.

An Energy Culture Maturity Conceptual Framework on Adopting Energy-Efficient Technology Innovations in Buildings,"The building sector is identified as the leading global energy consumer. Adopting energy-efficient technology innovations has been recognised as the most promising approach to reducing energy consumption in buildings. However, such technology adoption is considerably lacking due to traditional techno-economic thinking, which lacks human focus. Energy culture has been identified as a research domain that successfully overcomes the traditional techno-economic focus of technology diffusion. However, available energy culture studies on adopting energy-efficient technology innovations in buildings are limited to exploring specific energy cultures rather than investigating holistic energy culture maturity, which guides incremental diffusion of energy-efficient technology innovations. Conversely, culture maturity has been studied in other cultural research domains such as safety cultures. Therefore, this study aims to develop an energy culture maturity conceptual framework that provides a holistic view of energy culture maturity for adopting energy-efficient technology innovations in buildings. The research method this study implemented was a scoping literature review method, using Web of Science, Scopus, and Engineering Village research databases. The findings of the study include the development of factor categorisation with 14 main factors and 11 subfactors and the development of three energy culture maturity stages, as well as the development of the energy culture maturity conceptual framework as the principal outcome. The proposed conceptual framework significantly contributes to energy culture research as the pioneering framework on energy culture maturity. The framework should be further tested and applied to find its utility.","Soorige, Dumindu;Karunasena, Gayani;Kulatunga, Udayangani;Mahmood, Muhammad Nateque;De Silva, Lalith",Journal,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",2022-06-01,"Faculty of Science, Engineering and Built Environment;University of Moratuwa",building ;  conceptual framework ;  eco-innovation ;  energy culture ;  energy culture maturity ;  energy-efficient technology ;  energy-efficient technology innovation ;  open eco-innovation ;  open innovation
Technological innovation and employee psychological well-being: The moderating role of employee learning orientation and perceived organizational support,"A significant yet rarely explored research area is how the adoption of technological innovations impacts employee psychological well-being, such as in regard to employee anxiety and satisfaction. Accordingly, this study proposes and tests a framework of the effect of technological innovation on the psychological well-being of employees and how much effect is shaped by employee learning orientation and perceived organizational support. Empirical findings from 202 employees within 40 manufacturing SMEs show an inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovation and employee psychological well-being (measured as employee anxiety and satisfaction). Further analysis reveals that both employee learning orientation and perceived organization support enhance the inverted U-shaped effect of technological innovation on employee psychological well-being. Our findings present important research and practical implications for innovation and organizational studies literature.","Zahoor, Nadia;Donbesuur, Francis;Christofi, Michael;Miri, Domnan",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-06-01,"Teesside University Business School;Loughborough University, School of Business and Economics;Cyprus University of Technology;University of Strathclyde",Employee learning orientation ;  Pakistan ;  Perceived organizational support ;  Psychological well-being ;  SMEs ;  Technological innovation
Redirecting marine antibiofouling innovations from sustainable horizons,"Biofouling has great environmental, economic, and societal impacts. Emerging and promising strategies for antibiofouling require incorporation of sustainability concepts. To this end, key research priorities should be given to disrupting attachment of organisms or engineering innovative surfaces to slough off fouling organisms from the surfaces, with more holistic considerations of other viable options, including eco-friendly antifouling chemicals.","Liu, Xiaobo;Yang, Jin Long;Rittschof, Daniel;Maki, James S.;Gu, Ji Dong",Journal,Trends in Ecology and Evolution,2022-06-01,Guangdong Technion-Israel Institute of Technology;Klingler College of Arts and Sciences;Shanghai Ocean University;Duke University Marine Laboratory;Nanjing University of Science and Technology;Southern Laboratory of Ocean Science and Engineering,
Representation of machines and mechanisms in augmented reality for educative use,"Mobile devices and augmented reality are powerful technological advances used in a wide area of applications and with great potential in engineering education. Nowadays, education, in general, faces several challenges, among them, keeping the attention and engagement of the students in the classroom and motivating the students to self-learn. Augmented reality (AR) is an option to reverse this situation. This work presents an analysis of current augmented reality technologies and a review of the current state-of-the-art of augmented reality introduced in teaching, especially focusing on engineering at the undergraduate level. This research aims to investigate the impact of AR on student attitude, engagement, and student understanding of the concepts of mechanical engineering. The contribution of this work is the generation of an augmented reality app for mobile devices to aid in the understanding of planar mechanisms by displaying models of simple machines. The augmented reality simulation allows the three-dimensional representation of the planar mechanisms as well as several possible interactions, plots, and calculations. The students used the mobile app and solved a simple exercise. Furthermore, a questionnaire was applied to capture their perceptions of using augmented reality in their classes of mechanical engineering. The evaluation of the exercise, as well as the results of the questions, indicated that the students had a positive perception of the use of augmented reality in the classroom. Also, augmented reality increased their engagement and improved their comprehension of the components of the mechanisms.","Urbina Coronado, Pedro Daniel;Demeneghi, José Augusto Amador;Ahuett-Garza, Horacio;Orta Castañon, Pedro;Martínez, Manuel Martínez",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2022-06-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Augmented reality ;  Educational innovation ;  Generation z ;  Higher education ;  Mobile applications
The OMiLAB Digital Innovation environment: Agile conceptual models to bridge business value with Digital and Physical Twins for Product-Service Systems development,"OMiLAB is a community of practice which offers a digital ecosystem bringing together open technologies to investigate and apply conceptual modeling methods for varying purposes and domains. One of the core value propositions is a dedicated Digital Innovation environment comprising several toolkits and workspaces, designed to support Product-Service Systems (PSS) prototyping – a key ingredient for PSS lifecycle management. At the core of this environment is a notion of Agile Digital Twin – a conceptual representation that can be tailored with knowledge engineering means to bridge the semantic and functional gap between a business perspective (focusing on value creation) and an engineering perspective (focusing on cyber-physical proofs-of-concept). To facilitate this bridging, the hereby proposed environment orchestrates, across three abstraction layers, methods such as Design Thinking, Agile Modeling Method Engineering and Model-driven Engineering to turn Ideation into smart Product-Service Systems experiments, in a laboratory setting. The proposed environment was built following Design Science principles. It addresses the problem of historically-disconnected skills required for Digital Innovation projects and it provides a testbed for feasibility experimentation. For design-oriented, artifact building research, a higher Technology Readiness Level can thus be achieved (compared to the level that idea development methods typically attain).","Karagiannis, Dimitris;Buchmann, Robert Andrei;Utz, Wilfrid",Journal,Computers in Industry,2022-06-01,Universität Wien;Universitatea Babeș-Bolyai;OMiLAB NPO,Agile modeling method engineering ;  Digital twin ;  Domain-specific conceptual modeling ;  OMiLAB ;  Physical twin ;  Smart Product-service Systems
Recent advances and overview on sustainable development of membrane-based wastewater treatment technology,"The development of membrane-based wastewater treatment technology faces two challenges, i.e.: (i) improvement in the environment quality requires high-standard treatment, and (ii) carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality calls for green and sustainable techniques. Under such circumstances, methods to break the bottleneck of water permeability and pollutant removal efficiency trade-off, to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emission of membrane technology, and to stimulate the sustainable development of membrane-based wastewater treatment are of great significance.Recently, remarkable progress in membrane-based wastewater treatment has been achieved in terms of membrane separation fundamentals, antifouling membrane preparation, membrane process innovations, and engineering applications. Current efforts have been dedicated to precise design of membrane materials, functionalization of membrane interface, and process greening transformation. In this work, recent research progress has been reviewed in terms of functional extension of membrane technology/process, design of high-performance membrane materials, sustainable utilization of membranes, and green development of membrane processes. Further analysis and discussion on future development are also presented.In the context of future multi-target needs, multi-functionalization, selective and customized separation, and green development are worthy of in-depth research for promoting the sustainable evolution of membrane-based wastewater treatment technology.","Wang, Zhiwei;Dai, Ruobin;Zhang, Xingran;Wen, Yue;Chen, Mei;Li, Jiayi",Journal,Tumu yu Huanjing Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Civil and Environmental Engineering,2022-06-01,Tongji University,Functional extension ;  High-standard treatment ;  Membrane materials ;  Sustainable development ;  Wastewater treatment
Open Innovation Dynamics of Furniture Design and Function: The Difference between IKEA and Nitori,"Even though global markets are transferring from offline to online, offline sales are rapidly increasing in two top global furniture firms in Korea and Japan each—IKEA and Nitori. This study aims to answer the following research question: ‘What are the differences and similarities between IKEA and Nitori in the open innovation dynamics of furniture design and function?’ Diverse naturalistic qualitative research methods such as participatory observation, or focus group interviews were used. IKEA is mainly pursuing engineering open innovation strategies, including advanced furniture design with engineering knowledge, fusion with new IT and other technologies for new and innovative furniture function and design, and pursuit of creative design idea frontiers.

Developing green process innovation through network action learning,"Green process innovation is itself a complex process and beneficially involves inter-organizational collaboration across disciplinary, industry and university-industry boundaries with many opportunities for network action learning. We investigate how green process innovation yields actionable knowledge when co-directed, co-developed and co-deployed in a network of organizations. We undertook two case studies focused on innovation at the water-energy nexus. With the use of action learning research, we describe and reflect on the actions undertaken by the network to co-generate learning from green process innovation. We demonstrate how this inter-organizational learning is grounded in shared experiences, subjected to critical questioning and supported by (and generating) actionable knowledge. Our paper links the green process innovation process with technical and collaborative learning outcomes, achieved through network action learning. Of managerial relevance are two forms of actionable knowledge: that towards solving engineering puzzles and that addressing the problem of collaboration and learning in networks.","Wu, Szu Hsin;Coughlan, Paul;Coghlan, David;McNabola, Aonghus;Novara, Daniele",Journal,Creativity and Innovation Management,2022-06-01,School of Business;Trinity Business School;Trinity College Dublin,actionable knowledge ;  collaboration ;  green process innovation ;  network action learning
Social interdependencies as facilitators of cooperative learning in new product development: The moderating effect of technological novelty,"As automobile manufacturing firms often outsource third-party designers to produce key innovative components, the suppliers of these third-party designers must be capable of collaborative innovation through cooperative learning in today's changing technology and customers’ demands. However, research has rarely investigated how suppliers’ relationships - specifically, the mutual dependence among suppliers - can be leveraged to enhance cooperative learning and thus the final product quality. This research draws on social interdependence theory to examine the associations between two main types of interdependence (task and resources) and cooperative learning under different levels of technology novelty conditions. Based on data collected from automobile parts suppliers in China, the results indicate that resource and task interdependence were positively associated with cooperative learning. However, high task interdependence is unfavorable under high technological novelty; whereas, resource interdependence is a key driver of inter-organizational learning under higher levels of technological novelty. The results of this study have significant theoretical and implications for researchers and designers to nurture suppliers’ cooperative learning capabilities under diverse technology novelty conditions.","Vivian Ma, Hanzhuo;Liu, Shulin;Klein, Gary;Wayne Huang, Wei;Jiang, James",Journal,Expert Systems with Applications,2022-06-01,College of Management;Southern University of Science and Technology;Xi'an Jiaotong University;University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,Interdependence ;  Knowledge management ;  New product development ;  Supplier relationships ;  Technology novelty
Out of the Ivory Tower: The Patenting Activity of Canadian University Professors Before the 1980s,"This study analyses the patenting activities of university science and engineering professors in Canada between 1920 and 1975. Unlike most studies on commercial activities in academia, which typically focus on the post-1980 period and on university practices, we focus on the pre-1980 period and on the individual decisions of professors to patent their inventions. Based on quantitative patent data, we show that patenting, and thus professors’ interest in the possible commercial value of their scientific discoveries made in university laboratories, was relatively common on an individual and informal basis well before the 1980s and the advent of what is now called “academic capitalism”. This contradicts the belief that before that period, universities were a kind of ivory towers in which professors isolated themselves from external influences and engaged only in pure and disinterested research.","Colleret, Maxime;Gingras, Yves",Journal,Minerva,2022-06-01,Université du Québec à Montréal,Innovation ;  Intellectual property ;  Patents ;  Science professors ;  Technology transfer ;  University ;  University-industry relations
Iterative uncertainty reduction in multi-actor smart service innovation,"Smart service innovation is the process of reconfiguring resources, structures, and value co-creation processes in service systems that result in novel data-driven service offerings. The nature of such offerings requires the involvement of multiple actors, which has been investigated by a few studies only. In particular, little is known about the multiple actors’ efforts to manage uncertainty in the process of establishing smart service systems. Empirically grounded in data from 25 interviews with industry experts, we explore how organizations act and interact in smart service innovation processes. For our data analysis, we adopt a microfoundational view to derive a theoretical model that conceptualizes actor engagement as a microfoundation for iterative uncertainty reduction in the actor-to-actor network of the smart service system. Our study contributes to information systems research on service systems engineering and digital transformation by explaining smart service innovation from both a multi-actor and a multi-level perspective, drawing on service-dominant (S-D) logic and microfoundations as well-established theoretical lenses.","Poeppelbuss, Jens;Ebel, Martin;Anke, Jürgen",Journal,Electronic Markets,2022-06-01,Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Dresden (FH);Ruhr-Universitat Bochum,Actor engagement ;  Digital transformation ;  Microfoundations ;  S-D logic ;  Service system
Highlights on Advancing Frontiers in Tissue Engineering,"The field of tissue engineering continues to advance, sometimes in exponential leaps forward, but also sometimes at a rate that does not fulfill the promise that the field imagined a few decades ago. This review is in part a catalog of success in an effort to inform the process of innovation. Tissue engineering has recruited new technologies and developed new methods for engineering tissue constructs that can be used to mitigate or model disease states for study. Key to this antecedent statement is that the scientific effort must be anchored in the needs of a disease state and be working toward a functional product in regenerative medicine. It is this focus on the wildly important ideas coupled with partnered research efforts within both academia and industry that have shown most translational potential. The field continues to thrive and among the most important recent developments are the use of three-dimensional bioprinting, organ-on-a-chip, and induced pluripotent stem cell technologies that warrant special attention. Developments in the aforementioned areas as well as future directions are highlighted in this article. Although several early efforts have not come to fruition, there are good examples of commercial profitability that merit continued investment in tissue engineering. Tissue engineering led to the development of new methods for regenerative medicine and disease models. Among the most important recent developments in tissue engineering are the use of three-dimensional bioprinting, organ-on-a-chip, and induced pluripotent stem cell technologies. These technologies and an understanding of them will have impact on the success of tissue engineering and its translation to regenerative medicine.

Emerging technologies in Indian mining industry: an exploratory empirical investigation regarding the adoption challenges,"Purpose: Emerging technologies have been transforming most industries. A wide range of emerging technologies such as blockchain, internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotics and many others have changed the way in which firm value chain activities or processes were executed traditionally. The mining industry has also witnessed the introduction of these emerging technologies in various processes from the exploration stage to the final processing of ores. The purpose of this paper is to understand the pace of adoption of emerging technologies in the Indian mining industry and identify the challenges that managers confront while adopting emerging technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertook qualitative research. Data collection was done in two stages. Secondary research was conducted to arrive at a repository of use cases of the adoption of emerging technologies in the global mining industry. Primary data collection was also done. The insights on emerging technology adoption and challenges faced in the Indian mining industry were captured by in-depth interviewing of subject matter experts. The authors interviewed 21 mining subject matter experts with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. The responses were content analyzed by thematic content analysis. Technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) frameworks were applied to segregate different factors affecting the adoption of emerging technologies in the Indian mining industry. Findings: Emerging technologies such as blockchain, IoT, AI, ML, robotics has been applied across various mining engineering value chain activities such as in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling. However, emerging technologies adoption was hindered because of a lack of managerial awareness, cultural inertia, substantive upfront investments and the nature of intangible benefits in the short run. Research limitations/implications: The research applied technology adoption frameworks in the mining industry. The authors used TOE and DOI frameworks to understand the challenges faced by Indian mining firms. The research findings, thus added to the conversation of TOE and DOI frameworks in the context of the Indian mining industry. Practical implications: The research finding would help mining firm managers to anticipate the challenges with respect to technology adoption. This would allow mining executives to create a proper technology adoption plan and intervene proactively. The research would also provide information about the steps taken by competing firms with respect to emerging technologies adoption. The research would help managers to decide technology implementation steps in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling to be undertaken for successful adoption of emerging technologies. Technology firms could gain insights into the issues faced by mining firms in adopting emerging technologies. This research would help managers to influence organizational technology policy and endorse the addition of pro-technology policies in mining activities. Policymakers involved in the mining sector could also incorporate industry-level policy decisions so as to facilitate the adoption of emerging technologies among mining firms and remove the barriers to the adoption of emerging technologies. This would create an opportunity for technology providers to redesign product offerings, which could be a good fit for Indian mining firms. Originality/value: Indian mining industry contributed significantly to the Indian economy. Despite this, limited focus has been put regarding the adoption of emerging technologies in the mining industry. Mining managers did not have any framework to understand the challenges faced in the adoption of technologies across the mining value chain that is in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling. This study focused on identifying those challenges through the use of technology adoption frameworks. This research was one of the first studies to gain insights on emerging technologies adoption in the context of the mining industry through the theoretical lens of TOE and DOI frameworks.","Bhattacharyya, Som Sekhar;Shah, Yash",Journal,Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,2022-06-01,Indian Institute of Management Mumbai,Blockchain ;  Diffusion of innovation ;  Digitization and automation ;  Emerging technologies ;  Internet of things (IoT) ;  Mining-industry ;  Technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) framework
"Decrypting distributed ledger design—taxonomy, classification and blockchain community evaluation","More than 1000 distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems raising $600 billion in investment in 2016 feature the unprecedented and disruptive potential of blockchain technology. A systematic and data-driven analysis, comparison and rigorous evaluation of the different design choices of distributed ledgers and their implications is a challenge. The rapidly evolving nature of the blockchain landscape hinders reaching a common understanding of the techno-socio-economic design space of distributed ledgers and the cryptoeconomies they support. To fill this gap, this paper makes the following contributions: (i) A conceptual architecture of DLT systems with which (ii) a taxonomy is designed and (iii) a rigorous classification of DLT systems is made using real-world data and wisdom of the crowd. (iv) A DLT design guideline is the end result of applying machine learning methodologies on the classification data. Compared to related work and as defined in earlier taxonomy theory, the proposed taxonomy is highly comprehensive, robust, explanatory and extensible. The findings of this paper can provide new insights and better understanding of the key design choices evolving the modeling complexity of DLT systems, while identifying opportunities for new research contributions and business innovation.","Ballandies, Mark C.;Dapp, Marcus M.;Pournaras, Evangelos",Journal,Cluster Computing,2022-06-01,ETH Zürich;University of Leeds,Blockchain ;  Classification ;  Cryptoeconomic design ;  Distributed ledger ;  Taxonomy ;  Token engineering
Blended Learning Adoption and Implementation in Higher Education: A Theoretical and Systematic Review,"Technological innovations such as blended learning (BL) are rapidly changing teaching and learning in higher education, where BL integrates face to face teaching with web based learning. Thus, as polices related to BL increases, it is required to explore the theoretical foundation of BL studies and how BL were adopted and implemented in relation to students, lecturers and administration. However, only fewer studies have focused on exploring the constructs and factors related to BL adoption by considering the students, lecturers and administration concurrently. Likewise, prior research neglects to explore what practices are involved for BL implementation. Accordingly, this study systematically reviews, synthesizes, and provides meta-analysis of 94 BL research articles published from 2004 to 2020 to present the theoretical foundation of BL adoption and implementation in higher education. The main findings of this study present the constructs and factors that influence students, lecturers and administration towards adopting BL in higher education. Moreover, findings suggest that the BL practices to be implemented comprises of face-to-face, activities, information, resources, assessment, and feedback for students and technology, pedagogy, content, and knowledge for lecturers. Besides, the review reveals that the ad hoc, technology acceptance model, information system success model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and lastly diffusion of innovations theories are the mostly employed theories employed by prior studies to explore BL adoption. Findings from this study has implications for student, lecturers and administrators by providing insights into the theoretical foundation of BL adoption and implementation in higher education.","Anthony, Bokolo;Kamaludin, Adzhar;Romli, Awanis;Raffei, Anis Farihan Mat;Phon, Danakorn Nincarean A.L.Eh;Abdullah, Aziman;Ming, Gan Leong",Journal,"Technology, Knowledge and Learning",2022-06-01,Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Blended learning adoption and implementation ;  Higher education ;  Students' attitude ;  Students' perspective ;  Teaching and learning in digital environments

"Past, present, and future perspective of biomedical innovation in India","Innovation to design, develop, and deploy biomedical technologies, for use in health care, has been actively pursued in our country for several decades. Excellent work done by individuals, institutions, and organizations laid the seeds for a biomedical innovation culture in the country. Some of these seeds resulted in revolutionary technologies such as the Jaipur foot, Kalam-Raju coronary stent, Chitra heart valve, and SBMT ventilator. In addition, organized efforts by various governmental agencies and research projects in engineering and medical institutions have given further impetus for innovation to develop biomedical devices. At the same time, these initiatives have taught several hard lessons for current and future innovators. The exigencies created by the COVID-19 pandemic demanded an accelerated pace of innovation to address the urgent needs and uncertainties created by the pandemic. This led to extremely rapid revival, refinement, and recycling of existing technologies. However, most of the so-called COVID-inspired innovations in the country are merely imitations, improvisations, and improvements in existing technologies. Very few can be classified as novel innovations, and almost none are inventions. Failure of these technologies to address the real needs of end-users, limited laboratory testing, absence of clinical validation, and infringement of intellectual property rights makes them unsuitable for use in the healthcare sector. This represents a tremendous wastage of human, material, and financial resources. The way forward is for innovators (and institutions/organizations facilitating innovation) to consider all aspects of the innovation cycle, starting from the generation of ideas to address the real needs of end-users, designing of prototypes, laboratory testing, clinical validation, regulatory approval, commercialization, and post-marketing surveillance. A simplified framework-the KNOW ESSENTIALS algorithm-is presented here, which can help to consolidate the gains of past innovation efforts and encourage genuine innovation in the country.","Mathew, Joseph L.;Matthew, Thalakkotur Lazar",Book,Biomedical Translational Research: Technologies for Improving Healthcare,2022-05-26,"Manipal Academy of Higher Education;Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh;National Biomedical Instruments & Devices Hub",Biomedical innovation ;  COVID-19 ;  Healthcare technologies ;  Innovation ecosystem ;  Innovation pathway

Fabrication of Bioinspired Functional Micro-Nano Structures by Femtosecond Laser and Their Applications,"Significance The micro-nano structures in nature contain endless functions, which bring new opportunities for the innovation and development of material science and engineering technology. Inspired by biological functional surfaces, many new applications have been developed for biomimetic surfaces, such as structural colors, superhydrophobicity, self-cleaning, and optical performance improvement. Femtosecond laser direct writing technology is a processing method that can accurately control the material structures in the micro-nano scale. By adjusting the femtosecond laser processing parameters, 3D processing beyond the diffraction limit can be realized in a variety of material systems. The unique feature of the femtosecond laser direct writing technology is that it can realize the cross-scale modification of materials, and prepare more complex micro-nano structures through simulation and optimization. In this review, the characteristics and processing advantages of femtosecond laser are first introduced, and then the applications of femtosecond laser in the fields of structural colors, superhydrophobicity, anti-reflection, and bionic compound eyes are described in detail. In addition, the applications of the femtosecond laser fabrication of bionic functional micro-nano structures in other fields are briefly illustrated. Finally, the development of the femtosecond laser fabrication of bionic functional micro-nano structures is prospected. Progress In the long and brutal process of natural selection and biological evolution, various organisms have evolved their own unique functions to adapt to the environment. With the help of microscopic imaging, it has been found that the surfaces of many organisms are covered with many micro-nano structures. It is the different characteristics of these micro-nano structures that enable the organisms to adapt to extreme living environments. In line with the principle of learning from nature, researchers have carried out a lot of research on the micro-nano structures of biological surfaces, using different processing methods to imitate the structures of organisms in a variety of material systems, realizing the structural colors of material surfaces, superhydrophobicity, anti-reflection, large field of view angles and other functions. At present, nano-imprint printing, 3D printing, plasma etching, photolithography, ultra-fast laser processing, and other technologies have been used to achieve the preparation of bionic functional micro-nano structures. Among them, the femtosecond laser processing technology has the characteristics of high precision, cold processing, and diffraction limit breaking, and has an obvious technical complementarity with the traditional processing methods. Nature may be said to be the guide to the extreme manufacturing of modern industry. Therefore, the bionic design born from learning from nature presents unique functional characteristics due to the micro-nano structures of their unique surfaces widely used in radar, submarine, aircraft, corrosion resistant coating, and self-cleaning occasions. The femtosecond laser direct writing technology is widely used in the controllable fabrication of bionic micro-nano structures. A femtosecond laser has two obvious characteristics. One is that the duration of a femtosecond laser pulse is very short, which inhibits the formation of thermal action zones around the laser focus area. The other is that a femtosecond laser has a very high peak power, which far exceeds that of the Coulomb field in atoms. This kind of technology is highly accurate, simple, and efficient. Compared with other micro-nano manufacturing technologies, it also has the advantage of good compatibility with materials. Bioinspired micro-nano surfaces have been widely concerned in the industrial field and the academic circles due to their wide application background, such as self-cleaning, oil-water separation, and fog collection. This paper reviews the new progress in the preparation of biomimetic functional micro-nano structures by a femtosecond laser, and shows their properties in structural colors, surface wettability, optical performance regulation, and so on. The potential application prospects of the femtosecond laser preparation of biomimetic functional surfaces in present and future are discussed. Conclusion and Prospect Due to the limitation of the length of this article, other excellent femtosecond laser fabrication of bionic micro-nano functional structures and their applications cannot be introduced in detail. The femtosecond laser direct writing technology can be used to simulate and fabricate the surface micro-nano structures of lotus leaves, nepenthes plants, rice leaves, butterfly wings, and gecko fingerprints. These structures include micro-pores, micro-columns, periodic structures, and self-assembled structures. The microstructures can realize self-cleaning, anti-ice, oil-water separation, bubble manipulation, structure colors, fog collection, underwater bubble collection, droplet transport, shock resistance, adhesion, and other functions. In this paper, the applications of femtosecond laser direct writing to fabricate bionic functional micro-nano structures in structural colors, superhydrophobicity, and optical performance control are reviewed. The biological surface micro-nano structures have provided infinite inspiration for researchers and stimulated a large number of excellent works on the ultra-fast laser fabrication of bionic functional surfaces. However, there are still some problems, such as how to quickly and efficiently simulate complex natural surfaces and how to accurately reproduce cross-scale micro-nano structures. There is no doubt that the solution of these problems will further enhance the competitiveness of the femtosecond laser fabrication of bionic functional micro-nano structures. It is believed that with the improvement of femtosecond laser micro-nano manufacturing capability and the continuous new inspiration brought to us by nature, the bionic multi-functional surfaces should create more application value in biological, medical, environmental protection, and other fields in future. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the new application of the laser micro-nano fabrication of complex high-resolution structures.","Cao, Jiaji;Xiu, Siyu;Xu, Jinkai;Yu, Huadong",Journal,Zhongguo Jiguang/Chinese Journal of Lasers,2022-05-25,Changchun University of Science and Technology,bioinspired structure ;  femtosecond laser ;  functional surface ;  laser technique ;  micro-nano structure
Micro-Nano 3D Printing Based on Photopolymerization and Its Development Status and Trends,"Significance As a micro-nano additive manufacturing (AM) technology, micro-nano 3D printing based on photopolymerization has significant advantages in the manufacture of high-precision and complex micro-nanostructures. Traditional AM technology is essential in printing macroscale structures. However, its printing accuracy is limited, and the difficulty of meeting the demanding requirements for printing accuracy in many micro-nano manufacturing fields has grown tremendously. For example, the printing accuracy of microfluidic chips in the biological field is on a microscale. In micro-nano optics, the period of photonic crystals requires printing accuracy to reach hundreds of nanometers. Additionally, 3D printing technology can manufacture high-precision and complex three-dimensional structures and has huge industrial application needs in micro-nano electromechanical systems, micro-nano photonic devices, micro-fluidic devices, biomedicine and tissue engineering, and new materials. Thus, research on micro-nano 3D printing technology has received widespread attention. Progress Recently, researchers have developed various types of micro-nano 3D printing technologies suitable for several materials (organic polymers, metals, glass, ceramics, biological materials, composite materials, etc.). Micro-stereolithography (single-photon absorption) and two-photon polymerization using photopolymerization are the most representative micro-nano-scale 3D printing technologies. Micro-nano 3D printing technology based on photopolymerization uses the continuous, pulsed laser or LED light as its energy source. The photopolymerization reaction process is controlled at the micro-nano scale to print and manufacture the micro-nano 3D structure. First, the optical micro-nano resolution of 3D printing mainly depends on the diffraction limit of the optical system, such as the Rayleigh criterion 0. 61 X/NA, where A and NA are the wavelength of the light source and numerical aperture of the imaging system, respectively. Sub-micron resolution can be obtained using a light source with a shorter wavelength, such as the UV beam, and an objective lens with a higher NA. Additionally, the lithography resolution, which is far beyond the optical diffraction limit (below 100 nm) can be achieved using ultra-fast femtosecond pulse lasers to excite the nonlinear response of the material, such as two-photon or multiphoton absorption effect. Finally, most of the micro-nano 3D printing optical systems are sets of micro-imaging systems, and the lithography resolution is improved using the latest and frontier super-resolution micro-imaging technology. For example, by introducing super-resolution microscopy, stimulated emission depletion ( STED ), two-color non-degenerate two-photon absorption (ND-TPA), and other technologies, the lithography resolution can be increased to less than 10 nm. Currently, micro-nano 3D printing is one of the most frontier advanced manufacturing fields in the world. In 2014, micro-nano 3D printing was listed in the top 10 disruptive innovations of the year by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Technology Review. With the rapid improvement of prototyping technology for printing accuracy, efficiency, and other performance requirements, plane projection 3D printing has developed rapidly recently. Compared with traditional micro stereolithography, plane projection 3D printing has advantages including accuracy, efficiency, and equipment cost-efficiency. In 2015, researchers from Carbon 3D and the University of North Carolina proposed a layer scanning-based manufacturing method, known as the continuous liquid interface production (CLIP), which increased the printing rate by about 100 times. Recently, the most disruptive and transformative ultra-high-precision surface projection stereolithography (PfiSL) and femtosecond projection two-photon lithography (FP-TPL) technologies have been undergoing rapid development. These technologies can break through the inherent contradiction between the printing precision and size and can achieve high-precision, high-efficiency, large-size, and low-cost manufacturing. Conclusions and Prospect This paper present an up-to-date review of the development history, trends, and latest research progress in high-resolution, large-scale micro-nano 3D printing technology, achieved by different photochemical principles and optical methods. The rapid development of micro-nano 3D printing technology has completely changed the manufacturing of arbitrarily designable 3D structures from macro- to microscale. Projecting 3D printing has become the most important and rapidly developing micro-nano 3D printing method due to its performance and cost-effectiveness. We systematically reviewed different principles of optical 3D printing technology, from one-photon absorption, two-photon absorption, super-resolution imaging-assisted one/two-photon absorption principle. Furthermore, we reviewed the performance of different optical 3D printing systems, from single-focus serial scanning, multi-focus parallel scanning, surface projection, layer scanning, and volume manufacturing. We focused on the contradiction between print throughput and print resolution. Additionally, we discussed specific challenges in manufacturing structures with sub-diffraction limit feature size and large-scale area. The projection of 3D printing technology has been continuously developed and improved through the combination of advanced microscope imaging methods, such as STED, light-sheet imaging, random access scanning, and computed tomography. These methods have been successfully applied to various 3D printing systems, effectively improving the demand for high-resolution printing of macroscale 3D structures. Finally, some new and innovative methods in the field of optics are the main driving force for developing of micro-nano 3D printing. The photopolymerization micro-nano 3D printing technology will become an essential technique in laser precision micromachining in the future, and promote the development of intelligent manufacturing by leaps and bounds.","Zhao, Yuanyuan;Luo, Haichao;Liang, Zixin;Deng, Mingjie;Duan, Xuanming",Journal,Zhongguo Jiguang/Chinese Journal of Lasers,2022-05-25,Jinan University,3D printing ;  laser technique ;  optical micro-fabrication ;  printing efficiency ;  resolution ;  stereolithography ;  two-photon polymerization fabrication

Design Research on Gas Turbine Casing based on QFD and TRIZ,"The theories of quality function deployment (QFD) and inventive problem solving (TRIZ) have been widely used in the engineering field, but they have their own shortcomings in solving engineering problems. The integrated model of QFD and TRIZ is used in this study to make the two methods complement each other and help the engineers to find key problems quickly and solve them efficiently, which provides new idea for the technological innovation. This study takes the improved scheme design of the gas turbine casing as a case and designs an asymmetric structural casing assembly scheme through the stages of demand analysis, building a house of quality(HOQ), contradiction analysis and program output.The key technical parameters that need to be improved can be verified by the integrated model of QFD and TRIZ theories, which provides inspired solutions for the contradiction problems that are difficult to be resolved.","Jin, Xiao;Li, Miao;Liu, Xun;Ming, Xin Guo",Journal,Reneng Dongli Gongcheng/Journal of Engineering for Thermal Energy and Power,2022-05-20,Harbin No. 703 Research Institute;Shanghai Jiao Tong University;South China University of Technology,Design demands ;  Gas turbine casing ;  QFD ;  TRIZ
"Waterlogging mitigation and safe water supply: lessons learnt from low-lying areas of Basirhat municipality, India","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a replicable model that ensures Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage as well as water treatment facilities at the community level by providing total service coverage at community scale. An intervention was implemented in one of the low-lying areas of Basirhat Municipality (West Bengal, India) that included a number of action programs in order to address household- and community-level water-induced challenges. Design/methodology/approach: A research study was undertaken to identify the root causes of the problems that are generally spawned from geomorphological, hydro-fluvial, climatic factors and processes and the situation becomes complicated when many other cumulative problem-contexts layovers the existing ones. A number of social and technological innovations were tested in the field and this paper critically examined the intervention processes and outcomes. It was implemented through participatory process by involving related stakeholders working at that scale so that necessary public acceptance is received for scaling up, at least, in the similar physical, social, economic and institutional contexts. Findings: The problem conceptualization process, spatial assessment for contextualizing the problem, design of interventions for different scales, development of project deployment strategies from field-based learnings contributed in developing a total solution based on fusing of household-level technical solutions, social innovations and actions for community engagements towards sustainability. Mobilized community members in addressing local inundation and waterlogging crisis. Satellite image-based maps shown to make them understand the upper-lower connection of drainage. People also developed their own action plans and engaged themselves in resuscitation of an old canal, removed the garbage that resulted in improved drainage conditions in the area. Research limitations/implications: Pandemic due to COVID 19 and its related prolonged lock down, West Bengal State Assembly Election, closure of municipal governance system due to the forthcoming municipal election, closure of educational institutions, closure of Anganwadi Centre in the field area were the limitations. Due to the lock down, it was difficult for the team to maintain the time frame as well as the budget. As per the Election’s Code of Conduct gets released no public meeting was allowed without permission, people in the vicinity became suspicious, hence movement of the team members got restricted. Practical implications: Due to the COVID protocols, the team could not organise mass training programs. It was difficult for the team members to commute in public/private transport, hence filed work got impacted. As the team could not access data from the health department, they developed a strategy of generation data on body mass index, mid-upper arm circumferences and waist-to-hip ratios to understand the status of health and nutrition of the community. It was difficult to access the Public Health Engineering Department’s laboratory situated in the municipality for water sample test. Cost escalated due to extension of the project time. Social implications: During the second phase (wave) when people lost access to health facilities they requested the team to stop field visit. Women’s empowerment through acquiring knowledge and skill on treatment and safe storage of drinking water at home. Men appreciated and recognized this, which improved the status of women in the society. Children after expressing their willingness to learn the new technology of water purification were given handholding training by their mothers and knowledge transfer has taken place in the next generation. Mobilized community members in addressing local inundation and waterlogging crisis. Satellite image-based maps to understand the upper-lower connection of drainage helped them develop their own action plans and engaged themselves in resuscitation of an old canal, removed the garbage that resulted in improved drainage conditions in the area. Originality/value: Household-level solutions include supply of low cost, easy operable, sustainable water purifiers, community-level solution focused on securing water-related challenges at social/public gathering places and wider catchment area level solutions include the engagement of local communities to drain out stagnant waters by clearing drains, creating/digging small canals through collective actions. Geo-spatial techniques (topographical mapping, spatial survey, water quality tests) along with social methods such as participatory appraisals for gathering information on human health, public awareness campaigns and partnership development with local government agencies were the major activities performed as part of the implementation of interventions. It is imperative to mention that water-related challenges in the low-lying settlement areas of Basirhat Municipality have effectively been addressed by relying on necessary theoretical underpinnings (Disaster risk reduction/humanitarian principles) transmitted through application of scientific techniques and mediated through local people and their agencies.","Dey, Aniruddha;Islam, Sheikh Tawhidul;Paul, Biplabketan;Bandyopadhyay, Swarnabha;Sengupta, Piu;Sanyal, Nandini;Mondal, Krishna Prosad;Jubaer, Al;Mitra, Rangeet",Journal,International Journal of Disaster Resilience in the Built Environment,2022-05-20,Jahangirnagar University;Science Connect Ltd;Professional Institute for Development and Socio Environmental Management – PRISM;Professional Institute for Development and Socio Environmental Management – Professional Institute for Development and Socio Environmental Management – PRISM;Naireeta Services Pvt.

Hacking or Engineering? Towards an Extended Entrepreneurial Software Engineering Model,"Startups play a key role in software-based innovation. They make an important contribution to an economy's ability to compete and innovate, and their importance will continue to grow due to increasing digitalization. However, the success of a startup depends primarily on market needs and the ability to develop a solution that is attractive enough for customers to choose. A sophisticated technical solution is usually not critical, especially in the early stages of a startup. It is not necessary to be an experienced software engineer to start a software startup. However, this can become problematic as the solution matures and software complexity increases. Based on a proposed solution for systematic software development for early-stage startups, in this paper, we present the key findings of a survey study to identify the methodological and technical priorities of software startups. Among other things, we found that requirements engineering and architecture pose challenges for startups. In addition, we found evidence that startups' software development approaches do not tend to change over time. An early investment in a more scalable development approach could help avoid long-term software problems. To support such an investment, we propose an extended model for Entrepreneurial Software Engineering that provides a foundation for future research.","Kuhrmann, Marco;Muench, Juergen;Klunder, Jil",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-05-19,Hochschule Reutlingen;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover,hybrid development method ;  Software development in startups ;  software process
The role of IT-based technologies on the management of human resources in the COVID-19 era,"Purpose: The current pandemic will introduce many novel policies, adaptations, innovations and procedures by innovative human resource (HR) creativity. In particular, information technology (IT) implementation is a field that needs more significant focus and a wider range of creative interventions. The author would undoubtedly see a more human-focused approach to HR management (HRM) in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) era, where enterprises and workers have had to reinvent themselves in a brief amount of time drastically. Following the nationwide lockdown caused by COVID-19, many companies were pushed to opt for remote working, which presents both difficulties and benefits for workers and employers. So the purpose of this study is to investigate some key consequences resulting from COVID-19’s effect on multiple HRM roles, how technology is empowering and fostering HRM, informative forecasts based on how organizations are coping and finally, the path in the post-pandemic environment. Design/methodology/approach: The COVID-19 epidemic has had a significant effect on every area of the global economy. It has had severe implications for public institutions and raises particular questions for medical schools. The emergence of COVID-19 has disrupted many activities and requires intense and prompt attention from medical educators. So, HR leaders now face the difficult task of managing the interests of workers and their corporations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has proved that this is not just a difficult time but rather a testing time for companies across the globe to check and ensure how swiftly they adapt themselves by thinking and planning differently. An enterprise evolves with nature, and change is unavoidable if performance and productivity are to improve. Changes in structure, technology and priorities are overgrowing, posing big obstacles to leaders. Corporations worldwide have looked to technology to pursue creative solutions to some of the world’s most pressing problems. This study provides a review of articles related to the role of technology in HRM in the COVID-19 period. The analyzed articles are divided into three groups, including articles related to the role of information communication technology, cloud computing and teleworking in HRM in the COVID-19 era. Also, the most important key challenges are collected, and solutions are provided for them. Findings: In times of trouble, authentic leadership shines through. The actions of pioneering HR leaders throughout the COVID-19 epidemic will significantly affect their respective organizations. When COVID-19 expanded around the world, HR agencies made their workers’ health and welfare a top priority. HRM’s long-term sustainability can be dictated by how they deal with the current crisis. Web-based solutions, such as cloud computing, will also address a vital resource allocation gap. It illustrates the possible efficacy of patient-oriented, web-based applications built on result-driven design, which continues to be validated by more testing and assessment. Many studies have emphasized business innovation as a necessity due to changes in the environment and various challenges and requirements facing businesses. The challenge of observing social distance and limiting face-to-face business services is the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic era. Research limitations/implications: This study could entail a joint international collaboration initiative among research centers, allowing information about COVID-19 impacts to be shared more easily. It will favor a worldwide policy to find a response to the epidemic but still address cultural and social issues. Practical implications: The survey concludes that, whenever possible, employers and medicals should explore remote working opportunities in all industries to alleviate uncertainty and improve employee psychological well-being. The facilitating considerations and problems are often addressed in order to supply practical views for developing cloud-based solutions. Originality/value: This research aims to lead to the advancement of scientific knowledge in the HRM area through the use of IT-based technology. It allows businesses to reinvent HRM techniques to save money and maximize efficiency without compromising their employees’ life quality and well-being. More in-depth studies at various pandemic stages would yield more valuable insights into HRM’s emerging position.","Vahdat, Sahar",Journal,Kybernetes,2022-05-17,"Isfahan Kidney Diseases Research Center, Isfahan UMS",Cloud computing ;  COVID-19 ;  Human resources management ;  Information technology ;  Teleworking

"Orderly ""symbiotic enrichment"" of conventional & unconventional oil and gas -discussion on theory and technology of conventional & unconventional petroleum geology","The development of petroleum industry presents a new situation of marching into deep stratum, deep sea and unconventional, highlighting natural gas field and valuing the geological engineering integration. The research of geology discipline presents a new trend of parallel development of conventional & unconventional petroleum geology and overall research of conventional & unconventional oil and gas integration in superbasins. In the future, oil and gas will still be the key demand for energy consumption and security, and the integration and innovation of conventional & unconventional petroleum geology will be the main challenge of discipline development. The emergence of conventional & unconventional petroleum geology is mainly due to the needs of reconstructing the theoretical framework of petroleum geology, reunderstanding the superbasin resource system, redeveloping applicable key technologies, reshaping the strategic role of energy transformation, and rerecording the exploration and development demonstration template. Conventional & unconventional petroleum geology is a geological discipline that studies the formation mechanism, orderly symbiosis, differential enrichment, recovery law and development strategy of conventional oil and gas reservoirs and unconventional oil and gas areas in the ""symbiotic enrichment"" basin, such as Ordos, Sichuan and other superbasins. It pays attention to the two resources of conventional oil and gas and unconventional oil and gas, and focuses on the evaluation of the characteristics and matching relationship of ""source rock, reservoir, oil bearing, mobility, recoverability and economy"" around the main source rock strata. Innovative research and development of core technologies such as source rock control theory and assessment of source reservoir symbiosis system, physical and numerical simulation of conventional & unconventional symbiotic accumulation basin, integrated evaluation of geological engineering and platform ""industrialized"" production mode. The research core is ""overall discovery, limit exploitation and coordinated development of conventional & unconventional oil and gas"". Conventional oil and gas and unconventional oil and gas are orderly ""symbiotic enrichment"", ""symbiosis"" is an objective natural law, ""enrichment"" is subjective cognition.Because objective laws can be recognized subjectively, through orderly coordination of the unity of objective and subjective, and advanced innovation and research and development of theories and technologies, the potential and value of the remaining resources can be better explored.The facts that from conventional trap oil and gas to unconventional continuous oil and gas, and then to conventional & unconventional orderly ""symbiotic accumulation"" oil and gas, show that innovative development of theoretical understanding and core technologies will lead and support the continuous realization of efficient discovery and utilization of oil and gas resources.","Yang, Zhi;Zou, Caineng",Journal,Dizhi Xuebao/Acta Geologica Sinica,2022-05-15,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development,Carbon neutrality ;  Conventional and unconventional petroleum geology ;  Coordinated development ;  Orderly accumulation ;  Shale oil & gas ;  Sweetarea and section ;  Symbiotic accumulation

Urban Agglomeration and Firm Innovation: Evidence from Asia,"This paper examines the relationship between urban agglomeration and firm innovation using a recently developed dataset that consistently measures city boundaries across Asia together with geo-referenced firm-level data. It finds that the spatial distribution of innovation by firms is highly concentrated within countries. Further, firms in larger cities have substantially higher propensities to introduce product and process innovations and to undertake R&D activities, a result that holds for subgroups of countries and even when the largest cities are excluded from the analysis. Finally, the presence of high-quality universities and highly ranked engineering departments in cities is positively associated with firm innovation, lending support to the idea that the accumulation of human capital locally is a key channel through which urban agglomeration affects innovation.","Chen, Liming;Hasan, Rana;Jiang, Yi",Journal,World Bank Economic Review,2022-05-01,Asian Development Bank Philippines;ADB,agglomeration economies ;  firm innovation ;  knowledge spillovers ;  R&D

Thinking and Reconstitution of Practical Teaching Mode in Universities under Post-Epidemic Era,"Practical teaching in university is vital to develop students' abilities of engineering thinking and innovation consciousness. Taking the light chemical engineering of Shaanxi University of Science and Technology as an example, the characteristics of the practical teaching mode in universities under the post-epidemic era were analyzed in this paper. Many key issues such as the matching of the practical teaching concept with the requirements of the new situation and the connection between the multiple links of the practical teaching system were put forward. Combined with the professional certification standards of engineering education and the concept of new engineering construction, three major models had been formed, including the ""strong + weak"" practice link classification training system, the online and offline mixed practice teaching concept, and the intelligent practice teaching platform. Through the research and practice of practical teaching models in universities under the post-epidemic era, the aim of this work was to train the model for engineering education professional certification and a practical teaching system that met the requirements of new engineering disciplines, and develop excellent engineering talents with the abilities of diversification and innovation.","Wang, Wenliang;Luo, Qing;Li, Xinping;You, Xiangyu;Xue, Bailiang",Trade Journal,Chung-kuo Tsao Chih/China Pulp and Paper,2022-05-01,Shaanxi University of Science and Technology,Engineering education professional certification ;  Light chemical engineering ;  New engineering education ;  Post-epidemic era ;  Practical teaching
Implementation of Integrative Projects as a Contribution to the Major Design Experience in Chemical Engineering,"The training of chemical engineers requires creating dynamics that bring them closer to the reality of professional practice and providing active learning experiences to develop skills that strengthen critical thinking, autonomy, teamwork, and communication, as a contribution to sustainable engineering education. However, these experiences are isolated, and sometimes do not show an integrated vision between different areas of knowledge. This work aims to introduce the lessons learned by creating capstone integrative projects as tools for the design and control of processes in the Faculty of Chemical Engineering of the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana. The capstone project was developed in randomly selected groups to develop a basic engineering proposal for an industrial process of local or national interest. Validation was carried out, consisting of surveys of 54 students in the last year of the program, an opinion query of 60 recent graduates, and a focus group of five graduates, with a profile of employers, management of innovation, development, and design of chemical processes. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 43 processes were evaluated with students, evidencing a significant improvement in the skills defined by the faculty in the graduation profile. A total of 94% of the graduates in that period recognize the capstone project as an integrator of design and process control, and it is concluded that this contributes positively to the professional development of the chemical engineer.","Ocampo-López, Carlos;Castrillón-Hernández, Fabio;Alzate-Gil, Hader",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-05-01,Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana,ABET ;  capstone projects in engineering education ;  engineering competencies ;  learning experience ;  research projects in chemical engineering ;  sustainable engineering education
Recent Advancement in Assessment and Control of Structures under Multi-Hazard,"This review presents an up-to-date account of research in multi-hazard assessment and vibration control of engineering structures. A general discussion of the importance of multi-hazard consideration in structural engineering, as well as recent advances in this area, is presented as a background. In terms of performance assessment and vibration control, various hazards are considered with an emphasis on seismic and wind loads. Although multi-hazard problems in civil engineering structures are generally discussed to some extent, the emphasis is placed on buildings, bridges, and wind turbine towers. The scientific literature in this area is vast with rapidly growing innovations. The literature is, therefore, classified by the structure type, and then, subsequently, by the hazard. Main contributions and conclusions from the reported studies are presented in summarized tables intended to provide readers with a quick reference and convenient navigation to related publications for further research.

Evolution of optical wireless communication for B5G/6G,"The research on optical wireless communication (OWC) has been going on for more than two decades. Particularly, visible light communication (VLC), as a means of OWC combining communication with illumination, has been regarded as a promising indoor high-speed wireless approach for short-distance access. Recently, lightwave, millimeter-wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz) and other spectrum mediums are considered as potential candidates for beyond fifth-generation/sixth-generation (B5G/6G) mobile communication networks. On the basis of previous studies, this review focuses on revealing how the research of next-generation OWC technology should be carried out to meet the requirements of B5G/6G for practical deployment. The research, development and engineering transformation of the OWC systems are a paragon of interdisciplinary. It involves a wide discussion on how to build a high-speed, multi-user, full-duplex, white-light OWC system based on existing technologies by showing the innovations and trade-offs at various levels with material, device, air-interface technology, system and network architecture. The compatibility of OWC is emphasized and some advanced heterogeneous OWC systems are presented, which involves the combination or integration of various functions such as sensing, near-infrared (NIR) beam-steering, positioning and coexistence with radio frequency (RF) communication. Finally, several potential directions are pointed out for the actual engineering deployment in the B5G/6G era.","Wei, Zixian;Wang, Zhaoming;Zhang, Jianan;Li, Qian;Zhang, Junping;Fu, H.

Locating Chart Choice Based on the Decision-Making Approach,"Modern manufacturing engineering requires quick and reasonable solutions during the production planning stage, ensuring production efficiency and cost reduction. This research aims to create a scientific approach to the rational choice of a locating chart for complexly shaped parts. It is an important stage during the manufacturing technology and fixture design process. The systematization of the designed and technological features of complexly shaped parts and the definition of the features that impact a locating chart create the fundamentals for justification. A scientific approach has been developed using the complex combination of the part’s features and a decision-making approach using the example of bracket-type parts. The matrix of design and technological features of parts was developed including steel AISI 3135 and cast iron DIN 1691. The classification of locating charts for bracket-type parts was defined. A mathematical model of the rational choice of the locating chart according to the structural code of the workpiece was verified in case studies from the practice. As a result, a decision-making approach was applied to the rational choice of the locating chart for any bracket-type part. The proposed solutions improve the production planning stage for machine building, automotive, and other industries.","Ivanov, Vitalii;Botko, Frantisek;Kolos, Vitalii;Pavlenko, Ivan;Hatala, Michal;Antosz, Katarzyna;Trojanowska, Justyna",Journal,Materials,2022-05-01,Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Conductive Bridge Random Access Memory (CBRAM): Challenges and Opportunities for Memory and Neuromorphic Computing Applications,"Due to a rapid increase in the amount of data, there is a huge demand for the development of new memory technologies as well as emerging computing systems for high-density memory storage and efficient computing. As the conventional transistor-based storage devices and computing systems are approaching their scaling and technical limits, extensive research on emerging technologies is becoming more and more important. Among other emerging technologies, CBRAM offers excellent opportunities for future memory and neuromorphic computing applications. The principles of the CBRAM are explored in depth in this review, including the materials and issues associated with various materials, as well as the basic switching mechanisms. Furthermore, the opportunities that CBRAMs provide for memory and brain-inspired neuromorphic computing applications, as well as the challenges that CBRAMs confront in those applications, are thoroughly discussed. The emulation of biological synapses and neurons using CBRAM devices fabricated with various switching materials and device engineering and material innovation approaches are examined in depth.","Abbas, Haider;Li, Jiayi;Ang, Diing Shenp",Journal,Micromachines,2022-05-01,School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering,artificial neurons ;  artificial synapses ;  CBRAM ;  emerging memory technologies ;  memristor ;  neuromorphic computing ;  RRAM
Integrating the Entrepreneurial Mindset into the Engineering Classroom,"Contribution: This article highlights one approach to fostering the entrepreneurial mindset in the engineering classroom. Background: Entrepreneurship and innovation are currently trending topics in engineering education and will continue developing for the foreseeable future. Intended Outcomes: The guiding research question is: how can an entrepreneurial mindset focused learning experience improve student self-regulation, seeing value, and lifelong learning through metacognitive reflections? Application Design: The study is implemented within a five-week module focused on developing the entrepreneurial mindset as part of a required course on supply chain management technology. The supporting pedagogical interventions include authentic learning, information literacy, a mix of low stakes and high stakes assessment, and parallel scaffold and collaborative learning. The module is assessed through a metacognitive reflection centered around self-regulated learning, seeing value, and lifelong learning. Findings: First, the metacognitive reflections showed 50% of participants would approach their work differently (e.g., make changes to management and scheduling, using credible sources, obtaining writing assistance through the university writing lab). Second, participants were able to articulate soft skill development and/or subject matter expertise as benefits as it relates to entering the workforce. Third, participants were able to express opportunities for extending their knowledge in the future.","Bosman, L.

The Dutch Flood Protection Programme: Taking Innovations to the Next Level,"The Dutch regional water authorities face an enormous task: the strengthening of about 1500 km of dikes and 500 civil-engineering structures before 2050. This immense operation is being funded, prioritised and supported by the Dutch Flood Protection Programme (DFPP), an alliance of regional water authorities and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. The work will be executed in nearly 300 projects located throughout the country on the coast, lakes and major rivers. To complete this task on time and within budget, innovation (a better insight into the behaviour of flood defences, new techniques and processes) is believed to be the way forward. In this paper, we look at how the DFPP has encouraged innovations between 2012 and the present. We stress the importance of using a sender–receiver approach to further knowledge transfer and uptake, and we describe how, by using an action research approach, the Dutch Flood Protection Programme is currently adapting its innovation strategy on the basis of lessons learned to improve knowledge uptake. We will address some of the innovations that have been developed over the years and how monitoring knowledge uptake helps to further improve the learning-by-doing approach.","Tromp, Ellen;Te Nijenhuis, Anouk;Knoeff, Han",Journal,Water (Switzerland),2022-05-01,Deltares;Dutch Flood Protection Programme,dikes ;  flood decision-making ;  flood risk management ;  innovations ;  knowledge uptake
Sustainable Transport and Mobility—Oriented Innovative Startups and Business Models,"Sustainability-oriented transport and mobility solutions hunt for engineering and management innovations. Both are primarily adopted by startups—ambitious and dynamic forms of organization stimulated by technical and technological progress. In this paper, the original definition of a startup as the new organizational form has been proposed, and the most relevant trends in green transportation and mobility solutions have been discussed. The paper also seeks knowledge about new business models of sustainable transport and mobility-oriented innovative startups. For this purpose, descriptive statistics of about 200 transport-oriented startups have been produced, based on the results of quantitative research in 2016–2019 in Poland, and the most appealing solutions are presented. Business models of sustainability-oriented transport and mobility startups have been mapped and analyzed. Green innovations in transport concern mainly products and business models. The studied startups can be divided into responding to challenges in designing new equip-ment, vehicles, and infrastructure (including electromobility) and those offering solutions in managing transport processes, fleet, and passenger transport—especially micro-mobility in cities public transport. Analyzing the profitability of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-oriented startups, we concluded that startups related to “hardware” projects (vehicles, infrastructures, drones) need more financial support or strategic partnership than service-oriented projects. We also hypothesized that “hardware” startups contribute more to “greening” transportation and mobility sector processes than startups offering services, which requires further in-depth research.","Skala, Agnieszka",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-05-01,Politechnika Warszawska,business model ;  innovation ;  startup ;  sustainability ;  transport
"Complex interlinkages, key objectives, and nexuses among the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change: a network analysis","Background: Global sustainability is an enmeshed system of complex socioeconomic, climatological, and ecological interactions. The numerous objectives of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement have various levels of interdependence, making it difficult to ascertain the influence of changes to particular indicators across the whole system. In this analysis, we aimed to detect and rank the complex interlinkages between objectives of sustainability agendas. Methods: We developed a method to find interlinkages among the 17 SDGs and climate change, including non-linear and non-monotonic dependences. We used time series of indicators defined by the World Bank, consisting of 400 indicators that measure progress towards the 17 SDGs and an 18th variable (annual average temperatures), representing progress in the response to the climate crisis, from 2000 to 2019. This method detects significant dependencies among the time evolution of the objectives by using partial distance correlations, a non-linear measure of conditional dependence that also discounts spurious correlations originating from lurking variables. We then used a network representation to identify the most important objectives (using network centrality) and to obtain nexuses of objectives (defined as highly interconnected clusters in the network). Findings: Using temporal data from 181 countries spanning 20 years, we analysed dependencies among SDGs and climate for 35 country groupings based on region, development, and income level. The observed significant interlinkages, central objectives, and nexuses identified varied greatly across country groupings; however, SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) and climate change ranked as highly important across many country groupings. Temperature rise was strongly linked to urbanisation, air pollution, and slum expansion (SDG 11), especially in country groupings likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown, such as Africa. In several country groupings composed of developing nations, we observed a consistent nexus of strongly interconnected objectives formed by SDG 1 (poverty reduction), SDG 4 (education), and SDG 8 (economic growth), sometimes incorporating SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG 16 (peace and justice). Interpretation: The differences across groupings emphasise the need to define goals in accordance with local circumstances and priorities. Our analysis highlights global partnerships (SDG 17) as a pivot in global sustainability efforts, which have been strongly linked to economic growth (SDG 8). However, if economic growth and trade expansion were repositioned as a means instead of an end goal of development, our analysis showed that education (SDG 4) and poverty reduction (SDG 1) become more central, thus suggesting that these could be prioritised in global partnerships. Urban livelihoods (SDG 11) were also flagged as important to avoid replicating unsustainable patterns of the past.

"Progress of Methylation of C6-8~Arene with Methanol: Mechanism, Catalysts, Kinetic/Thermodynamics and Perspectives","High-efficiency production of xylene/trimethylbenzene from benzene/toluene with methanol is a potential way to promote the implementation on the coupled cycle development strategy of petrochemical and coal chemical industry and optimize the resource structure. At the same time, relying on the innovation of catalytic new materials, physical chemistry, intelligent capture technol-ogy, process engineering, and other principles and methods, p-xylene (PX) and trimethylbenzene (TMB) with higher added value were prepared by C6-8~arene methylation, which could elevate the level of methylation field and improve the competitiveness of the industry. This paper focuses on the one-step methylation reaction of benzene with methanol or toluene with methanol to obtain high-purity p-xylene (BM-PX/TM-PX), and the one-step methylation reaction of xylene with methanol to obtain mesitylene (XM-TMB). The methylation reaction mechanism and the preparation strategy of a high-performance catalyst were reviewed. The high selectivity of PX obtained by pre-cisely controlling the pore size and acid site distribution of zeolites was emphasized. Meanwhile, the current research progress of TMB, the kinetic/thermodynamics of the BM-PX/TM-PX, and XM-TMB methylation reaction were described. Based on a literature research and the conclusion of our research group, the mechanism of methylation reaction process was expounded. Finally, the new research direction of catalysts used and reaction process in methylation reaction were prospected in order to guide the rapid development of this field.","Dong, Peng;Shao, Tingna;Zhao, Yu;Ji, Dong;Yang, Yong;Zhao, Xinhong;Li, Hongwei;Tian, Junying;Wang, Dongliang;Li, Guixian",Journal,Processes,2022-05-01,Lanzhou University of Technology;Key Laboratory of Low Carbon Energy and Chemical Engineering of Gansu Province,arene ;  catalyst ;  kinetics/thermodynamics ;  mechanism ;  methylation
A Challenge-Based Learning Intensive Course for Competency Development in Undergraduate Engineering Students: Case Study on UAVs,"Accelerated advances in science and technology drive the need for professionals with flexible problem-solving abilities towards a collaborative working environment. The advances pose a challenge to educational institutions about how to develop learning environments that contribute to meeting the aforementioned necessity. Additionally, the fast pace of technology and innovative knowledge are encouraging universities to employ challenge-based-learning (CBL) approaches in engineering education supported by modern technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other advanced electronic devices. Within the framework of competency-based education (CBE) and CBL are the design, implementation, and evaluation of an intensive 40 h elective course which includes a 5-day challenge to promote the development of disciplinary and transversal competencies in undergraduate engineering students whilst relying on UAVs as the medium where the teaching– learning process takes place. Within this credit course, a case study was carried out considering the framework of an exploratory mixed-methods educational research approach that sought a broad understanding of the studied phenomena using various data collection instruments with quantitative and qualitative characteristics. An innovative academic tool was introduced, namely a thematic UAV platform that systematically exposed students to the principles underlying robotic systems and the scientific method, thereby stimulating their intellectual curiosity as a trigger to solve the posed challenge. Moreover, students came up with innovative teamwork-based solutions to a designed challenge while having an enjoyable and motivating time flying drones on an indoor obstacle course arranged by themselves. The preliminary findings may contribute to the design of other CBL experiences, supported by technology applied for educational purposes, which could promote the development of more disciplinary and transversal competencies in future engineers.","Félix-Herrán, Luis C.;Izaguirre-Espinosa, Carlos;Parra-Vega, Vicente;Sánchez-Orta, Anand;Benitez, Victor H.;Lozoya-Santos, Jorge De J.",Journal,Electronics (Switzerland),2022-05-01,Universidad de Sonora;Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León;Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional;Tecnológico de Monterrey,challenge-based learning ;  educational innovation ;  educational robotics ;  higher education ;  I-week ;  intellectual curiosity ;  unmanned aerial vehicles
"Applications of Nanozymology in the Detection and Identification of Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens","Nanozymes are synthetic nanoparticulate materials that mimic the biological activities of enzymes by virtue of their surface chemistry. Enzymes catalyze biological reactions with a very high degree of specificity. Examples include the horseradish peroxidase, lactate, glucose, and cholesterol oxidases. For this reason, many industrial uses of enzymes outside their natural environments have been developed. Similar to enzymes, many industrial applications of nanozymes have been developed and used. Unlike the enzymes, however, nanozymes are cost-effectively prepared, purified, stored, and reproducibly and repeatedly used for long periods of time. The detection and identification of pathogens is among some of the reported applications of nanozymes. Three of the methodologic milestones in the evolution of pathogen detection and identification include the incubation and growth, immunoassays and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies. Although advances in the history of pathogen detection and identification have given rise to novel methods and devices, these are still short of the response speed, accuracy and cost required for point-of-care use. Debuting recently, nanozymology offers significant improvements in the six methodological indicators that are proposed as being key in this review, including simplicity, sensitivity, speed of response, cost, reliability, and durability of the immunoassays and PCR strategies. This review will focus on the applications of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens in samples obtained from foods, natural, and clinical sources. It will highlight the impact of nanozymes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent and PCR strategies by discussing the mechanistic improvements and the role of the design and architecture of the nanozyme nanoconjugates. Because of their contribution to world health burden, the three most important pathogens that will be considered include viruses, bacteria and fungi. Although not quite seen as pathogens, the review will also consider the detection of cancer cells and helminth parasites. The review leaves very little doubt that nanozymology has introduced remarkable advances in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and PCR strategies for detecting these five classes of pathogens. However, a gap still exists in the application of nanozymes to detect and identify fungal pathogens directly, although indirect strategies in which nanozymes are used have been reported. From a mechanistic point of view, the nanozyme technology transfer to laboratory research methods in PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies, and the point-of-care devices such as electronic biosensors and lateral flow detection strips, that is currently taking place, is most likely to give rise to no small revolution in each of the six methodological indicators for pathogen detection and identification. While the evidence of widespread research reports, clinical trials and point-of-care device patents support this view, the gaps that still exist point to a need for more basic research studies to be conducted on the applications of nanozymology in pathogen detection and identification. The multidisciplinary nature of the research on the application of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens requires chemists and physicists for the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanozymes; microbiologists for the design, testing and analysis of the methodologies, and clinicians or clinical researchers for the evaluation of the methodologies and devices in the clinic. Many reports have also implicated required skills in mathematical modelling, and electronic engineering. While the review will conclude with a synopsis of the impact of nanozymology on the detection and identification of viruses, bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and helminths, it will also point out opportunities that exist in basic research as well as opportunities for innovation aimed at novel laboratory methodologies and devices. In this regard there is no doubt that there are numerous unexplored research areas in the application of nanozymes for the detection of pathogens. For example, most research on the applications of nanozymes for the detection and identification of fungi is so far limited only to the detection of mycotoxins and other chemical compounds associated with fungal infection. Therefore, there is scope for exploration of the application of nanozymes in the direct detection of fungi in foods, especially in the agricultural production thereof. Many fungal species found in seeds severely compromise their use by inactivating the germination thereof. Fungi also produce mycotoxins that can severely compromise the health of humans if consumed.","Songca, Sandile Phinda",Journal,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2022-05-01,University of KwaZulu-Natal,bacterial ;  cancer cell ;  enzyme mimic ;  fungal ;  helminth ova ;  immunosorbent assay ;  nanozyme ;  pathogen detection ;  polymerase chain reaction ;  viral
The hidden face<sup>1</sup> of the value in eco-design tools <sup>2</sup>: Theoretical basis of an essential concept,"Since the end of the 20th century, the engineering field, like many other sectors, has been faced with society's new preoccupations. Eco-design strives to reduce the harmful effect of industrial production and mass consumption on the environment. It makes use of tools and methods which, besides being built on technical and scientific foundations, borrow a vocabulary from economics and management science (“cost-benefits”, “needs”, “stakeholders”, etc.) and puts a fundamental category -“value”-, back on the agenda. This research endeavors to show how these foundational concepts “contaminate” the tools colonized by an economical imaginary. Researchers' and scientists' attempts to modify or overturn the existing order come up against a blind spot: the definition of value in the engineering field and, more specifically in sustainable development, finds its theoretical origins in the political economics of the 18th century, more precisely in the neo-classical economy of the 19th century. Through a narrative review methodology, we first argue that eco-design have not broken away from the ideology of orthodox economics, where riches are reduced to a simple monetary expression, and the social and environmental consequences are evaluated in terms of cost/benefits in the light of a rational instrumentality. Then, to illustrate these propositions, we base our arguments on the analysis of three tools used to develop ideas of sustainable development/innovation: Life Cycle Assessment; the Value Mapping tool, and the Triple Layered Business Model Canvas.","Tyl, Benjamin;Gomez, Armelle",Journal,Sustainable Production and Consumption,2022-05-01,Université de Bordeaux;APESA,Eco-design ;  Eco-innovation ;  Engineering ;  Political economy ;  Value theory
Recent developments in nonferrous metals and related materials for biomedical applications in China: a review,"Abstract: Biomedical materials have received increasing attention in recent decades and have been used in medical applications to advance patient care, such as prosthetic implants, tissue repair and regeneration, drug delivery systems, pharmaceutical or biological therapy products, and sensitive diagnostic technologies. Among different types of biomedical materials, nonferrous metals and related materials (NMRMs) are important and attractive candidates. The updating of biomedical NMRMs and devices heavily relies on original research and application-oriented innovation. Here, we provide recent research findings and succinct insights into the developments in NMRMs for biomedical applications in China, including the use of titanium, magnesium, copper, zinc, cobalt, zirconium, hafnium, niobium, rhenium, tantalum, tungsten, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, their alloys and compounds, rare earths, high-entropy alloys, and liquid metals. Finally, the literature review concludes with several possible directions of NMRMs for new and future developments in biomedical engineering.

Model-augmented safe reinforcement learning for Volt-VAR control in power distribution networks,"Volt-VAR control (VVC) is a critical tool to manage voltage profiles and reactive power flow in power distribution networks by setting voltage regulating and reactive power compensation device status. To facilitate the adoption of VVC, many physical model-based and data-driven algorithms have been proposed. However, most of the physical model-based methods rely on distribution network parameters, whereas the data-driven algorithms lack safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose a data-driven safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for the VVC problem. We introduce three innovations to improve the learning efficiency and the safety. First, we train the RL agent using a learned environment model to improve the sample efficiency. Second, a safety layer is added to the policy neural network to enhance operational constraint satisfactions for both initial exploration phase and convergence phase. Finally, to improve the algorithm's performance when learning from limited data, we propose a novel mutual information regularization neural network for the safety layer. Simulation results on IEEE distribution test feeders show that the proposed algorithm improves constraint satisfactions compared to existing data-driven RL methods. With a modest amount of historical data, it is able to approximately maintain constraint satisfactions during the entire course of training. Asymptotically, it also yields similar level of performance of an ideal physical model-based benchmark. One possible limitation is that the proposed framework assumes a time-invariant distribution network topology and zero load transfer from other circuits. This is also an opportunity for future research.","Gao, Yuanqi;Yu, Nanpeng",Journal,Applied Energy,2022-05-01,Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering,Data-driven ;  Deep reinforcement learning ;  Pathwise derivative ;  Safe exploration ;  Volt-VAR control
Generation time of the alpha and delta SARS-CoV-2 variants: an epidemiological analysis,"Background: In May, 2021, the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant became dominant in the UK, superseded by the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in December, 2021. The delta variant is associated with increased transmissibility compared with the alpha variant, which was the dominant variant in the UK between December, 2020, and May, 2021. To understand transmission and the effectiveness of interventions, we aimed to investigate whether the delta variant generation time (the interval between infections in infector–infectee pairs) is shorter—ie, transmissions are happening more quickly—than that of the alpha variant. Methods: In this epidemiological analysis, we analysed transmission data from an ongoing UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) prospective household study. Households were recruited to the study after an index case had a positive PCR test and genomic sequencing was used to determine the variant responsible. By fitting a mathematical transmission model to the data, we estimated the intrinsic generation time (which assumes a constant supply of susceptible individuals throughout infection) and the household generation time (which reflects realised transmission in the study households, accounting for susceptible depletion) for the alpha and delta variants. Findings: Between February and August, 2021, 227 households consisting of 559 participants were recruited to the UKHSA study. The alpha variant was detected or assumed to be responsible for infections in 131 households (243 infections in 334 participants) recruited in February–May, and the delta variant in 96 households (174 infections in 225 participants) in May–August. The mean intrinsic generation time was shorter for the delta variant (4·7 days, 95% credible interval [CI] 4·1–5·6) than the alpha variant (5·5 days, 4·7–6·5), with 92% posterior probability. The mean household generation time was 28% (95% CI 0–48%) shorter for the delta variant (3·2 days, 95% CI 2·5–4·2) than the alpha variant (4·5 days, 3·7–5·4), with 97·5% posterior probability. Interpretation: The delta variant transmits more quickly in households than the alpha variant, which can be attributed to faster depletion of susceptible individuals in households and a possible decrease in the intrinsic generation time. Interventions such as contact tracing, testing, and isolation might be less effective if transmission of the virus occurs quickly.

Innovation of engineering teaching methods based on multimedia assisted technology,"Presently, computer network technology and application have penetrated all fields of society, particularly towards advanced primary education in Chinese universities and engineering colleges. They are hardly used to improve the standard of advanced teaching using multimedia assistive instruction. This paper examines the teaching mode of physical education based on Advanced Multimedia Technology (AMT) for Teaching Evaluation in engineering education to improve the current standard of education. Education in physical activity has a distinct advantage in terms of its instructional role and services in the network environment, which offers a functional training atmosphere for the learners. According to a questionnaire survey, the students said the impact of digital teaching became substantially higher than the conventional teaching in physical education and hence agree that computer-aided instruction would increase learning interest than traditional mode. Instantly, the difficulties of physical education teaching provide some suggestions based on the student evaluation of teaching in multimedia-assisted technology, which has become a successful approach to evaluating teaching faculties. The experimental research indicates that the suggested methods can precisely classify student evaluation tasks. Mutual trust and cooperation between teachers and students are strengthened by the implementation of multimedia-assisted teaching and other techniques with a positive impact, and the practical capacity of students is greatly improved.","Fu, Jianping",Journal,Computers and Electrical Engineering,2022-05-01,Central South University,Artificial Intelligence ;  Computer network ;  Multimedia ;  Smart class ;  Teaching method ;  Wisdom network
"Spatial division of labor, specialization of green technology innovation process and urban coordinated green development: Evidence from China","A theoretical framework is helpful to solve the problem of how to realize green coordinated development of urban in developing countries under the background of uneven distribution of green technology innovation resources. Adhering to the Confucian thought of ""not afraid of scarcity, only afraid of uneven distribution"", this paper constructs a theoretical framework of urban green coordinated development under the division of labor in urban green technology innovation on the basis of China's reform experience and space science, and empirically tests the impact of urban green technology innovation process specialization on urban green development. The research results show that there is a spatial division of labor and urban green technological innovation process specialization between central city and non-central city in China. While the professionalization of the urban green technology innovation process promotes urban green development, it also narrows the gap in the level of green development between China's central cities and non-central cities, and this promotion effect is even greater in underdeveloped areas. Different types of cities have heterogeneity in the intermediary transmission mechanism of urban green technology innovation process specialization affects urban green development: Central cities mainly rely on the two channels of human capital advancement and environmentally friendly modern industrial system; non-central cities mainly rely on economic activity and the green transformation of heavily polluting enterprises. Finally, policy recommendations are made for policymakers to proactively use the theoretical framework to improve urban life.","Liao, Bin;Li, Lin",Journal,Sustainable Cities and Society,2022-05-01,Hunan University,Central city ;  Heterogeneous intermediary mechanism ;  Non-central city ;  Urban green coordinated development ;  Urban green technological innovation process specialization
Beyond the UNFCCC North-South divide: How newly industrializing countries collaborate to innovate in climate technologies,"While the Global North is historically responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs) are expected to overtake developed country emissions in the coming years. At the same time, NICs are climbing the ladder of the global economy, increasing their competitiveness on the global stage and catching up with technological competencies of developed economies. Against this background, this paper explores innovation and collaboration in Climate Change Mitigation Technologies (CCMTs) in NICs. The research question is whether the propensity to innovate and diffuse CCMTs is impacted by technological collaboration with two highly developed countries, Germany and The United States. The sample of NICs includes the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) plus Israel, Mexico, and Turkey, in a panel from 1995 to 2015. The empirical results suggest that collaboration with both Germany and the U.S. is highly significant for domestic CCMT innovation in NICs. These findings are important because, stepping beyond the literature on the merits and drawbacks of global climate governance tools such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and related UNFCCC processes, they show that collaboration for climate and environmental technologies could become a key tool to significantly improve the chances to stay in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. Finally, the policy advice for NICs and developing countries is to, above all else, focus on incubating strong technological innovation systems, including strengthening domestic Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), as well as to enhance technological collaboration with developed countries.","Herman, Kyle S.",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2022-05-01,University College London,CDM ;  Climate change mitigation technologies ;  Environmental technologies ;  Learning-by-doing ;  Paris climate ;  Technological innovation systems
"Concrete seawalls: A review of load considerations, ecological performance, durability, and recent innovations","Increasing frequency of extreme weather events, driven by climate change, coupled with growing population densities, have contributed to an increasing demand for coastal structures to protect and stabilize shorelines. Concrete seawalls are a common category of coastal protection structures, designed with the primary objectives of absorbing wave action, preventing coastline erosion, and alleviating flooding. Much research has been carried out on improving concrete seawall performance. This work is a review of the current state-of-the-art in concrete seawalls focusing on design aspects including wave loading and innovative seawall designs, ecological considerations, and durability performance. Different conventional seawalls and their advantages and disadvantages are reviewed. Wave loads on seawalls have received significant attention; and multiple approaches for the quantification for the different types of loads are presented. However, wave load quantification remains a challenging task, especially for novel designs, and performance under load for such designs must be quantified through testing in wave tanks. Drawing inspiration from natural shorelines, modification of surface complexity at a multitude of scales can improve the otherwise poor ecological performance of seawalls. Ecological performance can also be improved by the incorporation of natural materials or structures in seawalls although the exact influence of concrete and other material chemistry on benthic diversity is unclear. The corrosion of the steel is a major durability concern, and the use of non-corrosive reinforcement can increase seawall durability toward corrosion. Other durability concerns include alkali silica reaction and sulfate attack, which can be mitigated through proper mixture design, including through the use of supplementary cementitious materials. Examples of innovative seawall designs and systems which have the capability to outperform conventional seawalls are discussed. Advances in structural design, ecological engineering, and infrastructure materials science will drive the development of multi-functional seawalls which are sustainable, durable, and resilient.","Hosseinzadeh, Nima;Ghiasian, Mohammad;Andiroglu, Esber;Lamere, Joel;Rhode-Barbarigos, Landolf;Sobczak, James;Sealey, Kathleen Sullivan;Suraneni, Prannoy",Journal,Ecological Engineering,2022-05-01,University of Miami,Coastal protection ;  Design ;  Durability ;  Ecology ;  Seawall ;  Sustainability

"Design thinking, lean startup, and high-technology marketing for human-centered systems engineering","The use of design thinking, lean startup, and high-technology marketing in systems engineering is presented as a case study. All were used and evaluated for their potential to improve systems engineering processes and design, address the challenges of culture change, increase the adoption rate of new technology, and engage with potential users and sponsors more effectively. Multiple examples of training and use on a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) initiative at a large government agency showcase how these approaches were tailored and used successfully for significant benefits such as enhanced collaboration and better problem definition and design solutions. Challenges remain for use by quiet thinkers and with virtual teams. These new ways of thinking are well aligned with creating and using new technologies and are suitable for situations involving innovation, uncertainty, and change within organizations. This case study intends to familiarize systems engineers with the application of these human-centered approaches, to interest systems engineers in incorporating these approaches into their work processes, and to inspire the systems engineering research community to investigate further.","Weiland, Karen J.;Knizhnik, Jessica R.L.",Journal,Systems Engineering,2022-05-01,NASA Glenn Research Center;NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,design thinking ;  human-centered ;  systems engineering processes
"Thai undergraduate science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) creative thinking and innovation skill development: a conceptual model using a digital virtual classroom learning environment","Qualitative and quantitative research methods were undertaken to examine and develop a digitally based virtual classroom learning environment (VCLE) for Thai undergraduate students’ creative thinking and innovation enhancement in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEM/STEAM) disciplines. The research methodology was divided into two phases, including the synthesis and then the design of the VCLE. Also, in addition to the study’s authors, nine experts were used for the model’s development and another ten for its assessment (19 total). From their in-depth interviews and subsequent content analysis, their input of the proposed STEAM-ification process was synthesized and the data analyzed. The results revealed that the VCLE design should begin with a face-to-face, classroom learning environment in which the ‘gamification’ mechanisms were introduced and examined. This was then reinforced by moving the gamification process online outside of the classroom. Furthermore, five VCLE STEAM-ification steps were found to be particularly useful for enhancing creative thinking and student innovation. These included investigation, discovery, connections, creativity, and reflection. Moreover, we identified the gamification process as consisting of three main components. These were the ‘game mechanics,' the ‘game dynamics,' and ‘player emotions’. The ten experts agreed that the VCLE STEAM-ification creativity and innovation (C & I) process was appropriate at an ‘excellent’ level (x¯ = 4.68, S. D. = 0.47), which has great potential in the development of Thai undergraduate student C & I skills. Also, when undertaken correctly, innovation and motivation to learn are also outcomes from both VCLE and gamification applications. Thus, when students undertook study with the VCLE STEAM-ification format, they were found to achieve higher levels of creativity and innovation than students who studied using the traditional teaching plan. These results were found to be statistically significant at the.01 level.","Wannapiroon, Naphong;Pimdee, Paitoon",Journal,Education and Information Technologies,2022-05-01,King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang,21  Century education st ;  Creative Thinking ;  Critical thinking ;  Digital Learning Environment ;  Gamification ;  Innovation skills ;  STEAM-ification ;  STEM ;  Thailand
Sodium Alginate as a Pharmaceutical Excipient: Novel Applications of a Well-known Polymer,"Alginates are naturally occurring polymers revealing low toxicity, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, excellent gelling and thickening properties, as well as low production cost and good availability. One of the most important features typical for alginates is the ability to undergo ionotropic gelation which is gel formation process occurring upon the contact with cations. Because of their advantageous properties, alginates have been extensively utilized in food and pharmaceutical industries. In this review the current knowledge regarding the most recent studies involving both popularly applied dosage forms, like tablets or hydrogels, and novel advanced drug delivery systems applied in targeted therapies are summarized and discussed. The presented studies indicate that although sodium alginate is a well-established polymer, it is still widely applied as pharmaceutical excipient and the presented research studies indicate that there are still research areas that can be explored and provide innovation in drug delivery systems.","Jadach, Barbara;Świetlik, Weronika;Froelich, Anna",Journal,Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,2022-05-01,Poznan University of Medical Sciences,biodegradable polymer ;  carrier ;  controlled release ;  drug delivery system ;  sodium alginate
Application of three-dimensional printing medical-industrial outpatient clinics in digital medical education,"BACKGROUND: The combination of three-dimensional (3D) printing and medical workers in outpatient and digital medical education is constantly improving and developing. The application of 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient mode to the clinical practice and teaching of digital medicine will be an innovative combination during the rapid development of 3D printing. This new mode will also further promote the development of applied medicine. OBJECTIVE: To compare the advantages of 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic with traditional medical teaching and 3D printing medical teaching, and expounds in detail the clinical practice teaching case of 3D printing medical worker combination clinic of the Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. METHODS: The teaching methods of traditional medicine and 3D printing medicine were investigated and compared with 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic at Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University in terms of “teaching, education, digital medicine”. We discussed the composition of 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic, investigated the development of 3D printing items, and summarized the number of participants who had participated in the training of 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic as well as the number of international conferences held in the 3D printing clinic center of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital from January 2018 to January 2021, thereby expounding the important role of 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic in the development of digital medical education. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The traditional medical education that proceeds in a large classroom is boring, in which students are easy to lose their attention and difficult to master knowledge comprehensively. 3D printing medical education could improve the understanding of abstract content in medical education, but there is a lack of clinical translation potential in 3D printing. 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinics could cultivate the transformation thinking of medical-industrial talents, train the students’ ability to transform scientific research achievements, and help the smooth implementation of clinical research achievements. 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinics at Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital has successfully produced personalized orthoses for patients, with the characteristics of interdisciplinary interaction, medical and industrial talent interaction, and system training. It took the lead in the development and exploration of 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinic in the clinical practice and teaching of digital medicine, and has achieved good results. At present, there are 42 Master/MD candidates and 137 trainees in the 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinic. It has held 10 international conferences on rehabilitation medicine and engineering, and 6 international conferences on the clinical transformation of advanced technologies in rehabilitation medicine and engineering, all of which have a profound impact on the development of 3D printing digital medicine education over the world. To conclude, the teaching mode based on 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinics is not only beneficial to training students’ scientific research and innovation ability guided by clinical needs, but also conducive to the development of cutting-edge disciplines such as translational medicine, tissue engineering, rehabilitation engineering and biomedical engineering.","Zheng, Kun;Xu, Yuanjing;Yu, Wenqiang;Ren, Fuchao;Deng, Qian;Wang, Jinwu;Dai, Kerong",Journal,Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research,2022-05-01,Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine;Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Weifang Medical University,3D printing outpatient ;  Achievement transformation ;  Clinical teaching ;  Digital medical education ;  Medical-industrial combination ;  Scientific research innovation ;  Teaching mode ;  Tissue engineering
A Computer Science Perspective on Digital Transformation in Production,"The Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) promises significant improvements for the manufacturing industry by facilitating the integration of manufacturing systems by Digital Twins. However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.","Brauner, Philipp;Dalibor, Manuela;Jarke, Matthias;Kunze, Ike;Koren, István;Lakemeyer, Gerhard;Liebenberg, Martin;Michael, Judith;Pennekamp, Jan;Quix, Christoph;Rumpe, Bernhard;Van Der Aalst, Wil;Wehrle, Klaus;Wortmann, Andreas;Ziefle, Martina",Journal,ACM Transactions on Internet of Things,2022-05-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Universität Stuttgart;Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT,Digital shadows ;  Industrial internet of things ;  Internet of production ;  World wide lab
State-of-the-art CRISPR for in vivo and cell-based studies in Drosophila,"For more than 100 years, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has served as a powerful model organism for biological and biomedical research due to its many genetic and physiological similarities to humans and the availability of sophisticated technologies used to manipulate its genome and genes. The Drosophila research community quickly adopted CRISPR technologies and, in the 8 years since the first clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) publications in flies, has explored and innovated methods for mutagenesis, precise genome engineering, and beyond. Moreover, the short lifespan and ease of genetics have made Drosophila an ideal testing ground for in vivo applications and refinements of the rapidly evolving set of CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) tools. Here, we review innovations in delivery of CRISPR reagents, increased efficiency of cutting and homology-directed repair (HDR), and alternatives to standard Cas9-based approaches. While the focus is primarily on in vivo systems, we also describe the role of Drosophila cultured cells as both an indispensable first step in the process of assessing new CRISPR technologies and a platform for genome-wide CRISPR pooled screens.","Zirin, Jonathan;Bosch, Justin;Viswanatha, Raghuvir;Mohr, Stephanie E.;Perrimon, Norbert",Journal,Trends in Genetics,2022-05-01,Harvard Medical School,CRISPR ;  Drosophila ;  genome engineering
Can Induced Gratitude Improve Creative Performance on Repurposing Tasks?,"Urgent societal problems, including climate change, require innovation and can benefit from interdisciplinary solutions. A small body of research has demonstrated the potential of positive emotions (e.g., gratitude, awe) to promote creativity and prosocial behavior, which may help address these problems. This study integrates, for the first time, psychology research on a positive prosocial emotion (i.e., gratitude) with engineering-design creativity research. In a preregistered study design, engineering students and working engineers (pilot N = 49; full study N = 329) completed gratitude, positive-emotion-control, or neutral-control inductions. Design creativity was assessed through rated scores of responses to an Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a Wind-Turbine-Blade Repurposing Task (WRT). No significant differences among AUT scores emerged across conditions in either sample. As only the pilot-study manipulation of gratitude was successful, recommendations are provided for further studies on the effect of gratitude on engineering-design creativity. The reported work may also inform other strategies to incorporate prosocial emotion to help engineers arrive at more original and effective concepts to tackle environmental sustainability, and in the future, other problems facing society.","Sisson, N.

Preparing Industry Leaders: The Role of Doctoral Education and Early Career Management Training in the Leadership Trajectories of Women STEM PhDs,"While gender diversity in leadership has been shown to benefit organizations and promote innovations, women continue to be underrepresented in leadership positions in the industry sector. With increasing numbers of women pursuing PhDs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, it is critical to examine how PhD programs contribute to the career paths of PhDs. This study examines the role of doctoral education preparation in communication, management, and technical skills, as well as post-PhD early career management training (ECMT), on PhDs’ attainment of leadership positions in industry. Data come from the National Science Foundation Survey of Doctorate Recipients, National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates, and National Research Council Rankings of PhD programs. Using regression analyses, results indicate that ECMT is associated with a higher likelihood of attainment of leadership positions. PhD preparation in management skills also contributes to the attainment of leadership positions. Previous literature has shown that structural inequities and workplace bias contribute to limiting women’s progress to leadership positions and that it is critical to address systemic and workplace biases. Research findings suggest that PhD program preparation and increased access to professional development opportunities can help contribute to the enhancement of women’s pathways to leadership roles. Structural changes in doctoral education preparation in management skills and increases in ECMT opportunities offered by employers also have the potential to increase the participation of STEM PhDs in leadership roles in industry.","Main, Joyce B.;Wang, Yanbing;Tan, Li",Journal,Research in Higher Education,2022-05-01,ETH Zürich;Purdue University,Doctoral education ;  Gender ;  Industry ;  Leadership

Progress and applications of acoustic black holes,"The problem of vibration and noise has always been one of the difficulties in the development of society. Therefore, the innovation of vibration and noise reduction methods has never stopped. In recent years, the introduction of acoustic black holes to manipulate flexural waves has become a hot topic in the field of vibration and noise. In this review, the acoustic black hole is defined as a kind of structure which can converge the flexural wave by changing the geometric parameters or material properties. In the absolute ideal case, the flexural wave velocity gradually decreases to zero in the acoustic black hole region. Acoustic black hole structures, as a new kind of flexural wave manipulation technique, can effectively reduce the propagation speed of flexural waves in the structure, thus reducing the reflection at the end of the boundary and forming a region with high energy density. Therefore, it has a broad application prospect in vibration reduction, noise reduction, fluctuation control and energy recovery. Different from the composite structure of vibration reduction and noise reduction in the past, the acoustic black hole has some certain advantages in practical application because of its simple structure, material and preparation process. Up to now, a great deal of theoretical modeling and experimental research has been carried out on the structural form of acoustic black holes, and some certain research results have been obtained. This review first introduces the origin, basic definition and principle of acoustic black holes, then introduces the theoretical calculation and experimental research methods, including frequency domain methods (semi-analytical method, Gauss expansion method, geometric acoustics method, transfer matrix method, finite element method, unit decomposition finite element method, spectral element method, and finite difference method) and wave-number domain method. Additionally, the laser ultrasonic scanning technology is emphasized in the experimental research. Next, the four main functions of acoustic black holes are classified and described, which are vibration reduction, noise reduction, fluctuation control and energy recovery, and the research status and existing problems of each application direction are summarized. The application of acoustic black holes in vibration reduction and noise reduction is becoming more and more comprehensive, and its applications in wave regulation and energy recovery are emerging in recent years. As a new research direction, the basic theory and practical application of acoustic black holes still need to be widely studied further. The breakthrough points include: (1) The acoustic vibration coupling mechanism of acoustic black holes and the matching with functional materials need to be further clarified; (2) the nonlinear wave behavior in acoustic black holes needs to be further improved; (3) according to different engineering scenarios, the bearing integrated design method of acoustic black hole composite structures is developed; (4) theoretical modeling and application development of imperfect acoustic black hole structures. The development of acoustic black holes is also a supplement and broadening to the related research of vibration and noise reduction. From the perspective of social development needs, the related research of acoustic black holes has potential applications in the independent research and development of functional structures and materials.","Gao, Nansha;Zhang, Zhicheng;Wang, Qian;Guo, Xinyu;Chen, Kean;Hou, Hong",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2022-04-25,China State Shipbuilding Corporation;Northwestern Polytechnical University,Acoustic black hole ;  Energy recovery ;  Fluctuation control ;  Vibration and noise reduction

These teaching reform measures greatly improved the students' interest in learning this course, as well as their professionalism and research ability.","Ni, He;Fan, Ruifang;Yin, Liang;Wang, Yutao;Chen, Jianfang",Journal,Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Biotechnology,2022-04-25,South China Normal University,Bio-separation engineering ;  Curriculum reconstruction ;  Curriculum reform ;  Emerging engineering education
Identifying the most suitable machine learning approach for a road digital twin,"Road infrastructure systems have been suffering from ineffective maintenance strategies, exaggerated by budget restrictions. A more holistic road-asset-management approach enhanced by data-informed decision making through effective condition assessment, distress detection and future condition predictions can significantly enhance maintenance planning, prolonging asset life. Recent technology innovations such as digital twins have great potential to enable the needed approach for road condition predictions and proactive asset management. To this end, machine learning techniques have also demonstrated convincing capabilities in solving engineering problems. However, none of them has been considered specifically within a digital twin context. There is therefore a need to review and identify appropriate approaches for the usage of machine learning techniques with road digital twins. This paper provides a systematic literature review of machine learning algorithms used for road condition predictions and discusses findings within the road digital twin framework. The results show that existing machine learning approaches suitable and mature for stipulating successful road digital twin development. Moreover, the review, while identifying gaps in the literature, indicates several considerations and recommendations required on the journey to road digital twins and suggests multiple future research directions based on the review summaries of machine learning capabilities.","Chen, Kun;Eskandari Torbaghan, Mehran;Chu, Mingjie;Zhang, Long;Garcia-Hernández, Alvaro",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Smart Infrastructure and Construction,2022-04-21,University of Birmingham;University of Nottingham;The University of Manchester,Digital twin ;  Machine learning ;  Pavements & roads ;  Road condition prediction ;  Road digital twin

Towards sustainable product development – Insights from testing and evaluating a profile model for management of sustainability integration into design requirements,"Product development and manufacturing continues to be a profound contributor to the socio-ecological problems and challenges we are facing in our world today. For products to contribute to sustainability requires not only that socio-ecological lifecycle impacts are considered in the initial stages of the product innovation process, but that they are maintained as integral product requirements. Although research offers a plethora of approaches, methods, and tools for sustainable product development, the implementation in industry remains low. The focus of this research is a less explored area of sustainable product development implementation, the management of needs identification and propagation of design requirements. The purpose is to: i) add to state of knowledge about current practices of sustainability integration into requirements, and ii) the academic discussion on implementation of sustainable design and product development. A self-assessment approach for sustainability integration into requirements is tested. The purpose of the approach is to support improvement of the requirements management process design, including activities and competencies, for engineering design. Four Swedish product development and manufacturing companies tested the approach, from which the results are used to evaluate usefulness, usability, and effect potential. The findings are discussed together with key characteristics for requirements and sustainability criteria, providing insights to ensure that socio-ecological considerations are both influencing the initial requirement specification, and maintained as decision parameters throughout the product development process.","Watz, Matilda;Hallstedt, Sophie I.",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2022-04-20,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola,Implementation ;  Requirements ;  Sustainability criteria ;  Sustainable design ;  Sustainable product development ;  Traceability ;  Trade-offs
Innovations in Undergraduate Research Training Through Multisite Collaborative Programming: American Heart Association Summer Undergraduate Research Experience Syndicate,"BACKGROUND: To support diversity in biomedical science, the American Heart Association launched the Supporting Undergraduate Research Experiences for undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds to provide mentorship and high-level exposure at 5 leading medical institutions. Here we describe the initial formation of the partnership and the alteration made in response to the program to accommodate COVID-19 safety precautions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We outline how programming shifted from local, in-person programming in the summer of 2019 to a collaborative, mainly virtual curriculum in 2020 using students’ self-reported before and after surveys from both 2019 (n=33) and 2020 (n=42). Students from both in-person (2019) and virtual programs (2020) self-reported significant gains in scientific proficiency. A qualitative-directed content analysis of student open-response questions was performed. Students reported extensive benefits from the 2020 virtual training, including Personal Gains, Research Skills, Thinking and Working Like a Scientist, and Attitudes and Behaviors. Notedly, we observed increases in the Attitudes and Behaviors category. We outline the pros and cons of in-person and virtual programming and make recommendations moving forward in a postpandemic world with hybrid work and learning systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our effort informs the development of future undergraduate research training programs, significantly maximizing a hybrid training modality. The American Heart Association Supporting Undergraduate Research Experiences serves as a model for building multi-institutional partnerships and providing research experiences that overcome institutional barriers and support students’ interests, commitment, and ability to persist in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.","Ajayi, Tinuola B.;Mueller, Adrienne L.;Okwuosa, Ike S.;Barshilia, Asha;Wu, Joseph C.;Benjamin, Emelia J.;Barnett, Joey V.;Oliver, Kendra H.",Journal,Journal of the American Heart Association,2022-04-19,Framingham Heart Study;School of Public Health;Stanford University;American Heart Association;Northwestern University;Vanderbilt University School of Medicine;Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine;Boston Medical Center;Communication of Science and Technology Program Nashville TN,American Heart Association (AHA) ;  multi-institutional programming ;  online ;  Supporting Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE) ;  training ;  undergraduate ;  virtual
Challenges and opportunities for social entrepreneurs in civil engineering in Brazil,"Purpose: This paper aims to identify challenges and opportunities for social enterprises (SE) in civil engineering in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: Starting from the transformative social innovation theory and inspired by grounded theory principles, this paper conducts three-stage exploratory research. First, this paper mapped the Brazilian SE civil engineering ecosystem. Next, this paper classified the SE initiatives along with an organizing framework. Finally, this paper conducted 11 interviews with key ecosystem actors and analyzed data through iterative, parallel and interrelated content analysis procedures. Findings: The 37 SE found were classified along “Sustainability,” “Housing,” “Transportation” and “Sanitation” pillars, which are aligned with the United Nations’ social development goals. This paper found 50 challenges and opportunities, which were aggregated along seven dimensions. Three elements are particularly relevant as opportunities: opportunities for SE with ecosystem supporters, specialized investors and partnership with major companies; while government and early investment are the most relevant challenges. Research limitations/implications: Research findings and conclusions cannot be extended to other sectors and countries. Usual limitations associated with exploratory qualitative research must also be highlighted. Practical implications: The government should offer financial and technical support for civil engineering in working in partnership with ecosystem supporters. Academy could use SE content and ecosystem for its students and should offer diverse resources for network creation. Originality/value: Focusing on civil engineering SE in Brazil, this study sheds light on a high-impact sector that has not been studied yet.","Vasconcellos, Ernesto Ferreira;Leso, Bernardo Henrique;Cortimiglia, Marcelo Nogueira",Journal,International Journal of Organizational Analysis,2022-04-18,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,Brazil ;  Civil engineering ;  SDG ;  Social development goals ;  Social entrepreneurship ;  Social innovation ;  Sustainability ;  Sustainable development
Use of Technological Tools in Virtual Education for Educational Innovation in Amazon Public Universities,"University education is in a process of change ready to take on the challenges of educational innovation by incorporating new technological tools to replace traditional ones; because, educational innovation must be reflected in educational practices that improve teaching learning. It is important to raise those technological tools in a requirement in virtual teaching. The professors Peruvian public universities of the Amazon present serious deficiencies to differentiate the digital and virtual tools of the traditional slate, multimedia projector and other resources that have supported teaching for many decades in the classroom. The objective of the research was: To determine the relationship between the use of technological tools in virtual education and educational innovation in teachers of the various faculties of San Martín National University. The study was of a correlational descriptive type. The sample consisted of 339 professors from the various faculties of the National University of San Martín. It is concluded that the use of technological tools in virtual education used by university teachers are: attendance, forum, grades, homework, etiquette, videoconference, polling, digital whiteboard, screen sharing and presenting videos, evidencing as a result, that the use of technological tools in virtual education is significantly related to educational innovation in professors of Peruvian public universities in the Amazon.","Padilla, Manuel;Lopez, Ibis;Chauca, Mario;Juarez, Monica;Injante, Richard",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-04-16,Universidad Nacional De San Martín – Tarapoto;Universidad Nacional Tecnológica De Lima Sur,educational innovation ;  technological resources and activities ;  Technological tools ;  virtual education
Cooling textiles for personal thermal management,"Textiles play an extremely important role in various aspects of our life since prehistoric times. Toward passionate and imperceptible sport and health, people have begun to explore evolving functions beyond the basic values of textiles. Smart textiles with functions such as communication, sensing, color change, warming, cooling, actuation, and computing have become the new frontier of wearable technology. Global warming and the enormously scorching weather have adversely affected human production and living as well as the sustainable development of society. As being homothermal, the human body has the ability of automatic temperature regulation. However, people are still vulnerable to excessive heat load without the protection of buildings and traditional cooling systems. As the largest organ of the human body, the skin can sense the temperature changes of the external environment and regulate its own temperature. Human skin heat dissipation is a complex process including heat convection, heat evaporation and heat radiation. As the boundary between human skin and the external environment, textiles play an important part for the human body to attain thermal comfort under different environmental conditions. Therefore, personal thermal management, a technology regulating the microenvironments around the human body, can effectively control the heat exchange of the human body, and thus become an eco-friendly solution. With the progress of thermal and materials science, diverse cooling textiles have provided people with convenience and safety in the fields of medicine, firefighting, aerospace, and military technology. In the perspective of cooling principles, personal thermal management solutions based on textiles are categorized as UV-protective textiles, cooling textiles, active cooling suits, and radiative cooling textiles. Some of them have been utilized to maintain a relatively stable body temperature in different scenarios. Textile applications at present are no longer confined to social intercourse and aesthetics, but are more focused on functional breakthroughs. The urgency of global warming and the danger of outdoor work in special occupations have greatly increased the demand for innovations in cooling textiles. It is crucial to maintain thermal comfort of individuals for physical and mental health in extreme environments. Although certain cooling textiles have been commercialized and become basic essentials for specific occasions, stringent challenges remain for weakening the perception of cooling textiles during utilization, expanding their application scenarios to make them available life-essentials. This review focuses on the regulation mechanism and development of various cooling textiles for personal thermal management. We summarize recent research progress and its significance in energy saving and emission reduction. We also propose solutions toward related challenges in the research and development of high-performance protective textiles, and finally give a perspective to the rise of cooling protective textiles. Through multidisciplinary innovations in textile engineering, materials science, optics, thermal science, and mechanics, cooling textiles can be yielded in a low-cost way with multi-functional performance, while maintaining superior wearability and durability compatible with our daily activities. Cooling textiles would enable the construction of more effective, more comprehensive, and more subtle cooling systems for people. In the perspective of intelligent sport and health, the combination of cooling textiles with flexible electronics and digital twins technology can further enable common-looked textiles with intelligence such as autonomous thermal regulation, perception and interaction, thermoelectrical self-powering, short-haul communication, and metaverse.","Zeng, Shaoning;Hu, Jiayu;Zhang, Manni;Xiang, Yuanzhuo;Wu, Jiawei;Su, Minyu;Zhang, Yuqi;Shen, Meng;Hong, Ping;Huang, Zhaolin;Chen, Min;Zhou, Ning;Hou, Chong;Zhou, Huamin;Zhang, Dingyu;Tao, Guangming",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2022-04-15,Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics;Huazhong University of Science and Technology;Beijing Sport University;Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology;Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital;Health Commission of Hubei Province;General Hospital of Civil Aviation Administration of China,Cooling textile ;  Functional fabric ;  Personal thermal management ;  Radiative cooling ;  Wearable technology
Nanoparticle applications as beneficial oil and gas drilling fluid additives: A review,"Nanotechnology remains a relatively new innovation for the oil and gas industry. However, many applications have now become an integral part of some of its key technological processes. Nanotechnology is being widely applied, especially to improve the performance of drilling equipment, wellbore fluids, and improved/enhanced oil and gas recovery methods. Some drilling equipment, such as drilling bits and wellbore tubulars, are being fabricated using nanomaterials. Here, we review the evolution of relevant nanotechnology applications, manufacturing methods of suitable nanoparticles, their classification, and the various applications of nanotechnology in drilling engineering, especially related to drilling fluids. Applications involving water- and oil-based drilling fluids are reviewed. It is apparent that the nanoparticles used to date have tangibly improved several drilling processes. Silica and alumina nanoparticles have proved to be highly effective at improving the rheology, filtration, and thermal stability of drilling fluids. Environmental impacts and costs of materials/fluids are of paramount concern when selecting materials for deployment as drilling fluids, and these factors are addressed in this review. By providing a comprehensive understanding of existing, successful nanotechnology applications in drilling fluids, this review provides a guide to outstanding research issues to be solved and potential future applications in this field.","Al-Shargabi, Mohammed;Davoodi, Shadfar;Wood, David A.;Al-Musai, Ameen;Rukavishnikov, Valeriy S.;Minaev, Konstantin M.",Journal,Journal of Molecular Liquids,2022-04-15,DWA Energy Ltd.;Tomsk Polytechnic University;Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS,Drilling additives ;  Drilling fluids ;  Nanofluids ;  Nanoparticles ;  Nanotechnology ;  Rheological and filtration properties
Numerical investigation on mooring line configurations of a Paired Column Semisubmersible for its global performance in deep water condition,"The advances observed in the offshore-renewable industry include the recent development of a deep draft paired column semisubmersible platform developed for application on dry trees in Gulf of Mexico (GoM). These developments led to the recent innovation of the Paired Column Semisubmersible by Jun Zou of Houston Offshore Engineering. This paper presents a detailed investigation on the mooring line analysis for two different configurations on the hull of a Paired Column Semisubmersible (PCSemi). The numerical research of the PCSemi platform coupled with mooring lines was conducted, and the model was validated. Two different mooring configurations were investigated: Chain-Polyester-Chain (CPC) and Polyester-Polyester (PP) configurations, with dynamic coupling in frequency domain (FD) and time domain (TD) using ANSYS AQWA and Orcaflex. A comparative study of the mooring lines is also investigated in 2,438 m water depth at GoM, using 16 mooring lines with catenary mooring design. Results of this study gives the natural period of floating PCSemi's heave motion ranged from 21s to 22s. Also, the effect of a damaged mooring line increased the tension in other mooring lines. Lastly, the CPC configuration has a smaller amplitude for wave-frequency platform motions compared to the PP mooring configuration from the depicted PCSemi global performance.","Amaechi, Chiemela Victor;Odijie, Agbomerie Charles;Wang, Facheng;Ye, Jianqiao",Journal,Ocean Engineering,2022-04-15,"Standards Organisation of Nigeria;Department of Engineering, Lancaster University;Tsinghua University;MSCM Limited",Catenary mooring system ;  Hydrodynamics ;  Mooring lines ;  Offshore platform ;  Paired column semisubmersible (PCSemi) ;  Semisubmersible global performance
Implementation of enterprises’ green technology innovation under market-based environmental regulation: An evolutionary game approach,"With the increasing carbon neutral targets claimed by responsible countries, many research has been done to investigate the impact of environmental regulation on green technology innovation (GTI). However, there still remains a gap at micro level that takes enterprise as research subject to figure out an effective regulatory mechanism that supports the development of GTI. Since the integration of technology and finance is the main trend in future progress of GTI, it is meaningful to study the decision-making behavior and influencing factors of heterogenous enterprises and banks under market-based environmental regulation policies. This paper established a tripartite evolutionary game model among two types of enterprises with distinct Research & Development (R&D) ability and banks. The results show that: (1) the scenario when subsidy to enterprises is greater than to banks leads to a better situation; (2) penalty has more significant influence on enterprises than subsidies at the early stage, and enterprises' strategic choices of independent R&D is more reliable on subsidies; (3) when the price gap between different levels of technology increases, enterprises are inclined to continuously invest in green R&D, while it will restrain enterprises’ technology introduction behavior.","Li, Mengyuan;Gao, Xin",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2022-04-15,Antai College of Economics and Management;Hohai University,Evolutionary game model ;  Green technology innovation ;  Green technology trading market ;  Incentive and penalty ;  Market-based environmental regulation
Technology assessment in the STEM curriculum: Teaching responsible research and innovation skills to future innovators,"• This article describes and evaluates a novel approach to incorporating technology assessment (TA), responsible research and innovation as well as science and technology ethics into STEM curricula (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) by the ex-ample of the online course ‘Good Chemistry – Methodological, Ethical, and Social Dimensions.’ Based on the evaluation of extensive student feedback, this article answers positively to three major reservations (Is it possible? Is it necessary? Does it make a difference?) that often preclude such contents from STEM curricula: first, understanding the normative dimensions of chemists’ professional agency is a skill, like many others, that requires adequate teaching and training; second, en-gaging with TA issues not only teaches discourse and critical thinking skills, but increases students’ professional competences to collaborate in highly interdisciplinary settings; third, though this is less evidential and needs to proof in the future, it may enhance chemists’ responsi-bility as drivers of innovation.","Mehlich, Jan",Journal,Zeitschrift fur Technikfolgenabschatzung in Theorie und Praxis / Journal for Technology Assessment in Theory and Practice,2022-04-08,Universität Bonn,discourse skills ;  innovation ethics ;  interdisciplinarity ;  responsible research and innovation ;  STEM education
Dynamic capabilities for digitalisation in the AECO sector – a scientometric review,"Purpose: A scientometric review of extant literature is conducted to define and delineate upon the enabling dynamic capabilities required to engender the digitalisation of organisations operating in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) sector. A secondary aim sought to provide direction for future studies and theories to be tested in this novel field of investigation as well as stimulate wider polemic debate amongst industry stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretivist philosophical stance and inductive approach was undertaken in this study, using a grounded theory strategy. Secondary data used was sourced from the Scopus journal database using specific related keywords. VOSviewer was used to prepare co-occurrence maps based on the bibliographic data gathered. Findings: AECO organisations that seek digitalisation must possess the capability to sense and seize opportunities and threats within the business environment and reconfigure their business processes to best meet their market demand. This can be achieved by improving on attributes relating to industrial management and strategic planning, organisational learning, enterprise resource management and innovative information technology. Future studies should target novel areas such as AECO organisations' ambidexterity and service innovation. Originality/value: This is the first study to explore the dynamic capabilities of AECO organisations in relation to digitalisation adoption. Therefore, the research serves as a robust theoretical background for signposting AECO organisations who seek to transition to digital solutions in the fourth industrial revolution.","Aghimien, Douglas;Aigbavboa, Clinton Ohis;Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel;Edwards, David;Thwala, Wellington Didibhuku;Roberts, Chris J.",Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2022-04-08,"Birmingham City University;Federal University of Technology, Akure;University of Johannesburg",Competitive advantage ;  Construction digitalisation ;  Digital transformation ;  Dynamic capability ;  Industry 4.0
Visualization Analysis of Research Hotspots and Frontiers of Flexible Space and Future Prospects,"The proposal and delineation of flexible space is an effective approach to promote innovation in territorial management, improve the scientificity of spatial planning, and meet practical demands in the context of significant economic and social transformation. However, existing research focuses on preliminary theoretical exploration and case studies on individual cities/regions and is inadequate from the perspective of systematic and integrated research. We used visualization analysis software (CiteSpace5.6) to develop a knowledge graph of flexible space research based on more than 800 articles published between 1990 and 2020 on the topic of ""Flexible Space"" and ""Flexible Planning"", retrieved from two databases (""Web of Science"" and ""China National Knowledge Infrastructure""). The research drew the following conclusions: 1) The quantity of English literature had a significant upward trend, but the amount of Chinese literature increased first and then decreased. Most research focused on eco-environmental and engineering perspectives, and ecosystem services and land use suitability evaluation became the novel direction. 2) The cooperative network density of scientific research institutions related to flexible space research was 0.0042, indicating a relatively low degree of cooperation. The segmented cooperative network centered on several institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Queensland in Australia, etc. 3) The most common knowledge groups included the concept and connotation of flexible space, flexible planning methods, and regulation measures. Features such as land reservation, mixed utilization, and space replacement were emphasized in the descriptive terms, while the use of spatial and quantitative analysis models for spatial optimization and evaluation of suitability were technical focuses, and the most widely adopted methods included decision support systems and agent-based models. Various regulation measures were proposed, with the ""rigid-flexible combination"" approach being amongst the most widely used. To promote theoretical and systematic research on flexible space, the theoretical framework should be built first as a general guide to related research. The theoretical basis and technical methodology should be improved with the support of multidisciplinary integration to enhance the scientificity and feasibility. Moreover, more case studies on various research areas should be carried out to improve the practicability.","Luo, Yanhua;Li, Pingxing",Journal,Tropical Geography,2022-04-05,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology Chinese Academy of Sciences,CiteSpace ;  flexible space ;  prospect ;  spatial planning ;  visualization analysis
E-commerce acceptance in the dimension of sustainability,"Purpose: Technology presents e-commerce as an alternative buying and selling place that is accepted by the public. The high growth of e-commerce has an impact on the sustainability of both the economic dimension, the social dimension and the environmental dimension. Indonesia is the country with the fastest-growing e-commerce but also has the second-largest plastic waste in the world. The synergy of sustainability for e-commerce is an interesting and awaited innovation. This is because sustainability has become the responsibility of all countries in the world. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical understanding of the context of sustainability in e-commerce separately focuses on a company perspective and the use of green products from a consumer perspective. It requires the involvement of e-commerce stakeholders as a whole to get comprehensive research results. The use of qualitative research methods with exploratory approaches is used in this study to reveal the concept of sustainability in e-commerce in Indonesia. Findings: This study found similarities in the topic of acceptance of sustainability in e-commerce with a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence and habits. Changes to the variables were revealed due to changes in the e-commerce phase. The variable trust is in the introduction phase and builds trust in e-commerce. Currently, in Indonesia, the e-commerce phase is in a phase of growth and value formation. Habit creation and dependence is a requirement for value formation. Several new topics were proposed in this study, namely, awareness, security, logistics and user interface and user experience (UX). The establishment of an e-commerce identity through UX clearly shows its target market. The e-commerce phase and the topics involved in it can become a reference for e-commerce regulation-making in Indonesia. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to e-commerce in Indonesia with data processing limited to February 2020. Practical implications: The results of this study provide an overview of increasing the intention to use e-commerce through human acceptance and engineering dimensions. This research also reveals the stages of e-commerce in Indonesia that can be used as a reference for determining the right regulations for e-commerce and the trade-offs for sustainability. Originality/value: This study produces additional references to the intention to use technology by completing the UTAUT model. This study reveals changes in variables in perceived value that are interesting for further research along with technological developments and changes in people’s habits. Exploration carried out can add references to the application of sustainability in e-commerce, especially in developing countries.","Haryanti, Tining;Subriadi, Apol Pribadi",Journal,Journal of Modelling in Management,2022-04-05,Universitas Muhammadiyah Surabaya;Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember,E-commerce ;  Information systems ;  Management information systems ;  Perceived value ;  Stage ;  Sustainability ;  UTAUT
Comparative analysis of the risks of hospitalisation and death associated with SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) and delta (B.1.617.2) variants in England: a cohort study,"Background: The omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated partial vaccine escape and high transmissibility, with early studies indicating lower severity of infection than that of the delta variant (B.1.617.2). We aimed to better characterise omicron severity relative to delta by assessing the relative risk of hospital attendance, hospital admission, or death in a large national cohort. Methods: Individual-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases resident in England between Nov 29, 2021, and Jan 9, 2022, were linked to routine datasets on vaccination status, hospital attendance and admission, and mortality. The relative risk of hospital attendance or admission within 14 days, or death within 28 days after confirmed infection, was estimated using proportional hazards regression. Analyses were stratified by test date, 10-year age band, ethnicity, residential region, and vaccination status, and were further adjusted for sex, index of multiple deprivation decile, evidence of a previous infection, and year of age within each age band. A secondary analysis estimated variant-specific and vaccine-specific vaccine effectiveness and the intrinsic relative severity of omicron infection compared with delta (ie, the relative risk in unvaccinated cases). Findings: The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospital attendance (not necessarily resulting in admission) with omicron compared with delta was 0·56 (95% CI 0·54–0·58); for hospital admission and death, HR estimates were 0·41 (0·39–0·43) and 0·31 (0·26–0·37), respectively. Omicron versus delta HR estimates varied with age for all endpoints examined. The adjusted HR for hospital admission was 1·10 (0·85–1·42) in those younger than 10 years, decreasing to 0·25 (0·21–0·30) in 60–69-year-olds, and then increasing to 0·47 (0·40–0·56) in those aged at least 80 years. For both variants, past infection gave some protection against death both in vaccinated (HR 0·47 [0·32–0·68]) and unvaccinated (0·18 [0·06–0·57]) cases. In vaccinated cases, past infection offered no additional protection against hospital admission beyond that provided by vaccination (HR 0·96 [0·88–1·04]); however, for unvaccinated cases, past infection gave moderate protection (HR 0·55 [0·48–0·63]). Omicron versus delta HR estimates were lower for hospital admission (0·30 [0·28–0·32]) in unvaccinated cases than the corresponding HR estimated for all cases in the primary analysis. Booster vaccination with an mRNA vaccine was highly protective against hospitalisation and death in omicron cases (HR for hospital admission 8–11 weeks post-booster vs unvaccinated: 0·22 [0·20–0·24]), with the protection afforded after a booster not being affected by the vaccine used for doses 1 and 2. Interpretation: The risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for omicron than for delta, with higher reductions for more severe endpoints and significant variation with age. Underlying the observed risks is a larger reduction in intrinsic severity (in unvaccinated individuals) counterbalanced by a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Documented previous SARS-CoV-2 infection offered some protection against hospitalisation and high protection against death in unvaccinated individuals, but only offered additional protection in vaccinated individuals for the death endpoint. Booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines maintains over 70% protection against hospitalisation and death in breakthrough confirmed omicron infections.

Understanding Teamwork Affects Ingenuity in Creative Initiatives,"Representatives that are able to think independently and beyond the box are more likely to come up with unique and novel solutions to problems. This desire to solve problems might lead to new ways of doing things, better outcomes, and more efficient performance. In today's dynamic and changing economic environment, companies in any sector, including manufacturers, might certainly tolerate acting selfishly in their operations or the means by which they deliver products and services. As international markets and technological innovation continue to expose the manufacturing sector, businesses are being pushed to become more inventive in order to meet client needs and engage on a worldwide basis. As technology and innovation professionals prepare for future leadership roles in their firms, it's vital that they understand creativity and how to foster it among their peers. Employees are encouraged to cooperate when they are given the chance to be creative, according to the key contribution of this article. They solicit feedback from their co-workers when they have new ideas. The most intriguing component of offering a place for creation and invention was the creative process's design to foster collaboration and coordination. Several undergraduate engineering schools are gaining traction and integrating creativity into their curriculum, recognizing the realities of the corporate world and the necessity for creative problem-solving skills development. Creativity may be taught and people can be encouraged to come up with fresh ideas. On the other hand, teamwork and team teaching provide a lot of advantages. The current research will educate students about creativity and innovation, as well as how to foster it among their co-workers, in order to prepare them for future supervisory roles. Furthermore, the study's findings will benefit in the development of individualistic thinking abilities.","Choudhary, Manisha;Kumar, Sushil;Subhash, ;Sharma, Madhavi",Journal,World Journal of English Language,2022-04-01,"Sanskriti University;Vivekananda Global University;Shree Guru Gobind Singh Tricentenary University;Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad",creativity ;  development ;  innovation ;  learning ;  performance ;  teamwork
Innovation-based learning (InnBL): Turning science and engineering undergraduate degree programmes towards innovation,"Research-based projects are conventionally regarded as the capstone of an undergraduate degree. These projects combine what students have learned in their coursework with the undertaking of small, independent research projects. We advocate engaging students towards completing their final research projects from their very first year in science and engineering studies in stimulating their creativity and innovation. Here we argue that this revolution of early directing choices and early commencement of work towards the thesis can potentially impact students' thoughtful selection of core courses that are relevant; provide appropriate grounding for undertaking useful research; swiftly and effectively answer their practical research questions and make the student placement-ready. To this end, we propose an Innovation-Based Learning (InnBL) framework for turning science and engineering degree programmes toward a culture of innovation in an era of Industry 4.0. We explore the pros and cons of InnBL if implemented and the implications for the student, institution, and society.","Mandumpal, Jestin Baby;Ferdinand-James, Debra Sharon;Ziarati, Parisa;Hussein, Emad Kamil;Umachandran, Krishnan;Kennedy, Ian G.",Journal,Journal of Creativity,2022-04-01,"Al-Furat Al-Awsat Technical University;American University of the Middle East;The University of the West Indies;Islamic Azad University, Tehran Medical Branch;University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg;Nelcast Ltd",Creativity ;  Independent research ;  InnBL ;  Innovation ;  Problem-based learning ;  Project-based learning ;  Research-based learning ;  Science shops ;  Undergraduates
Role of artificial intelligence in PCOS detection,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinal disorder which affects females aged between 12 and 45 years. It is the disorder in which the cyst is formed in the ovary. The oocyte does not get mature at its natural which and form a fluid-filled sacs known as cyst. When there are many cysts in the ovary, it is then known as polycystic ovary. It may affect both the ovaries. It causes absent menstrual cycles, weight gain, hirsutism, pigmentation, and decrease in hair volume. There are some studies which say that this is a lifestyle disorder, but the main reason is not known yet. PCOS leads to an obstacle in conceiving. It can be suppressed by some changes in lifestyle patterns such as daily exercise and food patterns. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a science and engineering subject that deals with intelligent behavior. It is a subfield of computer science that has improved human existence in a variety of ways. AI is a combination of reasoning, learning, problem-solving perception, and language understanding. A general introduction to the subject of AI creates a new revolution in the world and creates a great scope in future to describe machines that mimic human nature in association with 'cognitive' functions of human mind, such as 'learning' and 'problem-solving.'AI is the technique in which the human work is totally handled by machines. In various domains, AI has recently outperformed humans, and there is enormous potential in healthcare. The health-care system deals with a massive volume of data that is difficult to examine using standard approaches. AI's success in health-care offers improved illness prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment. There are many inventions in machines which can take over the manual work. The AI can reduce the percentage of human error and provides the best and fast result. Together, human people and innovation may pave the road for better health-care services. The ability for a system to automatically learn and improve is provided by machine learning, a branch of AI logically planned. Its main objective is to create new machine learning algorithms that allow users to access specific datasets and use the information for analysis and research the unstructured. Applications of machine learning support significant change, particularly in businesses such as health care that deal with data identification, image recognition, prediction, and identification. Much critical attention has been paid to PCOS screening. In order to address this problem, the current study was created to investigate a noninvasive way to aid in PCOS screening. Our research demonstrates that the suggested algorithm successfully detects PCOS (mean area under the curve of 0.978), suggesting that deep learning may be a potent technique for PCOS identification. In addition, research findings may suggest the exceptional potential of using scleral pictures to diagnose diseases. A fruitful study area may emerge from the integration of AI and characteristics taken from scleral pictures. This article mainly is about PCOS and the role of AI for its diagnosis and better results. The transvaginal ultrasound machine is a noninvasive means of examining the human ovary to show important aspects for PCOS diagnosis. The key characteristics that distinguish ovarian pictures are the number of follicles and their diameters. As a result, PCOS is diagnosed by manually counting follicles and measuring their diameters. This procedure is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. So to make this process easy and error free the introduction of AI is needed.","Agrawal, Anushka;Ambad, Ranjit;Lahoti, Radhika;Muley, Parikshit;Pande, P.",Journal,Journal of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University,2022-04-01,Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering;Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education & Research (Deemed to be University),Follicle ;  hirsutism ;  polycystic ovary syndrome ;  transvaginal ultrasound machines
"Building Indian Biomedical Leadership to Bridge the Gap Between Science, Primary Health Care and Public Health","The Indian biomedical landscape has been characterized by the existence of somewhat polarized institutional structures and professional growth. While some scientific and public health challenges have been met with existing structures, there is still a large unmet scientific and public health need. Broadly, the physical separation of science, engineering, medical campuses and industry has led to silos of excellence and accomplishment with huge gaps in innovation and implementation. The lack of inter-disciplinary educational options has further reinforced the cultural underpinning of “guilds” that have found it difficult to collaborate. Strikingly, with almost a comparable number of institutions that train doctors in the allopathic or traditional disciplines such as Ayurveda, Unani etc., an “integrative medicine” framework has not emerged, apart from an over reliance on specialization at the expense of primary care. This paper is written by two physician-scientists, the first is located in a basic life science research center. The second, a practicing family physician, from the institutional anchor of a life sciences research institution. In this, we trace our experiences, primarily from a principal investigator’s perspective, describing the scientific projects and try to explore the lessons learnt along the way. We will first describe the research in the lab’s core area of human cervical cancer progression and our more recent effort with Dengue genomics and vaccine design. We then describe the lab's engagement with medical campuses and other agencies as well as review our various meetings and interactions so far with our colleagues from Africa to grasp what might be the “generalizable lessons” for the future. The Indian council of medical research initiated a program with Africa in health sciences. Building upon those interactions, we have taken some incremental steps in that direction and described our efforts.","Krishna, Sudhir;Prasad, Ramakrishna",Journal,Journal of the Indian Institute of Science,2022-04-01,Indian Institute of Technology Goa;PCMH Restore Health and Wellness LLP & the Academy of Family Physicians of India,
Load Balancing and Parallel Computation Model for Performance and Accuracy over the Cluster of Nodes,"Cloud computing can be online based network engineering which contributed with a rapid advancement at the progress of communication technological innovation by supplying assistance to clients of assorted conditions with aid from online computing sources. It's terms of hardware and software apps together side software growth testing and platforms applications because tools. Large-scale heterogeneous distributed computing surroundings give the assurance of usage of a huge quantity of computing tools in a comparatively low price. As a way to lessen the software development and setup onto such complicated surroundings, high speed parallel programming languages exist which have to be encouraged by complex operating techniques. There are numerous advantages for consumers in terms of cost and flexibility that come with Cloud computing anticipated uptake. Building on well-established research in Internet solutions, networks and utility computing, virtualization et cetera Service-Oriented Architectures and the Internet of Services (IoS) have implications for a wide range of technological issues such as parallel computing and load balancing as well as high availability and scalability. Effective load balancing methods are essential to solving these issues. Adaptive task load model is the name of the method we suggest in our article for balancing the workload (ATLM). We developed an adaptive parallel distributed computing paradigm as a result of this (ADPM). While still maintaining the model's integrity, ADPM employs a more flexible synchronization approach to cut down on the amount of time synchronous operations use. As well as the ATLM load balancing technique, which solves the straggler issue caused by the performance disparity between nodes, ADPM also applies it to ensure model correctness. The results indicate that combining ADPM and ATLM improves training efficiency without compromising model correctness.","Sheetal, Annabathula Phani;Bhima, Ravi Teja;Karampudi, Radha;Vara Prasad, Srisailapu D.",Journal,Ingenierie des Systemes d'Information,2022-04-01,GITAM University,cloud computing ;  load balancing ;  parallel computing ;  service oriented architectures
Information Literacy Modules for First-Year Engineering Students,"The abundance of information available to us every day continues to increase, largely because of society’s reliance on the internet. While the internet provides access to a wealth of information, information may be inaccurate or irrelevant because anyone can publish content on the internet. As a result, it is critical for individuals to develop information literacy, which includes the skills to gather information, assess its quality, and use it effectively. Information literacy is especially important for engineers because of the need to be lifelong learners in order to adapt to the needs of society and technological innovations. Despite the importance of information literacy, it largely remains absent from undergraduate engineering curriculum. In this work, we developed two modules that were implemented and assessed at two time points in two different first-year engineering courses. These modules focus on defining information and providing a framework to assess the information. Each module includes a short video followed by a handout with questions designed to support students in making connections between the videos and their assigned design project. The development of the modules was informed by current research within the area of information literacy as well as the first two authors’ experience teaching first-year engineering students. Assessment data from the two implementations show that students were able to identify a range of resources they used to get information for their design project. While some students were able to assess the quality of information using a structured process, many students’ assessments were superficial and needed more time and instruction to improve. In addition to discussing our assessment outcomes, we provide a reflection on our personal experience implementing the modules to support the implementation of these modules by other instructors. These modules are available for use, testing, and adaptation in other first-year engineering contexts.","Faber, Courtney;Ellestad, Rachel;Walsh, Alexis",Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2022-04-01,"Tickle College of Engineering;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville",Assessment ;  First-year curriculum ;  Information literacy

This paper provided a compressive literature review on the application of complex network theory in the field of public transportation resilience. Firstly, this paper analyzed the characteristics of the literature related to public transportation network resilience, such as the trend of the number of documents, the distribution of publications and hot keywords combined with the bibliometric analysis method. This paper sorted out the development process of public transportation network resilience, and summarized the research hotspots in the field of public transportation network resilience. Secondly, based on the definition of public transportation network resilience, this paper reviewed the application and research status of complex network theory in public transportation resilience assessment and resilience optimization. On the one hand, the core content of public transportation resilience assessment including resilience assessment indicators, assessment methods, interruptions modeling and redistribution of interrupted traffic were systematically analyzed. On the other hand, this paper sorted out the related research on the resilience improvement strategy of public transportation from the two aspects of pre-disaster prevention and post-disaster recovery. Finally, the main problems and challenges faced by existing researches were summarized, and the development direction and research trend of future public transportation resilience were analyzed from the aspects of resilience assessment method innovation, interruptions modeling improvement, and recovery model exploration.","Yang, Qi;Zhang, Ya Ni;Zhou, Yu Qing;Bai, Li Biao",Journal,Zhongguo Gonglu Xuebao/China Journal of Highway and Transport,2022-04-01,Chang'an University,Complex network ;  Public transportation ;  Resilience ;  Review ;  Traffic engineering
Interdisciplinary Collaborations in Digital Health Research: Mixed Methods Case Study,"Background: Digital innovations in medicine are disruptive technologies that can change the way diagnostic procedures and treatments are delivered. Such innovations are typically designed in teams with different disciplinary backgrounds. This paper concentrates on 2 interdisciplinary research teams with 20 members from the medicine and engineering sciences working jointly on digital health solutions. Objective: The aim of this paper was to identify factors on the individual, team, and organizational levels that influence the implementation of interdisciplinary research projects elaborating on digital applications for medicine and, based on the results, to draw conclusions for the proactive design of the interdisciplinary research process to make these projects successful. Methods: To achieve this aim, 2 interdisciplinary research teams were observed, and a small case study (response rate: 15/20, 75%) was conducted using a web-based questionnaire containing both closed and open self-report questions. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to analyze the quantitative data. The answers to the open-ended questions were subjected to qualitative content analysis. Results: With regard to the interdisciplinary research projects investigated, the influencing factors of the three levels presented (individual, team, and organization) have proven to be relevant for interdisciplinary research cooperation. Conclusions: With regard to recommendations for the future design of interdisciplinary cooperation, management aspects are addressed, that is, the installation of a coordinator, systematic definition of goals, required resources, and necessary efforts on the part of the involved interdisciplinary research partners. As only small groups were investigated, further research in this field is necessary to derive more general recommendations for interdisciplinary research teams.","Krause-Jüttler, Grit;Weitz, Jürgen;Bork, Ulrich",Journal,JMIR Human Factors,2022-04-01,Nationales Centrum für Tumorerkrankungen Dresden;Medizinische Fakultät Carl Gustav Carus,digital health ;  interdisciplinary ;  research collaboration ;  team processes ;  team science
"3D Printed Formwork for Concrete: State-of-the-Art, Opportunities, Challenges, and Applications","Concrete is the most used human-made material in the world, and it is responsible for around 8% of the total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Hence, efficient concrete construction methods are one of the main foci of research in architecture, civil engineering, and material science. One recent development that promises to achieve this goal is the use of digital fabrication for building components. Most investigations focus on direct extrusion 3D printing with concrete, which has already been covered in several review articles. Conversely, this article reviews a different approach, which focuses on the indirect digital fabrication of concrete through 3D printed formworks. This approach is under investigation for structural and nonstructural, as well as for on- and off-site applications, with a number of projects having already been built, but a comprehensive review of 3D printed formworks has not yet been compiled to synthesize the findings. This article provides a comprehensive map of the state-of-the-art of five different 3D printing technologies used for the fabrication of formworks so far. The aim is to serve as a fundamental reference for future research, provide a basis for consistent language in this field, and support the development of construction standards. The article further discusses the new geometric possibilities with 3D printed formworks and their potential for making concrete construction more sustainable. In addition, the opportunities and challenges of 3D printed formworks are evaluated in the context of other traditional and digital fabrication tools. A synthetic classification in five functional typologies is proposed and illustrated with 30 representative case studies. Finally, the article concludes with a brief reflection on the role of 3D printing in the broader context of formwork innovation and a possible outlook for this technology.","Jipa, Andrei;Dillenburger, Benjamin",Journal,3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing,2022-04-01,ETH Zürich,3D printing ;  advanced manufacturing ;  concrete ;  digital concrete ;  digital fabrication ;  formwork
A Multidisciplinary Method to Support the Evolution of NWS Weather Radar Technology,"The highly successful fleet of Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radars is approaching its end of service, and research efforts are under way to inform a decision toward a possible WSR-88D replacement. A methodology to link radar design characteristics to impacts on how radar data are used to diagnose hazardous weather was developed through a unique partnership between radar-engineering innovations in radar simulations and National Weather Service (NWS) radar data interpretation expertise. Deep commitment to two-way learning across disciplines resulted in a methodology that is both efficient and highly relevant to the NWS hazardous weather warning program. The methodology presented in this paper is a model for revealing complex trade-offs between weather radar characteristics and their resultant impact on NWS data interpretation for threat identification. This qualitative methodology is presented in the context of a broader proof-of-concept study from which it was developed. Adapted for further research, it can support the crucial role of deriving quantitative radar design criteria that balance the trade-offs among radar capabilities, cost, and impact to users. That is, the proposed methodology supports the evaluation of candidates for a potential WSR-88D replacement and any necessary major system upgrades in the interim.","Boettcher, Jami;Torres, Sebastián;Nai, Feng;Curtis, Christopher;Schvartzman, David",Journal,Weather and Forecasting,2022-04-01,Gallogly College of Engineering;The University of Oklahoma;NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory,Data quality control ;  Decision making ;  Experimental design ;  Radars/Radar observations
Towards Automated Structural Stability Design of Buildings—A BIM-Based Solution,"Building information modelling (BIM) is a revolution in the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. In the AEC industry, several interesting innovations are being introduced every day. Most of the code compliance work, which is time-consuming and quite multifaceted, is now performed manually. The number of unwanted errors is increasing, and any suspension of the project is led by the structural code-checking system, and is a tiresome process. Subsequently, the BIM-based model is presented to automate the structural stability design of buildings. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) specification is introduced in this work, and is used to automate the building design processes to achieve design correctness and efficiency. The IFC-based interoperability framework is presented to automate the design of structural elements of RC buildings. Consequently, a deep multi-perception-based generalized adaptive framework (DMPBGAF) is presented for the automated code compliance checking process. The concepts and relationships in the building code were automatically matched to their equivalent concepts. A building code was checked against the Indian seismic code IS 13920, and when shear wall data were presented in this IFC file, it exchanged the data with the custom engine. It is possible to eliminate the unwanted issues based on the automated code compliance system with BIM. This goal can be accomplished by using a coding rule-based engine to compile the BIM model and store the design code of the specific country with its clauses. After generating the Python file to code all of the prepared checks, the python file in the form of functions was obtained from the IfcOpenShell library. Finally, a rule engine was developed for interpretation of the checks; the three model IFC files were tested on this, and it gave satisfactory results. The FreeCAD software was employed in this research for the IFC-based BIM model to automate the design. The shear wall data were presented in the first IFC model; all of the code checks were passed based on this modelled design, and when given to the rule engine, it gave a 100% compliance report. Insufficiently reinforced shear wall data contained in the other two IFC files were purposely created to fail some of the code checks. This method significantly reduces the time by eliminating the duplication of efforts. From the viewpoint of accuracy and reliability, the proposed method is more accurate and results in enhanced reliability as compared to manual design methods.","Khattra, Satinder Kaur;Rai, Hardeep Singh;Singh, Jagbir",Journal,Buildings,2022-04-01,"Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana;Punjab Technical University",building information modelling (BIM) ;  code checks ;  generalized adaptive framework ;  Indian seismic code ;  industry foundation classes ;  IS 13920 ;  rule engine ;  shear wall data
FDNet: Knowledge and Data Fusion-Driven Deep Neural Network for Coal Burst Prediction,"Coal burst prediction is an important research hotspot in coal mine production safety. This paper presents FDNet, which is a knowledge and data fusion-driven deep neural network for coal burst prediction. The main idea of FDNet is to extract explicit features based on the existing mine seismic physical model and utilize deep learning to automatically extract the implicit features of mine microseismic data. The key innovations of FDNet include an expert knowledge indicator selection method based on a subset search strategy, a mine microseismic data extraction method based on a deep convolutional neural network, and a feature deep fusion method of mine microseismic data based on an attention mechanism. We conducted a set of engineering experiments in Gaojiapu Coal Mine to evaluate the performance of FDNet. The results show that compared with the state-of-the-art data-driven machines and knowledge-driven methods, the prediction accuracy of FDNet is improved by 5% and 16%, respectively.","Cao, Anye;Liu, Yaoqi;Yang, Xu;Li, Sen;Liu, Yapeng",Journal,Sensors,2022-04-01,China University of Mining and Technology;Ltd.,coal burst ;  coal mine safety ;  deep neural network ;  fusion-driven
Influence of Surface Roughness and Particle Characteristics on Soil–Structure Interactions: A State-of-the-Art Review,"The study of soil–structure interface behavior contributes to the fundamental understanding of engineering performance and foundation design optimization. Previous research studies the effect of soil characteristics and surface roughness property on the soil–material interface mechanism via interface shear test. The reviews utilizing past established laboratory studies and more recent tests based on state-of-the-art technologies reveal that surface roughness significantly affects interface shear performances in the studies of soil–structure interactions, especially in peak shear strength development. A preliminary but original investigative study by the authors was also carried out using a sophisticated portable surface roughness gauge to define the material surface roughness properties in order to study the interface behavior parametrically. Additionally, using the authors’ own original research findings as a proof-of-concept innovation, particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology is applied using a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera to capture sequential images of particle interactions in a custom-built transparent shear box, which validate the well-established four-stage soil shearing model. The authors also envisaged that machine learning, e.g., artificial neural network (ANN) and Bayesian inference method, amongst others, as well as numerical modeling, e.g., discrete element method (DEM), have the potential to also promote research advances on interface shear mechanisms, which will assist in developing a greater understanding in the complex study of soil–structure interactions.","Wang, Runshen;Ong, Dominic E.L.;Peerun, Mohammud I.;Jeng, Dong Sheng",Journal,Geosciences (Switzerland),2022-04-01,School of Engineering and Built Environment;Griffith University,critical roughness ;  friction development ;  interface shear test ;  PIV technology ;  random or ribbed surface roughness ;  surface roughness
"Global, regional, and national minimum estimates of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death, by age and family circumstance up to Oct 31, 2021: an updated modelling study","Background: In the 6 months following our estimates from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, the proliferation of new coronavirus variants, updated mortality data, and disparities in vaccine access increased the amount of children experiencing COVID-19-associated orphanhood. To inform responses, we aimed to model the increases in numbers of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death, as well as the cumulative orphanhood age-group distribution and circumstance (maternal or paternal orphanhood). Methods: We used updated excess mortality and fertility data to model increases in minimum estimates of COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver deaths from our original study period of March 1, 2020–April 30, 2021, to include the new period of May 1–Oct 31, 2021, for 21 countries. Orphanhood was defined as the death of one or both parents; primary caregiver loss included parental death or the death of one or both custodial grandparents; and secondary caregiver loss included co-residing grandparents or kin. We used logistic regression and further incorporated a fixed effect for western European countries into our previous model to avoid over-predicting caregiver loss in that region. For the entire 20-month period, we grouped children by age (0–4 years, 5–9 years, and 10–17 years) and maternal or paternal orphanhood, using fertility contributions, and we modelled global and regional extrapolations of numbers of orphans. 95% credible intervals (CrIs) are given for all estimates. Findings: The number of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death is estimated to have increased by 90·0% (95% CrI 89·7–90·4) from April 30 to Oct 31, 2021, from 2 737 300 (95% CrI 1 976 100–2 987 000) to 5 200 300 (3 619 400–5 731 400). Between March 1, 2020, and Oct 31, 2021, 491 300 (95% CrI 485 100–497 900) children aged 0–4 years, 736 800 (726 900–746 500) children aged 5–9 years, and 2 146 700 (2 120 900–2 174 200) children aged 10–17 years are estimated to have experienced COVID-19-associated orphanhood. Globally, 76·5% (95% CrI 76·3–76·7) of children were paternal orphans, whereas 23·5% (23·3–23·7) were maternal orphans. In each age group and region, the prevalence of paternal orphanhood exceeded that of maternal orphanhood. Interpretation: Our findings show that numbers of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death almost doubled in 6 months compared with the amount after the first 14 months of the pandemic. Over the entire 20-month period, 5·0 million COVID-19 deaths meant that 5·2 million children lost a parent or caregiver. Our data on children's ages and circumstances should support pandemic response planning for children globally.

Mechanical performance of modified Polypropylene/Polyamide matrix reinforced with treated recycled carbon fibers for lightweight applications,"This research paper reports light-weighting future mobility system by modification of recycled carbon fiber composites (RCF). Virgin carbon fiber (VCF) from defense and aerospace sectors needs significant innovation for their high value reutilizations. RCF for composites is at its infancy and fundamental research gap remains to enhance fiber adhesion by its surface science as well as a cost-effective process engineering. A 25% in weight of non-treated versus 400 °C thermally treated VCF and RCF were added in a bi-phase polymer blend of polypropylene (PP) / polyamide 12 (PA12). Results demonstrated 17.7% improved mechanical strength with surface thermodynamics designed with functional maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) and poly[methylene(polyphenyl)isocyanate] (PMPPIC). Characterization methods used included, mechanical properties, XPS, FTIR and SEM. The final recycled carbon fiber reinforced polymer (RCFRP) 20%/80% PP/PA12— PMPPIC has a better impact energy of 16.8% compared to the MAPP RCFRP chemistry without affecting hybrid matrix mechanical strength. Surface design with maleic anhydride functionality enhanced mechanical strength over impact energy for both VCF and RCF composites. Viscosity of the RCFRP composites supports the relationship between viscosity and hybrid matrix polymer adhesion behavior between both surface modifiers used. Finally, the surface energy of the modified composites elucidated the governing mechanism of fiber-matrix adhesion. The fabricated composites are recyclable and meet the stringent light-weighting requirements of many components in mobility vehicles.","Maia, Bruno Sena;Behravesh, Amir H.;Tjong, Jimi;Sain, Mohini",Journal,Journal of Polymer Research,2022-04-01,Beijing University of Chemical Technology;University of Toronto,Carbon fiber ;  Composites ;  Polymer ;  Recycled carbon fiber ;  Surface modifier
Enabling data-centric AI through data quality management and data literacy,"Data is being produced at an intractable pace. At the same time, there is an insatiable interest in using such data for use cases that span all imaginable domains, including health, climate, business, and gaming. Beyond the novel socio-technical challenges that surround data-driven innovations, there are still open data processing challenges that impede the usability of data-driven techniques. It is commonly acknowledged that overcoming heterogeneity of data with regard to syntax and semantics to combine various sources for a common goal is a major bottleneck. Furthermore, the quality of such data is always under question as the data science pipelines today are highly ad-hoc and without the necessary care for provenance. Finally, quality criteria that go beyond the syntactical and semantic correctness of individual values but also incorporate population-level constraints, such as equal parity and opportunity with regard to protected groups, play a more and more important role in this process. Traditional research on data integration was focused on post-merger integration of companies, where customer or product databases had to be integrated. While this is often hard enough, today the challenges aggravate because of the fact that more stakeholders are using data analytics tools to derive domain-specific insights. I call this phenomenon the democratization of data science, a process, which is both challenging and necessary. Novel systems need to be user-friendly in a way that not only trained database admins can handle them but also less computer science savvy stakeholders. Thus, our research focuses on scalable example-driven techniques for data preparation and curation. Furthermore, we believe that it is important to educate the breadth of society on implications of a data-driven world and actively promote the concept of data literacy as a fundamental competence.","Abedjan, Ziawasch",Journal,IT - Information Technology,2022-04-01,Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover,Data cleaning ;  Data discovery ;  Data literacy ;  Data preparation ;  Data profiling ;  Feature engineering

The Compressive Strength Prediction for FRP-Confined Concrete in Circular Columns by Applying the Normalized AlexNet-ELM and the Advanced Red Fox Optimization Algorithm,"Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP) can be widely utilized in civil engineering because of their helpful features like high corrosion resistance for aggressive surroundings and high strength to weight ratio. By providing a lateral confining pressure, the concrete compressive strength is increased. Giving an analytic model that can forecast the FRP strength is the purpose of this study. This model is according to the normalized AlexNet Extreme Learning Machine and the Advanced Red Fox Optimization Algorithm (AlexNet-ELM-ARFO). The AlexNet-ELM-ARFO algorithm's innovation includes a formulation of an analytic relation, which doesn't attend to the established effectiveness parameter that is in the models introduced in the literature. An extended empirical dataset is utilized for defining the suggested formulation's variables. The suggested model is applied to circular columns including continuous FRP. The predictions’ validation is shown by parametric research and the precision is examined by an empirical against theoretic comparison. A supplementary comparison is demonstrated with consideration of the theoretic prediction gained from the given method and the formulations’ results using significant design codes. Outcomes prove that the used method is adapted to the FRP-confined concrete design and ensures an improved precision in comparison with respect to the available competitors.","Cui, Wenming;Zhao, Li Cai;Xu, Yi Peng;Mamlooki, Mina",Journal,Advanced Theory and Simulations,2022-04-01,Tiangong University;Shandong University of Finance and Economics;National Taiwan University of Science and Technology;University of Mohaghegh Ardabili;LTD,fiber-reinforced polymers ;  optimization algorithm ;  red fox optimization ;  reinforced concrete
New frontiers of quantum computing in chemical engineering,"Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to strongly impact various sectors like finance, healthcare, communication, and technology by driving innovation across optimization and machine learning. Applications of QC in chemical, pharmaceutical, and biomolecular industries are also predicted to grow rapidly in the near future. Advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms have helped accelerate the widespread adoption of QC. Yet, despite the progress, several research gaps and challenges need to be addressed before leveraging QC for chemical engineering applications. Quantum computers offer higher computational power due to the exploitation of their quantum mechanical properties. However, not all computationally intractable problems can benefit from QC’s computational abilities. Achieving speedups over classical computing with quantum algorithms implemented on current quantum devices is possible for a few specific tasks. It is imperative to identify chemical engineering problems of practical relevance that may benefit from novel quantum techniques either with current quantum computers or of the future. Here, we present an introduction to basic concepts of QC while identifying the limitations of current quantum computers. A review of quantum algorithms that may benefit optimization and machine learning in chemical engineering with current quantum computers is also provided. This work also sets expectations for quantum devices of the future by exploring similar applications that may benefit from quantum algorithms implemented on such devices.","Ajagekar, Akshay;You, Fengqi",Journal,Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering,2022-04-01,Cornell University,Artificial Intelligence ;  Deep Learning ;  Machine Learning ;  Optimization ;  Quantum Computing

In the managerial field, recent studies show a growing attention at these topics, even if the strength of the relationship between Industry 4.0 innovations and sustainability has not yet been clarified. Given this research gap, the paper aims at studying Industry 4.0 and sustainability with its three pillars. A systematic review of the literature has been performed to analyze the main topic, the pillars of sustainability mainly considered and last, the possible outfalls of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. From a theoretical point of view, this paper contributes to the systematization of literature at the intersection between Industry 4.0 and sustainability, while from a managerial point of view it sheds light on implications and opportunities arising from considering the outfalls of innovations coming from Industry 4.0 on sustainability and its pillars.","Piccarozzi, Michela;Silvestri, Cecilia;Aquilani, Barbara;Silvestri, Luca",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-04-01,Niccolò Cusano University;Università degli Studi della Tuscia Viterbo,Industry 4.0 ;  Management ;  Pillars ;  Sustainability ;  Systematic literature review
"Mechanistic artificial intelligence (mechanistic-AI) for modeling, design, and control of advanced manufacturing processes: Current state and perspectives","Today's manufacturing processes are pushed to their limits to generate products with ever-increasing quality at low costs. A prominent hurdle on this path arises from the multiscale, multiphysics, dynamic, and stochastic nature of many manufacturing systems, which motivated many innovations at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and manufacturing sciences. This study reviews recent advances in Mechanistic-AI, defined as a methodology that combines the raw mathematical power of AI methods with mechanism-driven principles and engineering insights. Mechanistic-AI solutions are systematically analyzed for three aspects of manufacturing processes, i.e., modeling, design, and control, with a focus on approaches that can improve data requirements, generalizability, explainability, and capability to handle challenging and heterogeneous manufacturing data. Additionally, we introduce a corpus of cutting-edge Mechanistic-AI methods that have shown to be very promising in other scientific fields but yet to be applied in manufacturing. Finally, gaps in the knowledge and under-explored research directions are identified, such as lack of incorporating manufacturing constraints into AI methods, lack of uncertainty analysis, and limited reproducibility and established benchmarks. This paper shows the immense potential of the Mechanistic-AI to address new problems in manufacturing systems and is expected to drive further advancements in manufacturing and related fields.","Mozaffar, Mojtaba;Liao, Shuheng;Xie, Xiaoyu;Saha, Sourav;Park, Chanwook;Cao, Jian;Liu, Wing Kam;Gan, Zhengtao",Journal,Journal of Materials Processing Technology,2022-04-01,Robert R.

The dynamics of public spending on sustainable green economy: role of technological innovation and industrial structure effects,"In order to achieve the goal of sustainable green economic development, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the efficiency of the green economy and compare it with emission reductions. The green economy idea is a much-discussed solution to economic growth. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of government spending on the performance of the green economy of various countries under the “Belt and Road” (BRI) initiative project. The data were analyzed using the BRI economy panel data from 2008 to 2018. The generalized method of moments (GMM) was used to estimate the effect of government expenditures on education and research and development (R&D) on green economic performance index (GEE) in BRI countries. The results reveal that during the study period, BRI countries have experienced an upward transition towards green development, except for Pakistan and Bangladesh; their GEE decreased gradually from 2010 to 2018. Further, the findings of the system GMM revealed that both education and R&D have a positive impact on the green economy. Moreover, the compositional and technological effects of the overall sample were verified with the GMM process. Nevertheless, the sub-sample results revealed a heterogeneous impact on countries with a high per capita GDP. Following the results, useful policy measures for promoting sustainable green economic development have been proposed.","Yumei, Hou;Iqbal, Wasim;Irfan, Muhammad;Fatima, Arooj",Journal,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2022-04-01,Ilma University;Beijing Institute of Technology;Shenzhen University;Yangen University,BRI countries ;  Government spending ;  Green economy ;  Sustainability ;  Technology innovation
Ethics of climate engineering: Don't forget technology has an ethical aspect too,"Climate change may well be the most important issue of the 21st century and the world's response, in the form of ‘Climate Engineering’, is therefore of equal pre-eminent importance. However, while there are technological challenges, there are equally just as important ethical challenges that these technologies also generate. Governments, funding agencies and non-governmental organisations increasingly recognise the importance of incorporating ethics into the development of emerging technologies (for example, within the EU draft legislation on AI). As the world faces the global challenge of climate change there are urgent efforts to develop strategies so that responses to the climate problems do not reproduce more of the same. Ethical values from the onset are fundamental to this process and need highlighting. Hence, this paper analyses a series of ethical codes, framework and guidelines of the new emerging technologies of climate engineering (CE) through a review of both published academic literature and grey literature from either industry, government, and non-governmental (NGO) organisations. This paper was developed as part of a collaboration with international partners from TechEthos (TechEthos receives funding from the EU H2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101006249; Ethics of Emerging Technologies), an EU-funded project that deals with the ethics of the new and emerging technologies anticipated to have high socio-economic impact. Our findings have identified the following ethical considerations including autonomy, freedom, integrity, human rights and privacy in the developmental process of climate engineering, while a poverty of ethical values reflecting dignity and trust were noted.","Brooks, Laurence;Cannizzaro, Sara;Umbrello, Steven;Bernstein, Michael J.;Richardson, Kathleen",Journal,International Journal of Information Management,2022-04-01,"The Department of Values, Technology and Innovation, TU Delft;Austrian Institute of Technology;De Montfort University",Autonomy ;  Climate engineering ;  Codes ;  Ethics ;  Frameworks ;  Freedom ;  Guidelines ;  Human rights ;  Integrity ;  Privacy
Review on Anti-cancer and Anti-microbial Applications of Curdlan Biomaterials,"Polysaccharides are polymers of natural origin that are formed by microorganisms, animals and plants. Polysaccharides play an important part in the progress of living creatures because these are important particles for various life activities. These biologically derived polysaccharides are interesting because of their important characteristics like biodegradability, non-toxicity availability, biocompatibility, stability and low-cost production. In the recent years, biomaterials of polysaccharide origin have become innovative research goal in the arena of material science and engineering since polysaccharides establish a significant constituent of life matter and shows outstanding properties, which are the representative features of biomaterials. Polysaccharide biomaterials have been broadly proposed as scaffold materials in tissue engineering applications as gene carriers and for drug delivery systems. Curdlan is a class of natural polymer with exceptional pharmacological characteristics and has the capability to form single and triple helical structures with various biological important bioactive molecules for anticancer and antimicrobial applications. Curdlan is favorable for increasing the solubility in comparison to other polysaccharides therefore provides the possibilities for processing this polysaccharide with bioactive molecules into biomacromolecules of desired functions. Curdlan conjugated with various anticancer and antimicrobial agents have been explored, either as a delivery carrier for the drug or as a biomaterial with the drug. This review summarized almost all studies of curdlan with anticancer, antimicrobial applications, the analysis of different curdlan formulations and the influence of bioactive molecules on their anticancer and antimicrobial properties.","Ganie, Showkat Ali;Rather, Luqman Jameel;Li, Qing",Journal,Journal of Polymers and the Environment,2022-04-01,Southwest University,Anticancer ;  Antimicrobial ;  Curdlan ;  Polysaccharide
The Five Diamond Method for Explorative Business Process Management,"Explorative business process management (BPM) is attracting increasing interest in the literature and professional practice. Organizations have recognized that a focus on operational efficiency is no longer sufficient when disruptive forces can make the value proposition of entire processes obsolete. So far, however, research on how to create entirely new processes has remained largely conceptual, leaving it open how explorative BPM can be put into practice. Following the design science research paradigm and situational method engineering, we address this research gap by proposing a method called the Five Diamond Method. This method guides explorative BPM activities by supporting organizations in identifying opportunities from business and technology trends and integrating them into business processes with novel value propositions. The method is evaluated against literature-backed design objectives and competing artifacts, qualitative data gathered from BPM practitioners, as well as a pilot study and two real-world applications. This research provides two contributions. First, the Five Diamond Method broadens the scope of BPM by integrating prescriptive knowledge from innovation management. Second, the method supports capturing emerging opportunities arising from changing customer needs and digital technologies.","Grisold, Thomas;Groß, Steven;Stelzl, Katharina;vom Brocke, Jan;Mendling, Jan;Röglinger, Maximilian;Rosemann, Michael",Journal,Business and Information Systems Engineering,2022-04-01,Universität Liechtenstein;Universität Bayreuth;Queensland University of Technology;WU Vienna University of Economics and Business,Ambidextrous BPM ;  Business process management ;  Design science research ;  Digital technologies ;  Explorative BPM ;  Innovation management ;  Situational method engineering
STI-DUI innovation modes and firm performance in the Indian capital goods industry: Do small firms differ from large ones?,"Despite the importance of informal modes of learning and innovation for developing countries, there is little empirical evidence on their role in firm performance. This paper examines the effect of formal and informal learning modes followed by small and large firms on their overall performance in the capital goods industry. Following the wider literature on national innovation systems, we categorise the innovation modes as formal Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) and informal learning by Doing, Using and Interacting (DUI) mode. We observe that in the case of small firms the informal learning and experience-based innovation is related to improved performance, while the formal STI mode does not have any effect. On the other hand, for large firms, both STI and DUI innovation modes are positively related to their sales growth. Our results indicate that building certain DUI capabilities may act as a pre-condition to enhance the strength of science and technology-based innovation strategies.","Mathew, Nanditha;Paily, George",Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2022-04-01,United Nations University – Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology,Capabilities accumulation ;  Corporate performances ;  DUI ;  Indian capital goods industry ;  L20 ;  Modes of innovation ;  O32 ;  O33 ;  STI
Artificial Intelligence in Innovation: How to Spot Emerging Trends and Technologies,"Firms apply strategic foresight in technology and innovation management to detect discontinuous changes early, to assess their expected consequences, and to develop a future course of action enabling superior company performance. For this purpose, an ever-increasing amount of data has to be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Still, a major part of these activities is performed manually, which requires high investments in various resources. To support these processes more efficiently, this article presents an artificial-intelligence-based data mining model that helps firms spot emerging topics and trends at a higher level of automation than before. Its modular structure consists of components for query generation, data collection, data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic analysis, and visualization, combined in such a way that only a minimum amount of manual effort is required during its initial set up. The approach also incorporates self-adaptive capabilities, allowing the model to automatically update itself once new data has become available. The model parameterization is based on latest research in this area, and its threshold parameter is learnt during supervised training using a training data set. We have applied our model to an independent test data set to verify its effectiveness as an early warning system. By means of a retrospective analysis, we show in three case studies that our model is able to identify emerging technologies prior to their first publication in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies. Based on our findings, we derive both theoretical and practical implications for the technology and innovation management of firms, and we suggest future research opportunities to further advance this field.","Muhlroth, Christian;Grottke, Michael",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-04-01,GfK Group;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Artificial intelligence (AI) ;  computer-aided foresight ;  corporate foresight ;  innovation management ;  machine learning ;  strategic decision making ;  strategic foresight ;  technology management ;  trend detection
MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT AT AN ENTERPRISE THROUGH INTERNAL CONTROL AUGMENTATION IN THE CASE OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS,"If a national enterprise successfully enters the world market and takes a place in the world system of labor differentiation (or in international business), this fact is likely to guarantee sustainable development to the company, and taken in a large scale, to the national economy as a whole. This is confirmed by the experience of a number of countries, both indisputable long-standing leaders, such as the United States, the EU, and Japan, and new economic leaders, i.e. China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. We believe that this experience can be useful for Ukraine, as well. Using ample statistical material and research papers on the problem as a basis for our research, we have studied a number of issues of the world market development, and especially those of the market of machine-building products, namely: some tendencies prevailing in these markets, the main risks associated with entering and functioning in these markets, some possible directions of their development, and the development of enterprises and business entities operating in them. Some requirements to the enterprises functioning in the environment in question are defined, first of all, in the following spheres: labor productivity; capacity utilization; the technical level, quality and cost of production; the level, quality, content and scope of research and development work; the whole set of issues related to the development, production and promotion of products in the national and world markets. The paper identifies some priority areas, or segments, in which Ukrainian machine-building enterprises can succeed in the world market. The paper studies the role and place of accounting, internal control, and internal audit in the management system at an enterprise, as well as their influence on the results of financial and economic activity of business entities, and on their success in the world market, in the system of international business. The paper examines some of the most significant, from our point of view, current realities in which Ukrainian enterprises, together with their management and management systems, will have to work. The authors believe that the results of the study, after some adjustment, can be extended to enterprises in other sectors of the economy.","Semenets, ;Datsenko, G.;Panfilov, O.;Kuzkin, Yе;Pankratova, O.",Journal,Financial and Credit Activity: Problems of Theory and Practice,2022-03-31,Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University;State University of Trade and Economics;V.

Research on Architecture of Local Domain Application Based on Radio Frequency Identification,"Along with the speedy improvement of sensing systems, wireless transmission technology, and faster and faster chip, the scope of application of the Internet of things (IoT) has substantially and rapidly increased, and research and innovation that integrate artificial intelligence. At same time, campus application construction as the foundation of intelligence education is being on the march, which demands newly emerging computer technologies support, such as IoT, AI, Big data and so on. In this study, we provide an architecture of smart campus based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) which can offer new solutions to solve some problems such as position, identification, store information and so on because of its strong anti-interference capability and non-intrusiveness, as core technology of IoT. Then based on this architecture, a kind of intelligent campus application system scheme is proposed, which can realize the function of automatic identity recognition, book reading, internal consumption, student positions. Moreover, for some special exact location demands, this paper proposes a method to precisely measure RFID tag location based on triangulation principle, which is embedded in the architecture. The application of Internet of things technology can better promote some origination or company efficiency, such as more efficient service for teachers' and students' work, study and life.","Li, Tingshun;Liu, Zesan;Wang, Dadi;Ma, Suling",Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2022-03-29,"North China Electric Power University;State Grid Information and Telecommunication Group Co.

Enhancing online security using selective DOM approach to counter phishing attacks,"Today's computer era has paved the way for innovations like self-driving cars, quantum computing, and other ingenious advancements. As technology advances at a rapid pace, some issues yet remain unresolved. One of the issues is phishing, which dates back to the 1980s. Phishing is an art used by cybercriminals from the 1980s until to date targeting online users to harvest financial, confidential, and other sensitive information. The art and the methodologies used by cybercriminals have not evolved much from the AOL (American online) heydays. However, the counter mechanisms to defeat phishing have undergone considerable changes over the past two decades. Although sophisticated antiphishing systems are in place, statistics shows that phishing is a major threat. Our practical research proves that one of the state-of-the-art antiphishing systems can be bypassed using simple techniques. The research further demonstrates why today's antiphishing mechanisms fail and the need for a novel mechanism that will identify the authenticity of the website. In this manuscript, an antiphishing algorithm, PhishSec (PH-Sec), is introduced. PhishSec will not consider the URL of the website as the primary factor to determine the authenticity, rather take a reverse approach where the URL of the website is derived by analyzing the content of the visited website to establish its authenticity. To accomplish this, the HTML DOM (document object model) of a given web page on load is considered. This manuscript quotes the research results of the analysis of a state-of-the-art antiphishing system along with the introduced algorithm to counter-attack phishing. The introduced system detects phishing attacks with 99.21% of accuracy.","Nirmal, K.;Janet, B.;Kumar, R.",Journal,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2022-03-25,Wipro Limited;National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli,cyber security ;  e-crime ;  online security ;  online threats ;  password stealing ;  pharming ;  phishing ;  quantum computing ;  social engineering
"Scalability, Sustainability, and Ethicality of Multimodal Learning Analytics","Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) innovations are commonly aimed at supporting learners in physical learning spaces through state-of-the-art sensing technologies and analysis techniques. Although a growing body of MMLA research has demonstrated the potential benefits of sensor-based technologies in education, whether their use can be scalable, sustainable, and ethical remains questionable. Such uncertainty can limit future research and the potential adoption of MMLA by educational stakeholders in authentic learning situations. To address this, we systematically reviewed the methodological, operational, and ethical challenges faced by current MMLA works that can affect the scalability and sustainability of future MMLA innovations. A total of 96 peer-reviewed articles published after 2010 were included. The findings were summarised into three recommendations, including i) improving reporting standards by including sufficient details about sensors, analysis techniques, and the full disclosure of evaluation metrics, ii) fostering interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in learning analytics, software, and hardware engineering to develop affordable sensors and upgrade MMLA innovations that used discontinued technologies, and iii) developing ethical guidelines to address the potential risks of bias, privacy, and equality concerns with using MMLA innovations. Through these future research directions, MMLA can remain relevant and eventually have actual impacts on educational practices.","Yan, Lixiang;Zhao, Linxuan;Gasevic, Dragan;Martinez-Maldonado, Roberto",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-03-21,Monash University,ethics ;  learning analytics ;  learning analytics ;  multimodal ;  scalability ;  sensors ;  sustainability
Research and Application of Prefabricated Structure Construction Technology for Metro Station,"First, the research and implementation of prefabricated metro station structure and construction technology in recent 10 years are briefly discussed, involving a significant number of technologies such as structural design, component manufacturing, and construction technology. Second, the technical scheme of prefabricated structure is clarified based on the Changchun metro line 2 test station project, including overall technical orientation, structure selection, and structure system. The research contents and primary achievements of scientific and technological innovation are systematically introduced, including comprehensive joint technology, structural static, dynamic mechanical behavior and mechanical behavior of closed cavity thin-walled components, joint grouting technology, joint waterproof technology, production technology of large prefabricated components, construction technology and equipment, and multi-professional integration technology of station. The innovative technologies′ technical, economic, and social benefits are also examined, as well as the promotion and implementation situation is summarized. Finally, the prefabricated structure construction technology is initially developed to solve the challenge that metro station construction cannot be achieved in the cold winter season. However, the engineering practices prove that the implementation of prefabricated technology in other environmental conditions provides irreplaceable benefits, such as high quality, high efficiency, safety, green, and environmental safety. This technology is widely applicable and suitable for the construction of metro running tunnels, pedestrian passageways, highway tunnels, underground utility tunnels, and other opencut underground structures.","Yang, Xiuren",Journal,Tunnel Construction,2022-03-20,Ltd.;National Engineering Laboratory for Green & Safe Construction Technology in Urban Rail Transit,closed cavity thin-walled component ;  fully prefabricated structure ;  grouted mortise-tenon joint ;  prefabricated metro station
A Governance Framework for Implementation of Scientific and Engineering Innovation in Buried Infrastructure Systems,"This article draws on experience within a pervasive sensing research project, the Pipebots project. The aim of the project is to design miniature robots to gather physical condition and environmental data on buried pipe networks, using potable water distribution and wastewater pipe systems as the initial target applications. One of the challenges of the project is to anticipate and address the potential governance issues triggered by the project. Due to the lack of a suitable tool with sufficient breadth to guide thinking, the existing literature has been drawn upon to form the basis of a governance framework for use in infrastructure projects. Whilst the original intention was to be alert to and interrogate the forms of governance that may impact on new infrastructure interventions, what is emerging is a tool that would support the strategy for implementation, improve the design (a no-regrets design policy) and help build the business case for the transformational change the project envisages.","Shrimpton, Elisabeth A.;Hunt, Dexter V.L.;Rogers, Christopher D.F.",Journal,Frontiers in Sustainable Cities,2022-03-18,University of Birmingham,business case ;  framework ;  governance ;  infrastructure ;  justice ;  pervasive sensing ;  transformation ;  water and waste water

Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate - a step towards a sustainable nitrogen cycle,"Nitrate enrichment, which is mainly caused by the over-utilization of fertilisers and industrial sewage discharge, is a major global engineering challenge because of its negative influence on the environment and human health. To solve this serious problem, many technologies, such as the activated sludge method, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, adsorption, and electrodialysis, have been developed to reduce the nitrate levels in water bodies. However, the applications of these traditional techniques are limited by several drawbacks, such as a long sludge retention time, slow kinetics, and undesirable by-products. From an environmental perspective, the most promising nitrate reduction technology is enabled to convert nitrate into benign N2, and features low cost, high efficiency, and environmental friendliness. Recently, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction has been proven by satisfactory research achievements to be one of the most promising methods among these technologies. This review provides a comprehensive account of nitrate reduction using electrocatalysis methods. The fundamentals of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction, including the reaction mechanisms, reactor design principles, product detection methods, and performance evaluation methods, have been systematically summarised. A detailed introduction to electrocatalytic nitrate reduction on transition metals, especially noble metals and alloys, Cu-based electrocatalysts, and Fe-based electrocatalysts is provided, as they are essential for the accurate reporting of experimental results. The current challenges and potential opportunities in this field, including the innovation of material design systems, value-added product yields, and challenges for products beyond N2 and large-scale sewage treatment, are highlighted.","Xu, Hui;Ma, Yuanyuan;Chen, Jun;Zhang, Wei Xian;Yang, Jianping",Journal,Chemical Society Reviews,2022-03-11,Tongji University;University of Wollongong;Donghua University,
Scientific activity evaluation in Cuban universities: Analysis based on Scival (2011-2021),"Objective. The study aims to analyze indicators of production, collaboration, visibility, impact, and innovation of Cuban universities through Scival during the period 2012-2021. Design/Methodology/Approach. The study design is non-experimental (cross-sectional) and quanti-tative (descriptive). Eleven Cuban universities were identified in Scival. The indicators were delimited in a time window of 10 years (2012-2021). We analized the results based on 21 indicators covering scientific output, thematic categories, collaboration, visibility, and scientific and patent impact. Results/Discussion. 59.7% of the scientific output is produced by the University of Havana (UH) and the Central University of Las Villas (UCLV). There is a high specialization in engineering and computational sci-ences. Basic sciences such as mathematics, chemistry and physics are highlighted. 62.1% of the scientific output has been cited. The works’ distribution by journals’ quartiles revealed that 47.3% of the production had been published in 50% of the top Scopus journals during the last ten years. Low performance in innovation and social impact through patents was evidenced. Only UH and UCLV are highlighted. Conclusions. Scival is highly useful for conducting more effective institutional scientific production studies and establishing comparisons of multiple indicators. The biases offered by the tool are min-imized, thus offering reliable information for decision-making. The study revealed essential data on Cuban universities’ scientific output in Scopus in the last ten years. This is useful for science managers, decision-makers, researchers, and publishers.

Innovation industry-university cooperation and enterprise innovation performance in the Yangtze River Delta: Scale and effect,"Industry-university cooperation network is an important aspect of the construction of the innovation community in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). However, the current economic geography research focuses on the local scale and global scale. More omparative research on the effect of multi-scale industry-university cooperation needs to be carried out by economic geographers. Based on the IncoPat patent data from 2001-2017, this paper discusses the relationship between innovation industry-university cooperation and enterprise innovation performance from the perspective of scale and effect. Spatial pattern analysis and panel OLS analysis are the main methods used in this paper. The conclusions of this paper are as follows: (1) The spatial pattern of innovation industry-university cooperation in the Yangtze River Delta presents a star-shaped structure with provincial capital cities as the center. The dominant position of core cities in the network can help themselves to obtain innovation resources in the network. And the unbalanced distribution of university resources further consolidates the dominant position of provincial capital cities, which makes the pattern of innovation industry-university cooperation in the YRD have obvious characteristics of path dependence. (2) The impact of innovation industry-university cooperation on enterprise innovation performance in provincial and regional scales is significantly higher than that in other scales. On the one hand, the optimal scale of innovation industry-university cooperation has gradually evolved from the provincial scale to the regional scale during the integration of the YRD. On the other hand, the regional service characteristics of universities lead to the regional attribute of innovation industry-university cooperation. Therefore, the local or global scale has little explanatory power for the law of industry-university cooperation in China. It is particularly important to objectively view the role of universities in the process of spatial innovation from the regional scale. (3) There is a significant inverted ""U"" relationship between the average distance of innovation industry-university cooperation and enterprise innovation performance in the YRD. And the role and extreme point of innovation industry-university cooperation in engineering colleges are the largest among all types of colleges. Therefore, we need to pay attention to the differences brought about by the types of universities. This paper puts forward the following suggestions. We should speed up the construction of industry-university cooperation system focusing on regional scale. In addition, we should strengthen the construction of multi-scale coupling network of industry university cooperation in weak areas, and strive to enhance the network status of weak areas.","Mi, Zefeng;Shang, Yongmin;Xu, Weixiang;Zeng, Gang;Zhou, Can",Journal,Dili Yanjiu,2022-03-10,Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences;Zhejiang University of Technology;East China Normal University;Zhejiang Gongshang University,innovation industry-university cooperation ;  innovation network ;  innovation perfor-mance ;  scale ;  Yangtze River Delta

Perspectives for the Upgrading of Bio-Based Vicinal Diols within the Developing European Bioeconomy,"The previous decade has witnessed a drastic increase of European incentives aimed at pushing forward the transition from an exclusively petro-based economy toward a strong and homogeneous bio-based economy. Since 2012, numerous programs have been developed to stimulate and promote research and innovation relying on sustainable and renewable resources. Terrestrial biomass is a virtually infinite reservoir of biomacromolecules, the biorefining of which provides platform molecules of low complexity yet with tremendous industrial potential. Among such bio-based platform molecules, polyols and, more specifically, molecules featuring vicinal diols have gained tremendous interest and have stimulated an increasing research effort from the chemistry and chemical engineering communities. This Review revolves around the most promising process conditions and technologies reported since 2012 that specifically target bio-based vicinal diols and promote their transformation into value-added molecules of wide industrial interest, such as olefins, epoxides, cyclic carbonates, and ketals.","Muzyka, Claire;Monbaliu, Jean Christophe M.",Journal,ChemSusChem,2022-03-08,Université de Liège,biomass ;  cyclic carbonates ;  deoxydehydration ;  platform chemicals ;  polyols
"State of the art advancement in rational design of g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> photocatalyst for efficient solar fuel transformation, environmental decontamination and future perspectives","Recently, the graphite based heterogeneous photocatalysts has attained tremendous research attention in various environmental applications. Among them, the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is categorized as a unique solar active particle with its outstanding intrinsic properties i.e., adequate band configuration, excellent light absorptivity and thermo-physical durability, which make it highly useful and reliable for revenue transformation and ecological concerns. Considering the intrinsic potential of g-C3N4 in photocatalysis, so far, no report has been done in literature for its extraordinary configuration, morphological characteristics and perspective tuning for said applications. To overcome this research gap, our primary emphasis of this review regarding photocatalysis is to provide layout as well as the advancement of visible-light-fueled materials as highly stabilized and extremely effective ones for pragmatic implementation. Thus, this existing comprehensive assessment conducts a systematic survey over visible light driven non-metal novel g-C3N4. The major advancement of this evaluation is the fabrication of well-designed nanosized g-C3N4 photocatalysts with unique configurable frameworks and compositions. Furthermore, alternative techniques in order to customize the analogue band configuration and noticeable cultivation such as metal (cation), nonmetal (anion) doping, worthy metal activating, and alloy initiation with certain semiconductors are discussed in detail. In addition to this, g-C3N4 photocatalytic functionalities towards photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, CO2 photoreduction, biological metal ions deterioration as well as bacterial sanitization are also presented and discussed in detail. Therefore, we believe that such a pivotal compact assessment can provide a roadmap in several perspectives on the currently underway obstacles in the innovation of effective g-C3N4 catalytic design processes. Moreover, this critical assessment will ultimately serve as a useful supplement in the research area of g-C3N4 nanosized photocatalysts and for the researchers working on its key aspects in diverse range of natural, chemistry, engineering and environmental applications.","Hayat, Asif;Shah Syed, Jawad Ali;Al-Sehemi, Abdullah G.;El-Nasser, Karam S.;Taha, T.

"The Needs of K-12 Computer Science Educators towards Building an Inclusive Classroom: Implications for Policy, Practice, and Research","The technology sector remains one of the fastest growing industries across the nation and continues to rapidly permeate all facets of society. The next generation of the computing workforce must be equipped with the skills to examine how existing systems exacerbate inequities, while developing the competencies to build new, more equitable innovations. To enable this shift, computer science (CS) instruction needs to develop not only students' computing identities and computational thinking, but also critical thinking and ethical reasoning. Educators are key to this transformation, yet little is known about the landscape of K-12 CS educators and how equipped they are to provide equitable CS instruction. To understand the challenges that CS educators face and identify the supports and resources to more effectively equip them to serve a diverse student body, these panelists launched a national landscape survey. This panel of experts from the Kapor Center and the Computer Science Teachers Association will reflect on the survey findings and lead a discussion with the audience about the implications of the data on the future of educational policy, practice, and research to better support CS educators to build more equitable classroom spaces.","Davis, Kalisha;Twarek, Bryan;Becton-Consuegra, Dinah;Koshy, Sonia",Conference Proceeding,SIGCSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V.2,2022-03-03,Kapor Center;Computer Science Teachers Association,cs education policy ;  cs education research ;  culturally-responsive computing ;  equity ;  k-12 computing education ;  professional development

"Construction of the Disciplinary, Academic, and Discourse Systems in the Contemporary Chinese Philosophy of Science and Technology: Retrospect and Prospect","A review of the decades of research shows that Chinese philosophy of science and technology, on the strength of carrying forward traditions and blazing new trails, has made progress in the construction of discipline system and development of institutions, teaching materials and periodicals, with deepening the discussion on discipline orientation. In academic system construction, driven by efforts to update the academic framework and deepen research on the philosophy of nature, philosophy of science, philosophy of technology, science, technology and society, as well as other traditional fields, achievements have been made in ethical reflections on high technology, engineering ethics, big data and artificial intelligence philosophy, responsible innovation and other emerging, frontier and crosscutting fields. In the construction of discourse system, work has been done to make China’s voice heard on the international stage, excavate and elucidate the excellent traditional Chinese culture, and build disciplines with Chinese characteristics. In short, the achievements of the Chinese philosophy of science and technology have not come easily. Though a diverse and dynamic academic pattern has been formed, and wonderful and unique Chinese discourse has been created, we still face some problems. To accelerate the construction of “Three Systems” of the philosophy of science and technology with Chinese characteristics by building on existing achievements, we should carry forward the tradition of dialectics of nature and strengthen the guidance of Marxism, consolidate the foundation of philosophy and support interdisciplinary interaction and cooperation, track the frontiers of science and technology, and pay attention to the social operation of science and technology.","Huanjie, Lei",Journal,Frontiers of Philosophy in China,2022-03-01,Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,academic system ;  dialectics of nature ;  discipline system ;  discourse system ;  philosophy of science and technology
Innovations in Peripheral Nerve Injury: Current Concepts and Emerging Techniques to Improve Recovery,"Despite the surgical advances in treatment of peripheral nerve injuries, consistent recovery of function is limited suggesting that a multimodal approach is required to optimize nerve regeneration. This approach should include advanced surgical repair techniques, as well as tissue engineering, cellular therapies, and application of local and systemic modulators of neuroregeneration.

Running and Managing Shared Resources for Scientific Research: A Model from Biofoundry,"Biofoundry represents an excellent model for building and sustaining shared facilities for collaborative research and innovation. Biofoundry is a place where biological engineering meets automation. The biofoundry facility comprises many analytical instruments and precision robots to conduct experiments and automate at a large scale. Building, maintaining, and running a biofoundry requires adequate funding, skilled technicians and scientists, and a good business model. India does not have a long and successful history of building shared facilities for scientific research. However, Indian scientists will have to embrace the culture of sharing resources and facilities to conduct collaborative research to remain globally competitive. In this context, the challenges, and opportunities of biofoundry serve as a case in point for all future shared resources for scientific research and innovation. The unmet need of the nation is a policy framework for building large shared facilities leading to the optimal utilization of the technological and expertise resources, bring down the cost of doing science, and accelerate innovation.","Panda, Binay;Dhar, Pawan K.",Journal,Asian Biotechnology and Development Review,2022-03-01,Jawaharlal Nehru University,Biofoundries Alliance ;  Build-Operate-Transfer ;  Engineering biology ;  Public-Private- Partnership
Technological innovation vs. tightening raw material markets: falling battery costs put at risk,"The reduction of battery costs is a key enabler for an economically viable transition towards a climateneutral society. Despite market analysts being concerned about rising raw material prices, across forecasting studies, battery costs are expected to decline in the future. Respective authors base their cost estimates on past material price developments and do not rely on explicit technology roadmaps. This study integrates both future material price expectations and cost reductions driven by technological innovation. Therefore, a roadmap is defined for automotive battery technology and its production process throughout 2030, based on market expectations and expert knowledge. This roadmap is translated into year-over-year cell cost by two engineering-based, bottom-up material and process cost models and, at current raw material prices, a decline from above 100 to around 70 $ kW h-1 in 2030 is forecasted. The simulation of analysts' price expectations for critical materials reveals that this decline might significantly flatten or, in the most pessimistic case, vanish completely. A particularly high risk for cell cost is associated with the nickel price and consequently, implications for research and industry are outlined for its mitigation.","Mauler, Lukas;Lou, Xixue;Duffner, Fabian;Lekera, Jens",Journal,Energy Advances,2022-03-01,Dr. Ing. h.c.

Review of the progress of geological research on coalbed methane co-production,"Coalbed methane (CBM) co-production is an important way to improve the efficiency of CBM development in multi-seam areas, but the special nature of reservoir formation makes the co-mining method and production effect complex and variable, which presents challenges for efficient development. Experts in the field of CBM from China have carried out a lot of basic research and engineering practice on CBM reservoir formation and the feasibility of co-production in multiple seams, which have gained fruitful results, providing strong support for deepening the CBM geological theory and promoting industrial development. To provide reference for subsequent research, engineering implementation and industrial construction, this paper systematically analyzes and reviews the latest research progress in the field of CBM co-production geology in China from four aspects: reservoir formation theory of stacked CBM systems; co-production geological constraints; co-production feasibility identification method; and co-production reservoir damage. The main understandings can be summarized as follows. (1) The sequence gas control mechanism of the accumulation of the stacked CBM systems and the later modification effect of rock formation and ground stress are deepened. The hydro-geochemical closed index of coal-measure groundwater environment is constructed, which provides a new parameter to identify the stacked gas-bearing systems and hydrodynamic conditions, and three types of stacked geological patterns of gas-bearing systems (growth type, decay type and stable type) are identified by using fluid pressure profiles. The concept of stacked CBM system is further extended to the category of coal measure gas, and the theory and method system of “co-mining compatibility” of stacked gas-bearing systems based on coal-measure composite reservoirs is proposed and applied to the pilot demonstration project of coal-measure gas co-production, which has a chieved preliminary results. (2) The Carboniferous-Permian (Taiyuan-Shanxi Formation) in North China and Late Permian (Changxing-Longtan Formation) in Western Guizhou and Eastern Yunnan are the hotspot areas for CBM co-production research and engineering practice, and the fluid pressure system and permeability differences are the most concerned geological factors in co-production. The difference in hydrodynamic conditions and fluid supply capacity of Shanxi Formation and Taiyuan Formation is an important factor limiting the CBM co-production in North China. The maximum inter-seam span, cumulative thickness, coal body structure of the coal seam in co-production in Western Guizhou and Eastern Yunnan have received more attention, and interference from shallow groundwater is the key restricting the efficiency of CBM co-production in the Zhijin Block. (3) Productivity analysis, physical simulation, numerical simulation, and geochemical analysis of produced water are important methods to identify the feasibility and interference of CBM co-production. The basic idea, technical template and evaluation process for analyzing the produced water source and identifying the degree of fluid interference in the co-production wells based on the geochemistry of produced water, as well as the production layer contribution analysis method based on the peaking and identification of the gas-production curve, have been proposed. The continuous maturity and innovation of technical methods provide strong support for the optimization and efficiency improvement of CBM co-production engineering. (4) CBM co-production is more sensitive to geological conditions and engineering disturbances, and is prone to induce reservoir damage, involving Jamin effect and airlock damage induced by production layer exposure, as well as stress-sensitive and velocity-sensitive damage induced by the pressure system and permeability differences. Homogenized reservoir reconstruction, separated-pressure system development (separated-time or separated-space), and refined drainage design and control are effective ways to reduce reservoir damage.","Guo, Chen;Qin, Yong;Yi, Tongsheng;Ma, Dongmin;Wang, Shengquan;Shi, Qingmin;Bao, Yuan;Chen, Yue;Qiao, Junwei;Lu, Lingling",Journal,Meitiandizhi Yu Kantan/Coal Geology and Exploration,2022-03-01,China University of Mining and Technology;Xi'an University of Science and Technology;China National Administration of Coal Geology;Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Geological Support for Coal Green Exploitation;Guizhou Bureau of Coal Geological Exploration,CBM co-production ;  coal-measure gas ;  geological research progress ;  interference discrimination ;  produced-water ;  reservoir damage ;  stacked gas-bearing system
Diversity Unlocks Creativity and Innovation,"Aresearch lab (Optical-Bio Microsystem Laboratory), where international students are working toward their PhD and master s degrees along with senior researchers, is like a unit cell in the body of the university (Concordia University, Montreal, Canada). What better model can be available for analyzing the success of research that comes from providing a supportive and inclusive work environment that welcomes and encourages students from a diversity of countries, languages, and religious and socioeconomic backgrounds? Instead of the rather outdated metaphor of melting pot, the environment of our lab is rather like a mosaic, where the inlaying small colored squares are the individual skills that fit in and enrich our culture with wisdom, intelligence, and new ways of thinking. Our highly multidisciplinary lab is a bonus as our students have a special gift to integrate knowledge from different fields, for example, engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and fine arts, and to think differently and form new perspectives, outside the box, when making connections. This paper also presents the mechanism that was instrumental in making the women researchers as well as the international students feel comfortable and helped them to explore and contribute to the multidisciplinary aspects of our lab. In this paper, we highlight the important milestones in our lab work environment over the last fifteen years, with a focus on diversity, and we stress the beneficial role of the direction of the lab and the diversifying faculty, providing critically needed role models to our students. We emphasize the strength of diversity that unlocks imagination and intellectual curiosity.

Research progress and development direction of key technologies for efficient coalbed methane development in China,"During the 13th Five Year Plan period, the major problem of the low output of a single well of coalbed methane (CBM) has restricted the efficient development of CBM in China. Through Major National Science and Technology Projects and other technical researches, significant progress has been made in the theoretical understanding and engineering technology of CBM exploration and development. It is manifested in four aspects as follows. Firstly, the exploration concept has changed from looking for rich dessert areas to high-yield dessert areas, and the extensive development deployment has become finer. Secondly, in terms of efficient stimulation technology, with the expansion from two-dimensional seimic to three-dimensional seimic and from vertical wells (cluster wells) to horizontal wells, a new series of fracturing stimulation technologies for coal reservoirs transformation are developed, including indirect fracturing of crushed soft coal, multi-cluster acid fracturing of few sections of horizontal wells applied to calcite filled deep coal seams, and ultra-large-scale limit fracturing of horizontal wells in ultra-low permeability deep coal seams. These technologies have preliminarily solved the problem of economic benefit development of structural coal CBM, broken through the bottleneck of fracturing technology in coal seams with a depth of more than 2 000 m, and promoted the extension of CBM development from medium-shallow layers to deep layers. Thirdly, in terms of drainage and production technology, key technologies such as quantitative drainage and production multi-objective optimization design, CBM well rodless lifting and negative pressure drainage technology have been developed, promoting the transformation of CBM drainage and production control from qualitative to semi-quantitative and quantitative, solving the drainage and production problems of integrated cluster well groups and downward inclined horizontal wells, and effectively improving the production of single wells and the recovery rate of CBM. At last, in terms of stable production and stimulation technology, the innovative technologies are proposed, including stress release gas production of large-diameter horizontal wells and controllable temperature nitrogen injection displacement and stimulation of CBM, which provides technical reserves for the secondary development of CBM. In view of the stage characteristics of China’s CBM industry in the “climbing period” and “strategic opportunity period”, and the goal of the “carbon peak and neutrality”, based on the technical problems that need to be solved, this paper puts forward the “two-step” development strategy of China’s CBM industry. (1) By 2025, breakthroughs will be made in theory and technology, reaching the national target of 10 billion cubic meters per year in the 14th Five Year Plan, and strengthening confidence in industrial development. (2) By 2030, applicable technologies for different geological conditions in China will be formed, reaching the target of annual output of 30 billion cubic meters, and becoming an important part of natural gas production. The corresponding countermeasures are as follows. From the perspective of technology and management, according to the five elements of resources, technology, talents, policy and investment, and in line with the principle of “technological breakthrough as the core, five in one and collaborative innovation”, supporting safeguard measures are studied, formulated and implemented. Moreover, from the two aspects of efficient development and increasing the output of single well, theoretical research and technical research directions in nine aspects related to the future development of CBM industry are put forward, so as to achieve the goal of realizing the high-quality development of national CBM industry.","Xu, Fengyin;Yan, Xia;Lin, Zhenpan;Li, Shuguang;Xiong, Xianyue;Yan, Detian;Wang, Hongya;Zhang, Shuangyuan;Xu, Borui;Ma, Xinyuan;Bai, Nan;Mei, Yonggui",Journal,Meitiandizhi Yu Kantan/Coal Geology and Exploration,2022-03-01,China University of Geosciences;Ltd.;PetroChina Huabei Oilfield Company;PetroChina Coalbed Methane Company Limited,coalbed methane ;  development direction ;  drainage and production ;  efficient stimulation ;  exploration ;  technical progress
Research progress of surfactant enhanced oil recovery based on microfluidics technology,"It is of great scientific significance and engineering value to enable the innovation in EOR evaluation methods for old and unconventional oilfields. Microfluidic based reservoir-on-a-chip technology simply reproduces micro- and nano-pore structure to mimic reservoir porous media and provides direct visualization of multiphase flow, mass transport and phase behaviors of fluids within these confinements. Compared to conventional core flooding tests, microfluidic approaches demonstrate unique advantages of in situ visualization, availability in micro/nano confinement, low sample consumption and time efficacy. Surfactant injection has become one of commonly used chemical flooding approaches due to its excellent performance in mitigating interfacial tensions. In recent years, both academic and industrial community have witnessed a growing trend in research on evaluation of surfactant-based EOR using microfluidics. In this paper, we summarized the up-to-date research progress on microfluidics-based surfactant EOR evaluation, including the typical experimental apparatus, the mechanisms of emulsification and non-emulsification of oil-aqueous multiphase system in micropores and microchannels, and, specific case studies covering a variety of typical reservoirs.

Optimizing the complexities of unforeseen risk in healthcare with innovation and technology: a proposed framework,"Today, healthcare must be willing to take risks while advancing clinical transformation, starting from research to innovations, patient care technicians to physicians, management thinking lean to maximizing inventory flow, building a supply chain of healthcare workers to allowing engineering strategies, and building community facilities to establishing remote reusable facilities. In recent months, the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) has changed everyone’s perspective globally. The United States healthcare system is linked with financial needs. The stakeholders must understand the growth and possibility of the unforeseen new medical risks, including how to challenge the dataset used for decision making, increasing the required acceptance level for the verification and validation of growing medical risk models, because healthcare is a stochastic system, forecasting always changes and so does the final decision of investing the cost. The global fear brought on by the ongoing pandemic is playing a major role in the economic and social consequences. Experts recommend that physicians must be willing to take over the key roles and lead these strategies, but at the same time better integration of engineering fields can play a huge role in helping physicians to understand the strategies. It is very important to help them craft a solution that healthcare workers can stick to.

Narrative review: craniofacial bone regeneration—where are we now?,"Background and Objective: The craniofacial structures are complex and esthetically the most important component of appearance. Defects in this region lead to noticeable deformities that are physically and psychologically devastating to patients. Advances in grafting and tissue transfer techniques have improved the surgical outcomes but our ability to fully regenerate the lost or defective tissue is limited. The purpose of this narrative review is to give attention to the advances that have been made towards the development of new techniques to reconstruct craniofacial bony defects using a tissue engineering approach. The aim is to bring together up to date knowledge about biomaterials that make up an ideal scaffold; different stem cell sources and their uses; growth factors and methods of delivery to defect sites; and gene therapy techniques through different vectors. Methods: A detailed data-based search using google scholar was performed looking for articles in English with the search including the following terms: bone regeneration, tissue engineering, craniofacial reconstruction, scaffolds, osteoinductive growth factors. The search was supplemented checking references of relevant review articles. Key Content and Findings: Currently, research and clinical approaches to achieve craniofacial bone regeneration are attempting to shift to new techniques to avoid intensive surgeries. Considering new technology and biomaterials, techniques are aimed at targeting delivery of specific cellular components and factors that influence the growth of native bone. Currently no method investigated has been proven to fulfil all characteristics needed to replace autologous grafting as the new gold standard. Conclusions: Currently the gold standard for craniofacial bone regeneration is still autologous grafting, but the invasiveness and surgical morbidities involved has prompted research to explore further options. This narrative review concludes that: the incorporation of computer aided designs have advanced our ability to mimic the configurations, morphologic traits and mechanical function of the native site; the recently developed techniques to obtain and process stem cells from new sources, have potentiated our ability to regenerate bone with ease; incorporation of growth factors, show promise in their regeneration ability; innovations in gene therapy and vectors have demonstrated successful bone regenerations capabilities. With advances in all aspects, we are inching closer to discovering a new gold standard.","Khazaal, Hadi;Helman, Joseph",Journal,Frontiers of Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine,2022-03-01,Case Western Reserve University,Bone regeneration ;  craniofacial reconstruction ;  tissue engineering
Polysaccharides and Metal Nanoparticles for Functional Textiles: A Review,"Nanotechnology is a powerful tool for engineering functional materials that has the potential to transform textiles into high-performance, value-added products. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the development of functional textiles using metal nanoparticles (MNPs). The incorporation of MNPs in textiles allows for the obtention of multifunctional properties, such as ultraviolet (UV) protection, self-cleaning, and electrical conductivity, as well as antimicrobial, anti-static, antiwrinkle, and flame retardant properties, without compromising the inherent characteristics of the textile. Environmental sustainability is also one of the main motivations in development and innovation in the textile industry. Thus, the synthesis of MNPs using ecofriendly sources, such as polysaccharides, is of high importance. The main functions of polysaccharides in these processes are the reduction and stabilization of MNPs, as well as the adhesion of MNPs onto fabrics. This review covers the major research attempts to obtain textiles with different functional properties using polysaccharides and MNPs. The main polysaccharides reported include chitosan, alginate, starch, cyclodextrins, and cellulose, with silver, zinc, copper, and titanium being the most explored MNPs. The potential applications of these functionalized textiles are also reported, and they include healthcare (wound dressing, drug release), protection (antimicrobial activity, UV protection, flame retardant), and environmental remediation (catalysts).","Fernandes, Marta;Padrão, Jorge;Ribeiro, Ana I.;Fernandes, Rui D.V.;Melro, Liliana;Nicolau, Talita;Mehravani, Behnaz;Alves, Cátia;Rodrigues, Rui;Zille, Andrea",Journal,Nanomaterials,2022-03-01,Universidade do Minho,Alginate ;  Cellulose ;  Chitosan ;  Cyclodextrin ;  Functional textiles ;  Metal nanoparticles ;  Polysaccharides ;  Starch
Climate solution or corporate co-optation? US and Canadian publics' views on agricultural gene editing,"The dexterity and affordability of gene-editing technologies promise wide-ranging applications in agriculture. Aiming to take advantage of this, proponents emphasize benefits such as the climate-mitigating promises of gene editing. Critics, on the other hand, argue that gene editing will perpetuate industrialized forms of agriculture and its concomitant environmental and social problems. Across a representative sample of US and Canadian residents (n = 1478), we investigate public views and perceptions of agricultural gene editing. We advance existing survey-based studies, which tend to focus on whether knowledge, familiarity, trust, or perceptions of naturalness predict views on gene editing. Instead, we examine whether broader societal concerns about industrialized food systems-a key claim about genetic engineering launched by critics-predicts comfort with gene editing. We also explore the predictive power of views of climate change as an urgent problem, following proponent arguments. Survey results explore gene editing views in reference to specific cases (e.g., drought-tolerant wheat) and specific alternatives (e.g., versus pesticide use). We find that people critical of industrialized food systems were most likely to express overall absolute opposition to the technology, whereas those concerned with the imminence of climate change were more likely to support climate-relevant gene editing. Our findings suggest the need for further research into the conditions upon which public groups find gene editing compelling or not-namely, if applications enhance or counter industrial food systems, or offer particular climate adaptive benefits. Furthermore, we argue that attention to broader societal priorities in surveys of perceptions may help address calls for responsible research and innovation as concerns gene editing.","Nawaz, Sara;Satterfield, Terre",Journal,PLoS ONE,2022-03-01,The University of British Columbia,
Teacher Perceptions on Virtual Reality Escape Rooms for STEM Education,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a meta-discipline employ-ing active, problem-centric approaches such as game-based learning. STEM competencies are an essential part of the educational response to the transformations caused by the fourth industrial revolution, spearheaded by the convergence of multiple exponential technologies. Teachers’ atti-tude is a critical success factor for any technology-enhanced learning innovation. This study ex-plored in-service teachers’ views on the use of a digital educational escape room in virtual reality. Forty-one (n = 41) K-12 educators participated in a mixed research study involving a validated survey questionnaire instrument and an online debriefing session in the context of a teacher training program. The key findings revealed that such alternative instructional solutions can potentially enhance the cognitive benefits and learning outcomes, but further highlighted the shortcomings that instructional designers should consider while integrating them in contexts different than the in-tended. In line with this effort, more systematic professional development actions are recommended to encourage the development of additional teacher-led interventions.","Mystakidis, Stylianos;Christopoulos, Athanasios",Journal,Information (Switzerland),2022-03-01,Hellenic Open University;University of Patras;Turun yliopisto,Biology ;  Distance education ;  E-learning ;  Escape room ;  Online learning ;  Serious games ;  STEM education ;  Virtual reality

We have come a long way since that time in terms of sequencing the genes of the human genome. Now the researchers can sequence the DNA and analyze gene-expressed proteins in individual cells, allowing them to dissect the complexities of genetic diseases with exceptional details. Currently, technologies are available for single-cell or multi-omics platforms to analyze genotype and phenotype. The completion of this one-of-a-kind project created public expectations for immediate, better health care delivery and possible cures for ‘so called’ incurable diseases. The HGP was the single most influential investment made in modern basic science research. A monumental breakthrough in medicine has given us the ability to sequence the DNA in cancer cells to identify possible errors in mutations. The impact of the HGP’s success was so significant that President Barack Obama initiated a very ambitious new ‘precision medicine’ research initiative and announced the launch of this project during his State of the Union Address in 2015. The benefits of precision and personalized medicine include predicting susceptibility to diseases, improving disease diagnostics, preempting disease progression, customizing disease prevention strategies, and developing personalized drugs and therapies. As examples of emerging therapies, we have discussed the role of biomolecules and biologics in precision medicine applications like ‘The All of Us,’ personalized medicine approaches for monogenic diseases like hemophilia, sickle cell disease, and other rare genetic disorders, and CRISPR gene-editing technologies. Biomolecules play an essential role in all life processes, a variety of signaling processes, which are vital for normal functioning of physiological responses, in the early diagnosis of risk factors for various diseases, in the development of diseases and their progress. Furthermore, biomolecules, RNAs, DNAs, molecular and cellular engineering, genetic engineering of biologics, cells, tissues, and organs, play an important role in emerging therapeutic applications. The majority of the therapies discussed in this review are regulated as biologics under the Public Health Services Act of the USA. There is great interest in developing targeted therapy or precision medicine therapy for monogenic diseases, organ transplant applications, and tumor management, designed to interfere with targeted molecules for cancer-causing genes to slow the spread of cancer cells. Because molecular engineering, the development of biologics, gene-editing applications, and biomanufacturing are key components of emerging therapies, a keynote series was organized at INTERPHEX in November of 2021. INTEPHEX is the premier event that offers the latest intelligence, cutting-edge technologies, and state-of-the-art innovation for product development for pharmaceutical and biotechnology platforms. In an earlier article in this journal, we described drug discovery and development in the COVID Age; this overview provides a birds-eye view of the salient findings in each emerging area of medicine—precision medicine, personalized medicine, and emerging therapies.","Rao, Gundu H.R.",Journal,International Journal of Biomedicine,2022-03-01,University of Minnesota Medical School,Biomolecules ;  Emerging therapies ;  Personalized medicine ;  Precision medicine

Product Development of Natural Fibre-Composites for Various Applications: Design for Sustainability,"New product development review article aims to consolidate the principles and current literature on design for sustainability to seek the field’s future direction. In this point of view, the design for sustainability methods can be established under the idea of sustainability in dimensions of ecology, economy and social pillars. Design for sustainability concept is implemented in concurrent engineering, including concept, embodiment and detail design processes. Integrating sustainability in engineering designs is crucial to producing greener products, system innovation, and services aligned with current market demand. Currently, many concurrent engineering studies related to natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites associated with sustainability enhance the application of design for sustainability techniques by professional designers. However, the current literature is scarce in bridging the design for sustainability concept with concurrent engineering during the design development stage, and these areas should be further developed. Several other future research directions, such as the need for aligning with principles and applications, along with exploring the relationships between the design for sustainability techniques and views of sustainability, are presented in this review paper.","Asyraf, Muhammad Rizal Muhammad;Syamsir, Agusril;Zahari, Nazirul Mubin;Supian, Abu Bakar Mohd;Ishak, Mohamad Ridzwan;Sapuan, Salit Mohd;Sharma, Shubham;Rashedi, Ahmad;Razman, Muhammad Rizal;Zakaria, Sharifah Zarina Syed;Ilyas, Rushdan Ahmad;Rashid, Mohamad Zakir Abd",Journal,Polymers,2022-03-01,Faculty of Engineering;Tenaga Nasional Berhad;School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering;Universiti Putra Malaysia;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia;Punjab Technical University;Universiti Tenaga Nasional;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,Conceptual design ;  Design for sustainability ;  Natural fibre-composites ;  Product development ;  Sustainability development
A Comprehensive Review on Thermal Conductivity and Viscosity of Nanofluids,"The innovation of nanofluids, a novel working fluid, has presented the development of heat transfer properties in machining, automotive engine cooling systems, pumping power and others to optimize the overall system. Nanofluids have pulled in scientists' cogitation from various fields in designing new thermal systems for different engineering applications due to their distinctive thermophysical properties and prospective applications. Long term stability, improved thermal conductivity, and viscosity are the principal fundamental expectations in nanofluids research to achieve better heat transfer performance. In the previous couple of decades, various investigations have been completed to explore the nanofluids properties augmentation. For instance, kerosene-based oleic acid-coated Fe3O4 nanofluids showed 300% improvement of thermal conductivity, and water-based single-walled carbon nanotube revealed 320% improvement of viscosity. This paper presents a survey of recent exploration outcomes focusing on the thermal conductivity, viscosity, flow characteristics of hybrid nanofluids, including the preparation method of nanofluids utilized in different applications. Additionally, the elements that impact nanofluids' thermophysical properties, challenges of nanofluids, and fundamental outline and analysis of most recent research studies have been discussed and referenced. Finally, although the applications of nanofluid are increasing in several engineering sectors due to advanced discoveries of nanofluid, yet, requires more research focusing on the study of various sorts of nanofluids, different combinations of several types of nanoparticles, blending proportion and identifying the component which adds to the up-gradation of heat transfer to commercialize the nanofluids in practical fields.","Urmi, Wajiha Tasnim;Rahman, Md Mustafizur;Kadirgama, Kumaran;Malek, Zetty Akhtar Abd;Safiei, Wahaizad",Journal,Journal of Advanced Research in Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Sciences,2022-03-01,Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah,concentration ;  Nanofluid ;  temperature ;  thermal conductivity ;  viscosity
Optimization of Innovation Features in Mobile-Based Attendance Application,"Improved Human Resources Performance can be realized in the employee's absence. The sophistication of technology to accommodate the absence is the use of a Mobile-Based Attendance Application. Attendance can be used to measure employee performance. One of the measuring tools in measuring performance is the Key Performance Indicator (KPI). KPI values can be obtained from the Mobile-based Attendance Application, as currently implemented by an IT Company. But in its development, there is a shortage on the application features of Daily Attendance, Leave, Report Recaps Attendance and Report Recaps Leave. The value engineering method with the Analytical Hierarchy Process is used in this paper to obtain prioritized alternatives in the development of application feature updates. The results of the research show that the alternative with the largest percentage is owned by Alternative IV (45.6%). These results indicate that this alternative can be used as a recommendation for renewal of attendance application features on IT Company. Alternative IV shows optimal results such as the realization of application feature requirements for users, consumption of fewer workdays for 1-2 days, low costs, easy-to-understand feature design, and uncomplicated programming techniques.","Katrilia, Tiya;Anggoro, P.

Open Innovation Business Model as an Opportunity to Enhance the Development of Sustainable Shared Mobility Industry,"The shared mobility services market is growing and changing very rapidly. Many novelties are introduced to the systems, ranging from improvements to the services already offered to services referred to as innovative. Since the following years are to bring significant development of mobility as a service (MaaS) systems, data sharing, and cooperation on the mobility market, the article is dedicated to check whether the current business models of the industry are ready for the open innovations implementations. The article aimed to analyze the business models of shared mobility systems along with their presentation in the form of CANVAS models and to investigate whether the models contain aspects of open innovation. Moreover, the article presents its own value-added open business model prepared for the whole shared mobility market. The paper also identifies a set of open innovations that can be implemented by all types of shared mobility operators. It proposed the basis that operators can use when developing their own open business models. The developed research is an original contribution to filling the research gap concerning the approach to open innovation by operators of all types of shared mobility services available on the market. The results show that car-sharing service providers are the biggest opponents of open innovation. On the other hand, the most ‘open’ systems are bike-sharing services. The conducted research may support operators in the process of transforming their businesses into more accessible for users. It also helps to develop the open innovation concept to create more sustainable shared mobility systems along the lines of collaborative economy assumptions.","Turoń, Katarzyna",Journal,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",2022-03-01,Silesian University of Technology,Business models ;  Collaborative economy ;  Data sharing ;  Mobility management ;  Open innovation ;  Open shared mobility systems ;  Shared mobility ;  Sustainable transport systems ;  Transportation engineering
Recent developments of biomaterial scaffolds and regenerative approaches for craniomaxillofacial bone tissue engineering,"Bone defects in the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) region occur as a result of trauma, cancer excisions, congenital defects and deformities. CMF bone reconstruction is challenging due to anatomical complexity, functionality and aesthetic conditions. Bone grafting is the current standard approach to reconstruct CMF injuries. However, it possesses certain limitations to restore the structural and functional defects of CMF bone. To overcome these limitations, tissue engineering and regenerative methodologies have been developed to reconstruct damaged bone tissues. Various biomaterial scaffolds made up of synthetic, natural and ceramics materials have been used to repair craniofacial bone tissues. In this review, we have first discussed the structure of CMF bone, bone tissue engineering and mechanical properties required for CMF bone tissue engineering. Subsequently, a detailed survey on the recent research innovations of tissue engineering with various types of biomaterial scaffolds, stem-cell sources, growth factors and functional scaffold fabrication techniques to repair and remodel the CMF defects has been presented.","Gundu, Shravanya;Varshney, Neelima;Sahi, Ajay Kumar;Mahto, Sanjeev Kumar",Journal,Journal of Polymer Research,2022-03-01,Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi,Biomaterials ;  Bone ;  Craniomaxillofacial ;  Scaffolds ;  Stem cells ;  Tissue engineering
Rational confinement engineering of MOF-derived carbon-based electrocatalysts toward CO<inf>2</inf> reduction and O<inf>2</inf> reduction reactions,"The goal of global carbon peak and neutrality gives an impetus to the utilization of clean energy (e.g., fuel cell) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at a large scale, where the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are the key reactions via the sustainable system, respectively. As a main precursor for fabricating affordable carbon-based electrocatalysts with uniformly dispersed active centers and tailorable performances for ORR and CO2RR, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have captured a surge of interest in recent years. Despite the facilitated development of MOF-derived carbon-based electrocatalysts by many investigations, it is still plagued by high overpotential and unsatisfied life span, which are greatly determined by the efficient and alterable confinement effect on synthesis and performance. In this review, firstly, the confined synthetic strategies (doping engineering, defect engineering, geometric engineering, etc.) of MOF-derived carbon-based electrocatalysts with multi-sized active centers (atom, atomic clusters and nanoparticles (NPs)) are systematically summarized; secondly, the confinement effect on the interaction of ORR and CO2RR intermediates, as well as the catalytic durability and activity, was discussed from chemical and physical aspects. In the end, the review discusses the remaining challenges and emerging research topics in the future, including support upgradation and catalyst innovation, high selectivity and effective confinement synthesis, in situ and operando characterization techniques, theoretical investigation, and artificial intelligence (AI) assistant. The new understanding and insights into these aspects will guide the rational confinement concept of MOF-derived carbon-based electrocatalysts for ORR and CO2RR with optimized performances in terms of confinement engineering and are believed to be helpful for filling the existing gaps between scientific communities and practical use.","Zhang, Xiaoyu;Xue, Dongping;Jiang, Su;Xia, Huicong;Yang, Yanlin;Yan, Wenfu;Hu, Jinsong;Zhang, Jianan",Journal,InfoMat,2022-03-01,Institute of Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences;Henan Polytechnic University;Zhengzhou University;Jilin University,carbon-based materials ;  CO  reduction reaction 2 ;  confinement effect ;  electrocatalyst ;  metal organic framework ;  oxygen reduction reaction

A review of current practice for testing by analysis of cold-formed steel structures,"New product development is crucial to advance innovation in the cold-formed steel structural industry. Design of cold-formed steel structures usually requires physical testing, but it may be challenging to control the complexity and uncertainty inherent in physical experiments. The physical testing of new components and assemblies is often a cost barrier that prevents implementation and delays new product development. Testing by analysis has recently been recognized as a desirable area to pursue by the cold-formed steel structural industry due to the benefit of providing an efficient test environment. Not only does testing by analysis limit the high expense of physical experiments needed to quantify the behavior and safety of new members, connections, and structures, but it also reduces the time from product inception to development. Two considerations are necessary to ensure accurate results from testing by analysis. First, it requires a rational engineering analysis to calculate the capacities and deformations of the member or system, and the requirements to produce accurate analyses must be explicitly stated. Second, it is necessary to understand if the software used is capable of correctly modeling the behavior of thin-walled and nonsymmetric structural members and systems. Although the computational capability for structural design has been developed in recent years, there lacks a standardized approach to testing by analysis, especially for cold-formed steel design. This review aims to evaluate existing design standards that include the numerical test-based design for both cold-formed steel and other structural engineering industries. Recommendations for the use of testing by analysis based on the design standards and recent research related to numerical modeling are presented. The results of this study will assist with accurate and efficient design using testing by analysis.","Koh, Hyeyoung;Blum, Hannah B.",Journal,Structures,2022-03-01,UW-Madison College of Engineering,Cold-formed steel ;  Finite element analysis ;  Test-based design ;  Testing by analysis ;  Virtual testing

"Monitoring innovation metrics in construction and civil engineering: Trends, drivers and laggards","The study presents and analyzes innovation metrics in construction and civil engineering, domains which are found to lag behind other fields of science and technology in terms of innovation output. A specific line of focus is put on research and development (R&D) both in academia and industry. Scientific production is analyzed by treating eighteen of the oldest peer-reviewed journals in the field with over a hundred thousand articles published over the past fifty years. The aim is to capture and interpret trends with respect to four field verticals: (i) new materials and systems (hardware), (ii) digitalization, (iii) environmental impact and (iv) novelty/efficiency. The analysis reveals distinctive rates of innovation for each vertical, with some slowing down, as innovation becomes standardized and mainstream, and others peaking up, stemming from developments in other fields of science. Results are treated with respect to the S-curve technology maturity framework which accounts for effort and time towards development and the widely adopted scale of technology readiness levels. Further, corporate innovation is analyzed through patent search covering twelve key inventors and various technology focuses. While no straightforward approach exists to present innovation metrics without considering the broader socio-political and economic context, the present work seeks to provide a comprehensive monitoring of the progress in the field which reflects capital, time and effort put together, towards advancing propositions for future research.","Terzis, Dimitrios",Journal,Developments in the Built Environment,2022-03-01,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Civil engineering ;  Construction ;  Innovation ;  Review ;  Sustainability ;  Technology maturity ;  Technology readiness level
MXenes based nano-heterojunctions and composites for advanced photocatalytic environmental detoxification and energy conversion: A review,"Extensive research is being done to develop multifunctional advanced new materials for high performance photocatalytic applications in the field of energy production and environmental detoxification, MXenes have emerged as promising materials for enhancing photocatalytic performance owing to their excellent mechanical properties, appropriate Fermi levels, and adjustability of chemical composition. Numerous experimental and theoretical research works implied that the dimensions of MXenes have a significant impact on their performance. For photocatalysis to thrive in the future, we must understand the current state of the art for MXene in different dimensions. Using MXene co-catalysts in widely used in photocatalytic applications such as CO2 reduction, hydrogen production and organic pollutant oxidation, this study focuses on the most recent developments in MXenes based materials, structural modifications, innovations in reaction and material engineering. It has been reported that using 5 mg of CdS–MoS2-MXene researchers were able to generate as high as 9679 μmol/g/h hydrogen under visible light. The MXenes based heterojunction photocatalyst Co3O4/MXene was utilized to degrade 95% bisphenol A micro-pollutant in just 7 min. Numerous novel materials, their preparations and performances have been discussed. Depending upon the nature of MXene-based materials, the synthesis techniques and photocatalytic mechanism of MXenes as co-catalyst are also summarized. Finally, some final thoughts and prospects for developing highly efficient MXene-based photocatalysts are provided which will indeed motivate researchers to design novel hybrid materials based on MXenes for sustainable solutions to energy and pollution issues.","Sharma, Sunil Kumar;Kumar, Amit;Sharma, Gaurav;Vo, Dai Viet N.;García-Peñas, Alberto;Moradi, Omid;Sillanpää, Mika",Journal,Chemosphere,2022-03-01,"Glocal University;Dại học Nguyen Tat Thanh;Islamic Azad University, Shahr-e Qods Branch;Shoolini University;Ton-Duc-Thang University;Universidad Carlos III de Madrid;Shenzhen University",Energy conversion ;  Hazardous pollutants ;  MXenes ;  Photocatalysis ;  Water pollution
Design of Experiments and machine learning for product innovation: A systematic literature review,"The recent increase in digitalization of industrial systems has resulted in a boost in data availability in the industrial environment. This has favored the adoption of machine learning (ML) methodologies for the analysis of data, but not all contexts boast data abundance.

"Recent advances in electrocatalysts, mechanism, and cell architecture for direct formic acid fuel cells","Direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs) are potential candidates as power sources for various applications, especially in portable electronics and medical diagnostic devices. Though they have been the subject of considerable research, commercial prototypes of DFAFCs are rudimentary compared to other liquid fuel cells, particularly the widespread methanol-based direct methanol fuel cells. Various strategies for rationally engineering the electrocatalysts for enhancing DFAFC performance have been explored in the last few years, such as alloying noble metals with earth-abundant transition metals, designing specific morphological and structural arrangements, decorating the surface with corrosion-tolerant cocatalysts, and providing better catalyst support for effective catalyst dispersion. An overall approach may be necessary and should include (i) understanding the underlying mechanism, which will guide the direction of catalyst engineering, (ii) employing morphological, compositional, and structural control of the electrocatalysts to improve catalyst utilization and enhance the intrinsic activity for real-world applications, and (iii) integrating these in a proficiently designed cell architecture suitable for targeted applications. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in electrocatalysts, formic acid electrooxidation mechanisms, and DFAFC cell architectures, which could help address the opportunities and challenges of commercializing DFAFC as a prospective alternative power source for portable applications.

"Embodying the past, designing the future: technological determinism reconsidered in technology education","From a philosophical viewpoint, technological design is about connecting what is desirable with what is technically possible. Technology itself plays a major role in design processes, not only because technology development is what designing is all about, but also since the existing technology at any given point in time frames what is possible to achieve in terms of new outcomes. A limiting role of technology in design, education and other societal activities goes under the concept of technological determinism and has arguably been one of the most significant points of debate in the social sciences in the last decades. The aim of this article is to investigate how philosophical, sociological and historical research, as well as design and innovation research about technological determinism, could be fruitfully reconsidered in technology education. The analysis yielded three novel findings about the nature of technological determinism. First of all, technological determinism can take the form of an idea, theory or a way of explaining technology development in history or the present, but it can also take the form of actual material structures that—implicitly or explicitly—permeate and influence society, or, at least, this is what some researchers claim. Secondly, technological determinism is not just something that is the result of a bird’s eye view of technology and society or when we study technology as part of the macro level of society. Determinism can appear on all levels, even the micro level. Thirdly, like its counterpart social/societal determinism, technological determinism is not necessarily a “bad” thing, but a natural result of design being a balance between what is societally desirable and technically possible. The most critical issue from the point of view of technological literacy is to promote the idea that it is humans that design and retain control over technology.","Hallström, Jonas",Journal,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,2022-03-01,Linköpings Universitet,Autonomous technology ;  Design ;  History ;  Technological determinism ;  Technological literacy ;  Technology education

Based upon decades of research and executive positions by senior scholars and perspectives of emerging professionals, the volume concentrates on motifs that portray relationships among policies and comparative analysis that reveals the need for global collaborations. This important book will be of great interest to researchers, scholars, postgraduates, and government and philanthropic professionals in the fields of higher education, public and educational policy, comparative education, and international affairs.","Lindsay, Beverly",Book,Higher Education Policy in Developing and Western Nations: Contemporary and Emerging Trends in Local and Global Contexts,2022-02-28,Ford Foundation;University of Oxford;University College London,
Study on Large Cryogenic Launch Vehicle Unmanned Fueling and Launching,"The concept of cryogenic launch vehicle unmanned fueling and launching (CLVUFL) has been defined with regards to the safety of space launching. The complicated interfaces between rocket and ground support, long time for fueling and launching, low reliability of critical equipment, and poor levels of intelligence and automation, are found to be the main problems by comparing the domestic and international representative CLVUFL technologies. Taking the fueling and launching process of a large cryogenic launch vehicle as the research object, three constraints, including unknown potential modes of critical equipment in launch vehicle (LV), low reliability of key devices in fueling system, and no remote or automatic control functions of facilities in launching site, are revealed based on the feature analysis of existing manual operations. An innovated technical solution is proposed by combining situation awareness, remote/automatic control, reliability growth and cryogenic fueling innovation. Furthermore, the prototypes of large caliber lateral zero-second separating connector, infrared imaging detect cryogenic propellant leak and spatial awareness of launching tower have been developed and tested. The work above provides a technical support to the certain rocket CLVUFL and launching site engineering transformation.","Zhong, Wen An;Ye, Xin;Zhu, Xiao Le;Yan, Zheng;Zhang, Jun Xin",Journal,Yuhang Xuebao/Journal of Astronautics,2022-02-28,Xichang Satellite Launch Center,Fueling and launching ;  Large cryogenic launch vehicle ;  Unmanned
Current trends and opportunities in the methodology of electrodermal activity measurement,"Electrodermal activity (EDA) has been measured in the laboratory since the late 1800s. Although the influence of sudomotor nerve activity and the sympathetic nervous system on EDA is well established, the mechanisms underlying EDA signal generation are not completely understood. Owing to simplicity of instrumentation and modern electronics, these measurements have recently seen a transfer from the laboratory to wearable devices, sparking numerous novel applications while bringing along both challenges and new opportunities. In addition to developments in electronics and miniaturization, current trends in material technology and manufacturing have sparked innovations in electrode technologies, and trends in data science such as machine learning and sensor fusion are expanding the ways that measurement data can be processed and utilized. Although challenges remain for the quality of wearable EDA measurement, ongoing research and developments may shorten the quality gap between wearable EDA and standardized recordings in the laboratory. In this topical review, we provide an overview of the basics of EDA measurement, discuss the challenges and opportunities of wearable EDA, and review recent developments in instrumentation, material technology, signal processing, modeling and data science tools that may advance the field of EDA research and applications over the coming years.","Tronstad, Christian;Amini, Maryam;Bach, Dominik R.;Martinsen, Ørjan G.",Journal,Physiological Measurement,2022-02-28,Oslo Universitetssykehus;University College London;Universitetet i Oslo,electrodermal activity ;  electrodes ;  skin impedance
Transforming the construction sector: an institutional complexity perspective,"Purpose: Government initiatives to improve construction have increasingly become more focused on introducing a repertoire of technologies to transform the sector. In the literature on construction industry transformation through policy-backed initiatives, how firms will respond to the demands to adopt and use innovative technologies and approaches is taken for granted, and there is scarcely any attention given to the institutional implications of transformation agenda. The purpose of this paper is to discuss these gaps and offer directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: Following a synthesis of literature on the UK’s industry transformation agenda, the authors use the concepts of institutional logics, arrangements, complexity and strategic responses to suggest seven research questions that are at the nexus of policy-backed transformation and institutional theory. Findings: In this paper, the authors argue that increasing demands for the adoption and use of digital technologies, platforms, manufacturing approaches and other “industry-4.0”-related technologies will reconfigure existing logics and arrangements in the construction industry, creating a problem of institutional complexity for general contracting firms in particular. Originality/value: The questions are relevant for our understanding of the nature of institutional complexities, change, strategic firm responses, field-level dynamics and implications for the construction industry in relation to the transformation agenda. This paper is positioned to spur future research towards exploring the consequences of industry transformation through the lens of institutional theory.","Oti-Sarpong, Kwadwo;Pärn, Erika Anneli;Burgess, Gemma;Zaki, Mohamed",Journal,Construction Innovation,2022-02-28,Department of Land Economy;University of Cambridge,BIM ;  Construction engineering management ;  Construction management ;  Construction technology ;  Innovation ;  Open manufacturing/offsite construction

Training Computing Educators to Become Computing Education Researchers,"The computing education community endeavors to consistently move forward, improving the educational experience of our students. As new innovations in computing education practice are learned and shared, however, these papers may not exhibit the desired qualities that move simple experience reports to true Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL). We report on our six years of experience in running professional development for computing educators in empirical research methods for social and behavioral studies in the classroom. Our goal is to have a direct impact on instructors who are in the beginning stages of transitioning their educational innovations from anecdotal to empirical results that can be replicated by instructors at other institutions. To achieve this, we created a year-long mentoring experience, beginning with a multi-day workshop on empirical research methods during the summer, followed by regular mentoring sessions with participants, and culminating in a follow-up session at the following year's SIGCSE Technical Symposium. From survey results and as evidenced by eventual research results and publications from participants, we believe that our method of structuring empirical research professional development was successful and could be a model for similar programs in other areas.","Carver, Jeffrey C.;Heckman, Sarah;Sherriff, Mark",Conference Proceeding,SIGCSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,2022-02-22,The University of Alabama;University of Virginia;NC State University,computing education research ;  empirical studies ;  professional development

New goal-oriented requirements extraction framework for e-health services: a case study of diagnostic testing during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Purpose: This paper aims to introduce the goal-oriented requirements extraction approach (GOREA). It is an elicitation approach that uses, specifically, healthcare business goals to derive the requirements of e-health system to be developed. Design/methodology/approach: GOREA consists of two major phases: (1) modelling e-health business requirements phase and (2) modelling e-health information technology (IT) and systems requirements phase. The modelling e-health business requirements phase is divided into two main stages: (1) model e-health business strategy stage and (2) model e-health business environment stage. The modelling e-health IT and systems requirements phase illustrates the process of obtaining requirements of e-health system from the organizational goals that are determined in the previous phase. It consists of four main steps that deal with business goals of e-health system: (1) modelling e-health business process (BP) step; (2) modelling e-health business goals step; (3) analysing e-health business goals step; and (4) eliciting e-health system requirements step. A case study based on the basic operations and services in hospital emergency unit for checking patient against COVID-19 virus and taking its diagnostic testing has been set and used to examine the validity of the proposed approach by achieving the conformance of the developed system to the business goals. Findings: The results indicate that (1) the proposed GOREA has a positive influence on the system implementation according to e-health business expectations; and (2) it can successfully fulfil the need of e-health business in order to save the citizens life by checking them against COVID-19 virus. Research limitations/implications: The proposed approach has some limitations. For example, it is only validated using one e-health business goal and thus it has to be authenticated with different e-health business goals in order to address different e-health problems. Originality/value: Many e-health projects and innovations are not established based on robust system requirements engineering phase. In order to ensure the success delivery of e-health services, all characteristics of e-health systems and applications must be understood in terms of technological perspectives as well as the all system requirements.","Alotaibi, Youseef;Subahi, Ahmad F.",Journal,Business Process Management Journal,2022-02-18,Umm Al-Qura University,Case study ;  COVID-19 ;  e-health business process ;  Modelling e-health process ;  Requirement elicitation ;  Requirement engineering
How frugal innovation shape global sustainable supply chains during the pandemic crisis: lessons from the COVID-19,"Purpose: The COVID-19 crisis has created enormous strain in global supply chains. The disruption has caused severe shortages of critical items, including personal protective equipment (e.g. face masks), ventilators and diagnostics. The failure of the industry to meet the sudden demand for these necessary items has caused a severe humanitarian crisis. These situations, resulting from the COVID-19, crisis have led to the informal growth of frugal innovation in sustainable global supply chains. This paper aims to provide a detailed overview of drivers of frugal-oriented sustainable global supply chains, following lessons acquired from emerging countries’ attempts to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a focused group approach to identify the drivers and this paper further validated them using existing literature published in international peer-reviewed journals and reports. The authors adopted total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) to analyze the complex relationships among identified drivers. Findings: The authors present a theoretical framework to explain how the drivers are interlinked. This paper has developed the framework through a synthesis of the TISM modeling and Matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment analysis. This paper observed that government financial support, policies and regulations, under the mediating effect of leadership and the moderating effect of national culture and international rules and regulations, has a significant effect on the adoption of emerging technology, volunteering initiatives and values and ethics. Further, emerging technology, volunteering initiative and values and ethics have a significant effect on supply chain talent and frugal engineering. These results provide some useful theoretical insights that may help in further investigating the role of frugal innovations in other contexts. Originality/value: The authors find that outcomes of the methodical contributions and the resulting managerial insights can be categorized into four levels. Industry and researchers alike can use the study to develop the decision-support systems guiding frugal-oriented sustainable global supply chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic and in recovering them thereafter. Suggestions for future research directions are offered and discussed.","Dubey, Rameshwar;Bryde, David James;Foropon, Cyril;Tiwari, Manisha;Gunasekaran, Angappa",Journal,Supply Chain Management,2022-02-17,"Liverpool Business School;Montpellier Recherche en Management (MRM);California State University, Los Angeles",Innovation ;  Sustainability
Digital project driven supply chains: a new paradigm,"Purpose: This paper aims to propose an integrated framework for digital project-driven supply chains (PDSC) to address multiple objectives in Architecture, Engineering, Construction and, Operations and Maintenance (AECO) value chain. Additionally, the following sub-objectives were also to be addressed: to assess emerging themes of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies in AECO and to identify lacunae in existing project supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The research relies on qualitative approaches and mixed methodologies, for building theories based on domain expert interviews and questionnaire surveys administered on industry professionals. Hypothesis testing has been used to analyze data and identify significant 4IR technology applications and evolve a PDSC framework to address multiple objectives in the AECO context. Findings: 4IR technologies can completely revolutionize AECO supply chains and catapult the discipline into a completely new paradigm. The immense computing power unleashed can contribute to enhancing effectiveness in delivery. Technologies such as the Internet of Things, Internet of Services, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Smart Factory, 3 D-Printing, Cyber-Physical Systems or Embedded Systems, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Robotics hold immense future potential. The study proposes an integrated framework to address the multiple objectives of improved project delivery, increased productivity and cost savings, activity monitoring, reporting and agility, better workflow processes and reduction of wastage. Research limitations/implications: The study offers ideas for complete integration of the AECO supply chain to deliver value to end customers. It, however, relies on opinions, perspectives and recollections of respondents, which is its limitation. Their opinion is expected to be influenced by their domain and project expertise. Practical implications: In today’s global environment, information and data management is a meaningful intermediary in 4IR. It can be delivered with the aid of the cloud to collect, appraise and evaluate data efficiently; faster machine operations to manufacture quality goods at a lower cost; boost productivity; and competitiveness in AECO companies. Appropriate exchange of information and knowledge transfer will lead to innovation, effective communication in terms of frequency and quality of information; willingness to share information to improve overall performance; commitment to a common goal and mutual support; and continuous innovative effort. Originality/value: This paper suggests fresh perspectives to integrated digital project-driven supply chains propelled by 4IR technologies, with a purpose to deliver multiple project objectives and end-customer value addition.","Bhattacharya, Sanjay;Chatterjee, Arup",Journal,Supply Chain Management,2022-02-17,Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University;Inspirage,Construction industry ;  Customer value ;  Customer-oriented performance measures ;  Integration ;  Supply-chain management ;  Value chain
Prototype Smartphone-Based Device for Flow Cytometry with Immunolabeling via Supra-nanoparticle Assemblies of Quantum Dots,"Methods for the detection, enumeration, and typing of cells are important in many areas of research and healthcare. In this context, flow cytometers are a widely used research and clinical tool but are also an example of a large and expensive instrument that is limited to specialized laboratories. Smartphones have been shown to have excellent potential to serve as portable and lower-cost platforms for analyses that would normally be done in a laboratory. Here, we developed a prototype smartphone-based flow cytometer (FC). This compact 3D-printed device incorporated a laser diode and a microfluidic flow cell and used the built-in camera of a smartphone to track immunofluorescently labeled cells in suspension and measure their color. This capability was enabled by high-brightness supra-nanoparticle assemblies of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (SiO2@QDs) as well as a support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm. The smartphone-based FC device detected and enumerated target cells against a background of other cells, simultaneously and selectively counted two different cell types in a mixture, and used multiple colors of SiO2@QD-antibody conjugates to screen for and identify a particular cell type. The potential limits of multicolor detection are discussed alongside ideas for further development. Our results suggest that innovations in materials and engineering should enable eventual smartphone-based FC assays for clinical applications.","Xiao, Zhujun;Darwish, Ghinwa H.;Susumu, Kimihiro;Medintz, Igor L.;Algar, W.

"The Italian instructions for the design, execution and control of timber constructions (CNR-DT 206 R1/2018)","In 2007 the Italian National Research Council published the technical document CNR-DT 206/2007 “Instructions for the design, execution and control of timber structures”, with the purpose to provide a technical support to the operators of the sector, in line with the most advanced knowledge at that time. Since then, the world of timber engineering has largely used such document, even though the instructions are not mandatory standard rules, so that they became the most common tool in Italy for the structural use of timber, opening the markets and favouring competition and new applications. In latest years new studies, researches and innovative proposals have promoted the development and the growth of timber constructions also in the civil residential field. The framework of standard rules for constructions and products, both Europeans and Italians, has evolved too. For these reasons, CNR has considered as opportune to proceed to the editing of a new version, updated and widened, namely with the acronym DT 206-R1. The document comes from the spontaneous cooperation of an open group of specialists and operators of the sector, based on a wide discussion on the common scientific and technical expertise and knowledge.

Optimizing the application of strategies promoting electronic procurement systems towards sustainable construction in the building lifecycle: A neurofuzzy model approach,"Digital transformations in the built environment address inefficiencies and sustainability issues in the building lifecycle. Accordingly, electronic procurement systems (EPSs) have benefits that improve the economic, environmental and social initiatives for sustainable construction. However, the slow rate of EPSs uptake evinces the need for strategic approaches towards their widespread implementation. Scoping the previous studies on EPSs, there is a lack of research on the influence dynamics of these strategies for effective promotion of EPSs in the built environment. Therefore, this study investigates the dynamic influences of strategies by using the neurofuzzy model for the effective promotion of EPSs implementation. Through a comprehensive literature review, 14 strategies were employed in an expert survey. A total of 121 datasets were collected and analyzed in the study. From the data analysis, five groups were derived: technology education, innovation culture management, technological stimulation environment, incentives and partnership mechanism and organizational integration support. Further, the neurofuzzy model and sensitivity analysis were used to predict and determine optimal strategies for promoting EPSs implementation. The findings showed dynamic ways of hybridizing the strategies for EPSs promotion. Two hybrid-approaches, in addition to other strategies, that actively enhance effective EPS implementation are ‘innovation culture management – technology education’ and ‘innovation culture management – incentives and partnership mechanism’. Additionally, the combinations of strategies that result in low promotion of EPSs were also highlighted. This study provides a deepened understanding of the dynamic influences of strategies for researchers and practitioners to effectively promote the widespread implementation of EPSs in the built environment.","Yevu, Sitsofe Kwame;Yu, Ann T.W.;Adinyira, Emmanuel;Darko, Amos;Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2022-02-15,Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology;Aston University;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Built environment ;  Construction industry ;  Electronic procurement systems ;  Neurofuzzy ;  Strategies ;  Sustainable construction

A case for co-construction with teachers in curricular reform: Introducing computer science in primary school,"With the introduction of Computer Science (CS) into curricula worldwide, researchers have investigated whether CS could be introduced transversally, as a support other disciplines. Few however consider both student learning and the teachers’ perspective in their assessments. In a co-constructive approach to translational research, we collaborated with teachers, in two case studies involving two classes each, to investigate how CS content could be used transversally. More specifically, teacher inputs and student learning data were combined in a mixed methods analysis to determine whether two CS Unplugged (CSU) activities from the curriculum could be leveraged to teach disciplinary content in primary school. The findings indicated that the CSU activities could be leveraged for maths and spelling, but require validation at a larger scale. More important, though, are the takeaways of the co-constructive experience with teachers. Interestingly the benefits of co-construction went both ways. While researchers gained a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of the activities, teachers i) appreciated having detailed student learning analyses, devoid of biases and impressions, ii) changed their perspective about researchers, and iii) were open to other collaborative research initiatives which they found to be drivers of change and innovation in their practice. The way co-construction was approached also impacted the teachers’ perception of their experience. Indeed, while one study was researcher-driven and included teachers, the other was teacher-driven and included researchers. When teacher-driven, the teachers felt they had a more active role, thus reflecting more on the study design, results and implications. Provided the positive impact that co-construction may have on innovation in teacher practices, different co-construction modalities must be investigated, as well as their implications on all stakeholders, including researchers.","El-Hamamsy, Laila;Bruno, Barbara;Kovacs, Helena;Chevalier, Morgane;Zufferey, Jessica Dehler;Mondada, Francesco",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-02-14,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;University of Teacher Education,Co-construction ;  Computer science education ;  Computer science unplugged ;  Primary school ;  Translational research ;  Transversal integration
Applications of Calcium-Based Nanomaterials in Osteoporosis Treatment,"With rapidly aging populations worldwide, osteoporosis has become a serious global public health problem. Caused by disordered systemic bone remodeling, osteoporosis manifests as progressive loss of bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, increasing the risk of fractures and eventually leading to osteoporotic fragility fractures. As fracture risk increases, antiosteoporosis treatments transition from nonpharmacological management to pharmacological intervention, and finally to the treatment of fragility fractures. Calcium-based nanomaterials (CBNMs) have unique advantages in osteoporosis treatment because of several characteristics including similarity to natural bone, excellent biocompatibility, easy preparation and functionalization, low pH-responsive disaggregation, and inherent pro-osteogenic properties. By combining additional ingredients, CBNMs can play multiple roles to construct antiosteoporotic biomaterials with different forms. This review covers recent advances in CBNMs for osteoporosis treatment. For ease of understanding, CBNMs for antiosteoporosis treatment can be classified as locally applied CBNMs, such as implant coatings and filling materials for osteoporotic bone regeneration, and systemically administered CBNMs for antiosteoporosis treatment. Locally applied CBNMs for osteoporotic bone regeneration develop faster than the systemically administered CBNMs, an important consideration given the serious outcomes of fragility fractures. Nevertheless, many innovations in construction strategies and preparation methods have been applied to build systemically administered CBNMs. Furthermore, with increasing interest in delaying osteoporosis progression and avoiding fragility fracture occurrence, research into systemic administration of CBNMs for antiosteoporosis treatment will have more development prospects. Deep understanding of the CBNM preparation process and optimizing CBNM properties will allow for increased application of CBNMs in osteoporosis treatments in the future.","Deng, Yuan;Wei, Wei;Tang, Peifu",Journal,ACS Biomaterials Science and Engineering,2022-02-14,General Hospital of People's Liberation Army;Institute of Process Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences,calcium ;  local application ;  nanomaterial ;  osteoporosis ;  systemic administration
Vehicle Dynamic Control using Vehicle Network Toolbox from MATLAB/Simulink®,"Automotive companies are strongly investing in vehicle innovation through partnerships with universities, research centers and improvements in its R&D units. All these actions aims to attend a growing demand of automotive market for new technologies in areas like comfort, safety, connectivity, performance and fuel efficiency. In case of electric and electronic field, innovation is associated with the development of new software functions or update of already existing ones. In general, these new software functions are specified by the OEMs and implemented in the electronic control units by their suppliers. It is essential to have engineering tools that allows OEMs development to create, simulate and even perform a vehicle conceptual testing of new functions in order to check if its dynamic response is behaving as expected. Through simulations and vehicle testing it is possible to assure a robust and detailed specification, avoiding undesired loops, reducing costs and development time.

A Pill to Find Them All: IoT Device Behavior Fingerprinting using Capsule Networks,"Aim and Background: The aim of this study is the application of novel deep learning technique of capsule networks for device behavior fingerprinting. Device behavior fingerprinting emerged as an important means to characterize the network behavior of connected devices due to the dynamic nature of smart systems. The study of device behavior fingerprinting strategies gave us an insight into the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning techniques. It also led us to some research questions that we incorporated in the proposed framework. Firstly, we explored the means to improve the efficiency of passive device fingerprinting techniques. Secondly, we needed to address the privacy concerns that arise from the creation and maintenance of device fingerprints. Objective: To our best knowledge, this is the first time that device for fingerprints had been generated in the form of images. The use of device fingerprints in image form best utilized the object recognition capabilities of capsule networks. Method: We designed a novel method to classify and save the network behaviour of IoT devices that are connected to a network. The proposed model was based on a two-fold innovation of the generation of unique images based on packet parameters of device transmissions, and the design of a model that could carry out efficient and accurate classification of device vendors based on their network behavior. Results and Conclusion: The generation of unique images offered a big advantage of saving the memory of the system. While a packet capture file may take around 150kb or more, the generated images were as small as the order of 2kb. For a smart system made up of thousands of devices, the order of memory space saved would become significant. Furthermore, since the algorithm of image generation could be customized by the network administrators, the images cannot be reverse-engineered by potential attackers, thereby assuring a secure way to save device behavior fingerprints. The developed model has compiled over 500 epochs that roughly translated to 100 minutes and gave the accuracy of the order of 92%. This was the first time that device network behaviour has been translated into an image and tested through classification using capsule networks. The translation of captured packet flows to black and white images not only saved on memory space but also provided a safeguard against reverse engineering by potential attackers. There is a vast scope to further use of this strategy to develop more complex device fingerprinting methods.","Varma, Gatha;Chauhan, Ritu;Singh, Dhananjay",Journal,"International Journal of Sensors, Wireless Communications and Control",2022-02-01,Amity University;Hankuk University of Foreign Studies,Capsule network ;  CNN ;  Device behavior fingerprinting ;  Image generation ;  Internet of Things ;  Smart systems

Adopting Safe-by-Design in Science and Engineering Academia: The Soil May Need Tilling,"In recent years, Safe-by-Design (SbD) has been launched as a concept that supports science and engineering such that a broad conception of safety is embraced and structurally embedded. The present study explores the extent to which academics in a distinctively relevant subset of science and engineering disciplines are receptive towards the work and teaching practices SbD would arguably imply. Through 29 interviews with researchers in nanotechnology, biotechnology and chemical engineering differences in perceptions of safety, life-cycle thinking and responsibility for safety were explored. Results indicate that although safety is perceived as a paramount topic in scientific practice, its meaning is rigorously demarcated, marking out safety within the work environment. In effect, this creates a limited perceived role responsibility vis-à-vis safety in the production of knowledge and in teaching, with negligible critical consideration of research’s downstream impacts. This is at odds with the adoption of a broader conception of, and responsibility for, safety. The considerations supporting the perceived boundaries demarcating scientific practice are scrutinized. This study suggests that implementing SbD in academia requires systemic changes, the development of new methods, and attention for researchers’ and innovators’ elementary views on the meaning of and responsibility for safety throughout the innovation chain.","Krouwel, Sam Jan Cees;Dierickx, Emma Rianne;Heesterbeek, Sara;Klaassen, Pim",Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022-02-01,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Athena Instituut;Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu,Academia ;  Responsibility ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Safe innovation ;  Safe-by-Design ;  Teaching and education
Digital Health Policy and Programs for Hospital Care in Vietnam: Scoping Review,"Background: There are a host of emergent technologies with the potential to improve hospital care in low- and middle-income countries such as Vietnam. Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence–based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government’s requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Th Vi n Pháp Lu t, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step. Results: In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians’ performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system’s capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks. Conclusions: Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet. More research is needed in the future to guide the implementation of digital health care systems in the Vietnam hospital setting.","Tran, Duc Minh;Thwaites, C.

How global value chain participation affects green technology innovation processes: A moderated mediation model,"Global value chain (GVC) embeddedness is an irreversible development paradigm in China's manufacturing sector. However, the increasingly prominent problem of ecological deterioration has become a bottleneck restricting its further high-quality development. Green technological innovation is an effective way to realise cleaner production and an environmentally-friendly society. Most studies consider green technological innovation as a whole. The specific mechanism and path influences on GVC participation in green technological innovation require further clarification. This study subdivides green technology innovation into process innovation and product innovation, constructing an improved Utterback and Abernathy (A-U) technological innovation process model to reveal the mediation effect moderated by environmental regulation. Our innovative findings are as follows: Green process innovation completely mediates GVC participation and green product innovation nexus; and environmental regulation positively moderates green process innovation's mediating role between GVC participation and green product innovation. Cleaner production technology innovation completely mediates the relationship between GVC participation and green product innovation. Green process innovation partially mediates the relationship between GVC forward participation and green product innovation. Cleaner production technology innovation completely mediates GVC forward participation and green product innovation nexus. The research conclusions provide new theoretical evidence for improving GVC forward participation and giving full play to cleaner production process innovation to promote China's green and low-carbon transformation; we also offer some references for other developing countries and emerging economies.","Hu, Dianxi;Jiao, Jianling;Tang, Yunshu;Xu, Yuwen;Zha, Jianrui",Journal,Technology in Society,2022-02-01,Yuxi Normal University;Hefei University of Technology,China'S manufacturing sector ;  Cleaner production technology innovation ;  Environmental regulation ;  Global value chain participation ;  Green process innovation ;  Green technology innovation processes
Copper‐Containing Catalysts for Azide–Alkyne Cycloaddition in Supercritical CO<inf>2</inf>,"Background: Chemical industry has increased the investment into and innovation capac-ity to supply chemicals from safe and sustainable sources, which will be essential to offering new solutions and supporting the green transition of the global economy and society. In this sense, the use of green solvents and reusable heterogeneous catalysts has emerged as a promising sustainable process strategy for engineering, chemistry and the environment. In this work, different homogeneous (copper bromide, CuBr and copper(II) acetate, Cu (CH3COO)2∙H2O) and heterogeneous (Cu Wire, Cu Plate, Cu/β‐SiC, pre‐treated Cu Wire and pre‐treated Cu Plate) copper catalysts were tested for the copper(I)‐catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. In addition, the influence of different reaction media was analyzed, comparing the use of an organic solvent such as toluene and a green solvent such as supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Methods: Characterization of the catalysts includes by X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Scan Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA) and Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR). Parameters such as catalyst loading, reaction time, reusability and leaching of the catalysts were studied to obtain more information on the CuAAC reaction in scCO2. Results: The pre‐treated copper plate achieved a 57% increase in reaction yield compared to the non pre‐treated copper plate. However, the recovery and reuse of the pre‐treated copper plate showed a severe deterioration and a considerable change in its surface. Cu Wire (without pre‐treatment) achieved yields of up to 94.2% after reusing it for five cycles. Conclusions: These results suggest the possibility to exploit the combination of heterogeneous catalysts and scCO2 and justify further research to highlight green solvents and simultaneously address the challenges of reaction, purification and recycling.","López, Sonia;García‐vargas, Jesús Manuel;García, María Teresa;Rodríguez, Juan Francisco;Gracia, Ignacio;Ramos, María Jesús",Journal,Catalysts,2022-02-01,Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,Copper catalysts ;  CuAAC ;  Green chemistry ;  Heterogeneous catalyst ;  Reusability ;  ScCO 2
"Modeling, Kinematic Characteristics Analysis and Experimental Testing of an Elliptical Rotor Scraper Pump","Against the backdrop of the rapid burgeoning of international energy engineering, the efficient utilization of energy is a paramount factor. The key idea in this paper is to propose an elliptical rotor scraper pump (ERSP) in order to address the imperfections and defects of traditional volume pumps, such as their labyrinthine design, low volume utilization efficiency and undesirable sealing performance. The ERSP can dramatically achieve the aims of ameliorating pump structure and improving energy efficiency. One of the Roots pump's rotors or the vane pump's shifting blade is replaced by a swing scraper in the ERSP. It is worth noting that a small swing range is a high-priority feature of the scraper; the scraper not only serves the purpose of dividing the pump cavity and self-sealing the unit but also reduces the noise level when working. A vital function of ERSP is the efficient conversion of mechanical energy into fluid pressure energy by changing the volume. Simultaneously, based on theoretical analysis, the mathematical model of the ERSP is established, and its kinematic characteristics are investigated, using ADAMS to verify the kinematic rationality of the ERSP. Ultimately, the research group manufactured a prototype of the pump, based on the previous simulation results and calculations, and experiments verified the feasibility of the pump. The design and research of the ERSP have essential reference significance for the development of fluid energy machinery technology.","Zhang, Zhen;Zhang, Tiezhu;Zhang, Hongxin;Yang, Jian;Cao, Yang;Jiang, Yong;Tian, Dong",Journal,Machines,2022-02-01,Qingdao University;Power Integration and Energy Storage Systems Engineering Technology Center (Qingdao),ADAMS ;  Kinematic characteristics ;  Prototype testing ;  Pumps ;  Structural innovation
Organizational (Non-) Adoption of Legally Obliged Energy-Saving Technologies: Why (Not) Comply?,"Although there are organizations that have adopted legally imposed measures regarding energy-saving technologies, up until now, there has been a lot of unused energy-saving potential. Based on existing theories, such as the adoption theory and the institutional theory, this exploratory research investigates the reasons for firms to (or not to) adopt energy-saving technologies, even though they are legally obligated, and it has a positive impact on economic organizational performance. A “multiple mini-case” study, with six cases in the Dutch metalworking/electrical engineering sector and in the synthetic material/rubber sector, were conducted. Results show that, nowadays, organizations do not feel any regulatory pressures as they are not aware of the existence of the concerned legal obligations, e.g., where an organization’s self-awareness (of the relative advantages of the technologies) begins to play the most important role. To adopt the technologies, decisionmakers must be convinced that adopting energy-saving technologies involves advantages for the organization and that the payback time is sufficient. Financial dilemmas negatively influence these adoption processes. Lastly, the continuous intentions of organizations to adopt energy-saving technologies appear to be positively related to the number of adopted technologies.","van Helmond, Carlijn G.C.;Kok, Robert A.W.",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-02-01,Faculteit der Managementwetenschappen,Energy-saving technology ;  Innovation ;  Organizational adoption ;  Regulatory pressure ;  SME
"Report From the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine—STI: Adopting a Sexual Health Paradigm—A Synopsis for Sexually Transmitted Infection Practitioners, Clinicians, and Researchers","Despite decades of medical, diagnostic, and public health advances related to diagnosis and management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), rates of reportable STIs continue to grow. A 2021 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on the current state of STI management and prevention in the United States, entitled Sexually Transmitted Infections: Adopting a Sexual Health Paradigm, offers recommendations on future public health programs, policy, and research. This new report builds upon the 1997 Institute of Medicine report, The Hidden Epidemic: Confronting Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and provides 11 recommendations organized under 4 action areas: (1) adopt a sexual health paradigm, (2) broaden ownership and accountability for responding to STIs, (3) bolster existing systems and programs for responding to STIs, and (4) embrace innovation and policy change to improve sexual health. We present our interpretive synopsis of this report, highlighting elements of particular interest to STI and sexual health practitioners, including clinicians, researchers, disease intervention specialists, community outreach workers, and public health staff. The report asserts that it is possible to create a healthier and more equitable future where fewer adolescents and adults are infected, fewer babies are born with STIs, and people entering their sexual debut and continuing throughout the life span are taught the language and skills to conceptualize and enact their own vision for what it means to be sexually healthy.","Rietmeijer, Cornelis A.;Kissinger, Patricia J.;Guilamo-Ramos, Vincent;Gaydos, Charlotte A.;Hook, Edward W.;Mead, Aimee;Yang, Sophie;Geller, Amy;Vermund, Sten H.",Journal,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,2022-02-01,"Colorado School of Public Health;The University of Alabama at Birmingham;New York University;Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine;National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine;Duke University;Yale University;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine",

A study into the contingencies of process improvement methods,"The design and improvement of business processes is of central importance for realizing benefits of information systems. A broad spectrum of methods has been proposed since the 1990s, which ranges into several dozen. It is unclear whether this large number trivially stems from copying and relabeling or whether there are substantial differences in these methods that can be tied to their applicability in different contexts or to the pursuit of different goals. Accordingly, we ask: Which activities do process improvement methods have in common, how do they differ, and why? In this paper, we approach these research questions using a multi-method design integrating techniques from systematic literature review, process mining, and statistical analysis. Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide a framework with 264 activities clustered in six stages that could be used for incrementally and radically improving processes. Second, we find that methods map to different configurations of the three dimensions described by the redesign orbit. Third, we uncover similarities and differences of the different methods contingent to the factors industry, objectives and whether a method is proposed or applied. Fourth, we observe three distinct clusters of method activities, which show that different strategies play a role when choosing a method for improvement. Our findings have important implications for the application of improvement methods in various improvement scenarios.","Malinova, Monika;Gross, Steven;Mendling, Jan",Journal,Information Systems,2022-02-01,Univerza v Ljubljani;Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin;WU Vienna University of Economics and Business,Activities ;  Contingency factors ;  Improvement methods ;  Method mining ;  Methods ;  Process improvement ;  Process innovation
Smart materials in architecture for actuator and sensor applications: A review,"Severe challenges such as depletion of natural resources, natural catastrophes, extreme weather conditions, or overpopulation require intelligent solutions especially in architecture. Built environments that are conceived from smart materials based on actuator and sensor functionality provide a promising approach in order to address this demand. The present paper reviews smart materials-based technologies which are currently applied or developed for application in civil structures, focusing on smart material applications for actuation or sensing. After giving a definition and categorization of smart materials, applications of the investigated materials (i.e. shape memory materials, electro- and magnetostrictive materials, piezoelectric materials, ionic polymer-metal composites, dielectrical elastomers, polyelectrolyte gels as well as magneto- and electrorheological fluids) are presented for the fields of architecture and civil engineering. While some materials are already highly advantageous in the application context, others still need further research in order to become applicable in real-world constructions. Nonetheless this review indicates their large innovation potential which should be consolidated by systematic research efforts in the near future.","Sobczyk, Martin;Wiesenhütter, Sebastian;Noennig, Jörg Rainer;Wallmersperger, Thomas",Journal,Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures,2022-02-01,Technische Universität Dresden Institut für Festkörpermechanik;Technische Universität Dresden,actuators ;  architecture ;  civil engineering ;  design ;  sensors ;  Smart materials
Navigating multiple logics: Legitimacy and the quest for societal impact in science,"Academic scientists are encouraged to pursue research that delivers both scientific and societal impact. This may involve a search for alternative mechanisms of social approval which lead to endorsement of scientists’ research goals. We explore how scientists mobilise and accumulate different forms of legitimacy, which might favour their participation in practices related to innovation and societal impact. We propose three specific sources of scientific legitimacy: i) scientists’ social networks (research-related legitimacy ties), ii) prominence in the relevant academic community (reputation-based legitimacy); and direct contact with the primary beneficiaries of the research (beneficiary-based legitimacy). To explain scientists’ participation in activities oriented towards innovation and societal impact, we test the significance of each of these sources of legitimacy and their potential interplay empirically, using a large sample of Spanish biomedical scientists.","Llopis, Oscar;D'Este, Pablo;McKelvey, Maureen;Yegros, Alfredo",Journal,Technovation,2022-02-01,Handelshögskolan;Rennes School of Business;Universiteit Leiden;Universitat Politècnica de València;Universitat de València,Beneficiary-based legitimacy ;  Innovation involvement ;  Institutional logics ;  Legitimacy ;  Reputation-based legitimacy ;  Research-related legitimacy ties ;  Science logic ;  Societal impact
Absorbing knowledge from an emerging field: The role of interfacing by proponents in big pharma,"Engaging with knowledge from an emerging field, with its promises and limitations still uncertain, can be challenging for incumbent firms. Proponents of novel technologies within these firms then play an important role in bridging the developments in the field with the rest of the firm. In this study, we explore how researchers in big pharma firms engaged with knowledge from a promising, yet once-speculative approach called fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). To set the context, we mapped the publications and drugs in clinical trials coming from this approach across big pharma firms. Through our unique access to researchers in two big pharma firms (an early and a late adopter), we conducted a case study to explore how researchers built the capability within their firms. We find that at each stage of knowledge absorption (search and recognize value, assimilate, acquire, transform and exploit), proponents perform both internal- and external-facing activities to overcome uncertainties with regards to the field. We find that the emphasis of these activities evolves over time as the field evolves. In the early days of the field, proponents of the approach motivated knowledge absorption by emphasizing the internal needs of the firm. As the field matured, with its value becoming increasingly known, proponents lean on the exciting developments in the field to motivate further the adoption of the technology. In general, we find that proponents strategically tuned their external activities to cater to their internal context and similarly, adapted their internal activities to reflect external developments. By exploring interfacing in an emerging field, this study provides insights into how practitioners in large incumbent firms can adapt to the emergence of novel technologies.","Romasanta, Angelo K.S.;van der Sijde, Peter;de Esch, Iwan J.P.",Journal,Technovation,2022-02-01,Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Absorptive capacity ;  Drug discovery ;  Innovation adoption ;  Pharmaceutical industry ;  Research and development
Navigating the New Normal: Which firms have adapted better to the COVID-19 disruption?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted businesses worldwide by lowering demand, impeding operations, stressing supply chains, and limiting access to finance. Yet we still lack an understanding of how firms can successfully adapt to this disruption. I examine this issue theoretically by combining arguments around dynamic capabilities and managerial cognition and developing several hypotheses concerning firm innovation, knowledge sources, management practices, and gender issues in relation to firms’ adaptation to this crisis. I test these assertions using data from two rounds of surveys involving more than 11,000 firms from 28 countries both before and after COVID-19 was officially declared a global crisis. The empirical results provide prima facie evidence that innovators, in particular those who are younger (i.e. start-ups) and those who rely on internal sources of knowledge, are more likely to adapt to COVID-19 than non-innovators. Moreover, firms with better management practices exhibit also greater ability to adapt to the crisis. I did not find systematic gender differences upon examining firms managed by women versus men. Following these findings, I set out several implications for research and policy.","Krammer, Sorin M.S.",Journal,Technovation,2022-02-01,University of Exeter Business School,Adaptation ;  COVID-19 ;  Crisis ;  Gender inequality ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge sources ;  Management practices ;  Start-ups

Dynamic regulation on innovation and adoption of green technology with information asymmetry,"This study investigates a regulator's dynamic policy to motivate firms' research on and adoption of green technology. In the proposed model, a firm makes unobservable efforts and can hide the technology's arrival from the regulator to avoid adoption costs. We find that the optimal policy follows a simple structure and induces part-time efforts, rather than the maximal effort reported in previous studies. In particular, the regulator should offer no subsidy before the arrival of a technology report, provide a one-time subsidy contingent upon that report, and always set a termination deadline. At the deadline, the firm is forced to select an external option that is associated with social costs. The optimal report-based subsidy decreases with time. Under the optimal policy, the firm works until an effort deadline, makes no effort thereafter, and reports the technology as soon as it arrives. This study also characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the optimal policy reduces to one that leads, in terms of throughout time, to effort that is maximal or minimal. Our results indicate that policymakers should implement a policy that compensates firms more in the present and less in the future.","Rong, Lisong;Chen, Jian;Wen, Zhong",Journal,Naval Research Logistics,2022-02-01,"Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management;China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Beijing Foreign Studies University;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology",
"A campus start-up ecosystem for mechanical engineering students: Challenges, approaches, catalysts and solutions","Start-up ecosystems are emerging rapidly worldwide. The speed of technology innovation and the diversity of business ideas keep the start-up landscape in constant flux. While many emerging start-ups are in the areas of electronics and information sciences, the field of mechanical engineering has huge potential that has yet to be exploited. Today’s mechanical engineering students need to be well positioned to recognize and seize potential start-up opportunities. This study examines the involvement of Indian mechanical engineering students in campus start-ups and the challenges they face in nascent entrepreneurship. Structural equation modelling was applied to a sample of 396 final-year undergraduate mechanical engineering students from the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University in Kerala. Data collection was achieved through a questionnaire developed on the basis of existing literature, feedback and market research. The findings highlight the currently prevailing barriers and best practices, and recommendations are derived for leveraging the nascent entrepreneurship potential of the mechanical engineering discipline. The negative effects of the barriers are positively moderated by the activities of campus-based entrepreneurship centres. The study results provide insights into the role of universities, higher education departments and government agencies in promoting a sustainable campus start-up culture through entrepreneurial learning.","Pradeep, M.;Satish, K.

User-Centered Design Roadmapping: Anchoring Roadmapping in Customer Value before Technology Selection,"Designing an innovation strategy in a world of rapid technological change has become increasingly challenging. Some companies are finding that anchoring technology choices in deeper understanding of the value users seek allows them to find a better balance among feasibility, viability, and desirability of potential solutions, and thus create more successful user outcomes. They do so by involving designers earlier in the roadmap development to guide product and technology selection, toward a future vision based on user value and aspirations. In this article, we extend two streams of prior research on technology roadmapping (TRM) and design roadmapping (DRM). First, we identify and compare technology and DRM approaches and their distinct strategic emphases: Technology selection and user value, respectively. Second, we compare two cases of DRM deployment in corporations: Siemens and Air France-KLM. The intent is to provide an in-depth understanding of why and how DRM complements TRM and how DRM facilitates making tradeoffs among strategic goals to more comprehensively address the feasibility, viability, and desirability of new product and service designs. We find that DRM embeds a deep understanding of current and future user needs, linking user-centered design and technology selection to strategy in practice.","Kim, Euiyoung;Simonse, Lianne W.L.;Beckman, Sara L.;Appleyard, Melissa M.;Velazquez, Herb;Madrigal, Antonio Suarez;Agogino, Alice M.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-02-01,"The School of Business at Portland State;Faculteit Industrieel Ontwerpen, TU Delft;Haas School of Business;University of California, Berkeley;Georgia Institute of Technology",centered design ;  Design engineering ;  product design ;  product development ;  systems thinking ;  technology management ;  user process design
Pursuing 'Fit for Purpose': An Industry Practioner's Experience with Roadmapping,"Since 2006, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Technology Innovation (TI) Office has applied roadmapping processes to help articulate the federal wholesale electric utility's technology research agenda. The TI Office team has evolved its tools, templates, and process steps considerably over the years in response to implementation challenges, shortcomings in deliverables derived from the process, and maturation opportunities enabled by data management and visualization software. Practioners within the TI Office have sustained their commitment to roadmapping during an era of significant evolution of the practice within industry and academia. The practice came out of product manufacturing environments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Increasingly since the early 2000s, roadmapping has been applied outside this 'traditional' realm, requiring trial, iteration, and customization of processes, tools, and deliverables to meet different requirements. The TI Office's use of roadmapping is one 'nontraditional' variant because the agency is not in the business of generating profits by creating products in response to market demands. Instead, the TI Office has used roadmapping to communicate the agency's technology research, development, and demonstration agenda to the broader community - national laboratories, universities, manufacturers, etc. - so these external organizations can respond with proposals delivering products with the desired technology characteristics. These products, in turn, enable BPA to continue to fulfill its public service mission as an electric utility and government entity in providing safe, cost-effective, and reliable electricity throughout the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.","Hillegas-Elting, James V.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2022-02-01,Bonneville Power Administration,Data visualization ;  electric utility ;  government ;  maturity model ;  roadmapping ;  university-industry collaboration
Towards a circular economy in food consumption: Food waste reduction practices as ethical work,"This article explores the transition towards a circular economy in the context of household food waste practices. The research concerning the circular economy has mainly focused on engineering or the processes of production, manufacturing, business and industry. However, the transition towards a circular economy requires, in addition to new technologies, infrastructures and innovations, a societal change and a change in everyday practices. In this article, we address this by examining the everyday practices of food waste reduction in households as ethical work. We claim that the intertwined practices, institutions and policies of the circular economy create moral categories and responsibilities in everyday food consumption. Thus, the transition towards circular economy requires everyday ethical work carried out by consumers. However, our analysis also brings out some possible challenges related to this transition that has not yet been accomplished. Our research materials consist of 26 food waste diaries collected from Finnish households and participant observation in 4 leftover cooking workshops organized with the Finnish Martha organization. We adapt Michel Foucault’s conception of ethics, focusing on the constitution of ethical subjectivity in food waste practices. Moreover, we utilize practice theoretical approach that has been widely used in food waste and sustainable consumption studies and connect it with Foucault’s theory. Our results suggest that in order to understand the circular economy as a moral economy, it is crucial to note the moral complexity of everyday life that results from partly contradictory ethical sensitivities and practices.","Lehtokunnas, Taru;Mattila, Malla;Närvänen, Elina;Mesiranta, Nina",Journal,Journal of Consumer Culture,2022-02-01,Tampere University,circular economy ;  consumption ;  ethical subjectivity ;  food waste ;  Foucault ;  moral economy ;  practice theory ;  Sustainability
Drama-Based Activities for STEM Education: Encouraging Scientific Aspirations and Debunking Stereotypes in Secondary School Students in Spain and the UK,"This study presents findings from testing an innovative student-centred drama-based teaching methodology for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines for secondary school students. The method, based on performances, was tested in two case studies, Spain and the UK, on a sample of 2089 students. These performances have been shown to be an effective way of generating a two-way dialogue between students and researchers and prompting student reflections about researchers as role models, gender inequalities in science and ethical issues in STEM careers and scientific research. Furthermore, they have enhanced young people’s positive attitudes and interest in science, scientists and scientific careers and have debunked science-related stereotypes. This indicates that the performances evaluated in this study are supporting the aspirations of young people, but not limiting their inclination to critically assess the relative benefits and risks of scientific development for themselves.","Villanueva Baselga, Sergio;Marimon Garrido, Oriol;González Burón, Helena",Journal,Research in Science Education,2022-02-01,Universitat de Barcelona;Big Van Ciencia,Drama-based education ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Science education ;  Scientific vocations ;  Student-centred pedagogy
"""Break the four only"" and ""establish new standards"" based on five value orientations","The evaluation system is basic function of the entire science and technology system. The evaluation of scientific and technological talents acts as the ""guiding stick"" of talent development, which would affect the value orientation, field direction, resource allocation and other key elements influencing the development of scientific and technological talents. In May 2021, Xi Jinping stressed the importance of evaluation system reform at the 20th Academician Conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the 15th Academician Conference of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the 10th National Congress of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology. He called to ""break the four only (paper-only, title-only, education-only and award-only tendency)"" and ""establish new standards"" at the same time. In September 2021, Xi Jinping stressed at the Central Conference on Talent-related Work that we should improve the talent evaluation system and speed up the establishment of a talent evaluation system guided by innovative value, ability and contribution. These views reflected that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China raised great attention to the basic and guiding role of the talent evaluation system, and determined to solve the problems within the current evaluation system. At its core, this study put forth the idea that talent evaluation should be based on the ""scientific value, technical value, economic value, social value and cultural value"" of the accomplishments made by the individual scholar (hereinafter referred to as the ""five values""). Firstly, this paper systematically analyzed the internal relationship between scientific and technological talent evaluation and talent discovery, introduction, assessment, promotion, incentive and support, and summarized the evolvement of quantitative evaluation system internationally and in China as well. The study also reviewed the progress of recent reform of China's scientific and technological talent evaluation. Secondly, the study analyzed the value orientation of different types of scientific and technological talent evaluation based on the five values orientation, that scientific value should be emphasized in the evaluation of the field of basic research, technical value should be emphasized in the evaluation of the field of applied research and technological development, economic value should be emphasized in the evaluation of the field of application and transfer of technology achievements, social value should be emphasized in the field related to public welfare, and cultural value should be emphasized in the field of science popularization, culture and consulting. The study further put forward the countermeasures and suggestions to ""break the four only"" and ""establish new standards"" within the five values framework. The suggestions were from the perspectives of improving the standard system, innovating methods and reforming the mechanism. Talents are the key to promoting independent innovation. Without the backing of a strong talent team, independent innovation is water without a source and a tree without roots. As an important part for the development of scientific and technological talents, talent evaluation should further pay attention to its ""baton"" role, adhere to the concept of five values in the evaluation of scientific and technological innovation achievements, constantly improve the evaluation system of scientific and technological talents, stimulate the internal driving force of scientific and technological talents, and continuously improve the overall level of scientific and technological talents.","Pan, Jiaofeng;Wang, Guanghui;Lu, Xiao",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2022-01-25,Institutes of Science and Development;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Break the four only ;  Establish new standards ;  Five value orientation ;  Scientific and technological talents evaluation

Advances in Multi-scale High Throughput Preparation of Metal Materials,"High throughput experiment of materials is to complete the preparation and characterization of a large number of samples in a short time, which can help researchers quickly screen the composition and process combination of new materials, efficiently explore the genes of mate-rial innovation, and thus promote the iterative ability of independent innovation. It is one of the key technologies of material genome engineering. High throughput preparation is the cornerstone of high throughput experiment. Its technical development direction can be summarized into two ca-tegories. The first is to improve the preparation efficiency through parallel experiments. The second is to achieve gradient changes in composition or process parameters on the same sample. According to the scale of sample preparation unit, it can be divided into nano-micro sample preparation method and macro sample preparation method. Nano-micro scale high throughput preparation technology represented by diffusion multiple method and combinatorial chips method has been widely used in various new materials. At present, one of the important development directions in this field is the high throughput preparation technology of bulk samples to realize the direct characterization of macroscopic mechanical properties. High throughput preparation methods of developing macro-scale samples can be generally divided into two categories: component high throughput preparation and process high throughput preparation. In this paper, latest research progress of high throughput preparation technology is reviewed, especially a combination technical approach of high throughput experiment and additive manufacture. In addition, the application of several high throughput preparation technologies in the design of high entropy alloys, amorphous alloys and novel structural materials are listed. The key points and trends of the future development of high throughput preparation technology are finally analyzed, including the high throughput preparation of homogeneous bulk samples, the integration of high throughput preparation and characterization and the development of an integra-ted cloud data platform for high throughput data acquisition, management and learning. We have confidence in that high throughput experiment will become a crucial tool for material innovation and hope to provide other researchers more technical ideas for the composition and process design of new metal materials by this review.","Hou, Yaqing;Su, Hang;Zhang, Hao;Wang, Changchang",Journal,Cailiao Daobao/Materials Reports,2022-01-10,China Iron and Steel Research Institute Group;Ltd;Ltd.,Bulk metallic samples ;  High entropy alloys ;  High throughput experiment ;  High throughput synthesis ;  Laser additive manufacture ;  Material genome engineering

Biotechnological approaches for genetic improvement of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.),"Castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) is an annual chiefly nonedible oilseed crop of commercial and industrial importance cultivated worldwide. There are emerging genetic improvement objectives including need for developing CMS system, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, ideal plant types for high-density planting and mechanical harvesting, and ricin-free castor bean seeds. Conventional breeding efforts and innovations including hybrid development using two-line system, selecting annual type from perennial nature, incorporating resistance against diseases, increasing harvest index, etc. have contributed immensely for increasing the productivity of the crop. However, in the absence of suitable genetic material with suitable traits, a few of the objectives such as resistance to gray mold disease, resistance to foliage feeders, ricin-free castor bean, etc. have not been achieved with the traditional approach. In this background, the success stories that have been witnessed in other crops as well as with the basic information that has been generated in castor bean suggest that biotechnological approaches employing genomics-assisted breeding and genetic engineering strategies have immense potential in the genetic improvement of castor bean. With this understanding, to create an updated information, the available literature on various aspects of biotechnological research such as genetic and genomic resources, genetic engineering tools, and techniques developed in castor bean has been reviewed, and appropriate strategies along with the future scope are presented that could be adopted for genetic enhancement of castor bean both for input and output traits.","Kumaraswamy, H.

Making or breaking the business case of digital transformation initiatives: the key role of learnings,"Purpose: The research aims to investigate how firms can develop their sensing capabilities for Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technology adoption through reframing their opportunity perceptions related to learnings from I4.0 initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: The research follows a design science research approach. Following the case of I4.0 technology introduction at a large food manufacturer, the paper develops a theoretical framework (artefact) and validates the applicability and efficacy of the framework within the case study. Findings: The theoretical framework highlights the different temporal (short-term/long-term) and locational (direct/indirect) value dimensions of I4.0 opportunities. The findings show that the use of the framework can shift managers’ perception regarding the business value of an I4.0 technology implementation. Specifically, the framework reversed initially negative perceptions around a narrowly scoped business case towards an opportunity-oriented attitude exploring further potentials of the technology. Research limitations/implications: The research adds to the debate when and why firms engage in, and sustain their I4.0 initiatives by providing a novel perspective on firms’ sensing capabilities. As a single-case study, the framework requires further validation in practice. Practical implications: The proposed framework provides practitioners with an extended view concerning the potential value of digital transformation projects and serves as a conversational tool. Originality/value: The presented wider frame for evaluating digital transformation projects, taking into account the more “intangible” value of their learnings, tackles the fundamental issue of translating explorative innovation efforts into exploitative value – a key challenge when dealing with innovation and one of the main barriers for the digital transformation.","Colli, Michele;Stingl, Verena;Waehrens, Brian V.",Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2022-01-03,Aalborg University,Dynamic capabilities ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge mapping ;  Learning
Applications of object detection in modular construction based on a comparative evaluation of deep learning algorithms,"Purpose: The practice of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being promoted by technology developers. However, its adoption rate is still reported as low in the construction industry due to a lack of expertise and the limited reliable applications for AI technology. Hence, this paper aims to present the detailed outcome of experimentations evaluating the applicability and the performance of AI object detection algorithms for construction modular object detection. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a thorough evaluation of two deep learning algorithms for object detection, including the faster region-based convolutional neural network (faster RCNN) and single shot multi-box detector (SSD). Two types of metrics are also presented; first, the average recall and mean average precision by image pixels; second, the recall and precision by counting. To conduct the experiments using the selected algorithms, four infrastructure and building construction sites are chosen to collect the required data, including a total of 990 images of three different but common modular objects, including modular panels, safety barricades and site fences. Findings: The results of the comprehensive evaluation of the algorithms show that the performance of faster RCNN and SSD depends on the context that detection occurs. Indeed, surrounding objects and the backgrounds of the objects affect the level of accuracy obtained from the AI analysis and may particularly effect precision and recall. The analysis of loss lines shows that the loss lines for selected objects depend on both their geometry and the image background. The results on selected objects show that faster RCNN offers higher accuracy than SSD for detection of selected objects. Research limitations/implications: The results show that modular object detection is crucial in construction for the achievement of the required information for project quality and safety objectives. The detection process can significantly improve monitoring object installation progress in an accurate and machine-based manner avoiding human errors. The results of this paper are limited to three construction sites, but future investigations can cover more tasks or objects from different construction sites in a fully automated manner. Originality/value: This paper’s originality lies in offering new AI applications in modular construction, using a large first-hand data set collected from three construction sites. Furthermore, the paper presents the scientific evaluation results of implementing recent object detection algorithms across a set of extended metrics using the original training and validation data sets to improve the generalisability of the experimentation. This paper also provides the practitioners and scholars with a workflow on AI applications in the modular context and the first-hand referencing data.","Liu, Chang;M.E.

Expression of Concern: Machine Learning based Robust Techniques to Detect DDoS Attacks in WSN (2022 International Conference on Intelligent Innovations in Engineering and Technology (ICIIET) DOI: 10.1109/ICIIET55458.2022.9967543),"One of the most hazardous threats in the current environment is DDOs attacks. It is challenging to identify and defend against these attacks since they are becoming more sophisticated and more frequent every day. So it's important to identify and prevent such type of attack before any impact. In this study, research on a new dataset of DDoS attacks which includes HTTP Flood attacks, and UDP Flood is conducted.SVM, KNN, and Random Forest among other machine learning algorithms for classification are used in this work to classify nodes as malicious or non-malicious nodes. Additionally, Fuzzy inference rules are applied to malicious nodes classified by machine learning algorithms(SVM, KNN, and Random Forest)accurately identify nodes as highly malicious, moderate malicious, or nonmalicious. Finally using all the processed information a decision is made to eliminate all the highly malicious nodes. Moreover, we have created a dataset namely AVV-DDos2286 which will be made publicly available for further studies on DDO attacks. Our proposed method uses a better hybrid approach combining machine learning algorithms with Fuzzy logic systems which outperform conventional DDos attack detection systems implemented using stand-alone machine learning algorithms.

Improving the application of Reinforcement Learning for load shifting in a cooling system through state-of-the-art algorithms and hyper-parameter optimization,"Increasing volatility in electricity generation makes an increasing degree of flexibility on the consumer side necessary. There are many methods to solve the resulting optimization problem, all of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. Rule-based Control is unsuitable for optimal integration of dynamic constraints, and the promising Model Predictive Control comes with a high engineering overhead. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subfamily of Machine Learning, has therefore been established as another method in research. In a previous work, we have demonstrated how two RL algorithms can be used for load shifting in a simulated cooling network with three consumer sites, under dynamic constraints. The continuous control DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm achieved slightly better results compared to the discrete control DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm. However, both were generally suitable for the application. In this work, we now investigate how the training and the final control performance change when recent innovations from RL research are used for both algorithms. For the continuous case, a SAC (Soft-Actor-Critic) algorithm is used and the discrete controlling DQN receives two additional design extensions. In addition, a Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization is performed for both algorithms. We can show that the training time is reduced several magnitudes compared to the last study while maintaining the same performance. After completion of training, both algorithms can save about 13 % of the weekly operating costs through load shifting, while maintaining the required temperature limits. Thus, the application to real-world problems becomes more feasible if the latest innovations from RL research are used.","Schreiber, Thomas;Evenschor, Vincent;Müller, Dirk",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of ECOS 2022 - 35th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems",2022-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Bayesian optimization ;  Building Energy System ;  Cooling network ;  Load shifting ;  Optimal control ;  Reinforcement Learning
"Teaching computational systems biology with an eye on quantitative systems pharmacology at the undergraduate level: Why do it, who would take it, and what should we teach?","Computational systems biology (CSB) is a field that emerged primarily as the product of research activities. As such, it grew in several directions in a distributed and uncoordinated manner making the area appealing and fascinating. The idea of not having to follow a specific path but instead creating one fueled innovation. As the field matured, several interdisciplinary graduate programs emerged attempting to educate future generations of computational systems biologists. These educational initiatives coordinated the dissemination of information across student populations that had already decided to specialize in this field. However, we are now entering an era where CSB, having established itself as a valuable research discipline, is attempting the next major step: Entering undergraduate curricula. As interesting as this endeavor may sound, it has several difficulties, mainly because the field is not uniformly defined. In this manuscript, we argue that this diversity is a significant advantage and that several incarnations of an undergraduate-level CSB biology course could, and should, be developed tailored to programmatic needs. In this manuscript, we share our experiences creating a course as part of a Biomedical Engineering program.","Androulakis, Ioannis P.",Journal,Frontiers in Systems Biology,2022-01-01,Rutgers University–New Brunswick;Biomedical Engineering Department,biomedical ;  computational systems biology ;  computational systems pharmacology ;  engineering ;  undergraduate
Breaking barriers: Scientific contributions in virology from women in low- and middle-income countries,"The advancement of science has been a collective effort and benefits from a diversity of views and gender representation. However, support for and recognition of women in science is often insufficient. Despite historically being marginalized by the scientific community, research by women has advanced the field of virology, from the discovery of rotavirus and isolation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to a vaccine for polio and the initial description of a virus’ ability to cause cancer. Although women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are continuing to share their diverse wealth of knowledge and innovation, even today many are under-recognized and under-supported in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This review will highlight women in virology from LMICs in Africa, Asia, and Latin America where the barriers to scientific education and achievement for women can be far greater than in high income countries. Despite these barriers, the women we profile below have made important contributions to translational virology. We hope this review will contribute to the global expansion of efforts to provide improved access to and retention in scientific careers for women.","Chinunga, Tehillah Taonga;Titanji, Boghuma Kabisen;Chahroudi, Ann",Journal,Frontiers in Virology,2022-01-01,Emory University School of Medicine;Emory University,diversity ;  low- and middle-income countries ;  scientific careers ;  translational virology ;  women in STEM
New challenges in drug discovery,"Drug discovery is a process by which novel potential medicines are identified via a series of critical research activities. It comprises a variety of scientific fields, including pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. The drug discovery centers and industries have supplied several life-saving medications for decades, which contribute to novel treatment opportunities for several life-threatening diseases. A central aim of the initiatives for drug discovery is to identify new molecular entities that can be useful in the management of diseases with unsatisfied needs. These conditions do not have useful treatments and, in fact, or potentially, constitute life threats. Many disorders, particularly acute diseases, can now be treated and managed properly. New drugs for heart disease, metabolic disorders, osteoporosis, mental health problems, oncology, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive health care, viral infections, etc. have been discovered to improve the health and quality of life. The entire procedure of drug discovery is a very complicated, time-consuming, expensive, and financially risky effort. Nowadays, drugs are produced via different naturally occurring resources, both traditionally or by various innovative techniques (Figure 25.1). Normally, it takes 10–15 years and requires the application of even over 2.5 billion dollars to have a novel medication in the market. In terms of the research & development (R & D) process and the new drug application process (NDA), the drug development industry is restructuring worldwide. Many of the restructurings were driven by costs, often benchmarked by governments in the United States and Europe, to provide the best value to the public purse for the purchase of medicines for national medical services. During the early stages of the drug development process, large-scale and complex chemical libraries are examined to identify new hits (i.e., bioactive compounds, ligands, and biomarkers). The complete process of drug discovery and development is graphically represented in Figure 25.2. Traditional medicinal chemistry strategies are often combined with sophisticated structural-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD) methods for exploring the huge chemical and biological molecules mostly as a major element of hit-to-lead advancement, lead standardization, and development of new active compounds. It is well known that drug discovery changed. In the past 5 years, Big Pharma around the world has undergone significant restructuring, with large companies remaining in need of all their skills and knowledge. It started outsourcing research organizations, but now it has gone much even further into the digital world. The path from concept in the new world of drug discovery and the goal of patient benefit validation will be a joint effort. New therapeutic classes are generated based on scientific options and therapeutical needs of drugs like pain medication, sedatives, L-dopa, antimicrobial agents, bioactive molecules, immunotherapies, and other drugs. All these medications were developed within a chemical framework of drug therapy and medication. Historically procedure of drug discovery and development is as old as some of the oldest human cultures. Ayurveda practice in India and traditional Chinese medicines in China are still in practice with over 5000-year-old therapy. Since the time Edward Jenner discovered immunization against smallpox, the beginning of modern medicine is considered. The field developed gradually until 1928, when Sir Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin after which the field of medicinal chemistry flourished and it became a complex interdisciplinary platform by the end of the twentieth century, mainly based on synthetic biological chemistry, which extended to multiple physiological specificities. Just at the beginning of the 21st century, research on drug discovery faced new challenges that transformed the classical concept of drug development that had taken place over half a century in practice. Pharmaceutical firms have therefore settled policies to address these problems and identified many key success features. While there are significant obstacles to marketing new drugs, it is a trend in the past 15 years that the number of drug approvals has increased. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority approved an average of 43 drugs in 2014–18, compared to an average of 23 in the first decade of the century. Researchers regard 2018 as a successful year with almost 59 FDA-approved drugs. Though impressive, these figures must be seen as part of total research and development (R&D) spending in the pharmaceutical sector. As a result, in 35 years, efforts to find and develop new drugs have been doubled. We are still a long way behind this pursuit, despite progress and heavy investment. The concern is that there seems to be something wrong in this translation from precise early discovery experiments to translations in different animal models and clinical trials. All the high molecule assumptions focus on various methods for the mapping of chemicals and wet lab goals, including the target design of drugs, the creation of new targets and implementing existing targets, and the launch of special molecules from multiple perspectives, on a synthetic route and the biodiversity test for novel drugs, appeared to be failed. Despite high promising activities in the in-vitro models, the drop-off of molecules when transported through the development chain is high. In recent years, countless emerging innovations and concepts have emerged for drug discovery. Besides the onset of each new method, a commitment was made to generate better drugs while reducing or containing costs. At least to some degree, these techniques have been employed in most pharmaceutical companies. During the same period, industry management has been greatly pressured by shareholders and investors to increase drug development and innovation productivity to meet annual growth expectations. The most noticeable methods to cure have already been tried and often failed for many diseases. During the same period, industry management has been greatly pressured by shareholders and investors to increase drug development and innovation productivity to meet annual growth expectations. The most noticeable methods to cure have already been tried and often failed for many diseases. For the development and evaluation of new medicines, the complexity of human biology also presents many challenges. Drug molecules with activity specific to one unique biological pathway in diseased cells with an optimal beginning and/or duration of action pharmacokinetic profile or without side effects as a result of systemically exposed conditions are very difficult to design. Patient compliance can also be a significant challenge when taking medicines. Drug delivery systems allow the design and engineering level of control to overcome these challenges beyond the inherent properties of the drug molecule. The old ways of finding drugs have passed forever and surely nobody wants to go back to packing and running columns manually. The trend we presently see for the large pharmaceutical chemist to become a multidisciplinary drug explorer at the core of a global discovery web. Some common challenges in the field of drug discovery are described in the following sections.","Bano, Iqra;Butt, Usman Dawood;Mohsan, Syed Agha Hassnain",Book,Novel Platforms for Drug Delivery Applications,2022-01-01,Ocean College Zhejiang University;Zhengzhou University;Faculty of Bio-sciences Sakrand,challenges ;  clinical trials ;  development ;  Drug ;  drug discovery
Evaluation of a Proposed Set of Usability Heuristics,"The innovations proposed by the mobile phone market have grown steadily in recent years, along with the increasing complexity of the hardware, operating systems and applications available in this market. These changes bring new usability-related challenges that need to be considered during the application development process, as new forms of user-application interaction increasingly require behavioral adaptation. In this situation, usability is an important issue, which depends on usability factors such as the User, their characteristics and skills, the Task he intends to achieve and also the Context of Use in which the user and the application are inserted. The components of this set are detailed in a set of heuristics previous proposed that was evaluated through two heuristic evaluations, which allowed to incorporate improvements to the proposal. Furthermore, a set of 13 usability heuristics and 183 sub-heuristics were proposed, which, through heuristic evaluations, better results were evidenced.

"Research on the development pattern of ""Double Helix structure"" combining basic research with engineering application of near space environment","As a breakthrough point of strategic basic frontier and major scientific problems, the field of near space presents new characteristics of dual engines driven by basic research and independent technological innovation. The development of environmental detection, atmospheric model, and numerical prediction in near space is reviewed. In addition, the influence of the atmospheric environment in near space on aircraft design and operation is analyzed. The results show that the variation of the environmental parameters in the near space at different time scales and space scales will significantly affect the aerodynamic heat, structural response, combustion efficiency and stability, target characteristic prediction, navigation control, and other aircraft performance, and greatly affect the flight performance and operational efficiency of the aircraft. The actual environment faced by aircraft flying near space is far more complex than the standard atmospheric models used in the design process. By analyzing the typical cases, aiming at the current situation that basic research and engineering application are less crosslinked and the existing basic research mode is relatively insufficient to support engineering application, it is proposed to establish the "" Double-Helical structure"" development mode driven by fundamental research and engineering application together to strengthen the coupling iteration of basic research and engineering application in the environmental field. Considering the development goals, problems, and challenges of basic research on the near space environment in China, some suggestions are put forward from the aspects of policy strategy, innovation ability, and innovation environment.","Jian, Zhuang;Fei, Cui",Journal,Aerospace Technology,2022-01-01,Innovation and Research Institute of HIWING Technology Academy;HIWING Technology Academy of CASIC,aircraft ;  Double Helix structure ;  environment detection ;  near space ;  Quasi-Zero wind layer
A review of research on design theory and engineering practice of high-speed railway turnout,"This paper systematically reviews the research progress, problems, specific countermeasures, and development trends of dynamic design theory as applied to high-speed railway turnouts. This includes wheel–rail contact solving, high-speed vehicle–turnout dynamic interaction simulation, analysis of long-term turnout performance deterioration, safety assessment of trains passing through the turnout, and the maintenance and management of turnout serviceability. High-speed turnouts still face severe technical challenges with regard to their acclimation to the future development of rail transit technology. Some of these challenges include the suitability of next-generation higher-speed turnouts to a complex environment, lifecycle design, optimization of wheel–rail matching and vehicle–turnout dynamic performance, real-time status capture and performance assessment, health management and damage prediction. It is now necessary to deepen the basic theoretical study of high-speed railway turnouts, and integrate cutting-edge techniques, such as advanced materials and manufacturing, intelligence and automation, big data and cloud computing, in an effort to enhance China’s capabilities for original innovation in high-speed railway turnout technology. By analysing the present situation in a problem-orientated manner, this paper aims to provide a new perspective, as well as some basic data for academic research into technological innovations for railway engineering.","Wang, Ping;Xu, Jingmang;Wang, Shuguo;Qian, Yao;Chen, Rong;Yang, Fei;Fang, Jiasheng",Journal,Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure,2022-01-01,Southwest Jiaotong University;China Academy of Railway Sciences,damage prediction ;  health management ;  High-speed railway turnout ;  performance assessment ;  real-time status capture ;  vehicle-turnout dynamic
Institutional Investors and Green Innovation of Stateowned Enterprises - Based on the Intermediary Role of Green Agency Costs,"In the context of promoting mixed ownership reform and developing green economic policies, whether these two policies can have synergistic effects is the problem we have studied in this paper. Taking Chinese A-share state-owned companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges from 2012 to 2018 as the research sample we empirically examine the impact of institutional investors' participation on green technology innovation activities of Chinese state-owned enterprises and find that institutional investors tend to promote the development the green innovation in SOEs. The conclusion still holds after taking endogenous problems into consideration, and we adopt instrumental variable, lagged variables and Tobit model to ease the endogenous problems. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce green agency costs to study the inner mechanism. The results show that the participation of institutional investors affects green technology innovation by alleviating green agency cost, indicating a promoting and monitoring role of institutional investors. This study puts forward the development path and policy guidance about green innovation from the internal perspective of enterprises, which is of profound significance to the development of mixed ownership reform and green economy strategy.","Long, Lingxiao;Yang, Junqi",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2022 6th International Conference on Business and Information Management, ICBIM 2022",2022-01-01,Business School of Sichuan University,Green innovation ;  institutional investors ;  state-owned enterprises
Digitalization of Education,"This paper discusses features and diversity of concepts and initiatives for digitalization in education. It also briefly discusses the advantages and challenges related to development of digitalized environments in education, as well as greater need for professional development of people working in digitalization. In addition, they encourage and promote innovation in many different spheres of life. The innovative capacity of technology is highly conditioned by the levels of digital skills of the population. It is not surprising that there is a very strong link between education and skills needed to utilize digital technologies in different spheres of life. An efficient, diverse, and strong higher education sector and research system will help the higher education sector to achieve this goal in the best possible way. Universities and faculties manage a significant portion of community resources and must use those resources effectively and for the benefit of society. Institutions will develop their positions according to their strengths and individuality and will contribute to higher quality and to other sectors of society. Furthermore, they will meet the needs of society in various fields and help each country to internationally affirm itself as an outstanding knowledge society. Digitalization is a tool for making fundamental changes in the processes, content, and various forms of work, which can put the education sector in a better position to achieve the goals of education and research, to increase quality and relevance in the approach to education for all. The time when experts talked about education technology in terms of audio, visual and experiential technology has passed. They also talked about hardware technology, software technology and a system based on technology. These are expressions from the past, as the old concepts in the field of educational technology or EdTech have been outdated during the last decade.","Nadrljanski, Đorđe;Nadrljanski, Mila;Pavlinović, Mira",Book Series,Learning and Analytics in Intelligent Systems,2022-01-01,"Faculty of Maritime Studies, University of Split;College of Inspection and Personnel Management",Digital skills ;  Digitalization ;  Educational technology ;  Higher education
Evaluating Knowledge Management Parallel to Nature-Based Solutions-Project MarkerWadden,"Marker Wadden follows the Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) concept to tackle multiple challenges in freshwater lake Markermeer (The Netherlands). NBS presents opportunities for knowledge management practices in the fields of engineering, ecology, and governance, which is a specific goal of the project. Therefore, Knowledge and Innovation program Marker Wadden (KIMA) was established. KIMA enabled knowledge management practices, such as monitoring, fundamental and applied research, parallel to the construction phase. Transferring knowledge back to the construction project and to other NBS-projects and -programs is regarded as a necessity to ensure scale-up. We argue that internal and external alignment can remove or bridge barriers between knowledge management, and application in ongoing construction activities and other NBS- applications. In this research we evaluate the internal alignment of KIMA with the construction project Marker Wadden, and its external alignment with other applications of NBS. Our data indicates that KIMA was only partially capable of realizing internal and external alignment. Absence of the consortium leader in the research program, a suboptimal financial construction, the belated start of research activities, a lack of incentive in the construction contract to engage in knowledge management, unstructured connection to system-level projects and major research programs were restraining factors.","Stouten, Marijn;Duijn, Michael;Ijff, Stephanie;Veraart, Jeroen;Husken, Lieke",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the IAHR World Congress,2022-01-01,Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences;Deltares;Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam;Wageningen University & Research,Alignment ;  Governance ;  Knowledge management ;  Knowledge transfer ;  Nature-Based Solutions

Innovation through process automation: Factors for success,"This paper seeks to identify critical success factors and inhibitors in process improvement initiatives such as process automation and application integration. In a fast-paced global competitive environment, business processes are considered a vital organizational asset and key differentiator. Several business process methodologies were considered to understand the efficacy of process improvements to accomplish desired benefits. A hybrid research methodology is used to deep dive into these factors combined with a pragmatic analysis of the phenomenology of a study abroad application process of an Australian University, after enabling automation and application integration. Additionally, a supplementary analysis of case studies is presented to deduce how process improvement frameworks influence or inhibit process improvement initiatives. Factors in a business process management (BPM) capability framework were mapped to identify critical success factors (CSFs) and inhibitors. The outcome of this research is a theoretical framework to support organizations to successfully implement continuous improvement initiatives.","Bachiller, Yvonne;Busch, Peter;Smith, Stephen",Conference Proceeding,"ACIS 2022 - Australasian Conference on Information Systems, Proceedings",2022-01-01,The University of Sydney;Macquarie University,business process management ;  critical success factors ;  process automation ;  process improvement ;  six sigma
The genomics of ornamental plants: current status and opportunities,"With the rapid development of sequencing technologies, followed by the reduction of sequencing cost, numerous ornamental plants have been sequenced, resulting in their genomic studies shifting from gene cloning and marker development to whole genome profiling. A profound understanding of genome structure and function at the whole genome level can not only help to modify ornamental traits, such as fragrance, color and flower shape, through genetic engineering, but also infer the genetic relationship and evolutionary history of ornamental plants via comparative genomics analysis. In this paper, we review the current situation of sequencing strategies and the application of genomics to study the origin and evolution of ornamental plants. We highlight challenges of ornamental plant genomic research. The use of cutting-edge technologies, such as genomics, gene editing and molecular design polymerization breeding, can facilitate our understanding of genetic regulation mechanisms and the germplasm innovation of important traits in ornamental plants. The results can be expected to significantly increase the breeding efficiency of ornamental plants.","Li, Mingyu;Wen, Zhenying;Meng, Juan;Cheng, Tangren;Zhang, Qixiang;Sun, Lidan",Journal,Ornamental Plant Research,2022-01-01,Beijing Forestry University,Genetic modification ;  Genome sequences ;  Genomics ;  Ornamental plants ;  Ornamental traits
Autonomous Ferries and Cargo Ships: Discovering Ethical Issues via a Challenge-Based Learning Approach in Higher Education,"The ethics of autonomous vehicles continue to be discussed at length in both academia and with the general public. Even though on the level of principles, there is ample fruitful discourse, what is often missing is a discussion targeted at implementation specific ethical challenges. However, outcomes of these discussions could guide developers and stakeholders in advancing towards a thoroughly responsible design of these autonomous and intelligent systems. This contribution reports on the investigation of the ethics of autonomous, zero emission ferries and cargo ships in such a practical way, carried out via engaging university students with the issue during a challenge-based learning engineering ethics course at the University of Lübeck. Within this course, a three-way discourse has unfolded between student groups, supervisors and Unleash Future Boats, a company active in the field of autonomous, hydrogen-powered ferries and cargo ships. Not only do we present a framework for teaching engineering ethics that strives to equip future engineers with a working knowledge and methodology to use ethics as a productive and integrated tool for decision-making during business and engineering development. We also share preliminary insights into relevant and specific ethical challenges to be met when implementing autonomous ferries and cargo ships for inland navigation.","Herzog, Christian;Leinweber, Noah Art;Engelhard, Stefanie A.;Engelhard, Lars H.",Conference Proceeding,"International Symposium on Technology and Society, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Universität zu Lübeck;Unleash Future Boats GmbH,Artificial Intelligence ;  Autonomous and Intelligent Systems ;  Autonomous Ships ;  Challenge-Based Learning ;  Ethics ;  Responsible Research and Innovation
From Responsible Innovation to Interrelational Technology Development,"This paper is about responsible technology development within Indigenous communities and brings to light the shortcomings of responsible innovation (RI) and responsible research and innovation (RRI) in context. A literature review is presented of select works in RI, RRI, and critical race theory in Science and Technology Studies (STS) as conceptual foci in relation to public interest technology development with a U.S. BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) focus. The paper further explores gaps in these approaches to responsible technology development as applied to Indigenous communities and continues with a literature review of select works within Indigenous theory. The author argues the need for both Indigenous theory and Indigenous data sovereignty as required elements when working with and within Indigenous communities. The paper concludes by proposing 'Interrelational Technology Development' to provide greater awareness and a conceptual framework for harm mitigation with increased responsibility, relevance, and respect for and within BIPOC communities.","Mesa, Alycia De",Conference Proceeding,"International Symposium on Technology and Society, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Arizona State University,critical race STS ;  ethics ;  Indigenous communities ;  Indigenous data sovereignty ;  Indigenous theory ;  responsible development ;  responsible innovation ;  technology development
"Educating for Precision Livestock Farming: The knowledge, skills and abilities to meet future industry and societal needs","The field of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is flourishing throughout the world, being driven by the fast development of accessible hardware and powerful computational technologies in combination with the growing need for solutions that enable sustainable animal production. Research in this field is burgeoning, with the number of publications indexed by Web of ScienceTM exponentially growing since 2016. Moreover, the translation of this science into commercial solutions is also booming, as evidenced by the recent emergence of many new high-tech PLF start-ups. For the continued success of the PLF field, it is important to align education with industry and societal needs. Education of PLF should provide individuals with knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA’s) not only to facilitate the innovation of high-quality technologies but to appreciate the practical and ethical issues in their application for sustainable animal production. A sub-group of International Commission of Agricultural Engineering (CIGR) Technical Section II has formed around an action to investigate “Educating for Precision Livestock Farming”. The objective is to identify the KSA’s needed for success at graduation and to provide pointers on learning paths for students of different backgrounds (animal science, animal production or engineering) and career goals (e.g. PLF researcher, technology developer, system technical support, farmer and veterinarian). To this end, data concerning PLF KSAs will be gathered from two sources: (1) existing course syllabi offered internationally and (2) a survey conducted with representatives of relevant companies. We will present the current results of this action during EC-PLF 2022 and use the opportunity to collect additional information from participants.","Norton, T.;Brown-Brandl, T.;Panagakis, P.;Cruz, V.;Diefes-Dux, H.;Calvet, S.",Conference Proceeding,"Precision Livestock Farming 2022 - Papers Presented at the 10th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, ECPLF 2022",2022-01-01,University of Évora;University of Nebraska–Lincoln;KU Leuven;Agricultural University of Athens;Universitat Politècnica de València,

Literature Searching/Compiling/Understanding for Support of Student Research/Projects: A Dedicated Course Approach,"Searching, compiling, understanding, and explaining the literature relative to one's research or project represents an essential 21st century skill for students. The innovation in the present work is that the full range of these diverse topics can be integrated and team taught, in a single unified course format. There is widespread awareness that the rapid advances in technology have greatly accelerated fundamental progress in science, engineering, and medicine as well as in the entrepreneurial development in these fields. Simultaneously, there have been, perhaps less publicized, advances in information science, database technology, literature searching tools, data compilation tools, and data sharing tools. To be competitive, students need to learn about and to incorporate these powerful tools into their research and engineering project work while they are in school and after graduation. Lessons learned in developing a productive academic research laboratory (Optics Laboratory at Georgia Tech) were used to formulate an inclusive suite of the needed topics and to introduce these via a course for undergraduate students to be team taught by an engineering professor and several librarians. After five offerings, this course has earned permanent listing. The resulting 2-credit hour elective ""Research Methods"" course has gotten high course evaluations.

Evaluation of Operational Challenges in Highway Construction Material Delivery,"One out of every 5 miles of highways and 45,000 bridges in the United States are in poor condition. Transportation agencies and highway construction industries are significantly impacted by workforce shortage, quality issues, and schedule delays for decades. For almost two decades, the industry has been facing the same obstacles, and it is high time that these problems are addressed with research, innovation, and implementation. This study's objectives are to (1) identify the various inefficiencies in material delivery, ticketing, and inspection processes; (2) rank the challenges to analyze their impact; and (3) identify proven technologies that can mitigate the encountered challenges. The study involved a comprehensive review of literature before distributing a survey questionnaire to 20 state departments of transportation (DOTs). Using the Relative Importance Index (RII), the authors have ranked the operational challenges in highway construction. According to the findings of the study, the primary challenge in highway construction is the shortage of field engineers and inspectors. This research will encourage state DOTs to implement digital delivery and inspection technologies. Utilizing electronic ticketing and electronic inspection will eliminate some of the challenges and assist in mitigating the rest.","Subramanya, Karthik;Kermanshachi, Sharareh;Pamidimukkala, Apurva;Loganathan, Karthikeyan",Conference Proceeding,Tran-SET 2022 - Proceedings of the Tran-SET Conference 2022,2022-01-01,University of Texas at Arlington College of Engineering,Challenges ;  Highway ;  Innovation ;  Technology ;  Workforce
LEAN PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION IN THE PROJECT DEFINITION PHASE: THE CASE OF PERU,"Public construction in developing countries is characterized by a lack of quality design information, poor front-end engineering studies, fragmented procurement, and financial obstacles. As a result, projects exhibit major delays, cost overruns, and contract resolution during construction which end up in failed projects. These issues cause dramatic losses in value for end-users and society. Current literature suggests that the main issues in public construction are rooted in the strategic definition, briefing, and concept design. To tackle these problems, the current research will focus on understanding the value-generating principles of public construction at the project definition phase by using the Lean Project Delivery System (LPDS). The methodology in this research is inductive and based on qualitative data. The case of Peru was used as a case representing a developing country. The findings show that the value-generating principles for public construction are end-user consideration, asset functionality, transparency, efficiency, predictability, and efficacy. However, the institutional pressures both enable and constrain public managers’ ability to deliver the expected outcomes and value. This represents a great opportunity to deploy lean methods at the beginning of the project to improve transparency, collaboration, and drive innovation. Future studies can develop a lean-enabled framework for public construction and scrutinize the constraints for value generation.","Lujan, Guillermo Prado;Murguia, Danny",Conference Proceeding,"30th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2022",2022-01-01,Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,Lean construction ;  LPDS ;  project definition ;  public construction
"Rural governance modernization strategy from the prospect of engineering, science and technology","Rural governance is the cornerstone of national governance in China. Research on the strategy of rural governance modernization plays an important role in clarifying the medium and long-term strategic deployment direction of China’s rural governance, and it is also of great significance to realize the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. This paper first scientifically analyzed the main difficulties faced by rural governance in China. And then based on the perspective of engineering science and technology innovation, it dissected the strategic needs for engineering science and technology in rural governance modernization. Thirdly it proposed the strategic vision and strategic path for China’s rural governance modernization enabled by engineering science and technology in detail. Finally, it put forward a series of policy recommendations for promoting the implementation of engineering science and technology in rural governance modernization. The research conclusion showed that 1) nowadays, China’s rural governance was facing such problems as fragmentation of governance processes, uncoordinated governance subjects, unscientific governance methods, high governance costs, and uneven governance efficiency, etc. 2) As China had been entering a new stage of development, positive progress had been made in the engineering science and technology of rural governance, it was urgent to give full play to the role of engineering science and technology in consolidating the material foundation of rural governance, improving the comprehensive effectiveness of rural governance, and accurately meeting the needs of multiple subjects, and then plan a new way to the modernization of rural governance in China from the strategic level of engineering science and technology. 3) By 2050, China's rural area was facing three changes that were the transformation from rural China to urban China, the transformation from a traditional society to an information society, and the transformation from an all-round well-off society to common prosperity. It was suggested to promote the deep integration of engineering science and technology with rural governance focusing on the important fields and key links of rural governance such as rural public service, public management, public security, and environmental governance, and then build a system for rural governance with the support of “policy environment, modern science and technology, engineering projects and high-quality talents”, achieving the goal of modern governance of rural autonomy, rule of virtue, rule of law and intellectual governance under the guidance of Party construction, and supporting the Rural Revitalization Strategy and the realization of common prosperity. 4) To accelerate the implementation and transformation of rural governance engineering technology, this paper proposed a series of policy arrangements such as strengthening top-level design, strengthening scientific and technological projects, highlighting the main body of farmers, exploring business governance, and implementing classified promotion strategies.","Feng, Xian;Li, Jin;Cao, Bingxue;Fan, Beibei;Ma, Chen",Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2022-01-01,Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences;National Engineering Research Center for Information Technology in Agriculture Beijing,development strategy ;  engineering science ;  modernization ;  rural governance ;  rural vitalization ;  technology

LEGAL ISSUES OF SPACECRAFT MANEUVERING WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - COMPARATIVE STUDY WITH THE JAPANESE REGULATIONS FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING VEHICLES ON THE GROUND,"What are the legal issues to realize safe operation of spacecraft with Autonomous Intelligent Systems in space? Technological innovations on artificial intelligence-based autonomous systems for space operations are developing rapidly, but the legal infrastructure to solve these issues when spacecraft cause incidents and/or accidents due to autonomous driving has not yet been evolved. When considering new means of resolving legal disputes in space, a comparative study with the legal regulations for automated driving of automobiles on the ground would be helpful. This research reviews the current status of legislation regarding the automatic driving of automobiles, which is being undertaken in Japan and other countries, and examine whether it can be invoked in space. A new safety standards and safety evaluation methods that correspond to the operation of the vehicle (including both ground vehicles and spacecrafts) by the autonomous driving system will need to be set, in addition to the conventional vehicle safety standards that are premised on driving by the driver, for the practical application of autonomous vehicles. For that purpose, the definition of” autonomous driving” must be clarified first. In this study, in accordance with the guidelines formulated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan, the classification (level 0-level 5) of the Society of Automobile Engineering International J3016 is cited as the definition of the level of autonomous driving in automobiles; in order to evaluate that whether this classification, the monitoring entity or the responding entity of safe driving at each level is applicable to the automatic driving of spacecraft. Next step is to give an overview of the laws and regulations of Japan, the United States, China, and Europe that have already been or are being maintained in some jurisdiction for the automatic driving of ground vehicles. This paper will mainly examine the legal liability in the event of an accident, and the means of resolving disputes of those jurisdictions. The final goal of this paper is to introduce the discussions and explore the design of the legal system that eventually can be applied in the event of an incident/accident of an automatically operated spacecraft in outer space. Such discussions may conclude us to add a new definition of the” persons for whom it is responsible” in Article 3 of the Space Liability Convention.","Moriguchi, Hisako",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency,accident ;  autonomous driving ;  HTV-X ;  insurance ;  legal issue ;  liability
The SpaceLand business model to overcome cultural barriers in Space-engagement world-wide,"A new business model to Space-engage societies with no cultural and financial barriers is hereby proposed, in synergy with a novel approach to democratize aerospace civil programs involving laypersons with scientists and innovators: in a nutshell, a global network of low-cost ground, underwater and flight facilities for microgravity is being created by the SpaceLand consortium in strategic locations at global level, to benefit the general public world-wide. A series of SpaceLand Centers is conceived also to cater for vital needs of developing nations in terms of ethical science research, future-facing education and sustainable technological progress related to microgravity R&D, at the same time generating good returns to stakeholders. It all hinges around records set by SpaceLand also during NASA Microgravity Pathfinder Flights for state-of-the-art ICT and biomed R&D conducted with world's youngest (11-yr-old Kim Marco Viberti), world's oldest (93-yr-old Cesare Massano) and world's 1st 100% disabled (Elma Schippa, April 2005) and other laypersons as subjects and operators of 0-G tests, also on behalf of a Nobel Prize winning scientist. Differently from the modus operandi hinted at by the UN Secretary-General when speaking, in September 2021, about “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on Earth”, the virtuous system hereby proposed intends to drastically reduce the financial burden to enter the Space era, thanks to “open” training and educational hubs affordable to anyone, linked with inexpensive parabolic flights on novel vehicles. Mixing aerospace tourism opportunities with weightless STEAMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math, Medicine) research open to anybody, this business also provides much-needed Space-engagement facilities and initiatives all-year-round to create jobs and sustainable socio-economic growth for the involved territories. Concentrating all such functions and services in an immersive fashion within futuristic ""Mars-base-like” ISRU settlements with ad-hoc ground and underwater testbeds, interactive educational tools, low-gravity emulators and STEAMM laboratories, at SpaceLand Centers scientists, people and payloads get prepared for the “real thing”, qualifying for Mars-gravity, Moon-gravity, Zero-gravity flight missions at the lowest-ever cost on the world's longest single-aisle parabolic flight vehicle secured by SpaceLand to also serve as aero-launch platform for small satellite-carrying launchers. The success of this self-sustained business model showcases how an actual democratization of Space can indeed provide good returns to shareholders while wide-opening people's access to Space-related techno-scientific tools and services. The transformative relevance of such a “Space for All” iniative stands out also insofar as it creates labour-intensive occupation, triggers new careers and aggregates valuable innovation and know-how for progress in all STEAMM areas, thanks to the uniqueness of microgravity. Inspiring youngsters to study also for planetary exploration or commercial applications and re-engaging the elderly e.g. in trailbalzing life-extension R&D in 0-G, public “space-awareness” can be effectively raised, without gender, generation, geo-cultural constraints: from conceptual ideas to engineering, a myriad spin-offs can see the light at SpaceLand Centers through anybody's hand-on participation, enhancing laypersons' life quality, striving to use Space to safeguard our planet and, at the same time, creating ethical business to all stakeholders and local economies.","Viberti, Carlo",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,SpaceLand Africa Ltd.,ethical business ;  ISRU ;  Microgravity-STEM ;  R&D ;  Space-democratization
Sustainable Development through Space Education for Children in Developing Countries,"Space is essential in the sustainable development of Low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and considerable efforts are put in place to help create and develop space sectors in LMICs. Capacity building is capital in ensuring the space sector remains viable for generations. Space education is critical in awakening interest in Space amongst individuals. Educating children about Space often sparks their curiosity and encourages both genders to become involved in Sciences, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. A context-specific approach is needed when educating children on any topic because this facilitates their understanding and stimulates their ingenuity. Using the daily experiences and tools familiar to children is paramount. A sure way to do this is by providing children with adapted storybooks, comic books, and video games and creating space museums and planetariums. Also, organizing space boot camps where the children will learn about space exploration and see instruments used in space exploration can help increase children's knowledge and develop their interest in Space technologies. Documentaries and movies that involve visual stimuli and imagination, coupled with basic experiments and practical sessions involving tactile stimuli, will permit children to easily remember concepts learned and put these into practice when necessary. In conclusion, there is a need to efficiently involve the younger generation in space exploration through space education to promote quality education, reduce inequalities, and facilitate industry innovation and infrastructure, all necessary for the sustainable development of the space sector in LMICs. This requires the active engagement of all stakeholders in Space development in LMICs.","Asongfac, Lily Rospeen;Zolo, Yvan",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Groote Schuur Hospital;Aerospace Baby Project,LMIC ;  Space Education
INNOVATION IN SPACE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY,"Official exploration roadmaps of governmental entities (such as the Global Exploration Roadmap or the ESA Terrae Novae Exploration Strategy) tend to include advanced algorithms (such as artificial intelligence techniques) in several layers of incoming missions to reach their objectives. NASA standards, released in 2015, show the need for autonomous medical care when the estimated levels of potential risk for medical problems are high. That is estimated to occur in long-duration planetary crewed missions (like that on the Moon and Mars) lasting more than 200 days. The need for such technology, currently not existing, shows that current capabilities and knowledge are not enough to mitigate hazards to human health. Adopting new healthcare capabilities leads to a shift in planning, managing, and executing health-related practices. Standard safety tests for general medical technology are not enough to ensure safety, and new capabilities are safe when meeting space safety requirements only. Furthermore, the same roadmaps share the need to account for private companies for delivering or commissioning services and products in space, not excluding the involvement of commercial astronauts. It is reasonable to think: what is healthcare innovation required for? And, who will be the end-user? Medical technology is closely related to specific services and end-users, two factors highly variable in incoming missions. Consequently, innovating in such a field could be extremely challenging and not practical. This work explores the driving factors of innovation in space medical technology, starting with the first human spaceflights. The objective is to investigate interrelated aspects of such driving factors concerning three significant elements: (i) space medical research discoveries, (ii) parameters of the astronaut population (such as background, age, gender, and in-flight hours, among others) and (iii) mission concepts. The significance of this work is in understanding the fit of technology and systems under development when mission constraints (such as budget and delivery time) vary. It is essential to raise awareness that such an innovation process may not be practical if the resources needed for reaching expected performance will not match constraints imposed by governmental entities. There is a need to adjust such a process to limit resource waste while ensuring safety in space.","Cinelli, Ilaria",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,AIKO S.r.l.,healthcare ;  innovation ;  space medical technology
Mercury Sample Return Mission Design Utilizing Innovative Systems and Technologies,"Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets, and the smallest planet in the solar system, known to have a significant metallic core and a high metal to silicate ratio. However, the reason for the planet's specific composition and formation is yet to be explained. While many theories attempt to justify these facts, none can be confirmed without further investigation, such as one provided by a sample return mission. The science collected from this mission will allow for validation of theories about the formation of Mercury and possibly the Solar System. By investigating theories about Mercury's formation, more information will be uncovered about the Earth's Moon as there are quite a few similarities between the two bodies. These similarities will help establish a newer, more grounded theory about the origin of the Moon and its effects on Earth. Additionally, learning about Mercury could provide information on how the Earth might evolve over time. Sending a spacecraft to Mercury has many challenges, orbital mechanics being one of the biggest. As Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, its orbit is the most affected by the Sun's gravity, making it difficult to manoeuvre a spacecraft into a stable orbit. Moreover, going to Mercury is a complicated and long-duration mission requiring gravity assists and complex trajectories. Thermal control is another challenge since the spacecraft must be protected from Mercury's extreme temperatures. In this context, this research attempts to deal with these difficulties through innovative analyses of technologies to develop a feasible plan to perform such a mission. The study presents trades of different technologies and approaches for subsystems. Due to the previously discussed challenges imposed by Mercury, employing an innovative approach to the technologies will allow for designing a mission optimal for combatting challenges. The paper also discusses the mission design tools and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches used to validate results. Please note that this work is submitted under the guidance of the Space Exploration Project Group (SEPG) of the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) as part of the ACHIEVED Initiative, which stands for Assembly for Concepts in Human Interplanetary Exploration with Various Extraterrestrial Designations. This initiative aims to enable students and young professionals from diverse technical and cultural backgrounds to work and collaborate on a space mission design project.","Rao, Sapna;Sinha, Priyanka;Ramirez, Marcos Eduardo Rojas;de Winter, Bram;Williams, Saira O.;Landers, Viduranga;Jagadam, Nitya;Morchedi, Sondes;Oseni, Dorcas;Laabidi, Rayen;Singh, Harsh",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,University of Petroleum and Energy Studies;Technion - Israel Institute of Technology;Universität der Bundeswehr München;Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais;Lockheed Martin Corporation;Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC);Nexus Aurora;Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC);Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC);Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC);Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace,Innovation ;  Mercury ;  Mission ;  Model Based Systems Engineering ;  Sample
Student Space Missions - Report on our 2022 Undergraduate Auroral Observing Campaign,"The Undergraduate Student Instrumentation Project (USIP) was a NASA program created to engage undergraduate students in rigorous scientific research for the purposes of innovation and developing the next generation of professionals in space research. It is now run by the University of Houston using local resources. This student-led project, based on the 5E instructional model, is executed by the students from initial ideation of research objectives to the design, testing, and deployment of scientific payloads. The 5E Instructional model places the student at the center of knowledge building, while instructors facilitate interaction with content and guide the inquiry process. Since 2013, this project has been not only an effective vehicle for delivering STEM education but is also effective in increasing classroom engagement and interest in space. Space research is inherently interdisciplinary and crosscuts Geoscience, Engineering, and Technology. The project is designed to integrate engineering, technology, physics, material science, and earth and atmospheric sciences as an important opportunity for the students to gain access to cross-disciplinary experiential research. In addition to classroom engagement, the students build their own payloads and ground instruments. This project increases students' command of essential skills such as teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, technology, communication, innovation, and leadership. For the faculty, the project was an extended exercise in professional development, learning how to implement project level inquiry-based education on this scale. For the students, this formative experience continues to encourage the development of a much broader range of technical skills than is typically offered within an undergraduate degree. Furthermore, the extensive time and energy that students commit to this project promotes a strong sense of personal and professional responsibility and emphasizes the necessity of coherent teamwork. Not only do students make valuable connections with each other during this process, but also to the broader space science community. They often work with professionals from outside of the USIP structure, and regularly attend and present at conferences and student competitions throughout the project. This paper will present the results of the 2022 Alaska observing campaign. Student projects included subjects ranging from atmospheric trace gas chemistry, ground penetrating radar for measure permafrost thickness and thermal infrared imaging of frozen waterbodies coupled with multiwavelength LiDAR study of surface topography and chemistry, auroral electron precipitation, quantitative multi-wavelength airglow studies, search for stratospheric microplastics, and monitoring auroral radio emissions, and stratospheric conductivity. This program is a for-credit course of two to three years duration.","Bering, Edgar A.;Khan, Shuhab;Moges, Mequanint;Jacobs, Laura T.;Hampton, Donald;Mölders, Nicole;Thorsen, Denise;Gamblin, Rachel B.;Greer, Michael;Greer, Presley;Gunawan, Bryan;Hernandez, Elizabeth;Humble, Emily;Lehnen, Jamie;Nguyencuu, Andy;Piña, Megan;Porat, Itay;Prince, John R.;Pessoa, Ana Gabriela;Simmons, James;Tovar, Chloe;Ulinski, Alexandra",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,College of Engineering and Physical Sciences;Department of Computer Science;College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics;UT Southwestern Medical Center;University of Alaska Fairbanks;NASA Johnson Space Center;University of Pennsylvania;University of Houston;Petra Seismic Design;Jacobs Consultancy,curriculum development ;  project-based learning ;  spacecraft design
Development of Colombian Space Program,"Officially, Colombia's space career began with the FACSAT program of the Colombian Air Force (COLAF). As the first and most significant milestone, the deployment in orbit of the 3U CubeSat FACSAT-1 was achieved, becoming Colombia a satellite operator. However, this satellite was neither designed nor fully developed by COLAF. To give continuity to the program and increase the country's competitiveness in the industry, COLAF framed a strategy to achieve autonomy in mission design: It begins with the operational concept's definition, analysis, and implementation, followed by the satellite's preliminary and critical design; and ending with the creation and execution of its integration and validation plan. All above, through a transfer of knowledge (ToK) system provided by the technological ally GomSpace from Denmark and received by the Aerospace Technologies Research Center personnel (CITAE). In parallel with the transfer, COLAF sought to create the capacity to verify and validate the space products developed, leading to the design of the AIT facilities named “CUBO-2”, carried out under the supervision of INPE from Brazil in compliance with the technical standards: ISO 8 for the satellite bus and ISO 7 for payloads. In the Research, Development, and Innovation (R&D&I) activities, COLAF co-designed and co-developed a 6U CubeSat called FACSAT-2, following ECCS standards. The primary payload is an electro-optical sensor with a resolution of 5 meters per pixel, and the secondary payload is a spectrometric sensor that collects data for greenhouse gas analysis. As a result, COLAF generated products such as space-grade electronic boards (designed at the research center), payload encryption software, and mission control software for planning and tracking satellites. All of the above works as evidence of the capability acquired by the center through knowledge appropriation about subsystem identification, space mission design, sensor integration procedures, COTS model evaluation, and engineering analysis for requirements validation. In conclusion, the transfer of knowledge about satellite platforms besides the future construction of specialized facilities promotes the research for the development of new highly-functional space products. The discussion should now focus on promoting the development of new strategies that emphasize more practical elements to generate new missions and raise the capacity of the research center and, at the same time, the Colombian space program.","Urbina, Sonia Ruth Rincón;García, Juan Manuel Cárdenas;Hanessian, Virginia;Villanueva, Karen Nicole Pirazan",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,GomSpace A/S;Research Center in Aerospace Technologies,CubeSats ;  emerging countries ;  Space program
UNOOSA Space Law for New Space Actors: For Governmental Officials and Beyond,"Innovation and knowledge derived from space exploration and related activities support economic growth, deliver high returns on investment, generate new technologies and create jobs. More countries and non-governmental entities than ever are investing their political and economic capital in the space environment. As such interests grows, awareness of and adherence to international space law becomes ever more important to maintain a stable, secure and safe space environment that can deliver sustainable returns on such investments. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), as the UN's dedicated entity for space affairs, works on the legal, policy and capacity-building aspects of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, as well as in space science and technology. In 2019, the Office launched the Space Law for New Space Actors project to provide targeted space law advisory services, through its legal services team, tailored to emerging spacefaring nations. Interested parties can request targeted space law capacity-building and advisory services in space law and policy provided by the Office. Since the Project's establishment, UNOOSA has delivered six technical advisory missions to governmental officials who are or will be involved in the developing process of space law and policy in their countries. Such capacity-building facilitates the development of national space law and/or policy that is in line with the existing international space law framework. In 2021, the Office also started delivering a series of lectures on national space law and policy to post graduate engineering students from emerging spacefaring nations to support them in getting acquainted with the legal framework and in the development of national space law and policy upon completion of their studies. In this paper, these services are explained in detail. Furthermore, the importance of the wider adherence to space law and the study made to identify the needs assessment and gap analysis of emerging spacefaring nations is introduced, including the presentation of central considerations that have been identified in regard of the design of national space law and policy. This work, carried out under the Space Law for New Space Actors project, is underlining the importance of dedicated efforts by the Office to raise awareness and adherence levels for international space law.","O'Donnell, Scarlet;Okumura, Yukiko",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Osterreichische Institut fur Internationale Politik,advisory legal services ;  capacity-building ;  custom-tailored ;  emerging spacefaring nations ;  international space law ;  national space law
Using Design Thinking as a tool for innovation in Human Spaceflight,"The current Human Spaceflight presents many human factors and habitability issues. Technology, products, and materials have remarkably evolved over the last few decades. However, astronauts' present lifestyle and living standards are focused solely on surviving the harshness of outer space. Therefore, this project's premise revolves around making life in space more humane using the lens of design thinking. The project's context is centered on Space Galley as it has an exciting premise for a designer: frequent interaction of astronauts with the area, food being a crucial comfort element, and the galley is an essential aspect in long-duration space travel. Furthermore, while consuming food, it was observed that station-keeping is an essential aspect for astronauts. Hence, the project narrowed down to Restraint Aids, which help in station-keeping, allowing astronauts to orient themselves to the workspace and carry out experiments and daily activities. The project's outcome is space footwear and new mobility aid, which significantly reduce the physical discomfort to the user, improve ergonomics for a longer duration and enhance well-being. The project's overall theme focuses on shifting from a machine-centric approach to a more human-centric approach. A new framework, Gravitational Cartography, was developed during the research and synthesis to bridge the gap between design, engineering, and science. Gravitational Cartography is mapping interactions between design, gravity, and life. It blends essential aspects of different fields like engineering, human factors, space science, psychology, and design to achieve harmony between technical and humanistic needs.","Mehta, Neel",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Studio Carbon,Gravitational Cartography ;  Human-centered design ;  Restraint Aids ;  Space Galley ;  Space habitats
MEXICO AND ITS RESOURCES FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE NEXT SPACE GENERATION,"Mexico currently ranks fourteenth in aerospace manufacturing and sixth as a world exporter of aerospace components. With this data, an extensive barrier is shown for our country to be able to develop space technology that may be relevant in Martian or lunar exploration, since this industry is one of the most complex in the world, it requires creativity, resources, and scientific innovation. and technology as well as great training. The creation of a program for students who can be involved in similar missions could be a great idea so that Mexicans have the opportunity to contribute to aerospace research as well as the development of the industry to provide knowledge, tools, and resources to the Martian and lunar missions, from his bachelor's degree to his doctorate. One of the activities to materialise this project is an extensive study of geological, opportunity, educational, scientific, and technological areas, as well as budget; Fortunately, there are university students who are looking hard for these kinds of projects to carry out missions, since they can take advantage of all the resources that the country has as perfect ecosystems to carry out long-term analogs, such as the Baja California desert and the Pico de Orizaba, in addition to characteristic and world-class universities, such as the UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico), the National Polytechnic Institute and the Tecnologico de Monterrey, which have links to space exploration and the STEAM field, in addition to having students in their classrooms enthusiastic about collaborating in projects of this nature, from planning to carrying out the analogous mission. This could be a fundamental step for Mexico to go from being just a manufacturing country in the aerospace sector to including pilots, academics, and students on space missions. In addition to the investigation of investment points, extensive collaboration networks are made with space agencies and the private sector around the world.","Chávez, Daniela Fernanda González;Sanchez, Aimée Regina Carranza",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Universidad Autónoma de Baja California;Faculty of Engineering,aerospace ;  exploration ;  industry ;  Mexico ;  resources ;  science

Unconventional Tools for Space Education in the Portuguese Ecosystem,"The Portuguese Space Agency - Portugal Space's main goal is to implement the country's Space strategy, which defines several priorities that include attracting and growing a highly skilled workforce, fostering international cooperation, promoting interdisciplinarity to create a flexible and adaptable mindset, and education on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics - STEM. To nurture the sustainable growth of the national Space ecosystem, Portugal Space promotes a set of unconventional, dynamic and practical activities available to the national and international student community. In this paper we present and discuss two on-going educational initiatives: the Zero-G Portugal initiative intends to bring Space closer to high-school students by allowing them to experience the sensation of floating in Space even if just for a few seconds, while also learning about the physics and applications of microgravity. It is further expected to evolve this activity to research flights, where university students can perform their previously planned experiments in a microgravity environment, allowing to explore science in a more practical manner and create enthusiasm for Space while actively learning. Portugal Space also promotes the European Rocketry Challenge - EuRoC, that seeks to stimulate university students to fly sounding rockets, by designing and building the rockets themselves. Such competitions stimulate innovation and motivate students to extend themselves beyond the classroom, while learning to work as a team. The growth of EuRoC within Europe is visible, with an increasing number of teams applying and raising already worldwide interest. From 6 teams and 100 students in its first edition, to a second edition with 20 teams selected from 34 applications received, totaling around 400 students, with the first Portuguese team making their debut. For the third edition, a pre-EuRoC course, promoted in cooperation with the Technical University of Munich, has been established to provide students relevant scientific and engineering knowledge. The interest in the competition keeps growing considering the 700 students from 34 countries worldwide that attended this pre-course. From all over Portugal, students from more than 20 higher education institutions have participated, reflecting the national interest in Space-related engineering courses, along with different aerospace engineering degrees opening in national universities. Initiatives like the ones described in this paper attract students' attention and are well-suited tools for educational purposes. Although current enthusiasm is reflected in the number of participants, a long-term analysis will allow us to understand the real impact these have in the Space ecosystem as a whole.","Gonçalves, Marta;Souto, Sofia;Lopes, Álvaro;Sá, Carolina;Costa, Hugo André",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Portuguese Space Agency,active learning ;  education ;  hands-on activities ;  Portugal ;  Space ;  STEM
Innovation in water rockets development based on biomimicry design tool in collaboration with the Aerospace Engineering Group of Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR),"At Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), we are bringing solutions and approaches to aerospace engineering in a more holistic way, considering other factors in addition to the traditionally technical ones. Since Costa Rica is a rich country in terms of biodiversity per area, we have ventured into the use of biomimicry approaches to achieve innovative and different solutions to rocketry problems. As a starting point, in this line of research and development, optimization through biomimicry thinking of the landing systems of high-power rockets was our topic of interest. This design approach from and with nature led us to propose as sources of inspiration and adaptations of robust functionality, the flying seeds of the South Pacific of Costa Rica. A prototype of a parachute system for a water rocket has been built; its design was based on the seeds of the Cedro Amargo, Cedrela odorata tree. The most remarkable characteristics of interest of this seed are the geometrical configurations and aerodynamic features, which we have identified as compatible with rocket parachute systems. This approach has allowed the development of tools for interdisciplinary collaboration, design analysis, use of materials, and experimentation that go beyond traditional practices. The biomimicry tool, in a country with significant natural wealth, represents a differentiating aspect of new design ethics, a driver of development and innovation and positions the University of Costa Rica and the country as a benchmark in the systematisation of comprehensive interdisciplinary methodologies that foster active involvement and deep respect for the natural world. In this scientific paper, we will describe the process that led to the definition of crucial variables, the selection of the best sources of inspiration from nature, and the impactful aspects that were considered in the final design. This research is the result of the project C1461 Mobile Laboratory of Action and Thought in Biomimetic Arts supported by the UCR.","de-Lemos-Medina, Leonora;Campos-Fonseca, Susan;Mora-Castro, Rebeca;Soto-Garro, Morelia;Dittel-Meza, Angely;Salazar-López, Francisco",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Universidad de Costa Rica,aeronautics ;  biodesign ;  biodiversity ;  Biomimicry ;  Cedrela odorata ;  flying seeds
TO ENABLE EQUALITY OF SCIENCE IN THE SPACE SECTOR THROUGH THE CASE OF DESIGN FOR LUNAR BASES,"Since its inception, the space sector has been considered highly technical, and so engineering has always played a predominant role. For some years now, the sector has been opening up to other disciplines and has begun to integrate the hard sciences and soft sciences in parallel. However, there are some misunderstandings between these sciences and what they represent. Despite the initiatives that seek to create links between the humanities and the hard sciences, there are still obvious splits and tensions. This article aims to provide guidance towards achieving equality between the disciplines and the different sciences, through the particular example of design in the space sector. We will see how the different types of sciences have an interest in collaborating and making the space sector one of the first areas to consider the sciences equally with a common goal: to make life on the Moon possible and enjoyable for astronauts. The question of human missions to the Moon tackles technical challenges but also questions about our ways of living, about the very notion of habitat. In his article”Searching for Design Research Questions. A Conceptual Clarification” (2010), the theorist in design Alain Findeli says that “the purpose of design is to improve or at least maintain the 'habitability' of the world in all its dimensions.” If the role of the designer is indeed to participate in the habitability of the world, both on Earth and in space, then the place of designers in human space missions makes sense. It becomes even more interesting when the ability to work on extremely different and deeply interdisciplinary projects is considered. This article explores the value of combining research and design methods with all the disciplines involved in human spaceflight, and how this can be of immediate benefit. To do this, past examples are explored, but the techniques and technologies available presently, in a diagnostic approach to the existing situation, and the scenarios that this can generate in a process of innovation and improvement.","Lhabitant, Coralie",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,,Design ;  Habitat ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Science ;  Technique
"Role of Middle Management in the Implementation of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion as a Business Catalyst for the future Aerospace Industrial Workforce","The aerospace industry is in the midst of a major expansion, but talent is a limiting factor. Studies in both private and public sectors show that diversity of skills and perspectives is one of the main drivers for greater innovation and success in these fields. Organizations representing a diverse workforce enable multiple demographics to relate to the company and brand, opening doors to new market segments, customers, and business partners. Consumers are becoming more diverse and firms may need to reflect this or risk losing out in important sectors. This is particularly significant for start-ups and industries where innovation is the key to growth, such as in aerospace. Moreover, no matter the business sector or the entity's size, equality and inclusion are also recognised as two of the core principles of a healthy workplace - and healthy workplaces drive productivity. The mutually reinforcing principles of equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are therefore key to business strategy and culture, as together they establish a sense of belonging among employees. Nevertheless, to create an equal, diverse, and inclusive workforce in the aerospace industry - a field that, like many STEM industries, has struggled to make progress with respect to EDI - a large cultural shift is required. Achieving EDI progress within an organization is a mindset-change that has to be progressively installed, and driving an inherent adherence to EDI principles is a shared responsibility, “being everyone's business”. However, there is no quick fix. All levels of organizations need to commit to EDI principles for company-wide initiatives to work, starting by top management commitment, immediately followed by middle management. Research clearly demonstrates that middle managers - responsible for taking executive strategies and objectives and translating them into sets of goals for their departments - often perceive EDI as an abstract concept or not as a priority. Unless the managers who directly supervise the majority of the workforce accept, encourage, and implement the recommended EDI initiatives, no progress will be made. This work was born out of the IAC IPMC Young Professionals Workshop 2021 and is thus written primarily from the perspective of diverse young professionals working in the aerospace sector. This paper aims to provide an extensive overview of how EDI principles can be effectively implemented and managed - and what the role of middle-management is within this process - in order to bring a strong positive human and business value for the future aerospace industrial workforce.","Pellegrino, Alice;Scalise, Genny;Lappin, Sarah;Arquimedes, Gomez Moya Ramon;Dalibot, Coraline;Boldt-Christmas, Linn;Bell, Michael",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Thales Alenia Space Italia;Thales Alenia Space;FESA;Loft Orbital Solutions Inc;Women in Aerospace Europe (WIA-E);QinetiQ Space nv;NASA John F.

JHU/APL's System Integration Support of NASA's Lunar Surface innovation Initiative,"The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA)/Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative (LSII) aims to spur the deployment of technologies needed for lunar surface exploration and accelerate the technology readiness of key systems and components. It is well-recognized that in order to achieve sustained operations on the surface of the Moon, new technologies must be deployed, especially regarding power systems, in situ resource utilization, dust mitigation, excavation and construction, and access and operations in extreme environments. As with all technology, development is a process starting with an idea and maturing through higher fidelity versions until it is fully developed, tested, verified, and ready to be deployed. The LSII activities at NASA are implemented through a combination of unique in-house activities, competitive programs, and public-private partnerships. This work is spread across institutions including commercial companies, academia, government laboratories, and research institutions. To optimize LSII effectiveness, it is important to harness the creativity and energy of these efforts, align them to common goals, and maximize the investments each stakeholder is making in development. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory LSII team supports NASA's STMD in their technology role of enabling a sustainable human presence on the lunar surface in the following four areas. • Running of the Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium • Providing science and engineering systems integration expertise • Lunar simulant analysis portal support • Technology Research opportunity support.","Bussey, Ben;Clyde, Brenda;Hurley, Dana;Fuhrman, Wes;Klima, Rachel",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2022-01-01,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,Moon ;  Technology
Use Logistic Regression model and SPSS Software to analyze the Added Value and Influencing Factors of the Employability of Postgraduates in Engineering,"SPSS26.0 software-assisted construction of logistic regression model, in order to study the increment of employment ability and its influencing factors of engineering postgraduates. The school-leaving questionnaires of graduates of master of engineering from S University were selected to study the added value and influencing factors of the employability of postgraduates in engineering. The research results show that the employability of postgraduates in engineering has been significantly improved in terms of knowledge updating ability, professional practice ability, innovation and creativity ability, and expression and communication ability. In the educational process of postgraduates of professional degree, factors such as professional practice process, mentor's guidance and input, and the conditions and management of training departments are significantly related to the added value of employability. It is suggested to add value and enhance the employability of postgraduates in engineering from three aspects: strengthening the construction of the school-enterprise dual-tutor team, improving the design and control of professional practice, and improving the training conditions and professional practice environment.","Liu, Wei",Conference Proceeding,"CAIBDA 2022 - 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Algorithms",2022-01-01,Shaoyang University,

Biofuel: A prime eco-innovation for sustainability,"The expanding human population along with industrialization, which results in increased fuel consumption, a decrease in fossil fuels, global warming and high fuel costs, prompted a search for an alternate solution for eco-innovation energy production. Protecting the environment and avoiding using chemicals to prepare for fuel production is necessary. Biofuel is the only eco-friendly and renewable solution to this problem of meeting energy demands. Biofuels include biodiesel, ethanol, bio-oil, hydrogen, methane, butanol and methanol. Plants, algae, municipal solid waste and microbial biomass are the most widely reputable sources of biofuels, which are environmentally and safe. Nanotechnology has the potential to have a huge impact on biofuel research, from nanomaterial processing to enzyme engineering for biofuel production. Identification of novel biofuel-producing organisms, optimization and improvement of their culture conditions, genetic engineering of biofuel-producing species, a thorough understanding of the metabolism of these organisms and effective strategies to mass culture these organisms to attain high biomass should be prioritized in the arena of biofuel research. This chapter discusses detail the methodology and technological advancements in biofuel generation and also highlights novel forms of biofuels.","Karthik, V.;Periyasamy, Selvakumar;Varalakshmi, V.;Pauline, J.

Dynamic Equivalent Modeling of Acoustic Metamaterials: Solving Problem of Noise and Vibration,"This book derives physical models from basic principles, studies the effect of equivalent models on the dynamic characteristics of phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials, and analyzes the physical mechanisms behind vibration and noise reduction. It first summarizes the research status of vibration and noise reduction, and research progress in phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials. Based on this, one-dimensional periodic beam, two-dimensional thin plate with circular hole, and corresponding gradient structures are introduced, and their dynamic characteristics are discussed in detail. Therefore, different equivalent methods for different models are proposed through theoretical analysis, modal analysis and transmission rate analysis. Finally, a Helmholtz-type acoustic metamaterial, i.e. a multi-layer slotted tube acoustic metamaterial, is studied. Aiming at the low-frequency band gap of this model, a theoretical model for solving the inverse problem of acousto-electric analogue equivalent is proposed, and the effect of structural parameters on the low-frequency band gap is studied using this equivalent model. This book closely revolves around how to conduct equivalent research on artificially fabricated periodic structures. The methods and conclusions presented in this book provide a new theoretical basis for the application of artificial woven periodic structures in the field of low-frequency vibration reduction and noise reduction and are also an innovation in the discipline of vibration and noise control. This book is suitable for undergraduate students, graduate students and teachers in vibration and noise majors in universities, and can also provide references for engineering and technical personnel in related fields.","Gao, Nansha;Deng, Jie",Book,Dynamic Equivalent Modeling of Acoustic Metamaterials: Solving Problem of Noise and Vibration,2022-01-01,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Acoustic Metamaterials ;  Acoustoelectric analogy ;  Band structure ;  Dispersion relation ;  Dynamic equivalence ;  Gradient bar construction ;  Inverse problem solving ;  Periodic sheet construction ;  Phononic crystal ;  Wave equation
Bio-Futures for Transplanetary Habitats - A Summary and Key Outcomes from the 2022 Symposium,"Bio-Futures for Transplanetary Habitats (BFfTH) is a Special Interest Group within the Hub for Biotechnology in the Built Environment that aims to explore and enable interdisciplinary research on transplanetary habitats and habitats within extreme environments through an emphasis on the bio-social and biotechnological relations. BFfTH organized the online and onsite networking symposium Bio-Futures for Transplanetary Habitats to examine how emerging biotechnologies, living materials, and more-than-human life can be implemented in habitat design and mission planning. The two day symposium aimed to serve as a catalyst in establishing an international network of collaborators across industry, academia and the private sector. It also aimed to support the development of novel methodologies to move beyond discipline-specific approaches in order to address and interrogate emerging questions surrounding potential transplanetary habitats and habitats in extreme environments. The symposium was divided into five sessions which hosted a minimum of three speakers each, these sessions were: Mycelium for Mars, Plants and Agriculture, Sustainable Habitats and Travels, Artistic Approach to Extremes Habitats, and Novel Biotechnologies for Space Habitats.

Industry 4.0 Technologies in Industrial Engineering Courses: A Faculty Survey in Brazil,"Industry 4.0 represents the digital transformation of industrial production, characterized by intense automation and digitalization of manufacturing and management processes, bringing new technologies such as Big Data Analytics, Industrial Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, and Additive Manufacturing. This transformation changes how processes are organized, demanding a new profile of engineers. This article presents a survey with professors of undergraduate courses in Industrial Engineering about the inclusion of i4.0 technologies in these courses. The research is guided by five questions about the importance, maturity, challenges, strategies, and impacts of these technologies in Industrial Engineering courses. A total of 95 professors responded to the survey, representing 17.9% of the total number of invited professors. The results show that, although most of these technologies are considered necessary for the new profile of the industrial engineer, the degree of maturity in teaching these technologies, in most cases, is still in the early stages of adoption. In addition, challenges related to capacity, infrastructure, and resources need to be overcome for successful innovation. In this sense, some strategies were pointed out in the survey. An evident limitation of the work is that it reflects the reality of a given country, which also presents significant regional differences. An extension of the present work would be to replicate and compare the results of this survey with those of other countries at different stages of Industry 4.0.","Lemstra, Mary Anny M.S.;Quinaglia, Eric Alberto;de Mesquita, Marco Aurélio",Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2022-01-01,Universidade de São Paulo,enabling technologies ;  engineering education ;  industrial engineering ;  industry 4.0
Major Millet Processing,"In the current global scenario, millets are being widely consumed as “superfood”. It is rich in chemical composition, phytochemicals and other nutritional beneficial compounds. It is necessary to understand the structure, composition and engineering properties to develop various postharvest systems and processing and handling equipment. Once the crop attains the desired maturity level, harvesting of millets is carried out manually or using a mechanical harvester-cum-thresher. A series of postharvest unit operations are involved in millet processing such as cleaning, drying, pretreatment, decortication, polishing, grading/sorting and milling. The engineering properties of millets are highly influenced by the moisture level, type of variety, genotype, stage of maturity, geographical location, agricultural practices and many more. Decortication of millet is a challenging process, and a rubber roll sheller and abrasive polisher are commonly used for this purpose. Increase in global demand for consumption of millets has led to the development in production, processing and value addition. Modern processing industries are equipped with sophisticatedmilling, grading and sorting (colour sorter) facilities to produce high-quality millet products. Still, further research and innovation are required in case of millet processing for the development of the postharvesting system and processing and handling equipment.","Naik, Mohan;Modupalli, Nikitha;Sunil, C.

Challenges and Benefits of Combining AI with Blockchain for Sustainable Environment,"Since the emergence of Fourth Industrial Revolution, the concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain had continued to receive growing applications. The technologies are prevalent in scientific domains and diverse research sectors such as agriculture, engineering, medical science, smart manufacturing and industries. The spread rate of the application of the technologies for innovation across all sectors had been phenomenal. On the other hand, quality of life has a direct link with continuous improvement in the quality of our environment – which can be achieved by deployment of advanced technology-based intelligent and control systems such as AI and blockchain. While AI and blockchain possess individual capabilities and potential contributions to environmental sustainability, the combining effects of the applications of both technologies to environmental sustainability domain could ensure robust deliverables and create numerous possibilities. This chapter therefore explores the benefits of the alliance of AI and blockchain in environmental sustainability as it relates to renewable energy and pollution prevention and presents some barriers to the efficacy of the synergy of the two technologies. Some solutions, where possible, are proposed to the challenges in order to harness the maximum benefit from alliance of the technologies as a positive force for sustainable environment.","Odekanle, Ebenezer Leke;Fakinle, Bamidele Sunday;Falowo, Olayomi Abiodun;Odejobi, Oludare Johnson",Book,Sustainable and Advanced Applications of Blockchain in Smart Computational Technologies,2022-01-01,First Technical University;Landmark University;Obafemi Awolowo University,
The Space Value of Money: Rethinking Finance Beyond Risk & Time,"The Space Value of Money introduces a fresh and innovative perspective on sustainability and finance. It expands our financial value framework, heretofore built around risk and time, by factoring in space, as an analytical dimension and our physical context. The proposed principle and metrics entrench our responsibility for space impact into our value equations, making finance inherently sustainable and acting as a theoretical bridge between core finance theory and the growing field of sustainable finance or ESG integration. The book offers a novel approach to value design, measurement, and creation, discussing the theoretical, mathematical, institutional, technological and data elements of the transformation. The Space Value of Money principle and metrics offer us the opportunity to adjust our financial value framework and transform human productivity in line with our sustainability targets. They also enable the design and engineering of the financial instruments that can help us address our evolutionary challenges/investment, like the transition to Net Zero. “Every once in a while, a book comes along that makes a fundamental contribution that is both profound and practical. A book that every member of the National Space Council, including the NASA Administrator and the Space Force chief of space operations should read. The Space Value of Money will be of interest to ESG and impact investors, government regulators, financial theorists, and outer space enthusiasts.” —Lt Col Peter Garretson, Senior Fellow in Defense Studies at the American Foreign Policy Council “No doubt, the pressing environmental challenges we face make the concept of the space impact of investments even more compelling.” —Dr. Pascal Blanqué, Chairman of Amundi Institute, Former Group CIO of Amundi Asset Management “The Space Value of Money brings much needed conceptual rigour, whilst further advocating the case for a new paradigm shift in financial valuation. This work gives us the lasting frameworks that aggregate impact across all spatial dimensions. Dr. Papazian culminates over ten years of research in this rich book, providing the springboard for further innovation and system implementation in this area.” —Domenico Del Re, Director, Sustainability and Climate Change, PwC “Enthralling and captivating. Papazian offers a clear, thorough, and comprehensive discussion. The Space Value of Money gives us an opportunity to reframe our thinking and to explore what is possible.

Innovation vs Practicality vs Entertainment: Developing and implementing affordable technological solutions for theatre accessibility,"This article examines the use of inclusive technological solutions to promote accessibility on stage. Specifically, it concentrates on the way technological solutions are developed and integrated into a show's design both in terms of the immersion and entertainment provided by the end-product, but also in practical ways, to make the technological solutions affordable and practical from the perspective of designing and running a show. The article is based on the empirical findings of a project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (United Kingdom) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) that brought together Red Earth Theatre, a small-scale touring theatre company based in the UK with an established track record and commitment to research in inclusive integrated communication for young audiences (with a focus on Deaf audiences) and an interdisciplinary team of researchers across arts and computer sciences at the University of Nottingham. The researchers developed technological solutions that would allow for accessibility to be embedded into the creative process (following principles similar to those of accessible filmmaking). Any such solutions, however, have to strike a balance between affordability, practical integration into workflows and particularly the design possibilities and creative options they present. They also have to successfully embed accessibility into performances in ways that are going to not only enable immersion, but also add to the semiotic richness and entertainment value of a show for all members of the audience, whatever their needs.","Mével, Pierre Alexis;Robinson, Jo;Tennent, Paul",Journal,inTRAlinea,2022-01-01,University of Nottingham,accessibility ;  creative captions ;  immersion ;  inclusion ;  surtitling ;  technology
Following the organism to map synthetic genomics,"Synthetic genomics, or engineering biology at the level of whole genomes and whole organisms, is an emerging outgrowth of parts-based synthetic biology. This nascent subfield is also diverse and difficult to characterize. As social scientists investigating responsible research and innovation in synthetic genomics, we suggest that focusing on the organism is a fruitful approach to making sense of the diversity it encompasses. Here, we offer a heuristic in the form of a tagging system to organize projects by the roles the engineered organism is asked to perform. We suggest several reasons why this system is useful for understanding the current shape and future directions of the field, especially in light of the need to ask: how does engineering biology contribute to building a future of sustainable relationships with other creatures?","Hey, Maya;Szymanski, Erika A.",Journal,Biotechnology Notes,2022-01-01,Colorado State University System,Model organisms ;  Organisms ;  Parts-to-whole assembly ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Synthetic genomics

"Application Research of CDIO Education Initiative in Reforming Online-Offline Hybrid Teaching of ""Software Testing"" Course","CDIO is an innovative educational concept used around the world to improve the quality of undergraduate engineering education. It is very suitable to be applied to guide the teaching reform of software testing course, which is an important part of software engineering education. Due to problems like the lack of practice in traditional software testing teaching and that of students' interest in learning, we proposed a novel CDIO-based online-offline hybrid teaching reform model for software testing course. In this reformed teaching model, guided by the CDIO educational initiative, we redesigned the course structure to adjust the teaching content, developed multiple online course practice trainings in an online curriculum resource library, and built a teaching evaluation mechanism corresponding to case-based offline teaching. This teaching reform, to a certain extent, has achieved the goal of strengthening practice, enhancing students' interest in learning, and improving their professional quality and software testing skills. This teaching practice provides reference and inspiration for the innovation and reform of software engineering education in colleges and universities.","Song, Xiaotao",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering, TALE 2022",2022-01-01,Taiyuan University of Technology,application and research ;  CDIO education initiative ;  online and offline hybrid teaching mode ;  software testing ;  teaching reform
"For Engineering Education, is Distance Learning a Friend or a Foe? A Case Study of First-Year Engineering Students","Distance Learning during the pandemic changed the habits of students; whether this change is positive or negative is still debated. Therefore, research should be conducted to determine whether the studying habits and self-perception of students changed. In this work, a performance comparison between groups taking classes in-person and a group taking classes remotely was conducted. Beside the performance comparison, a survey was conducted to learn about the perception of the students in the post-pandemic. Results indicate that the group taking classes remotely performed better, but regarding their opinion, students prefer attending in-person classes. Moreover, students' preferences indicate students would like their classes to be recorded, and that students feel more anxious about in-person examinations when compared to remote examinations.","Buentello-Montoya, David Antonio;Carreon-Andujo, Erika Judith",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering, TALE 2022",2022-01-01,Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Distance Learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering education ;  Higher education ;  Studying habits
Artistic-cultural perspectives in technical-professional training at UTFPR-Brazil,"In this research, we intend to study the role of art in the creative process, in engineering courses at the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, as a technological innovation factor. This qualitative research is characterised as a method for adopting a naturalistic and descriptive perspective. The sample is composed of students and graduates (10); teachers, coordinators and directors of Education of the Pato Branco Campus (10); Dean (1); Entrepreneurs (4). In the analysis and discussion of results from semi-structured interviews, we opted for Content Analysis, having in perspective the Theory of Social Representations of Moscovici (1978). Among the main conclusions, we highlight the valorisation of creative, interpersonal and communicative skills as fundamental competences in the formation of an engineer. It is also highlighted that the role of art in engineering can enhance creativity and constitute a factor of technological innovation. This can promote the imagination and the capacity for necessary and fundamental abstraction in the design of engineering projects and the communicational plan. The integration of art in formal training, at the moment, does not constitute an institutional option, nor does it contribute to a significant dialogical relationship between curricular activities and extracurricular artistic activities.","Auzani, Adriana Santos;da Silva, Levi Leonido Fernandes;de Almeida Pereira, Antonino Manuel;Morgado, Elsa Gabriel",Journal,Motricidade,2022-01-01,Universidade Católica Portuguesa;Universidade Católica Portuguesa;Instituto Politécnico de Bragança;Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná;University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro;Instituto Politécnico de Viseu,art ;  communication ;  creativity ;  culture ;  engineering ;  higher education

Technology Outsourcing of 3PL firm in a B2B contractual agri-supply chain,The post-covid increasing demand for regional agri-products and growing e-agribusiness have created a need to enhance third party logistics (3PL) firms' global cold-chain service facilities. Prime 3PL firms seek to increase profitability by outsourcing their technology innovation to research and developments (RND) institutes. This study presents an equity finance model for efficient technology innovation outsourcing. The result shows that outsourcing is favorable to the 3PL firm only if the ratio of the 3PL firm's initial capital to the technology RND team's efficiency is sufficiently high. The study further shows that investment in regional agri-supply chain (RASC) is favorable to 3PL firms if the post-harvesting loss rate is sufficiently low.,"De, Arkajyoti;Singh, Surya Prakash",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2022-01-01,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,3PL ;  Agri-supply chain ;  Technology outsourcing

Aluminium As a Structural Material,"Owing to its low density, high strength to weight ratio, high electrical conductivity, good formability, excellent corrosion resistance and recyclability, aluminium is one of the key engineering materials used for structural applications across the automotive, aerospace, mass transportation, ship building and power industry segments. Aluminium is consumed globally in the form of castings and forgings, wires and cables, flat rolled products (plates, sheets and foils) and extrusions. Rolled products and extrusion segments dominate global applications of aluminium while in India, wires and cables form the largest application segment. Building, construction and packaging are other major growth segments in India, China and the Middle East. Due to aluminium’s unique combination of properties of strength to weight ratio and recyclability, it has been a vital material for driving light-weighting in the aviation, automotive and ground transportation segments. There is a continuous focus on research to produce stronger, more formable and corrosion resistant alloys which are also easy to weld and recycle. Similar work on improved alloys and/or coatings is also happening in building and construction, power and packaging industry. In India, aluminium is the key material for rapid electrification and also making inroads in transportation segment including bus body, railway wagons, metro rail, cement bulkers, trailers etc. Aluminium consumption in India is poised to grow to 8.0 milion tonnes by 2025 from the 3.7 million tonnes in 2020 propelled by government initiatives like Make in India, Smart Cities, Electric mobility, Housing for all, rural electrification and freight corridors. New infrastructure, smart manufacturing and technology innovations will drive this industrial growth in India addressing skills and capability, manufacturing challenge and market dynamics. Towards this, flat rolled and extruded products are areas that need focussed and continued RandD in India for superior products and their performance through deeper understanding of processes and materials for increasing adoption of aluminium in India. Additionally, electric vehicles, additive manufacturing, computational materials engineering, AI advanced data analytics etc. are few key emerging areas that have already started impacting the course of RandD in the aluminium industry.","Adhikari, Saikat;Tathavadkar, Vilas;Basu, Biswajit",Book,Future Landscape of Structural Materials in India,2022-01-01,Aditya Birla Science and Technology Company Private Limited,

Then, a single focus group discussion involving both medical device innovators and regulators to collect data about the current regulatory practices for medical devices in Uganda. Univariate and bivariate analysis was done for the quantitative data to summarize results in graphs and tables. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Ethical review and approval were obtained from the Makerere University School of Biomedical Sciences, Research and Ethics Committee, and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. Results: A total of 47 innovators responded to the questionnaire. 14 respondents were excluded since they were not medical device innovators. Majority (76%) of individuals had been innovators for more than a year, held a bachelor's degree with a background in Engineering and applied sciences, and worked in an academic research institute. 22 of the 33 medical device innovators had stopped working on their innovations and had stalled at the proof-of-concept stage. Insufficient funding, inadequate technical expertise and confusing regulatory landscape were major challenges to innovation. The two themes that emerged from the discussion were “developing standards for medical devices regulation” and “implementation of regulations in practical processes”. Legal limitations, lengthy processes, and low demand were identified as challenges to developing medical device regulations. Conclusions: Efforts have been taken by government to create a pathway for medical device innovations to be translated to the market. More work needs to be done to coordinate efforts among stakeholders to build effective medical device regulations in Uganda.","Mpaata, Charles Norman;Matovu, Brian;Takuwa, Mercy;Kiwanuka, Noah;Lewis, Steff;Norrie, John;Ononge, Sam;Tuck, Sharon;Wolters, Maria;Demulliez, Marc;Ssekitoleko, Robert T.",Journal,Frontiers in Medical Technology,2022-01-01,"Edinburgh Medical School;School of Medicine, Makerere University College of Health Sciences;Makerere University School of Public Health;Makerere University;The University of Edinburgh;Heriot-Watt University",clinical evaluation ;  medical device standards ;  medical devices ;  medical devices regulations ;  medical innovation ;  regulatory pathway
Sequence-Based Marker Assisted Selection in Wheat,"Wheat improvement has traditionally been conducted by relying on arti­ficial crossing of suitable parental lines followed by selection of the best genetic combinations. At the same time wheat genetic resources have been characterized and exploited with the aim of continuously improving target traits. Over this solid framework, innovations from emerging research disciplines have been progres­sively added over time: cytogenetics, quantitative genetics, chromosome engineer­ing, mutagenesis, molecular biology and, most recently, comparative, structural, and functional genomics with all the related -omics platforms. Nowadays, the inte­gration of these disciplines coupled with their spectacular technical advances made possible by the sequencing of the entire wheat genome, has ushered us in a new breeding paradigm on how to best leverage the functional variability of genetic stocks and germplasm collections. Molecular techniques first impacted wheat genetics and breeding in the 1980s with the development of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based approaches. Since then, steady progress in sequence-based, marker-assisted selection now allows for an unprecedently accu­rate ‘breeding by design’ of wheat, progressing further up to the pangenome-based level. This chapter provides an overview of the technologies of the ‘circular genom­ics era’ which allow breeders to better characterize and more effectively leverage the huge and largely untapped natural variability present in the Triticeae gene pool, particularly at the tetraploid level, and its closest diploid and polyploid ances­tors and relatives.","Maccaferri, Marco;Bruschi, Martina;Tuberosa, Roberto",Book,Wheat Improvement: Food Security in a Changing Climate,2022-01-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,Cloning ;  Genetic diversity ;  Homoeologous loci ;  Mapping ;  Molecular marker ;  QTLome

Principles of Innovative Design Thinking: Synergy of Extenics with Axiomatic Design Theory,"The book presents a comprehensive treatment on a novel design theory that fosters innovative thinking and creativity essential for addressing wicked problems. Wicked problems are ill-defined, ambiguous in both aims and solutions, and complex with interconnected and intertwined (coupled) factors. While being ubiquitous and difficult, however, wicked problems share characteristics common to science and design in three regards, namely agent finitude, system complexity, and problem normativity. These fundamental attributes allow a core cognitive process common to design and science to be identified and a strategic problem-solving conception of methodology be formulated as a result. The theory facilitates new opportunities for synergetic cross-disciplinary research and practice by incorporating the essences of Extenics to axiomatic design. Innovative thinking is enabled by exploring Extenics for problem reframing, paradigm shift, and abductive reasoning and by engaging axiomatic design in the co-evolution (iteration) of the need and viable design concept. The theory is unique in that it is a framework for quantifying imprecise and vague design information available during the conceptual design stage as mathematical expression and algorithm early in the design effort and enables the objective evaluation and emergence of an optimal design concept from among multitude of viable ones. The book is conceived for students and real-world practitioners in engineering, natural and social sciences, business, and fine arts who seek to develop powerful design thinking for solving problems in a creative and innovative way.","Li, Wenjuan;Song, Zhenghe;Suh, C.

From Innovation to Markets and Back. A Conversation with Michel Callon,"In this conversation, Michel Callon reviews the major events and questions that have marked his scientific career. He begins by presenting the personal and political path that led him, after completing his engineering studies, to join the Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation at the École des Mines de Paris in 1968. His early work on the theme of innovation was conducted in a context where science and technology were the focus of multiple questions in economics and sociology. Michel Callon explains the collective research approach that led to the creation of the concept of translation, and the efforts to develop co-word analysis, an automated textual processing method designed to study the products of science and technology. It is from these questions on the processes of innovation, and from this long-standing dialogue with economists, that Michel Callon will develop, from the end of the 1990s, his work on markets. From research on the performativity of economic knowledge to the analysis of market agencements, this work has developed an original perspective on the dynamics of the economy, which goes beyond the criticisms usually levelled at capitalism by the social sciences. It invites us to develop a reflection on the plural roles that markets play not only in production and consumption, but also in the genesis of diverse social relations, in political organization and in crisis situations.","Mallard, Alexandre;Callon, Michel",Journal,Sociologica,2022-01-01,Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation,Economic sociology ;  Innovation ;  Market agencement ;  Science Technology and society
Cognitive Neuroscience for Design,"Design is based on an engineering approach to solving various problems in the real world. When design is considered as a comprehensive planning of things, it is essential to understand human beings, because many of the things to be designed include human elements. This is already a common understanding among those involved in design, and in fact, various efforts are being made to understand users. However, user surveys, such as questionnaires, observation, and marketing, are still in their infancy due to the irrationality of humans and the diversity of contextual factors surrounding humans. Therefore, it is desirable to develop new theories and method-ologies to understand humans more precisely and better contribute to design. This chapter focuses on the cognitive neuroscience approach as a research approach for understanding humans as they relate to design. Cognitive neuroscience is a research field that aims to decompose human cognition and behavior as information processing processes and understand these processes, including the brain’s mechanisms, which are the biological basis of human cognition and behavior. In this field, the recent devel-opment of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and other brain function measurement techniques are expected to advance our understanding of the essence of human cognition and behavior. This chapter will discuss how the cognitive neuroscience approach to human understanding can contribute to innovation in the design process.","Ueda, Kazutaka",Book,"Emotional Engineering, Vol. 9: Move Ahead Toward Self-Satisfying Society (SSS)",2022-01-01,The University of Tokyo,
An Interventional Design Anthropology of Emerging Technologies: Working Through an Interdisciplinary Field: Design,"Emerging technologies-such as autonomous driving (AD) cars, blockchain, robotics, and drones-are increasingly part of popular narratives and industry and policy agendas. They are commonly understood as new digital, data-driven, intelligent, or automated technological innovations in development, or at the cusp of being launched into a market. Thus, the anthropological question of how they might become part of everyday, experiential, possible worlds demands our attention. In this chapter we outline an approach to emerging technologies that is rooted in design anthropology and takes an interventional stance. In doing so we situated design anthropology of emerging technologies within an interdisciplinary field which has tended to be dominated by technologically determinist approaches. Through the example of the notion of trust in AD cars, we show how policy, industry, engineering, and social science approaches configure to provide different and critical understandings. Drawing on our own design ethnographic research, we show how design anthropological attention to people offers an alternative and viable mode of understanding how emerging technologies become part of emerging worlds.","Pink, Sarah;Raats, Kaspar;Lindgren, Thomas;Osz, Katalin;Fors, Vaike",Book,The Palgrave Handbook of the Anthropology of Technology,2022-01-01,Volvo Car Corporation;Högskolan i Halmstad;Monash University,Autonomous driving cars ;  Design anthropology ;  Emerging technologies ;  Innovation ;  Trust
Role of Metabolic Engineering in Enhancing Crop Nutritional Quality,"Human health faces one of the grave issues from the nutrition deficiency in crops. Therefore, it should be given prime importance to develop crops for subsiding this issue. In order to improve the nutritional quality of crops, biofortification aids in combatting nutrient deficiency by enhancing the nutrientspecific component levels. Plants have various types of complex metabolic pathways specific for the synthesis of particular nutrient compounds as well as other secondary metabolites. Plant metabolic engineering aids in the modulation of these specific biosynthetic pathways so as to introduce the new metabolic abilities by either downgrading or upgrading any particular enzyme according to the requirement for amplifying the nutritional quality. Progress and innovations made in the sequencing and bioinformatics will provide an ample opportunity about metabolic pathways and discover the best intervention point. Knowledge attained about vitamin metabolism, uptake of minerals, and relocation in plant makes it feasible today to increase micronutrient level in crop plants. While making comparison of different agronomic practices and conventional plant breeding with plant metabolic engineering and synthetic biological strategies, the latter ones have found to be more effective in synthesizing the specific nutrients, bioactive components in crops. Technological advancement and progresses made in the field of plant metabolic engineering particularly in view of research strategies of multigene stacking tool, complex metabolic engineering with prime focus on refining characters or traits associated with micronutrients, phytonutrients, and bioactive compounds will ultimately help the human race in developing the crops to meet the nutritional demand.","Bhat, Irshad Ahmad;Guleria, Khushboo;Fayaz, Mudasir;Roof-Ul-Qadir, ;Wani, Tareq Ahmad;Qadir, Jasfeeda;Kaloo, Zahoor A.",Book,Metabolic Engineering in Plants,2022-01-01,Lovely Professional University;University of Kashmir,Biofortification ;  Human health ;  Micronutrients ;  Nutritional quality

Innovation Methodology I<sup>3</sup> EME: Awareness for Biomedical Engineers,"With the innovation approach, I3 EME: Identify, Invent, Implement, together with Engineers, Medical users, and Economists, possible interdisciplinary working methods of an engineer in this segment are to be presented. Undergraduate and graduate students of Biomedical engineering cannot imagine much of the work of a medical technology engineer and are challenged in the first semesters with mathematics, engineering, and scientific fundamentals. With the help of this approach, students should be shown a perspective very early on and be able to compensate for the initial problems mentioned with the basics. During their studies, these students have little to no contact with expectations, particularly with the unique features of medical technology. For many, medical technology is only known in its use/application, without knowing why specific innovations are created in this area and how they can be kept up. In addition to the points already mentioned, the innovation methodology should also help students classify medical technology as a melting pot of all possible technologies and thus help to support the integration of new approaches. A fundamental requirement is, of course, to know the doctor’s work environment and to learn empathy toward the problems and the patient. In addition, it must be made clear to future developers at a very early stage that new technologies and processes and transfer projects must also be financed. The Innovation concept I3 EME is intended to teach interdisciplinary innovation generation for new products and services.","Fritzsche, Holger",Book,Novel Innovation Design for the Future of Health: Entrepreneurial Concepts for Patient Empowerment and Health Democratization,2022-01-01,Medizinische Fakultät und Uniklinikum Magdeburg,Innovation generation ;  Innovation tools ;  Interdisciplinary research ;  Technical translation ;  UNMET clinical need

Health Innovation Design at a University: INKA INNOLAB at Otto-von-Guericke-University,"Incremental innovation is the constant and gradual improvement of existing products, services, and processes: making them better, cheaper, or more effective; this is also the standard innovation process for medical product development. Here, disruptive technologies are seen as a simple alternative to existing products with reduced functions and limited performance. Innovation is not just something new but an invention multiplied by a commercial translation. There must be added value for the clinical user and the patient. New ideas and concepts require new technologies in interdisciplinary cooperation between engineers, scientists, economists, and the medical user. Biomedical engineering students, in particular, must understand that only through correct observation, process know-how, and subsequent analysis and evaluation can clinically relevant and affordable innovations be generated and possibly used for entrepreneurial ventures. The laboratory for innovation, research, and entrepreneurship—Innolab IGT (Innovation laboratory for Image-Guided Therapy) is run by a research group of engineers (INKA Application Driven Research) at the University Hospital of the Otto-von-Guericke-University in Magdeburg. It forms a network node between medicine, research, and business/industry. Here, students work in a focused manner from the innovation process to technology transfer with the user. At the same time, they should stimulate startup activities in this area. The concept of the Innolab IGT is simple but very effective and follows the innovation methodology I3 EME (Identify, Invent, Implement together with Engineers, Medical Users, and Economists), a fusion of the Design Thinking approach and Stanford Biodesign. First, needs are identified together with the clinical users. For these, initial solutions are being developed within the framework of the Innolab IGT and checked for commercial exploitation. The implementation of the ideas is then carried out by a startup-focused transfer downstream of the Innolab IGT in cooperation with the transfer structures of the University and broad network activity. Especially for the continuation of startup ideas beyond the Innolab IGT, early involvement and support of the Key Opinion Leaders and Stakeholders are needed.","Fritzsche, Holger",Book,Novel Innovation Design for the Future of Health: Entrepreneurial Concepts for Patient Empowerment and Health Democratization,2022-01-01,Medizinische Fakultät und Uniklinikum Magdeburg,Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation generation ;  Medical Research Laboratory ;  Medical technology transfer ;  Stanford biodesign ;  Startup

Genome Engineering as a Tool for Enhancing Crop Traits: Lessons from CRISPR/Cas9,"Over the last few decades, several efforts were made to improve cereal and horticulture crops, mainly using conventional or molecular breeding methods. The current situation enabled researchers to successfully investigate molecular mechanisms by identifying target genes to produce desirable plants. High-yielding stress-resistant crops are needed to achieve food security for the world’s increasing population. In this context, genetic engineering technologies like zinc fingers (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) have shown enormous potential in the production of improved crop varieties with desired agronomic traits. Since 2013, genome editing using sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs), especially CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, has received extensive attention for plant research due to its specificity and ability to simultaneously silence multiple genes. CRISPR/Cas9 has become a method of choice for researchers worldwide to improve crop yield, quality and reduce disease susceptibility. Many food crops, including maize, rice, wheat, tomato, potato and citrus have successfully undergone genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The availability of complete genome sequences of various crops together with innovations in genome-editing techniques opens new opportunities for obtaining desirable traits. This chapter summarizes the crop improvement using CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing approaches with particular emphasis on cereals and horticulture crops.","Saeed, Fozia;Shah, Tariq;Bukhat, Sherien;Munsif, Fazal;Ahmad, Ijaz;Khan, Hamad;Khan, Aziz",Book,Genome Editing: Current Technology Advances and Applications for Crop Improvement,2022-01-01,"The University of Agriculture, Peshawar;Bahauddin Zakariya University",Cereals ;  CRISPR/Cas ;  Disease resistance ;  Horticultural crops ;  TALENs

Nanobiomaterials Administration in Modernization of Biological Science: Current Status and Future Potential,"Nanobiomaterial is a broad area, which mainly consists of two terms, nano and biomaterial. Biomaterials can be described as natural or man-made materials consisting of biological components that may be from interdisciplinary scientific fields including material science, biofuels and bioenergy, pharmaceuticals, biology, genetic engineering, drug delivery, chemistry, etc. However, biological materials have wide range of applications yet the development of technology and new discoveries in the field of science require development of novel biomaterials and their systematic application. Here the use of term nano or more specifically nanotechnology takes its role. Nanotechnology is a field of research and innovation concerned with materials, devices, and particles on the atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The evolution of high standard biomaterials could be advanced by utilizing the newer generation applications of nanotechnology such as nanoparticles for drug delivery, nanocatalysts for biofuels production, nano-assemblies, or scaffolds for tissue and stem cell engineering. Contemporary technological expansion in the advancement of revolutionary speculative techniques for advance microscopy as well as for x-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, etc. has led to the investigation of substance at nano-level. Furthermore, it is strongly anticipated that healthcare, pharmaceutical, and bioenergy sectors can be remarkably upgraded by inspecting, envisioning, recognizing, refining biological materials, operations, and functions in the nanocsale domain. A considerable number of these approaches utilize nanoscale materials or nanobiomaterials for evolving distinct specifications demanded by these biological systems or processes. In this chapter, a comprehensive outlook of the field “nanobiomaterials” and a detailed overview of the numerous applications of nanobiomaterials are also discussed. In continuation, a specific presentation about various nanobiomaterials, their synthesis, their potential implementation, and finally their future prospects are also explained.","Singla, Ashish;Upadhyayula, Sreedevi",Book,"Handbook of Smart Materials, Technologies, and Devices: Applications of Industry 4.0: Volume 1-3",2022-01-01,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,Bioenergy ;  Biofuels ;  Biomaterials ;  Health care ;  Nanotechnology ;  Pharmaceutical

The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgery Worldwide,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first appeared in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 (World Health Organization. WHO director-general’s opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19—11 March 2020. https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19%2D%2D-11-march-2020. Accessed 2020). By September 9, 2020, 27.7 million cases and 0.9 million deaths were confirmed globally (Center for Systems Science and Engineering – Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center: COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html. Accessed 2020). This disease placed an unprecedented strain on healthcare systems around the world (Remuzzi and Remuzzi. Lancet. 395(10231):1225–8, 2020) and had a substantial effect on clinical practice across all surgical specialties, with neurosurgery being no exception (Bernstein. J Neurosurg. 2020:1–2. https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.4.JNS201031). Many hospitals implemented no-visitor policies and COVID-19 testing for all inpatients in order to prevent spread and protect patients and healthcare workers (Calderwood. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2020:1–9. https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.303). To conserve beds, workforce, and valuable resources such as masks, gowns, and ventilators, surgeons had to restrict operations to emergency and essential interventions. Some neurosurgeons were redeployed to new intradepartmental roles, others lateralized to provide care for coronavirus patients. In order to limit in-person interactions and contagion, there was a surge in telehealth and digital innovation for remote monitoring and management. Research laboratories were closed for prolonged periods. Medical education and residency training were also substantially altered, with cancellation of many in-person events and a transformation to online meetings and educational sessions. In this chapter, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the global neurosurgery community with respect to clinical care, education, and research. While the pandemic has caused tremendous disruption in global neurosurgery already, there is hope that many of the lessons learned during this time have contributed to our resilience and preparedness for the future, be it a second wave of COVID-19 or a new unexpected challenge.","Kalyvas, Aristotelis;Bernstein, Mark;Baticulon, Ronnie E.;Broekman, Marike L.D.;Robertson, Faith C.",Book,Neurosurgery and Global Health,2022-01-01,University of the Philippines Manila;HMC;University of Toronto;Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum;Harvard Medical School,Coronavirus ;  COVID-19 ;  Global neurosurgery ;  Neurosurgery ;  Pandemic ;  Prioritization ;  Task sharing ;  Task shifting ;  Telehealth ;  Triage
Transforming Engineering Systems: Learnings from Organising Megaprojects,"Whether through the delivery of a sewage system or energy distribution system, megaprojects are designed to intervene in engineering systems in a purposeful and deliberate manner. Although they always transform the system, their impact is partly predictable and partly unknowable. While the uncertainty surrounding megaprojects is widely accepted in practice and literature, project achievements are still compared against planned goals, and megaprojects are declared to be over budget, over time, over and over again, Flyvbjerg poignantly insists. Why is it so hard to design, deliver, and yield long-term benefits from megaprojects? Grounding our work in project studies literature, we discuss four challenges involved in managing megaprojects: (1) delivering purposeful interventions, (2) integrating complex work under high levels of uncertainty, (3) collaborating with friends and foes, and (4) innovating and learning under high time and budget constraints. The chapter offers implications for practice and research at the intersection between engineering systems and megaprojects.","Geraldi, Joana;Davies, Andrew",Book,Handbook of Engineering Systems Design: With 178 Figures and 54 Tables,2022-01-01,University of Sussex Business School;Copenhagen Business School,Complexity ;  Decision-making ;  Engineering systems ;  Innovation ;  Integration ;  Megaprojects ;  Project studies

Shaping the Future: North African Universities After COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted in one way or another all sectors of activity, rapidly moving from a sanitary crisis to become a socio-economic one. Higher education has been particularly affected, due to social distancing imperatives and the need to develop alternate ways of delivery relying on technology and distance learning. When the pandemic hit, it highlighted the digital unpreparedness of North African (NA) universities, as they responded quickly so as not to lose what remained of the academic year. They needed to provide resources for distance learning, ensure that faculty and staff were committed and dedicated to the success of the endeavor, and develop student support mechanisms. But the pedagogical challenges faced by all NA universities also pointed to opportunities for improvements in teaching and research. As many were to point out, COVID-19 did not introduce distance learning, it simply accelerated an ongoing process. Leading world universities were already on a trajectory towards the incorporation of technology into pedagogy, for the advantages it offers in terms of data access and processing, wider access to resources, cost of education, shared coursework and competencies, collaborative research, and interactivity at all levels. On a strategic plan, the pandemic also drew the attention of NA universities to the larger question of preparedness for the fourth industrial revolution, digitalization, and digital transformation. As international higher education shifts toward science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and data science programs in order to face the ever-increasing mass of data now available, NA universities and educational decision makers are now also realizing the eventual costs of being left behind. Digitalizing course offerings is but a small part of the role universities have to play in promoting innovation and socio-economic development, through upskilling the current workforce, appropriately training that of tomorrow, and orienting research towards artificial intelligence. Recent initiatives taken in the region may be good indicators of what life after COVID-19 will look like in NA universities.","Benjelloun, Wail",Book,Higher Education in the Arab World: New Priorities in the Post COVID-19 Era,2022-01-01,Mohammed V University in Rabat,Digital transformation ;  Distance learning ;  Health research ;  North African universities ;  Post COVID-19 ;  Skills gap

How the CEPHEI E-course Syllabus Design Was Developed and Implemented,"While the digitalization of education has been around since the 1990s, it is only since the Covid-19 pandemic that it has really taken hold in education, when universities were forced to rapidly move online and traditional patterns of teaching were no longer viable. This pushed universities to provide a blended learning environment drawing on technologies that our students, as digital natives, had already been using on a daily basis for some time. However, blended learning is only effective if underpinned by tried and tested learning frameworks—something that many universities were not prepared for when the shift to online learning took place. The Cooperative e-learning Platform for Industrial Innovation (CEPHEI) however, was already prepared and ready for this shift, as from 2017 it had been working on the development of an e-learning platform with the aim of digitizing education while also integrating the reality of professional innovation activities into the context of education according to the demands of industry. To achieve this aim, one of the first phases of the project was to identify key learning frameworks for e-course syllabus design, based on existing research, that could be used to provide recommendations for instructors in the development of their CEPHEI courses. This chapter presents the culmination of this process and provides a framework that can be used by instructors or institutions wishing to design e-learning courses. To make these frameworks tangible for the reader, examples are given throughout the chapter from an undergraduate environmental engineering course in a civil engineering department.","Kurban, Caroline Fell",Book,Digital Teaching and Learning in Higher Education: Developing and Disseminating Skills for Blended Learning,2022-01-01,MEF University,Assessment as learning ;  Assessment for learning ;  Assessment of learning ;  Backward Design ;  Blended learning ;  Bloom’s taxonomy ;  E-course syllabus design ;  Gagne’s Nine Events of Instruction
Legal Regulation and Sustainable Innovative Development of Society: Myths and Reality,"The purpose of the study is to define the parameters of evaluating the impact of legal regulation on innovative development of public relations, as well as to describe the state of the system of state-legal regulation of innovation activity in Russia in modern times. Methodology. In the course of the research, we have applied the methods of system analysis, which made it possible to explore the innovation-making in relation to the goals and scope of state policy and assess the impact of individual means of legal regulation on innovation performance. Subject-matter. The legal definition of innovation outlined in Russian legislation is investigated. It is shown that the use of the economic features of innovations for the development of a legal rule is an unsuccessful technique of legal engineering, and the application of the existing legal definition is one of the obstacles to the appropriate development of the state support system for innovation activity. Through examples, we show that uncertainty in the parameters of the state order for innovation is a constraining factor of innovative development. The article studies the performance of the “legal vacuum” to stimulate innovation activity. Findings. The legal definition of innovation and regulatory definition of the parameters of innovation activity is necessary solely for public-law effects, in particular, for developing the system of state support and state order of innovations. Law is an effective means of influence on the corresponding processes only to the extent when it allows establishing parameters for evaluation of the effectiveness and performance of the state support system. The system of state influence not assessed in parametric terms is a constraining factor of innovative development. There is an urgent need to clearly define the areas of innovation support, as well as to legally enshrine the requirements for state innovation support programs concerning the evaluation of their performance not by the amount of funding, but by effect from the sale of a new product, service or technology","Bolgova, Victoria V.",Book,Economic and Legal Foundations of Innovative Development in the Digital Age,2022-01-01,Samara National Research University,efficiency ;  innovation ;  innovative system ;  legal definitions ;  legal engineering ;  legal regulation ;  public policy ;  venture capital market

Basic principles of CO<inf>2</inf> capture and conversion technologies,"The inception of the Industrial Revolution contributed to the steep rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration globally. Apart from transitioning to low-carbon alternatives, the trend sparked intensive focused solutions that seek to capture CO2 to achieve net-zero emissions. CO2 capture technologies can be classified as postcombustion, precombustion, and oxyfuel combustion; each with distinctive differences in terms of working principles and advantages/disadvantages. At present, absorption is commonly adopted due to its technological maturity, removal efficiency, and commercial availability to remove industrial-generated anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, as innovations in carbon capture technologies mature, high research interests are also inclined toward converting captured CO2 into marketable commodity products by means of various conversion technologies, such as electrolysis, photocatalysis, biohybrid, nanoporous confinement, and CO2-based polymer synthesis by chain insertion technologies. This book chapter reviews various CO2 capture and conversion technologies, their technological limitations and prospects as a potential game-changer for the by-production of fuel and building materials via CO2 conversion.","Chai, Yee Ho;Rashidi, Nor Adilla;Mohamed, Mustakimah;Chin, Bridgid Lai Fui;Yusup, Suzana",Book,Nanomaterials for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Conversion Technologies,2022-01-01,"Tenaga Nasional Berhad;Curtin University, Malaysia;Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS","adsorption ;  basic principles of CO 2 ;  catalysis, materials synthesis ;  CCUS ;  chemical reaction engineering ;  CO 2 ;  CO  absorption 2 ;  CO  conversion 2 ;  CO  separation 2 ;  cryogenic separation ;  environmental chemical engineering ;  green chemistry ;  materials application ;  oxyfuel combustion ;  process engineering ;  separation ;  Sustainability engineering ;  sustainable development"

Securing Business Processes Using Blockchain Technology: A Case Study of Hydrocarbon Accounting Processes,"This research addresses the problems associated with hydrocarbon accounting reconciliation and allocation from the production facility to the export terminal. This paper further discusses the security of the hydrocarbon accounting database and the overall automation of the production value chain, providing transparency to the joint venture partners involved in the crude oil export agreement to avoid revenue loss. It also provides a system that is not prone to malware or data alteration and promotes hydrocarbon allocation among the injectors, production data management and production data security. The existing system mostly in the sub-saharan Africa lacks trust and greater transparency. A new technology will be devolped using Blockchain Hyperledger which is a distributed ledger technology. For the purpose of this research Javascript, PHP, MySQL on Apache virtual machine was used to design and simulate the blockchain network. The web interface of the system was tested using katalon web test framework using Agile methodology. The system will have to integrate with the Lease Automation Custody Transfer (LACT) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), A LACT-SCADANode synchronized system will be implemented in the custody transfer point in the export pipeline, so all the oil and gas Exploration and Production (E&Ps) companies injecting crude oil can view what each company in the network injected and also the quantity that got to the export terminal daily. This will be achieved by having all the custody transfer nodes of the E&Ps and export terminal node in a network of consensus. Production data will be distributed at strategic points during the transportation among the nodes uniformly at the same time, making it impossible for cyber-invasion on all the nodes at the same time. The outcome of this research will achieve an advanced secured transparent system to store production data for accurate hydrocarbon allocation, in which the consensus attribute of the implemented blockchain technology will give each node autonomy. Hence, making the production data highly reliable and reconciliation will be achieved at real-time. This innovation further presents a new knowledge in the application of mechatronics engineering to the oil and gas sector, with its multidisciplinary focus on electronics, mechanical and computer systems. It is the integration of a software system to a LACT and sensors on the crude oil pipelines to acquire data, compute in a Hyperledger fabric network and display at real-time for hydrocarbon allocation settlement.","Odachi, Kenechukwu",Conference Proceeding,"International Petroleum Technology Conference, IPTC 2022",2022-01-01,First Bank of Nigeria Plc,
The Key Technologies of Ultra-Deep Hpht Horizontal Wells and Its Application in Shunbei Oilfield of SINOPEC,"There was nearly 1.7 billion tons proved reserve in SINOPEC Shunbei oilfield, which is the deepest (>8000m) fault controlled marine carbonate oilfield in the world with high-temperature (>170 °C) and high -pressure (>140MPa). The formation geological conditions are complicated, high rock strength, easy leakage and collapse, multiple pressure systems co-exist in the slim borehole, which caused a series of directional drilling technical problems such as difficulty in controlling the tool surface, PDM build-up capacity prediction and so on. Therefore, the related research for ultra-deep direction drilling technology were carried out aiming at solving the directional drilling problem for Shunbei oilfield. Firstly, the optimized wellbore structure scheme design method was proposed, in which the geological characteristics, borehole size and the directional efficiency were considered. And then a double augmented well profile designed model was established based on optimizing the production casing size, through which the directional efficiency and the drilling rate of a trip were increased significantly, and the nonproductive time can be greatly reduced easily. Secondly, an ultra-deep directional well torque transmission prediction model was established based on the mechanical analysis of ultra-deep drilling string and based which a rapid tool face control method was formed. Furthermore, an innovative build-up rate prediction method was established based on both big Data analysis and balanced tendency build-up rate prediction method, and the accuracy is more than 90%. Moreover, the PDM rubber seal, stator and rotor dimensions are optimized to achieve high power output within a certain high temperature range to prolong the service life according to the wellbore temperature field. Finally, the optimization of high temperature MWD instrument and matching process technology was proposed, such as surface assisted cooling, borehole size enlarging and high displacement cooling technology effectively improve the reliability. The series of ultra-deep directional drilling technology has been applied in Shunbei oilfield. The field application results show that the average ROP of directional section is increased by more than 30%, directional efficiency is greatly improved, and the directional drilling cycle is shortened by more than 20%. Nearly 40 ultra-deep directional wells above 8000m have been constructed, setting more than 10 new Asia records of petroleum engineering onshore directional well. There are two innovations in this paper. The first is to put forward the design method of wellbore profile with the shortest drilling time as the goal, which can save 1-2 trips and improve the directional efficiency by more than 20%. The second is to introduce the prediction method of build-up rate based on borehole tendency angle, which improves the prediction accuracy of build-up rate by 28% in Shunbei ultra deep directional well.","Bai, Binzhen;Zeng, Yijin;Lu, Xin;Zhang, Hongning;Wang, Zhifa;Wang, Long;Zhou, Haobo;Silva, Eduardo David Gramajo;Maurice, Rached Rached",Conference Proceeding,"International Petroleum Technology Conference, IPTC 2022",2022-01-01,Sinopec;China University of Petroleum-Beijing,

Analyzing Impact of Technology-Facilitated Knowledge Creation on Student Satisfaction in Distance Learning Education,"Although Covid-19 cases are continuing to decrease, the practice of online learning has become common in education. Many education institutions have online classes besides face-to-face classes. However, many research reported several problems in distance learning practice mainly because of the limitation of interactive conversation and learning activities and finally lead to an ineffective knowledge creation process. It is reported that in a distance learning setting during the pandemic, the motivation and participation rate decreased while the absence and dropout rates increased. Knowledge conversion is a term to reflect the acquisition of new know-how or tacit knowledge from the learning activities. Currently, various technology vendor keeps making innovations to solve this problem, and available technologies that can be utilized to support distance learning education are increasing. Therefore, this paper aims to know the impact of the knowledge creation process on student satisfaction and explain how to utilize technologies throughout the knowledge creation chain. Based on the statistical analysis it is found that the knowledge creation process that is represented using the SECI model simultaneously has a significant positive effect on student satisfaction. This means all phases in SECI (socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) are simultaneously able to improve student satisfaction. However, partially, only socialization and internalization that has a significant positive impact on student satisfaction, which indicates these two factors partially could lead to better student satisfaction if it is planned and managed appropriately. This paper also constructs a matrix that helps education practitioners choose the right technology for each knowledge creation phase.","Wijaya, Mahaning Indrawaty;Gunawan, Ali",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2nd IEEE International Conference on Disruptive Technologies for Multi-Disciplinary Research and Applications, CENTCON 2022",2022-01-01,Bina Nusantara University,distance education ;  Knowledge creation ;  satisfaction ;  SECI ;  technology
Innovative RF Device Technologies for Advanced Information and Communications Network Society,"This paper describes the innovation of RF device technologies for wireless communication. Over the last decade, data traffic on the internet has increased exponentially. In particular, data traffic over wireless networks has exploded due to IoT including mobile phones. Since the 1990s, global wireless communication systems and personal cellular services, have evolved from 1G to 4G in order to meet the huge demand for wireless communication. Recently we are focusing on the research and development of devices and amplifiers for 5G, which is being implemented, and beyond 5G and 6G, which are on the horizon. The 5G system consists of many macro cells and small cells, and its power consumption is enormous. The high efficiency and high- power density of GaN devices decreases the power consumption of the whole system. Up to now, ongoing research on N-polar GaN has demonstrated an extremely high-power and high PAE at W-band. Recently we demonstrated innovative high-k MIS N-polar GaN HEMTs which were fabricated, for the first time, using commercial 4-inch wafer process facilities. We overcame the challenge of developing a vital gate insulating film by incorporating Si LSI material technology. Furthermore, a ScAlN/GaN HEMT with high polarization and lattice-matching is also promising. An AlN/GaN HEMT on AlN substrate achieves high current density without heating up. Heat dissipation technology is a critical method of improving device performance and efficiency. Moreover, we developed a novel passivation technology to control the electric flux lines using dielectric potions as a new engineering method for controlling the electric field of devices. This paper reports these innovative technologies for RF devices and amplifiers.","Makiyama, Kozo;Yoshida, Shigeki;Nakata, Ken;Miyamoto, Yasuyuki",Conference Proceeding,"2022 IEEE BiCMOS and Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuits and Technology Symposium, BCICTS 2022",2022-01-01,"Institute of Science Tokyo;Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.",5G ;  Amplifier ;  and 6G ;  Beyond 5G ;  HEMTs ;  High data-rate wireless communication networks ;  High frequency ;  High power ;  High-k MIS ;  N-polar GaN

Food Printing: 3D Printing in Food Industry,"This book provides a comprehensive overview of the technical notes, research designs, literature, and 3DP (three-dimensional printing) technology applications for effective food printing. It provides a multidisciplinary coverage of 3D food printing in different food sectors. Recent advancements in manufacturing processes have led food industries to create innovations to stay competitive in the market. 3D food printing incorporates 3DP digital gastronomy strategies to manufacture food products with consistency in shape, color, flavor, texture, and even nutrition. Thus, by controlling the number of materials and the quality of nutrients, food items can be manufactured and handled to fulfill their particular requirements. For food printing, both proprietary structures and self-developed frameworks are used from open sources. Similar frameworks are re-engineered to reformulate administration, content creation, and user interface. For example, three printing medium types, natural printable products, non-printable synthetic food products, and alternative ingredients as well as two recipe forms (i.e., element-based recipes and regular recipes) are used for customized food production. The authors address that open 3D technology for food printing and food processing technology are theoretically correlated with food printing. The book will help industrial designers, nutrition professionals, dieticians, manufacturing enterprises, and young researchers in food technology, material science, and mechanical engineering understand the latest advances in 3DP technology in food industries.","Sandhu, Kamalpreet;Singh, Sunpreet",Book,Food Printing: 3D Printing in Food Industry,2022-01-01,Lovely Professional University;National University of Singapore,3D printing ;  Design approach ;  Food ink ;  Food materials ;  Food Printing ;  Food products ;  Food technology ;  Nutrition

A COMPARISON OF HOW THE TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS INDUSTRY AND THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY’S SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESSES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID-19 AND HOW ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCIES COULD BE USED TO ADDRESS THEM,"Since it has been established that supply chain management has traditionally been a process-oriented field with not much focus on innovation, in a post-pandemic world, engineering managers have realized that research is needed to identify which aspects of global supply chain management have the greatest need for transformation and could benefit most through the application of entrepreneurial competencies. Along those lines, the authors of this paper have earlier proposed a research model, which includes a mapping between supply chain management process steps and entrepreneurial competencies along with proposed training and organizational changes to facilitate the implementation of a more entrepreneurial approach to supply chain management processes. Using a qualitative, grounded theory approach based on two case studies, the authors focus on two industries. The differences and similarities between the two industries will be compared in this paper; thus, showing engineering managers how the model could be applied to the two different industries considered in this paper.","Gandhi, S.

ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT IN THE AGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE,"Technology has never advanced as rapidly as it has in the last twenty-five (25) years. With these massive changes comes the challenges of how that innovation is managed to get that research into product and services, how to get those products and services positioned and priced in the markets, and how to satisfy the resource providers that their allocations have been best managed to obtain optimum results in the marketplace. These pressures have substantially changed the role of Engineering Management in any organization from a governance group to visionaries, from oversight to innovation managers, and from task masters to talent cultivators. The Engineering Manager is no longer the hands-on arbitrator of duties. They are becoming those who are training the next generation to think and act in new ways, cultivating those ideas while mentoring a diverse and integrated workforce that does not come from traditional backgrounds. This challenges the Engineering Manager to be a director and mentor rather than following more traditional paths achieving the next set of technological solutions. This paper explores this new and ambitious approach, along with tools for success, especially in mentoring diversity candidates so their buried ideas can be brought forward in a way appealing and desirable to well-established and ingrained management structures found in corporations, companies and academia. The Engineering Manager is now a leader and visionary for a new generation, requiring new thoughts and tools to meet these exciting challenges, and their new role is a challenging one. .","Day, Thomas J.",Conference Proceeding,ASEM 43rd International Annual Conference Proceedings,2022-01-01,U.S. Department of Commerce,Advancement ;  Change ;  Markets ;  Solutions ;  Technology ;  Vision
1.02 - Solar Photovoltaics: Living a Technology From Research Curiosity to Reality,"The progression of photovoltaic (PV) technology over the last 60-years has been a roller-coaster ride. The “ups and downs” have been characterized by significant innovative advancements, several tipping points and breakthroughs, periods of euphoria with government and private leadership and investments, complementary disappointments and worries about inconsistencies or loss of needed commitments, growth in industry, loss of many high-potential startups, overall impressive growth of manufacturing, slowness of adaption of indigenous manufacturing, expansion of science, engineering, and industry workforce, dramatic drops in both PV power and electricity prices, short-term materials shortages, and international collaborations—all leading to bringing PV to its current leadership position as a real, growing, and accepted component of our world electricity framework. This chapter provides an overview of this period from the mid-1950s to present, reflecting the observations, experiences, and career of the author who was able to live this interesting timeline. This reflects on the period from the birth of modern PV at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1954, through the establishment of the first markets for space. The turn in the 1970s toward terrestrial PV, followed by landslides of innovations in materials, devices, manufacturing, and reliability leads to the current status.

"Simulation Workflows in Minutes, at Scale for Next-Generation HPC","As the White House pushes to decarbonize energy (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/building-on-us-advanced-reactor-demonstration-momentum-federal-power-purchase-agreements/ ), the Department of Energy (DOE)’s National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC) has an urgent need to decrease the cost and schedule for new reactor design and construction in support of the Advanced Construction Technology (ACT) initiative. Current lead time for new reactors is 20–30 years and costs $10–$15 billion. This must be dramatically reduced to bring advanced reactors online. Digital Engineering, leveraging the best multiphysics simulation and high-performance computing (HPC), offers us a unique opportunity to lead these efforts, but a paradigm shift in engineering is mandatory: right now on the order of only 1% of engineers regularly use simulation as a tool in their design toolbox—meaning it is unusual for engineers to create virtual prototypes and broadly explore the available space of design options, and test and evolve them with modeling and simulation. Massive virtual prototype explorations are rarely done in new product development, because engineering modeling & simulation packages take months-to-years to learn, and setup of a new simulation can often require hours of laborious work. We must enable a new user to set up and run thousands of models quickly to evolve virtual prototypes. DOE has spent nearly $100 million (https://datainnovation.org/2020/06/does-30-million-investment-in-supercomputing-software-will-help-maintain-u-s-top-spot/, https://insidehpc.com/2021/07/doe-funds-28m-for-scientific-supercomputing-research-projects/ ) in taxpayer funds, and decades of development, to advance HPC. There is massive untapped potential in the thousands of simulation packages in existence, and the commercial cloud computing that is plentiful and affordable today. Computational physics and HPC needs to be put in the hands of every engineer to begin a renaissance in construction and manufacturing. We present an autonomous system built to hyper-enable engineers, and the work we’ve conducted using the Summit supercomputer to pursue it.","Grosvenor, Allan;Zemlyansky, Anton;Deighan, Dwyer;Sysko, Dustin",Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2022-01-01,MSBAI,Artificial intelligence ;  Deep learning ;  Digital engineering ;  Digital transformation ;  HPC ;  Reinforcement learning
"Uncertainties Management from the Hard and Soft approach, in projects of Brazilian Aerospace Sector","Over the past three decades, the discipline of project management has evolved in the sense of considering the differences between projects. The traditional management approach has given rise to a more flexible approach adapted to the project characteristics, considering its contingencies. The aerospace sector has recognized the importance of the contingency approach since the projects in this sector are complex, with different degrees of innovation and, therefore, varying levels of uncertainty. This article provides an empirical advance on uncertainty management in aerospace projects from the Hard and Soft approach. The research method used was the Case Study. Four cases from the Brazilian aerospace sector were analyzed, two from Embraer and two from INPE. For these cases, the Hard and Soft categorization system was applied at different stages of the life cycle, through different methods and to meet different purposes. The results show that the Hard and Soft approach is effective in identifying and managing project uncertainties.","Domingos, Teresa Raquel Pereira;Chagas, Milton De Freitas",Conference Proceeding,"2022 IEEE 28th International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2022 and 31st International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2022 Joint Conference - Proceedings",2022-01-01,Embraer - Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica SA;Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais,Aerospace projects ;  Hard and Soft Approach ;  Project Categorization Systems ;  Uncertainty Management

Biotechnology and Biodefense Enterprise: An Industry Perspective on Defence Acquisition,"Biotechnology is gaining priority along with other rapidly evolving disciplines in science and engineering due to its potential for innovating the modern military. The broad nature of biotechnology is directly relevant to the military and defence sector where the applications span clinical diagnostics, medical countermeasures and therapeutics, to environmental remediation and biofuels for energy. Although the process for a commercial biotech research and development (R&D) pipeline and the Department of Defence (DOD) acquisition cycle both aim to result in products, they follow two distinctly different pathways. In the biotech industry, the pipeline progresses from basic to applied science that includes design and R&D, commercialisation and product launch, where market forces and financial returns on investment drive priorities. Along the way, the scientific and iterative nature of R&D often results in several candidates for a given assay, drug, therapeutic or vaccine, many of which are unsuccessful or wind up in the so-called valley of death. The DOD acquisition process is a multi-phase and often multi-decade cradle-to-grave product lifecycle engrained in mission requirements, warfighter needs and creating legacy programmes of record. The biotech industry is composed of many small R&D and ‘big pharma’ companies that meet DOD’s unique medical mission requirements. These small R&D companies considered that non-traditional DOD acquisition partners are developing new innovations in biotechnology, but the complex DOD acquisition process is challenging for these small start-ups to navigate. Technology solutions that gain support through DOD acquisitions are able to successfully develop their products and bridge the valley of death by obtaining much needed funding for advanced development, test and evaluation, and demonstration through clinical trials. Our analysis profiles three case histories involving private-public partnerships that yielded biotech products developed through the DOD acquisition cycle that continues to meet current and future medical mission requirements.","Yeh, Kenneth B.;Du, Eric;Olinger, Gene;Boston, Donna",Journal,"Global Security - Health, Science and Policy",2022-01-01,KPMG LLP;DSBio Consulting;Life Sciences Division,Acquisition ;  biodefense ;  biotechnology ;  defence ;  product development ;  research and development
ASSESSING UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS' LEVEL OF AWARENESS OF COMMERCIALIZATION OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH INNOVATION AT A HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY,"Engineering Research Innovation Commercialization (ERIC) seeks to translate products or services from the research laboratory to the marketplace or the end-user for societal benefit. Research indicates that universities have distinctive capabilities that allow them to play an important role in the process of research innovation commercialization. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), though originally established mainly as teaching and blue-collar trade institutions to educate African Americans, have been gradually commercializing several research innovations through patenting. However, this is significantly lower compared to that of their counterparts (specifically, Predominately White Institutions - PWIs). This according to available research is mainly because HBCUs have been traditionally under-served and under-resourced. Currently several programs such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps and National Science Foundation Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (NSF- CREST) Center for Nanotechnology Research and Education (CNRE)) are being implemented by HBCUs to promote the commercialization of research innovations by training innovators about commercializing innovations. However, little research has been done to assess the level of awareness of engineering undergraduate students at an HBCU about the commercialization of engineering research innovations. This pilot study, therefore, seeks to investigate the level of awareness of engineering undergraduate students at an HBCU about engineering research innovation commercialization. The authors of this study have conducted a similar study that focused only on engineering graduate students in an HBCU. To achieve the purpose of this study, we developed a survey that adopts both binary and ordinal scales of question and administered it to 30 engineering undergraduate students in an ABET-accredited HBCU. After collation and analysis, the results indicate a low level of awareness of engineering research innovation commercialization by engineering undergraduate students at this University. Though at a pilot stage (to be validated by a larger study in different HBCUs), the study recommends that HBCUs initiate new or strengthen ongoing innovation commercialization training programs by including it in undergraduate engineering first-year courses such as ""Introduction to Engineering"" and related courses to help students become more aware of the opportunities in engineering research innovation commercialization processes.","Addo, Sampson;Tyagi, Pawan;Mutunga, Eva",Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2022-01-01,University of the District of Columbia,Engineering education ;  engineering research innovation commercialization ;  engineering student ;  Historically Black Colleges ;  Universities (HBCUs)

Resilient First Responder Paging via ATSC 3.0/NEXT GEN TV,"Many Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and Fire services across the United States still rely on analog voice paging technology to communicate emergency incident information to responders. The infrastructure for these paging systems is typically owned, operated, and maintained by the local government or agency to ensure coverage includes as close to 100% of the jurisdiction as possible. This paper proposes the use of datacasting technology to provide a redundant method for critical data distribution over a wide area to serve the paging needs of public safety and uses North Carolina as a test case. This concept could lead to cost-sharing, higher reliability, greater collaboration across jurisdictions, and reduced response times. The public deserves the best possible response from the public safety sector and therefore, public safety deserves the best technology available in order to achieve their mission. PBS North Carolina, along with the North Carolina Department of Information Technology First Responder Emerging Technologies Program (FirstTech), presented this concept at the 2019 National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Broadcast Engineering and Information Technology Conference. Much progress has been made since then. Starting in early 2020, a United States Department of Homeland Security Small Business Innovation Research grant was awarded to develop a prototype system that included an encoder and a custom ATSC 3.0 paging receiver with a miniature antenna. This paper will discuss the overall concept and current progress using ATSC 3.0 to address a critical emergency communications need [1].","Engel, Fred;Grasso, Red;Sammarco, Tony",Conference Proceeding,"2022 IEEE International Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security, HST 2022",2022-01-01,Pbs North Carolina;Project Technology Strategy Device Solutions Incorporated;FirstTech Program,ATSC 3.0 ;  call alerting ;  digital paging ;  dispatch ;  Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)
A Systematic Mapping Study on Quality Attribute Traceability,"Quality attribute traceability (QAT), as a sub-discipline of software traceability, ensures that quality attributes are considered in all phases of software development. QAT is one of the most critical and challenging research areas in requirement engineering. In recent years, several studies have been conducted on quality attribute traceability. However, researchers in this field have problems to identifying the research status of this field due to the lack of a comprehensive secondary study that reveals research trends and gaps. Evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) proposes systematic mapping study (SMS) and systematic literature review (SLR) methods for secondary studies on software engineering. In this paper we use the semantically enhanced SMS method in the QAT research area. In order to improve SMS, we introduce a concept classification approach. In this approach by using a QAT domain ontology, the keywords classification process is improved. The most important innovation of this study is the presentation of the QAT research tree. This research tree has been created by gathering research topics identified in this field along with existing gaps. Identified research topics include “QAT Approach,” “QAT Development,” “QAT Model,” “QAT Framework,” and “QAT Algorithm”. The results also indicate that “QAT Frameworks” is a research trend, and most recent studies have focused on this topic. On the other hand, “Trace Maintenance” and “Trace Integrity” are the research gaps in this field. In this article, active researchers, journals, conferences and countries in the field of QAT are also introduced. We also introduce a set of tools that facilitate the SMS process.","Sharifi, Ehsan;Barforoush, Ahmad Abdollahzadeh;Al dabbagh, Haider S.",Journal,Journal of Web Engineering,2022-01-01,Amirkabir University of Technology,concept classification ;  quality attribute ;  systematic mapping study ;  Traceability
INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION AND US INNOVATION: Insights from the US experience,"This chapter reviews evidence on the connection of international migration to innovation in the US. We review the quantitative and qualitative importance of immigrants to technological development (e.g., patents, entrepreneurship) and its recent growth. Immigrants account for about a quarter of US innovation, with much of that impact coming through the large and growing number of immigrants engaged in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. While immigrants are disproportionately represented among superstar inventors, most of the aggregate immigrant advantage for patenting and firm starts can be explained by individuals’ education levels and field of study. We characterise recent studies regarding whether immigrants crowd-in or crowd-out native engagement in innovation, with some differences emerging over studies depending upon whether cities, occupations, or student degree fields are used to measure effects. We close with areas for future research on this topic.","Kerr, William R.",Book,"Routledge Handbook of Immigration and Refugee Studies, Second Edition",2022-01-01,Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation;Harvard Business School;Faculty chair of the Launching New Ventures programme,

Research and Application of Ultrasonic Rolling Surface Strengthening Technology,"The mechanical, physical and chemical properties of metal materials, such as wear resistance, erosion resistance, corrosion resistance, and oxidation resistance, largely depend on the surface integrity of the material. As a new type of material post-processing technology, the ultrasonic rolling surface strengthening technology uses the method of coupling the preset initial static pressure and the dynamic ultrasonic impact force to complete the reciprocating processing of the material surface, achieving the smoothing effect of ""cutting peaks and filling valleys"". A deeper surface nanohardening layer and beneficial residual stress are obtained, they have unique advantages in improving the surface integrity of the material. In recent years, the research and application of ultrasonic rolling technology have become a research hotspot in the field of advanced manufacturing. Many scientific researchers and engineering technicians have deepened their research on the effective control of ultrasonic rolling process parameters and other process-assisted ultrasonic rolling composite processing technology. Research has achieved technological innovation in the preparation of high-performance materials and the remanufacturing of components. This paper introduces the research status and application of ultrasonic rolling surface strengthening technology at home and abroad, enumerates the shortcomings of the existing ultrasonic rolling surface strengthening technology, and looks forward to the future research direction. At present, most researchers at home and abroad have improved the properties of the processed materials from the experimental research, simulation analysis, micro-mechanism, and application research of ultrasonic rolling, and obtained good surface integrity. But for the ultrasonic rolling surface, the synergistic regulation relationship between performance and process parameters is still unclear, and the research on performance improvement and application of ultrasonic rolling composite processing technology has not been in-depth. For this reason, starting from the processing principle of ultrasonic rolling technology, the advantages of this technology in improving surface integrity are briefly expounded. The research progress of ultrasonic rolling technology is expounded. The influencing factors of ultrasonic rolling test mainly include ultrasonic rolling output amplitude, static pressure, processing times, spindle speed, feed rate, etc. The optimal selection of process parameters can improve the control effect between material structure and properties to a certain extent, and at the same time, some ultrasonic rolling composite post-treatment processes are also affected by process parameters introduced from the outside, such as introducing temperature during the ultrasonic rolling process or adding other physical or chemical composite processes to assist processing to better promote large plastic deformation of the material and induce fine grain size, so as to achieve the surface integrity gain effect of other process-assisted ultrasonic rolling treatments. Numerical simulation of the process in the experimental study is carried out, and the optimized process parameters can be selected to obtain better surface integrity of the material. The simulation analysis can provide a simple and feasible reference for the optimization of the experimental process. The improvement effect of ultrasonic rolling treatment on wear resistance and fatigue resistance of metal materials, as well as the synergistic regulation effect of other process-assisted ultrasonic rolling technology on the improvement of material properties, are mainly reviewed. Through the reasonable selection of ultrasonic rolling process parameters, the formation of nanostructures on the surface of the material, the transformation of beneficial residual stress, and the improvement of surface microhardness can achieve synergistic effects, thereby improving the microstructure, wear resistance and wear resistance of the material performance, erosion resistance and corrosion resistance. With the continuous deepening of the application field of ultrasonic rolling technology, the application scope has expanded from the initial research of ultrasonic rolling on the surface of metal materials to composite materials, coating materials, and even from traditional mechanical fields to biomedicine, military aerospace, petroleum engineering, etc. In the field, higher requirements are put forward for the surface performance indicators of engineering parts materials. Combined with the unique advantages of conventional ultrasonic rolling, through the coupling of other processing technologies and ultrasonic rolling technology, the ultrasonic rolling-assisted surface strengthening composite processing technology can better realize the post-processing of materials, and thus develope a variety of ultrasonic rolling assisted strengthening technology. It provides a new direction for the application and development of material surface post-treatment technology in engineering practice. The synergistic effect of ultrasonic rolling coupled with other surface strengthening processes (high temperature, remelting, electric pulse physical field and other auxiliary processes) is studied, which plays a positive role in improving the surface properties of materials and enhancing the corrosion resistance and friction resistance. At present, domestic and foreign researchers have used ultrasonic rolling technology to achieve post-processing of various metal materials, and obtained high-quality and high-efficiency materials through a single ultrasonic rolling or other process-assisted ultrasonic rolling methods. However, there are also situations in which the processing efficiency of ultrasonic rolling automation equipment is not stable enough, the processing quality is not high enough, and the application in the engineering field is not yet widely used, as well as the active control of material residual stress, nanostructure, fretting wear, and fatigue damage. The research on the microscopic improvement mechanism needs to be further expanded, and the research on the evaluation of surface integrity and the imperfect detection system is not comprehensive. In the future, based on the mature theory and broad application requirements of ultrasonic rolling technology, it is believed that the related ultrasonic rolling technology system will continue to improve in the future, and new progress will be made in the development of new composite processes and the evolution law of corresponding performance enhancement progress, and continue to expand the application field of its composite technology, to achieve the progress of my country's advanced manufacturing industry.","Meng, Cheng;Zhao, Yun Cai;Zhang, Xin Yu;Wang, Xin;He, Yang;Zhang, Jun",Journal,Surface Technology,2022-01-01,Jiangxi University of Science and Technology,surface integrity ;  surface strengthening ;  ultrasonic impact force ;  ultrasonic rolling
ENGINEERING STUDENTS' MOTIVATION FOR LEARNING IN CHALLENGE-DRIVEN PROJECT COURSES: A QUALITATIVE PILOT STUDY,"This pilot study explores engineering students' motivation for learning and studying through the lens of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Five postgraduate students from a research-intensive Swedish university participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews about their study experiences from different Challenge-Driven Education (CDE) courses. It adds to the limited, existing literature on CDE and is the first to study it from a purely motivational perspective. As this is a pilot study, the primary intent of the data analysis concerns the first two phases of Braun and Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis approach - familiarisation and immersion in the data and generating initial codes. A combination of inductive and deductive approaches to analysing the data were used, and preliminary motivational factors emerged from the interviews are illustrated according to the SDT concepts. A variety of motivations for learning and studying, such as innovation, real-world problem solving, contribution to the society, and trial for following master thesis projects, emerged from the data and positioned on the self-determination continuum in which different types of regulations are guiding students' behaviours simultaneously. Furthermore, autonomy in the choice of a project, feedback and assignment deadlines, and relationships within group work, enhanced or/and undermined the three psychological needs defined by SDT; autonomy, competence and relatedness. Preliminary findings are discussed in relation to the SDT literature, and practical applications are suggested for supporting the motivational needs of engineering students. Finally plans for a continuation of the study are discussed in light of this initial phase.","Pantzos, P.;Rosén, A.;Buckley, J.;Gumaelius, L.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (TUS);The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),challenge-driven education ;  higher engineering education ;  motivation ;  self-determination theory ;  student learning
DESIGN FOR IMPACT (D4i): A FRAMEWORK FOR TEACHING SUSTAINABILITY IN ENGINEERING DESIGN,"Sustainability has become an integrative part of engineering education since it is not possible to discuss sustainable development without also talking about innovation capability. Political and environmental frameworks request for a drastic change in the industrial landscape and also in the way design is carried out. This paradigm change forces new approaches to education that align with the prospects of the industry and also embed considerations related to the Triple Bottom Line (i.e. economic, ecological, socio-cultural elements). Addressing the complexity of sustainability requires innovative practices for teaching and learning, leading to new methodologies that aim to develop the broad sets of competencies required from the students. In Engineering Design, theories and methods related to sustainability have been mainly focused on the Design for X elements, material circularity, and product lifecycle leaving behind the importance of contextualized knowledge of regulations, or human-related aspects that motivates the students to tackle these challenges. Therefore, this study proposes a holistic approach that encompasses a broader understanding of what educators can exploit for capacitating future engineers in sustainability-related complex problem-solving. The framework highlights three main areas to be considered when teaching sustainability for Design Engineers: i) Context & Resources, ii) Human factors & Competencies, and iii) The D4i design process. A simplified version of this framework in class as a lecture-workshop format are presented and discussed along with multiple directions for future research.","Kunrath, Kamila;Beliatis, Michail J.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Aarhus Universitet,Engineering Education ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability ;  Teaching Framework
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TEACHER NETWORKS - WHAT MOTIVATES TEACHERS TO COLLABORATE?,"Teaching collaboration between universities is becoming increasingly important. Student intakes are increasing, and students are including MOOC courses from other universities to their studies. In Finland, there has been a long tradition in national teaching collaboration in computing education field. Our main research question is what motivates software engineering teachers to collaborate among universities. In this paper, we first give a short overview of national teaching collaboration from 1990's to the present day. Then, we present findings from a questionnaire that had respondents from active network participants. Main factors and practices that motivated teachers to participate in networking activities were existing project funding, active leaders and enough participants, interesting topics such as new innovations in learning technology, regular meetings and remote participation.","Kilamo, T.;Knutas, A.;Korhonen, A.;Poranen, T.;Sievi-Korte, O.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Aalto University;LUT University;Tampere University,motivation to collaborate ;  networking activities ;  software engineering teachers ;  Teaching collaboration
How do students transform good solutions from an educational challenge in a startup? A case study to entrepreneurship education,"In many universities around the world several events of short term PbL are taking place. These are challenges proposed to the engineering students from concrete problems given by NGOs, governmental institutions, or enterprises. In general, they are named hackathons or bootcamps. The goal is to spark interest and develop skills linked to the design and the engineering project development in short-time sprints. However, most of these solutions are never implemented in practice by the teams that created them. The universities consider these practices as part of the education in engineering. Two Brazilian institutions (CEFET/RJ-Federal Center for Engineering Education-Rio de Janeiro and UFRJ-Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil) participated and won the international event named ""Invent for the Planet"" organized by Texas A&M University in 2019. The students developed an interface for blind people to walk on the streets avoiding obstacles. Back in Brazil, these students patented the product and created a startup to produce and introduce that solution in the market. Today they have an accessibility startup with several other solutions in addition to the one created at the event. This research has the goal to understand the ways that made these students transform an educational project into a feasible/successful entrepreneurial action. What was the motivation of these students? Where did they get additional entrepreneurship training? What lessons does this case can provide to engineering education? A set of interviews has been carried out to understand the process that can contribute to engineering entrepreneurship education in the universities.","Braga, M.;Pifano, F.;Boehm, R.;Alves, M.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Texas A&M University;CEFET,Engineering Education ;  Entrepreneurship Education ;  Innovation ;  Invent for the Planet ;  Startup
A RESEARCH PROGRAM ABOUT A SHORT-TERM PBL APPROACH BASED ON THE SDG,"Increasing populations in urban areas create complex problems, such as access to drinking water, sanitation, housing, and traffic. Today's engineers are prototyping solutions for future cities. Engineering education must meet this challenge, with students developing knowledge in their engineering field while addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Problem-based learning (PbL) is a valuable tool in engineering education, particularly for sustainable development. In PbL, students solve engineering problems by developing projects. For example, students in early courses can confront problems demanding low-tech solutions. The Federal Center for Engineering Education in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, offers short-term project experience (PbL) focusing on SDG in cities. For 48h, students tackle SDG problems from urban communities and are challenged to create low-cost solutions. In the end, they pitch their solutions to experts from NGOs, governments, and corporations. This article presents a short-term PbL approach for SDG supported by one case developed by the students and concludes with recommendations for a research program, aiming to understand the process and transform the projects into concrete, sustainable, social innovation actions applied to communities.","Braga, M.;d'Escoffier, L.;Guerra, A.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz;Aalborg University,Assessment ;  Innovation ;  PbL ;  Short-term PbL ;  Sustainability
WHEEL OF COMPETENCIES: INDUSTRY DEMANDS OF COMPETENCIES FOR RESEARCH AND INNOVATION,"On the basis of the current state of research, this study identifies and validates future-oriented competencies. Using quantitative social research methods, it then investigates demands in industry. This involved, first, an evaluation of literature and the identification of competencies for research and innovation (R&I) activities. Next, from clusters of the identified competencies I derived 14 different types. On this basis, I generated a competency profile that informs the development of a tool for R&I, the Wheel of Competencies. With this newly developed tool specific competency profiles can be generated and analysed. Second, I operationalized and implemented the competence components in a questionnaire. On this basis, 200 CEOs and heads of research and development (R&D) departments of medium-sized and large enterprises in Germany were surveyed in November and December 2021 using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI). All enterprises have at least 50 employees and an in-house R&D department. In addition, enterprises have to belong to one of the following industry sectors: automotive, chemical, electrical or mechanical engineering. The results show that certain competencies are in very high demand across all industries, while others are more specific to an industry sector. Overall, the results indicate that the competencies in demand address the dynamic complexity in collaborative R&I processes. The results presented here make an important evidence-based contribution to curriculum development in engineering education based on future-oriented competencies and illustrates which transfer activities and collaborative formats are increasingly relevant.","Johannsen, T.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin,Competence ;  Curriculum Development ;  Employability ;  Skills ;  Survey
ORGANISING EVIDENCE-INFORMED INNOVATION: THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RESEARCH AGENDA,"Educational innovation often builds on existing practices, and focuses on improvement, rather than a radical change. One current example of educational innovation is Challenge-Based Learning (CBL). At university [blinded] the approach is a curriculum wide implementation of CBL based on a integrated programme that combines implementation of bottom-up innovation projects with research. The result of this research contributes to the translation of CBL to practice, thus helping curriculum designers and teachers in designing and executing their courses. In the process evidence is collected about principles of CBL, learning behaviour, learning outcomes, and didactical aspects of CBL, such as coaching and self-directed The goal of this paper is to explore the development of a research agenda, which aligns research and practice, and to contribute to evidence for successful CBL implementation as result. The CBL research agenda shows which topics and aspects of CBL are addressed by research and practice, and which are overlooked. It is a systematic way of collecting strategic and practical problems related to CBL implementation, and how these are translated into research questions, methods, and results. The CBL research agenda leads to dialogue, which in turn guides our CBL programme. This integrated programme, including the research agenda is governed by a Taskforce CBL and supported by programme management, and a university wide research community. This approach enables the curriculum wide implementation and research of CBL as a concept for educating engineers of the future and strengthening on-campus education.","van den Beemt, Antoine;van de Watering, Gerard;Bots, Michael",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,and design of challenges ;  assessment ;  facilitating structures ;  pedagogies ;  Please select one to five keywords learning
WHAT DO WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN DESIGNING AND RESEARCHING STUDENT LEARNING IN CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING?,"Challenge-Based Learning has become specifically popular in higher engineering education. CBL addresses the key characteristics of future engineering programs by embracing authentic, active learning, offering choice in problem-solving and learning practices as well as enabling training in interdisciplinary teamwork and decision-making. This responds to the desire of many students for a sense of meaning in their education. Just as with many other educational innovations, we see a large variety of many different initiatives under the CBL label which is why much research is being conducted on the characteristics of CBL implementation. But the goal for researching different characteristics of CBL experiments is to, in the long run, understand whether CBL influences student learning, and in which way, since prior research suggests positive effects of such active learning approaches. In this short paper we present a framework for capturing the prerequisites, context, process and outcomes of student learning in Challenge-Based Learning. We take a close look at CBL as an educational concept in contrast to the prior ways in which student learning has been described. We put forward a heuristic analytical framework that will allow researchers and educators to capture the different aspects of the CBL process and context that could guide further education innovation and research to foster student learning gain in CBL.","Helker, K.;Lazendic-Galloway, J.;Bruns, M.;Reymen, I.

ESSENTIALITY OF KNOWING TRANSVERSAL COMPETENCIES: TOWARDS ENGINEERING EDUCATION SUSTAINABILITY AND INDUSTRY READINESS OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS,"Engineering education is to prepare engineers for real-world challenges and seek novel solutions to cater to society's different needs. There is an increase in the global demand for industry-ready engineers. Engineering education sustainability and industry readiness are mutually inclusive, where the former is the combination of different skills and transversal competencies, while the latter is all about their applicability. Transversal competencies, transferable across disciplines, chisel engineering students to become versatile and practical on the shop floor. Sustainability in engineering education is usually discussed only from the ecological/environmental viewpoints. This paper tries to find out the relevance of transversal competencies from the perspectives of engineering students at three levels: the most recurring competencies, the competencies they lack, and the ones that need improvement. Recurring and essential transversal competencies such as problem-solving, creativity and innovation, communication, lifelong learning etc., were identified from different policy frameworks of accreditation agencies, industry reports, organizational reports, and academia. Primary data was collected from final-year engineering students for this exploratory research through semi-structured interviews. These transversal competencies, latent throughout the formative years, have a definite role in the engineer's industry readiness, making engineering education sustainable. The need for industry readiness of the engineering students indicates the sustainability of engineering education, which can bridge the gap between the industry and academia. The paper reveals opportunities for further expansion of the competency frameworks in the policymaking and accreditation procedures.","Sangwan, Devika;Venugopal, Abhijith",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani",Engineering Education ;  Lifelong Learning ;  Sustainability ;  Transversal Competencies
THE BERLIN ETHICS CERTIFICATE: CONCEPTUALIZING INTERDISCIPLINARITY AS A CORE BUILDING BLOCK OF ETHICS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,"To address the need for more responsible research and innovation, there is a growing call to integrate ethics education across the science and engineering curriculum. Accordingly, ethics education must not be limited to the avoidance of scientific misconduct but rather be oriented toward addressing the complexity of planetary challenges and realizing social good. Designing curricula to accommodate the ambition of integrated ethics, however, remains a great institutional and epistemic challenge. In this paper, we introduce the Berlin Ethics Certificate (BEC) at the Technical University of Berlin, to demonstrate how this challenge can be addressed by using interdisciplinarity as a core building block of integrated ethics education. The BECӳ unique approach to ethics education enables the positioning of ethical issues in all study programs within the university by designing future-oriented interdisciplinary courses open to all students, be they from the humanities, natural or engineering sciences. The paper outlines the BECӳ conceptualization of interdisciplinarity, ultimately arguing that interdisciplinary ethics education must be built upon the epistemic practice of situating knowledge. Methodologically, we show how the BEC approaches integrated ethics education through three iterative steps: 1) situating disciplinary knowledge in relation to other forms of knowledge, values and experiences (by focusing on multidisciplinary learning experiences), 2) establishing a common epistemic practice of collaboration (by focusing on interdisciplinary learning experiences), and 3) actively engaging with non-academic stakeholders to create responsible technology and take ethical action beyond the university (by focusing on transdisciplinary learning experiences). Examples of how the BEC implements this methodology are shown, which may serve as suggestions of best practices in integrated ethics education.","Ammon, S.;Kljagin, A.;Rettschlag, J.;Vortel, M.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin,Curriculum Development ;  Engineering Ethics ;  Integrated Ethics ;  Interdisciplinary Education ;  Situated Knowledge
"WHERE'S THE VALUE IN ENGINEERING, AND IN TEACHING IT?","New theoretical perspectives on how engineers generate economic and social value have emerged from research on engineering practice, complementing the conventional entrepreneurship emphasis on innovation and start-up enterprises. This research demonstrated, apparently for the first time, how most engineers generate significant economic value with limited if any opportunities for innovation, research and development in their work. In the absence of appropriate theory, students acquire limited understanding on the contributions they will make to society as engineers. Observations from engineering practice provide a more compelling research-based narrative that could attract a more diverse student population, and help graduates secure well-paid employment. Many engineering faculty share uneasy feelings that their students will rarely use the advanced mathematical analysis techniques taught in classes. Research explains how practice solving traditional textbook problems builds tacit knowledge that enables rapid technical decision-making in engineering practice. The research also provides insights on how typical engineering science research supports engineering practice. We argue the benefits from widely disseminating the findings presented in this paper to help faculty staff and students better understand how they will contribute to our collective future. This can help overcome current significant engineering performance shortcomings in sustainability and productivity growth without major curriculum changes.","Williams, B.;Trevelyan, J.

STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF A MAJOR ENGINEERING CURRICULUM REFORM,"As the demands of industry are evolving and new generations of students are entering universities, many engineering faculties invest time in curriculum reforms based on inspirational innovations, underpinned by engineering education research. The Faculty of Engineering Technology (FET) of KU Leuven had an additional argument to implement a huge programme reform: this faculty, hosting more than 6000 students spread across seven campuses in Flanders (Belgium), was an amalgam of different traditions and visions. Their merger into one faculty in 2013 aimed to optimize the organisation of research, education and community service. The goal of the programme reform in 2020-2021 was fourteenfold: enhancing our typical profile of (1) hands-on engineering in (2) strong interaction with the labour market and setting up (3) a technology hub with more attention to (4) multidisciplinarity, (5) professional competencies, (6) personal development & support, (7) lifelong learning and (8) challenges including (9) complex problem solving. The reform also aims to increase the (10) attractiveness and (11) social relevance of the programmes. By strengthening the internal coherence in the faculty, we can exploit the (12) multicampus narrative to offer students more choices and develop their (13) future disciplinary self, supported by (14) choice guidance. This paper describes how the curriculum was adapted in order to achieve these goals and presents the results of perception measurements organised among freshmen who followed the old programme in 2019-2020 and freshmen registered in the new programme in 2020-2021. Of foremost importance is the increased feeling that the professional competencies are essential for an engineer.","Langie, G.;Craps, S.;Van den Broeck, L.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,KU Leuven,curriculum reform ;  engineering education ;  merger ;  multicampus
"Collaborative, multidisciplinary, international, and societal relevant: A framework combining challenge-based learning and thesis writing across European universities","ECIU University is an EU-funded European University initiated by a network consisting of 13 universities across Europe. At its core is collaborative learning and research on a European level in close connection with various stakeholders to tackle societal challenges. Learners are engaged in joint project work based on the approach of challenge-based learning (CBL). Here, learners are actively involved in a real and relevant setting. Teams are composed of learners coming from different cultural backgrounds, disciplines, and levels of progress in their individual studies. A challenge within the ECIU framework starts with a “Big Idea” in the area of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 “Sustainable cities and communities” that has potential for societal impact. ECIU University offers four types of challenges that differ in length and depth. Within this paper, the first run of an ECIU Strategic Challenge, the most complex challenge type, is introduced. The Strategic Challenge is a six-month format that combines individual working phases while writing on one's master's thesis with collaborative working phases while cooperating closely in the team challenge. Hence, it offers a framework in which the progress of challenge and master's theses are expected to go hand in hand. The concept of how students collaborate in the Strategic Challenge builds up upon the Erasmus+ projects COLIBRI (Collaboration and Innovation for better, personalized, and IT-supported Teaching) and its follow up EPIC (Improving Employability through Internationalisation and Collaboration).","Stahlberg, N.;Brose, A.;Diedler, S.;Kuchta, K.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Hamburg University of Technology,Challenge-based learning ;  ECIU University ;  Sustainable Development Goal 11 ;  thesis writing
WHEN PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING BECOMES ENTREPRENEURIAL - A FACILITATOR'S VIEW ON STUDENT CHALLENGES,"Integration of entrepreneurship in current engineering education emphasises the need for engineers to initiate and drive innovation processes that transform ideas into societal value. Learnings from the history of engineering and the at times unsustainable impact of technology on society have drawn attention to user requirements and the societal context of technological innovations. In addition to this view, entrepreneurial education underlines the need to move beyond reactively addressing user requirements and societal developments to proactively creating opportunities and realising their potential to change societal patterns and trajectories. Grand challenges, such as climate change and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, have indeed confirmed the need for such abilities. This paper argues that when integrating entrepreneurship in engineering education, the pedagogical approach to how we teach entrepreneurial engineering will inevitably have to be revisited. The study aims to explore the facilitation of entrepreneurial projects in a problem-based learning (PBL) environment. Design-based research (DBR) was conducted to co-develop and test guidelines and models for entrepreneurial PBL based on existing PBL approaches. In this process, ten facilitators of entrepreneurial PBL projects were continuously challenged to change their perspective from being facilitators to students and from being practitioners to reflective practitioners. In this paper, we especially report on the part of the study investigating the following question: What challenges do students experience when PBL becomes entrepreneurial? The paper concludes with insights into the nuances of entrepreneurial PBL and closes with a short discussion on the need for more research to ensure integration and not the addition of entrepreneurship in engineering education.","Holgaard, J.

"CURRICULUM AGILITY AT FACULTY, DEPARTMENT, PROGRAM AND COURSE LEVEL","This short paper describes the first prototyping of a self-evaluation process of Curriculum Agility at a Faculty of Technology in Sweden. The process comprises guided, semi-structured, individual interviews at different organisational levels within the faculty, a joint narrative based on those interviews, prioritizing development strategies per level, and jointly mapping them on importance and implementation time. The self-evaluation is part of and based on the research on the principles of Curriculum Agility. The results show the interplay in timely curriculum change for futureproof engineering education between the teaching staff, the systems and the people who control the systems. The self-evaluation brings together the different perspectives and perceptions within the faculty and gives insight in how those affect the willingness towards and occurrence of curriculum development. This work in progress indicates how doing such a qualitative self-evaluation paves the road for transparent strategic dialogues on a holistic level about what to give attention and organize differently.","Brink, S.

Bridging Engineering and Humanities at Techno-Anthropology,"In 2022 it will be 10 years since the first students enrolled at Aalborg University’s new master program in Techno-Anthropology – an interdisciplinary program combining engineering/technical sciences and humanities/social sciences. This anniversary provides a good opportunity for reflecting on and assessing the proclaimed interdisciplinarity. Hence, this chapter discusses the practical possibilities for interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering/technical sciences on the one hand, and social sciences/humanities on the other through a concrete case study of the techno-anthropological master program at Aalborg University in Denmark. The research question addressed here is whether Techno-Anthropology is an example of a successful combination of two different epistemic cultures? To answer this, the chapter introduces the concept of boundary objects. It portrays the techno-anthropological landscape, identifies two visions for the master program and links the concept of boundary objects to the curriculum of Techno-Anthropology. The chapter concludes that the curriculum of the master program in Techno-Anthropology is a boundary object so fluid that it enables interdisciplinary collaboration between two different research groups with different visions for Techno-Anthropology. The two visions are headlined as ‘to engage technical experts and users in conversation and to translate technology-user perspectives into technical design’ and ‘to discover the complexity of technologies through online and offline ethnographic work, and to feed that understanding into technological innovation’.","Børsen, Tom",Book Series,Philosophy of Engineering and Technology,2022-01-01,Aalborg University,Boundary objects ;  Higher education ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Techno-anthropology
Research on Engineers’ Work at a Turning Point?,"According to their disciplinary perspective and their main object, engineering studies deal with engineering as a profession, describe the training, socialization, engineers’ activities, and question the specific ethical dimensions. On the French side, academic contributions to engineering studies are distributed between several fields of philosophy, history, and sociology – sociology of professions, sociology of science and technology, sociology of education. This chapter puts these different contributions into perspective to propose possible directions for further study and investigation of engineers’ work. The first part focuses on engineers as an occupational group associated with the social category of “cadres”. The second part examines engineering activities from the perspective of their heterogeneity and uncertainty. These dimensions hold an important place in the sociology of innovation and more recent research on maintenance and repair. If innovation is a specialty of sociology, maintenance and repair are not in itself. We conclude with further study and research perspectives aiming to consider engineers as crucial participants in maintaining infrastructures, communities, and society.","Colmellere, Cynthia",Book Series,Philosophy of Engineering and Technology,2022-01-01,École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay,Engineering work and occupation ;  Heterogeneity ;  Maintenance and repair ;  Uncertainty
VALUE ENGINEERING IN PRODUCT QUALITY MANAGEMENT APPLIED IN THE ENERGY EFFICIENT WOOD CONSTRUCTION,"The aim of a paper is to present value engineering as a product quality management tool in theoretical and empirical terms.

Lean Startup Practices: Operationalizing the Technological Business Planning Process in an Academic Environment,"The generation of innovation in the academic environment involves the development of technology/product, technological transfer and business, which together make up the Technological Business Planning Process (TBPP). This process can be divided into three stages: world of technology (initial stage), world of transition from technology to product and business (intermediate stage), and world of business (final stage). In this context, there is the Lean Startup (LS) methodology, which comprises a set of potential practices to facilitate the operationalization of these stages of development. However, the existing literature is incipient and lacks guidance on the LS practices with the greatest potential to contribute to each of these stages, which constitutes a theoretical gap. Thus, this research aims to identify the LS practices most used by researchers-entrepreneurs in the different stages of the Technological Business Planning Process. The methodological approach used was the case study in an important Brazilian public university. In this context, nine innovation projects in the process of generating technological business were analyzed. The results show four main contributions: i) the practices contributed mainly to the intermediate phase of the TBPP; ii) BMC and MVP were considered the most important practices to operationalize TBPP; iii) the LS practices contributed significantly to the knowledge management between team projects; and iv) the combined implementation of the practices highlighted the benefits for TBPP. This study contributes to technology innovation management in the academic environment and provides some gaps that can be developed in future works in technological projects context.","Reis, Luciana;Fernandes, June;Araújo, Márbia;Beaulieu, Martin",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2022-01-01,Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto;HEC Montréal,academic spinoffs ;  lean startup practices ;  technological business planning process ;  technology innovation management ;  technology transfer

Measuring and Validating Innovation Self-Efficacy: The Case of Business Management Students,"The research adapted an innovation self-efficacy scale that is designed for engineering students and applied it to Filipino business management college students. This paper describes the process of the adaptation, development, and determination of the representative questions per construct using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Furthermore, post hoc analyses using Levine’s test of homogeneity and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed to determine the relationships of the research variables to the demographic profiles of business students. Results show that business management students exhibit moderate degrees of self-efficacy. The measurement model shows that while Associational Thinking is the most observed trait, Observing is the most critical factor that defines what innovation self-efficacy should be. Post hoc analyses show that respondents being homogenous or heterogenous have no bearing on the ultimate effects of the demographic variables towards the main research variables. Lastly, the research was successful in confirming the entire measurement model with a contextually different dataset that can be easily deployed and combined with other scales or items of interest. Several theoretical and practical implications were presented, and some directions for future research were identified.","Relente, Andrei Raymund R.;Capistrano, Erik Paolo S.",Journal,Asia-Pacific Social Science Review,2022-01-01,University of the Philippines Diliman,Business Students ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Innovation Self-Efficacy ;  Management Students ;  Philippines

"Analysis of the Capabilities for Research, Development, and Innovation in Telecommunications Engineering Careears","International organizations notes that the main weakness for innovation in Latin American countries is that their national research organizations only evaluate and stimulate pure academic personnel by publications and citations, forgetting those who work in industry, losing a vast potential in each country. Higher education institutions must increase the development and innovation if they want to contribute to the third mission, which means the economic development of a country, in addition to the traditional advanced education and research, to adapt to new realities for the knowledge-based economies. Commercial war, SARS COV-2, and energy crisis drive policymakers and university managers to rethink and redesign institutions. This work offers an approach to measure the research, development, and innovation capabilities of three telecommunications engineering careers in three Latin American universities in Mexico and Ecuador looking for to increasing capabilities when doing collaboration. Results confirm that the knowledge contribution in engineering is proportional to the number of supported engineering careers, even mapped to national and international rankings. Also is confirmed that research is related to the academic production, but development and innovation are more related to an effective relation to industry.","Castillo-Velazquez, Jose Ignacio;Huerta, Monica Karel;Silva-Lopez, Rafaela Blanca",Conference Proceeding,"2022 IEEE ANDESCON: Technology and Innovation for Andean Industry, ANDESCON 2022",2022-01-01,"Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana-Lerma;Universidad Politécnica Salesiana, Cuenca;Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México",engineering management ;  Global-knowledge economy ;  Knowledge management ;  research innovation capability

Influence of Goal Orientation on the Innovative Behavior of Basic Research Project Members,"Strengthening basic research development is one of the important strategies for various countries. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to explore the influence path of the innovative behavior of basic research project members. Compared with ordinary innovation, basic innovation has a longer period and stronger uncertainty, so it has some special requirements for the characteristics of members engaged in such projects. Goal orientation is one of the important aspects of individual characteristics. The impact of different goal orientations on the innovation behavior and innovation performance of basic research project members needs to be examined. Based on goal orientation theory, creative self-efficacy theory and individual creative action theory, this paper studies the impact path of three goal orientations on basic research project members' innovative behavior through a questionnaire survey of 225 basic research project members. The results show that the learning goal orientation and prove goal orientation have significant positive impacts on innovation behavior, and creative self-efficacy has mediating effects between the learning/prove goal orientations and innovation behavior.","Sha, Qun;Zhang, Yali;Li, Liaoliao",Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,2022-01-01,Northwestern Polytechnical University,basic research ;  creative self-efficacy ;  goal orientation ;  innovative behavior

Individual Characteristics and Technology Adoption in Asset Management,"The railway sector in South Africa has a history of slow technology adoption, which has resulted in a lack of support from technology developers and obsolescence. As a strategy to stay current with technological trends in asset management, South Africa's railway company implemented a web-based asset management system in 2013 and a major upgrade in 2016. Despite the benefits associated with the organization's web-based asset management, the innovation has not received the expected usage and adoption. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of individual characteristics on the use of web-based asset management technology in the South African railway sector. The study targeted a population of 105 engineering practitioners in the South African railway sector who were using the web-based asset management system. Men were found to be the most frequent users of web-based asset management technology. Overall, the findings show that this technology is not widely used in the South African railway sector. Future research should attempt to investigate the underlying factors affecting the adoption of web-based asset management technology.","Makhanya, B. B.S.;Nel, H.;Pretorius, J.

Towards Self-adaptive/Reflective Co-managed Open Generativity to Augment Absorptive-multiplicative-relational Capabilities/Capacities,"With the increased popularity of open innovation (OI), we hypothesize that if the epistemology is open, harmonious, expansive, regulated with global - local metrics, positive non-reductionist co-evolutions of (eco)systems may develop. However, in line with the Capability Maturity Model, there is a need to improve absorptive, multiplicative and relational capability/capacity. As such, it is critical to develop sparks for knowledge-transfer, in diverse entrepreneurial channels and ecosystems, simulating pockets of interconnected-multi-channel conventional-augmented-metaverse realities-ecosystems. The goal of the study is to work towards sustainable investments across United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, in relation to the Information Architecture Society's 5 pillars. Requirements engineering involves reviewing literature on open innovations, generative systems, multi-disciplinary optimization, and sustainable investment. This leads to derivation of a research model. To increase capability and capacity, sustainable investing games, as reflective and analogous mediators/scaffolds are proposed. Hopefully, over time, differentiated criteria and weights can be derived, applicable across co-evolving business models and contexts, for the development of self-adaptive but co-managed socio-economic-technological generativity and sustainability.","Lee, Chien Sing;Wong, K.

Virtual and Augmented Reality Infused in AEC Ir 4.0,"Industry executives in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) business have deliberately escalated the need for precise, unambiguous, and intuitive knowledge. Industry 4.0 is of paramount importance towards the formation of a virtual logistics system in AEC that facilitates automation in manufacturing operations and acts as a link between distinct stakeholders and construction initiatives. Immersive Virtual and Augmented Reality (VAR) technologies are rolling out in many entertainment and scientific areas as consumer-based Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) become more ubiquitous. Furthermore, VAR innovations have great practical utility in the AEC industry due to improvements in Building Information Modeling (BIM). Although the AEC business has been reluctant to adopt VAR innovations in comparison to certain other sectors, mainly due to a paucity of reliable research contrasting the rise in benefits versus the unit price of deployment. This study aims to explore the dynamics of the industry in VAR technology adoption and addresses AEC strategic initiatives. Moreover, this paper discusses the VAR use cases in the AEC industry, along with its challenges and immersive VAR technology for BIM.","Ansar, Syed Anas;Arya, Swati;Agarwal, Shruti;Jaiswal, Kriti;Srivastava, Reena;Khan, Raees Ahmad",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2022 3rd International Conference on Computation, Automation and Knowledge Management, ICCAKM 2022",2022-01-01,Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University;University of Lucknow;Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology,and Construction (AEC) ;  Architecture ;  Building Information Modeling (BIM) ;  Engineering ;  Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) ;  Virtual and Augmented Reality (VAR)
Artificial Intelligence-Based Life Cycle Engineering in Industrial Production: A Systematic Literature Review,"For the last few years, cases of applying artificial intelligence (AI) to engineering activities towards sustainability have been reported. Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) provides a potential to systematically reach higher and productivity levels, owing to its holistic perspective and consideration of economic and environmental targets. To address the current gap to more systematic deployment of AI with LCE (AI-LCE) we have performed a systematic literature review emphasizing the three aspects:(1) the most prevalent AI techniques, (2) the current AI-improved LCE subfields and (3) the subfields with highly enhanced by AI. A specific set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify and select academic papers from several fields, i.e. production, logistics, marketing and supply chain and after the selection process described in the paper we ended up with 42 scientific papers. The study and analysis show that there are many AI-LCE papers addressing Sustainable Development Goals mainly addressing: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure; Sustainable Cities and Communities; and Responsible Consumption and Production. Overall, the papers give a picture of diverse AI techniques used in LCE. Production design and Maintenance and Repair are the top explored LCE subfields whereas logistics and Procurement are the least explored subareas. Research in AI-LCE is concentrated in a few dominating countries and especially countries with a strong research funding and focus on Industry 4.0; Germany is standing out with numbers of publications. The in-depth analysis of selected and relevant scientific papers are helpful in getting a more correct picture of the area which enables a more systematic approach to AI-LCE in the future.","Rahman, Hamidur;D'Cruze, Ricky Stanley;Ahmed, Mobyen Uddin;Sohlberg, Rickard;Sakao, Tomohiko;Funk, Peter",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Linköpings Universitet;Mälardalen University,Artificial intelligence ;  life cycle engineering ;  machine learning ;  sustainable development goal
CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT COMPETENCES - CASE TUAS,"The universities of applied sciences educate practically oriented experts for working life. The skills and competences needed in the future can be categorized for example as information and communication skills, thinking and problem-solving skills, and interpersonal and selfdirectional skills. The learning environments and the curricula should be designed to support the development of these skills. In this paper we present the curriculum framework developed and implemented for project-based learning in Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) faculty of Engineering and Business. By integrating project management skills into the academic curriculum, we support our students' success in the modern working life. The project learning environments used in the implementation are introduced as well. The professional project management competences have been identified and the curriculum has been developed to ensure that students are provided with the necessary skills. By describing the learning process and the learning objectives, we enable a logic and coherent learning path starting from the first year of bachelor studies and continuing to the master studies. The CDIO standards have strongly influenced on the development of the curriculum framework together with the IPMA (International Project Management Association) project management competences. IPMA's Individual Competence Baseline® is utilized in the curriculum development. The students of TUAS have a possibility to take a certification test. Achieving the certification is an international recognition of project management competence described in the Individual Competence Baseline®. For the institution students achieving the certificate is evidence that the learning outcomes are valid, and the students obtain high enough proficiency level. The presented framework has given a backbone for overall curriculum development to our faculty. The project activities (Project Hatchery, Innovation Project Capstone) have strengthened university-industry relationship and have created positive visibility to faculty.

Half-Precision Scalar Support in Kokkos and Kokkos Kernels: An Engineering Study and Experience Report,"To keep pace with the demand for innovation through scientific computing, modern scientific software development is increasingly reliant upon a rich and diverse ecosystem of software libraries and toolchains. Research software engineers (RSEs) responsible for that infrastructure perform highly integrative work, acting as a bridge between the hardware, the needs of researchers, and the software layers situated between them; relatively little, however, has been written about the role played by RSEs in that work and what support they need to thrive. To that end, we present a two-part report on the development of half-precision floating point support in the Kokkos Ecosystem. Half-precision computation is a promising strategy for increasing performance in numerical computing and is particularly attractive for emerging application areas (e.g., machine learning), but developing practicable, portable, and user-friendly abstractions is a nontrivial task. In the first half of the paper, we conduct an engineering study on the technical implementation of the Kokkos half-precision scalar feature and showcase experimental results; in the second half, we offer an experience report on the challenges and lessons learned during feature development by the first author. We hope our study provides a holistic view on scientific library development and surfaces opportunities for future studies into effective strategies for RSEs engaged in such work.","Harvey, Evan;Milewicz, Reed;Trott, Christian;Berger-Vergiat, Luc;Rajamanickam, Siva",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on e-Science, eScience 2022",2022-01-01,"Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico",floating-point arithmetic ;  research software engineering ;  scientific computing ;  software libraries
Strategies for Improving the Ability of Innovation and Entrepreneurship of College Students Majoring in Food Science and Engineering for Universities in Ethnic Region —Taking Yanbian Universtiy as An Example,"Innovation and entrepreneurship are being widely promoted and made popular as new job strategies for university graduates to relieve the pressure of employment. Colleges and universities in ethnically diverse places are significant components of higher education institutions in our nation and offer special advantages for instructing in innovation and entrepreneurship due to their national cultures. As a result, educating university students from many ethnic backgrounds about innovation and entrepreneurship has become crucial and integral to our nation's innovation and entrepreneurship strategy. This paper proposes strategies to enhance the innovation and entrepreneurship capacity of university graduate students in ethnic minority areas combing with the research and analysis of the innovation and entrepreneurship capacity of university graduate students majoring in food science and engineering in the college of agriculture, Yanbian university. These strategies includ: Improving the comprehensive quality and awareness of innovation and entrepreneurship capacity of university graduate students in ethnically diverse areas, strengthening teaching staff of innovation and entrepreneurship in minority areas and also completing the curriculum system of innovation and entrepreneurship education as well as socially responsible support policies.","Guo, Zhijun;Lü, Meng;Lü, Lei;Cui, Chengbi",Journal,Science and Technology of Food Industry,2022-01-01,Yanbian University,college students ;  food science and engineering ;  innovation and entrepreneurship ability ;  promotion strategy ;  universities in ethnic region
I.FAST and EURO-LABS Perfect Legacy of ARIES,"CERN hosted on May 2-6, 2022, the first annual meeting of the H2020 I.FAST project to support innovation in the field of science and technology of particle accelerators. The project has a completely different character from its predecessors in this area of research. It was approved for implementation a year ago by the EC with the highest marks. It is worth looking at why projects such as ARIES, I.FAST and EURO-LABS are so easily accepted. This alleged ease of acceptance is an appearance. Behind the acceptance, in conditions of extremely tough competition, is the excellent organization of the submitting community that has been developed over the years, as well as the perfect, well-thought-out preparation of the material. The author, a participant in the ARIES and other EC projects in the field of particle accelerator science and technology, presents here, on specific examples, his subjective opinions on how to prepare materials for high-output projects for the EC FP. The author hopes that these remarks may be useful in the process of submitting research projects from Poland in international cooperation to the EC in the best possible way. The science and technology of particle accelerators is an excellent area of showing such examples because it is interdisciplinary and includes the following components: building of research infrastructure, applied physics, mechatronics, materials engineering, automation and robotics, electronics, ICT, innovation, cooperation with industry, and social.","Romaniuk, Ryszard S.",Journal,International Journal of Electronics and Telecommunications,2022-01-01,Politechnika Warszawska,EC Innovation Pilot projects ;  H2020 projects ;  particle accelerator science and technology
Global perspective and African outlook on additive manufacturing research - an overview,"Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and advances made globally in medicine, construction, aerospace, and energy sectors are discussed. The paper further explores the current state of AM innovation and development landscape in Africa as a late comer to this area of smart manufacturing. Peer-reviewed and published literature were retrieved from Scopus database from 2005 to 2021 and analysed. In Africa, out of 500 published articles, South Africa has the highest research throughput, whereas about two-thirds of the continent is not actively participating in this burgeoning field. The main AM techniques most widely used are selective laser melting, fused deposition modelling, and direct energy deposition. Globally, there is an interplay of computational (machine learning and mechanistic models) and experimental approaches to understanding the physical metallurgy of AM techniques and processes. Though this trend is consistent with global practices, Africa lags the world in AM technologies, a niche that could leapfrog the manufacturing sector. Thus, Africa need to foster collaborative partnership within and globally to become an active global player in this industry.","Klenam, Desmond Edem Primus;Bamisaye, Olufemi Sylvester;Williams, Iyanu Emmanuel;Van Der Merwe, Josias Willem;Bodunrin, Michael Oluwatosin",Journal,Manufacturing Review,2022-01-01,"School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering;University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg;Air Force Institute of Technology",3D printing ;  Additive manufacturing ;  Africa ;  Research throughput
Development of Digital Module 'Phymology' on Optical Instruments,"One of the technological innovations in the 21st century that can be applied in the learning process is the use of digital-based instructional media. While, the learning media in the form of digital modules is still relatively little used in learning physics in schools. This study aims to produce learning media in the form of a digital module 'Phymology' on optical instrument material. This research uses Research and Development (R&D) research methods and is based on the ADDIE development model. The ADDIE development model has five stages, namely the analysis stage, the design stage, the development stage, the implementation stage and the evaluation stage. The digital module in this optical instrument material was developed in the PBL (Problem Based Learning) stage and contains STEM aspects, namely science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The final result of the development of a digital module for this optical instrument material is an android application with an apk format that can be downloaded via the Google Play Store and then installed on the student's smartphone device.","Arnida, N.

Equitable and Resilient Infrastructure Investments,"Communities across the United States are subject to ever-increasing human suffering and financial impacts of disasters caused by extreme weather events and other natural hazards amplified in frequency and intensity by climate change. While media coverage sometimes paints these disasters as affecting rich and poor alike and suggests that natural disasters do not discriminate, the reality is that they do. There have been decades of discriminatory policies, practices, and embedded bias within infrastructure planning processes. Among the source of these policies and practices are the agencies that promote resilience and provide hazard mitigation and recovery services, and the funding mechanisms they employ. These practices have resulted in low-income communities, often predominantly Indigenous people and communities of color, bearing a disproportionate share of the social, economic, health, and environmental burdens caused by extreme weather and other natural disasters. At the request of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Resilient America Program of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened the Committee on Applied Research Topics for Hazard Mitigation and Resilience to assist the FEMA in reducing the immense human and financial toll of disasters caused by natural hazards and other large-scale emergencies. FEMA asked the committee to identify applied research topics, information, and expertise that can inform action and collaborative priorities within the natural hazard mitigation and resilience fields. This report explores equitable and infrastructure investments for natural hazard mitigation and resilience, focusing on: partnerships for equitable infrastructure development; systemic change toward resilient and equitable infrastructure investment; and innovations in finance and financial analysis.",,Book,Equitable and Resilient Infrastructure Investments,2022-01-01,,
Study on Coordinated Development of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area,"The development of scientific research in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is unbalanced and inadequate, and its contribution to technological innovation is insufficient to meet the huge demand for industrial innovation in the Greater Bay Area. This paper tries to clarify the coordination relationship between scientific research and industrial innovation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area since 1997 by constructing the scientific research-industrial innovation coordination data sets, correlation index and relative development index for ten industries in the area. This paper analyzes the evolution and interaction rules of scientific research and industrial innovation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and puts forward corresponding countermeasures. The research found that scientific research and industrial innovation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area showed an overall upward trend while the coordinating level varies from industry to industry. Among the ten industries analyzed in this paper, communication technology and integrated circuit have reached a high level of coordination; marine engineering equipment is still in the primary coordination stage; and other industries are at a good level of coordination. The scale advantage and competitive advantage of scientific research are dynamic for the improvement of coordination level, which suggests that we should combine the scale effect and competitive advantage of innovation, pay high attention to originality and leadership, and strive to form the special and preponderant advantage of regional scientific research.","Wang, Yun;Yang, Yu;Liu, Yi",Journal,Bulletin of Chinese Academy of Sciences,2022-01-01,"Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;University of International Business and Economics;Institute of Strategy Research for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area",coordination ;  Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area ;  scientific research ;  technological innovation
Influence of Scott pine seed size on the quality of seedlings produced,"The creation of highly productive forests should be based on the use of high quality seedlings. Those machines and technologies that have been used for cleaning and subsequent sorting of coniferous seeds with their subsequent sowing in the nursery do not fully provide the forestry complex with good-quality planting material. The reason for this is the use of seeds of unsorted fractions in nurseries, the failure to observe conditions during sowing that ensure the amicable emergence of seedlings and conditions in the sowing rows for the normal development of plants, excluding their large mortality and obtaining non-standard seedlings. It should be noted that modern requirements for silvicultural production largely depend on the quality of planting material. Seedlings obtained by growing them without overshooting give a high silvicultural effect if they meet the intended purpose of the cultivated area, have biometric parameters determined by GOST, which make it possible to grow high-quality planting material without overshooting in two growing seasons. The use of innovations in the restoration of forest landscapes is necessary for the cooperation of engineers and researchers. The integration of scientific and technical research and engineering design contributes to the speedy achievement of stringent environmental requirements for vehicle engines and tools. Obtaining high-quality seed is possible while maintaining the sowing qualities of seeds, reducing the degree of injury and treatment cycles, reducing losses during processing and sowing in the nursery. Based on this, there is a need to develop a device for sorting seeds of coniferous species, which will ensure the quality and efficiency of the technological process, as well as obtaining high-quality seed material in a minimum number of processing cycles.","Knyazev, A.

A Feature Engineering and Ensemble Learning Based Approach for Repeated Buyers Prediction,"The global e-commerce market is growing at a rapid pace, but the percentage of repeat buyers is low. According to Tmall, the repurchase rate is only 6.1%, while research shows that a 5% increase in the repurchase rate can lead to a 25% to 95% increase in profit. To increase the repurchase rate, merchants need to predict potential repeat buyers and convert them into repurchasers. Therefore, it is necessary to predict repeat buyers. In this paper we build a prediction model of repeat purchasers using Tmall’s dataset. First, we build high-quality feature engineering for e-commerce scenarios by manual construction and algorithmic selection. We introduce the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm to solve the data imbalance problem and improve prediction performance. Then we train classical classifiers including factorization machine and logistic regression, and ensemble learning classifiers including extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine machines. Finally, we construct a two-layer fusion model based on the Stacking algorithm to further enhance prediction performance. The results show that through a series of innovations such as data imbalance processing, feature engineering, and fusion models, the model area under curve (AUC) value is improved by 0.01161. Our findings provide important implications for managing e-commerce platforms and the platform merchants.","Zhang, M.;Lu, J.;Ma, N.;Cheng, T.

Nanomaterial Assisted Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting,"Sustainable scientific innovations hold key to a progressive world in its true sense. Steeping high energy demands and lack of universal presence of resources gravitates the need to generate alternate fuel sources to sustain human life in the near future. Splitting water over heterogeneous nanocatalysts to generate hydrogen offers an economic, green, and fairly easy replacement for clean fuel production. As conventional and one of the most sought photoelectrodes, semiconductor nanomaterials forms an integral part of PEC evolution and the prelude of this chapter. This section details semiconductor-based photoelectrode research progress over the last decade, the role of befitting optical and electronic tunability, bandgap engineering, morphology control, and high surface of these nanomaterials which make them an ideal photoelectrode material. Efficiency of light to fuel conversion predominately depends on photon absorption and the magnitude of interfacial charge transfer (ICT). While highlighting the strategies for increasing photon absorption the course of this chapter follows to focus on the role of morphology of the nanomaterial as it dictates surface area, charge separation, transportation, and mobility. In continuation, advances towards functionalizing photomaterials for making them responsive to visible light, with emphasis on harvesting solar light are cited. The chapter briefly also mentions the more recent findings on peculiar photocatalysts such as molybdenum disulphide, oxy-nitrides, and graphene based. Lastly, contemporary challenges and opportunities in the field are summarized.","Juneja, Subhavna;Bhattacharya, Jaydeep",Book Series,Materials Horizons: From Nature to Nanomaterials,2022-01-01,Jawaharlal Nehru University,
GETTING INEQUALITY RIGHT: A ZUNZIAN PERSPECTIVE ON THE REFORMULATION OF THE AMERICAN PROMISE,"This essay draws on Zunz’s major works to show how the reformulation of the American Promise between, roughly, 1870 and 1960 established a new relationship between inequality and solidarity. I argue that Zunz’s analysis demonstrates that the emerging white-collar middle class responded to the crises of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries with three cultural innovations— recodifying status, engineering social harmony, and formalizing voluntarism—intended to reconcile the country to the inequalities of urban-industrial life. Through the construction of corporate bureaucracies, the development of “human engineering,” and the creation of the nonprofit sector, members of the new middle class attempted, with considerable success, to get inequality “right” by adapting their traditional expectations about inequality to new institutional circumstances. By linking large-scale changes to the agency of a specific social group, Zunz’s contributions to historical research illuminate how the American Century emerged from historical circumstances and why it has fallen apart.","Revell, Keith D.",Journal,Tocqueville Review,2022-01-01,,
Research on Adversarial Patch Attack Defense Method for Traffic Sign Detection,"Accurate and stable traffic sign detection is a key technology to achieve L3 driving automation, and its performance has been significantly improved by the development of deep learning technology in recent years. However, the current traffic sign detection has inadequate difficulty resisting anti-attack ability and even does not have basic defense capability. To solve this critical issue, an adversarial patch attack defense model IYOLO-TS is proposed in this paper. The main innovation is to simulate the conditions of traffic signs being partially damaged, obscured or maliciously modified in real world by training the attack patches, and then add the attacked classes in the last layer of the YOLOv2 which are corresponding to the original detection categories, and finally the attack patch obtained from the training is used to complete the adversarial training of the detection model. The attack patch is obtained by first using RP2 algorithm to attack the detection model and then training on the blank patch. In order to verify the defense effective of the proposed IYOLO-TS model, we constructed a patch dataset LISA-Mask containing 50 different mask generation patches of 33000 sheets, and then training dataset by combining LISA and LISA-Mask datasets. The experiment results show that the mAP of the proposed IYOLO-TS is up to 98.12%. Compared with YOLOv2, it improved the defense ability against patch attacks and has the real-time detection ability. It can be considered that the proposed method has strong practicality and achieves a tradeoff between design complexity and efficiency.","Zhang, Yanjing;Cui, Jianming;Liu, Ming",Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2022-01-01,Chang'an University;National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China,Adversarial patch attack ;  Deep learning ;  Traffic sign detection

BIM and the future of architecture teaching,"Innovations offered by digital technologies to architecture, civil engineering and construction can significantly alter professional practices. Among the alternatives, BIM (Building Information Modeling) can accelerate the design management through a process based on the interoperability, leading architects, and engineers to work collaboratively. Since 2007, there was a huge increase on research related to BIM possibilities. However, the rapid pace of research has not been accompanied by the necessary changes in the curriculum of architecture and civil engineering undergraduate courses. In Brazil, Decree No. 9,983 of 2019 stablished the basis for BIM's National Strategy, starting initiatives to leverage actions promoting gains in productivity and competitiveness in the civil construction sector. This paper presents the results of a research that aims to analyses the potential of BIM Domain Model Uses as an alternative to stablish a pathway for including BIM in architecture undergraduate teaching process. A case study has been conducted in two phases: the analysis of the current curriculum of the architecture undergraduate course of a Brazilian Faculty and the analysis of the new curriculum recently approved by the institution. Preliminary result allows to identify alternatives to include BIM since the first periods of the course, increasing gradually in complexity until the capstone project. Among the aspects to be considered, the adoption of a collaborative teaching process is the most important. However, the mindsets and attitudes need to change to fully take advantage of BIM potentialities in architecture teaching.","Salgado, M.

Offsite Construction: Reflection is Simply Not Good Enough - We Need a New Prism!,"This paper reflects on the recurrent challenges facing Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC), noting that slow incremental changes have only just stated to address efficiency and product delivery systems underpinning its value proposition. Whilst these challenges embrace many areas, from quality through to waste and concomitant carbon footprint initiatives; the challenge here is ""why have other sectors out-performed AEC in many of these areas?"". Acknowledging this, the work presented here challenges the industry to re-think its position, advocating the use of a new 'prism' - one which highlights new opportunities for exploitation, rather than re-examining parochial 'traditional' approaches. The rationalisation underpinning this treatise rests on the need for AEC to transition towards Industry 4.0. This work presents findings from three case study construction organisations based in Turkey. The foci concentrated on the use and application Offsite Construction (OSC) concepts, addressing the specific technology-related needs to transition to Industry 4.0. This is particularly important given the need for organisations to not only unlock their digital potential to improve performance and capability, but also leverage better value throughout the whole process. Emphasis was therefore placed on this transformative 'journey' using agility as the main prism. Research findings highlight the need to step back from adopting conventional thinking and linear approaches, to ones which help actuate evidenced-based levers for change: from conceptualising, embedding, implementing and diffusing new technology per se (into existing business systems and processes); but also embrace the macro, meso and micro drivers associated with the skills and people involved in the delivery of these products and services. In doing so, the paper presents a number of agility-driven innovation and exploitation opportunities, from Additive Manufacturing through to Distributed Ledgers and new data-centric logistic platforms.","Ezcan, V.;Goulding, J.

Digital Twin based built environment asset management services development,"The Digital Twin (DT) concept emerged recently in the Architecture, Engineering, Constructions and Operations domain and the interest for digital built asset management service implementations is increasing. However, most of the applications are developed according to custom approaches, preventing the generalisation and modularisation. This article presents a methodological framework for DT-based applications development. DT-based applications support effective data-centric processes in the management of critical assets. The proposed approach is based on a flexible and federated data model, enabling dynamic data management. The federated data model provides an interface and connection among different knowledge domains. The service requirement definition provides the input specification for the application development, accomplished through the modelling of three fundamental components: data, processes, and algorithms. These components are assembled through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), supporting the DT-based services. The proposed approach is applied to the West Cambridge DT research facility and tested in the building energy sub-metering strategy. The developed approach allows flexible and interoperable data-centric applications development, contributing to the generalisation and scalability of DT-based built asset management applications. This aims at providing a consistent approach that can be employed in different domains, where the DT technologies play a central role in service innovation.","Moretti, N.;Xie, X.;Merino Garcia, J.;Chang, J.;Kumar Parlikad, A.",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2022-01-01,Department of Engineering;University of Cambridge,
Hybrid Competencies Model for Managing Innovation Projects,"Today, many organizations often face the problem of selecting rational necessary methodologies for an effective program, portfolio and project management. As a rule, in specific unique conditions for the implementation of programs and projects, it is difficult for organization methodologists to choose a methodology ""suitable"" for the goals and scope of the functional coverage of projects from the methodologies presented on the global ""market"". If applying systematically approaches the problem of creating a methodology, then it is obvious that a ""boxed"" product in such a situation cannot be ideally suited, since this product was developed for certain application conditions that do not coincide with the specifics of the organization. This problem sets the task for project management methodologists to either adapt the ""box"" methodology or develop their own, for the specifics of the projects of this organization, under the conditions in which it operates. Considering management methodology as the language of effective stakeholder interaction, the importance of using classical methodologies is a priority. A sound project management methodology will guide the project manager through a controlled, manageable and visible set of activities to achieve project results. However, the development of a new qualitative methodology is a very costly undertaking that requires highly qualified methodological resources, versatile professional experience, time, etc. In professional cases, when solving this problem, managers-methodologists follow the path of adapting existing methodologies. Adaptation of methodologies can go with the use of convergence and/or hybridization.","Verenych, Olena;Wolff, Carsten;Bushuyev, Sergiy;Bondar, Olena;Voitenko, Oleksandr",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2022-01-01,Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture;Technische Universität Dortmund,competencies ;  hybrid model ;  information technology ;  Innovation project ;  managing projects
"The “resilience” concept: definitions, interpretations, research approaches and schools of thought","The aim of this article is to review definitions of “resilience”, including regional and urban resilience, as well as to describe the interpretations of the terms. An effort is also made to identify the approaches taken to strengthen resilience in practice, as well as research approaches. Relevant literature is reviewed, and schools of thoughts regarding adaptability are also indicated. The review of the definitions of resilience shows how many emphasise the existence of external threats which it is first and foremost important for socio-ecological systems to withstand, before being in a position to mitigate effects, adapt to new circumstances, and also undergo transformation. Only less often is attention paid to internal factors that may lead to disturbances, but also favour or force reorganisation of a system. Newer definitions also highlight component elements of systems, such as individuals, households and communities; while highlighting issues of social inclusion. Notions of regional resilience most often relate to the economy, while definitions of urban resilience more often invoke urban functions and systems (including infrastructure aimed at preventing negative natural phenomena), as well as covering social issues. The literature in essence offers three distinguishable interpretations in resilience studies. These are important insofar as the acceptance of the appropriate one determines further research procedure, and even conclusions as to what is or is not a resilient system. It is engineering resilience, ecological resilience and evolutionary resilience that can be identified. Initially, it was the engineering-related interpretation that dominated in resilience research, even as today use is often made of a systemic approach referring to the interpretation of evolutionary (adaptive ) resilience . O n th e othe r hand , transformation al abilit ies are more and more often indicated as features of key importance to the building of resilient socio-ecological systems. Review of the literature on resilience shows that, among the approaches of practical value to its strengthening it is possible to distinguish such approaches as those involving disaster risk reduction, climate-change adaptation, social-ecological aspects, complex adaptive systems, livelihood, and agencies and institutions. Among the research approaches taken to the concept of resilience, it is possible to distinguish the equilibrium-related, systems perspectives, path dependence and the long view. And where schools of thought are concerned, there is a human capital agglomeration view; and industrial structure, economic variety and innovation approach considered along with the application of digital technologies in smart cities; and a third school putting the emphasis on institutions.","Masik, Grzegorz",Journal,Przeglad Geograficzny,2022-01-01,Uniwersytet Gdański,definitions ;  interpretations ;  re-gion ;  research approaches ;  research review ;  resilience ;  schools of thought ;  town and city

The advent of sequencing technologies and transgenic techniques represents a quantum leap in orchid research, enabling molecular approaches to be employed to resolve the historically interesting puzzles in orchid basic and applied biology. To date, 16 different orchid genomes covering four subfamilies (Apostasioideae, Vanilloideae, Epidendroideae, and Orchidoideae) have been released. These genome projects have given rise to massive data that greatly empowers the studies pertaining to key innovations and evolutionary mechanisms for the breadth of orchid species. The extensive exploration of transcriptomics, comparative genomics, and recent advances in gene engineering have linked important traits of orchids with a multiplicity of gene families and their regulating networks, providing great potential for genetic enhancement and improvement. In this review, we summarize the progress and achievement in fundamental research and industrialized application of orchids with a particular focus on molecular tools, and make future prospects of orchid molecular breeding and post-genomic research, providing a comprehensive assemblage of state of the art knowledge in orchid research and industrialization.","Zhang, Diyang;Zhao, Xue Wei;Li, Yuan Yuan;Ke, Shi Jie;Yin, Wei Lun;Lan, Siren;Liu, Zhong Jian",Journal,Horticulture Research,2022-01-01,Beijing Forestry University;Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University,

Robotic Swarm for Marine and Submarine Missions: Challenges and Perspectives,"Underwater exploration and monitoring are particularly challenging for the absence of GPS, limited communications, high hydrodynamic pressure and harsh environmental conditions. Autonomous swarms of underwater robots can play a crucial role for missions such as wide area underwater exploration, environmental monitoring and inspection of existing engineering infrastructures, like oil and gas, and archaeological or historical sites, given their properties of scalability, robustness, flexibility, adaptability, enlarged perception and tasks' parallelization. Driven by the need to understand the state of art and develop new solutions within the realization of a new swarm of underwater fishes1, we provide here a critical review of past and current projects of underwater swarms, focusing on sensors, mission tasks, algorithms, simulation environments and real life proofs of concept. Moreover, we analyze the research directions that can improve the impact of autonomous underwater swarms on environmental preservation and marine sustainable development, also considering the limiting factors imposed on these prospects.1This work is part of a new project 'Heterogeneous Swarm of Underwater Autonomous Vehicles' funded by the Technology Innovation Institute and developed with Khalifa University, UAE","Luvisutto, Alberto;Shehhi, Aaesha Al;Mankovskii, Nikita;Renda, Federico;Stefanini, Cesare;De Masi, Giulia",Conference Proceeding,"2022 IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Symposium, AUV 2022",2022-01-01,Technology Innovation Institute;Khalifa University of Science and Technology;Sant'Anna Scuola Universitaria Superiore Pisa,multivehicle system ;  swarm robotics ;  underwater robotics

PRESTRESSED GEOPOLYMER CONCRETE BRIDGE WITH 100% SECUNDARY AGGREGATES,"In order to reduce the environmental impact of construction, contractors are looking for alternatives to cement based materials. An innovation trajectory has been completed based on the chain collaboration. Based on the chain approach, this project has gone through an innovation trajectory with a duration of 9 months from idea to realization of an in situ post-tensioned geopolymer concrete bridge with aggregates of thermally cleaned tar-containing asphalt granulate. The obtained environmental benefit turned out to be approximately 75%. Two major aspects are presented, process-related and technical related. An answer is given to the question of how an innovative sustainable alternative for cement based mixtures can be developed and actually applied in the practice of an already accepted building project without lead times of decades. Within a lead time of only 9 months, a program has been completed which has led to the realisation of a proven structurally safe in situ prestressed geopolymer concrete bridge. Based on the development of a new geopolymer concrete mixture, primarily aimed at achieving the required strength class and workability, a large experimental campaign has been carried out at Delft University of Technology and other laboratory. Focus was on the structural behaviour of the geopolymer concrete regarding bending, shear and cracking behaviour. This research was carried out on 24 beams of different sizes, reinforcement configurations and mixtures, combined with testing of compressive and tensile strength, young’s modulus, creep behaviour and a multitude of material aspects to prove a 100 year service life of the bridge. The innovation currently applied on the bridge can potentially be widely applied within civil engineering projects.","van der Ham, Herbert;Janssen, Tim",Conference Proceeding,fib Symposium,2022-01-01,Delft University of Technology;Nobleo B&I;Boskalis,bridge ;  chain collaboration ;  geopolymer ;  in situ ;  prestressing ;  secondary aggregates
Challenge-based learning during the pandemic for engineering courses based on competencies,"Full Paper; Innovate Practice. Challenge-based learning has been a key component of Tecnologico de Monterrey's Tec21 disruptive educational model, which focuses on the development of competencies through working on a solution to a real-life, ad-hoc challenge. A brief description of the previous Tec20 and current Tec21 models is presented. The first part of this work presents a comparison of four Tec21 physics courses with 185 students working face-to-face and 205 students working online. The average challenge report score was 5% higher for the online courses than for the face-to-face courses. This difference was significant at a = 0.05 level through t-tests. Closer monitoring by the instructor to achieve course objectives or less rigorous course evaluation policies might have favored the online courses. The second part of this research compares the average grades of the Tec21 model vs. the Tec20 model, based on traditional Problem-Based Learning (PBL). A comparison of Tec20 PBL reports (372 students) and Tec21 Challenge reports (205 students) taking Electricity and Magnetism courses is presented. Average report grades were 3-7% higher for the Tec21 model than for the Tec20 model. The Tec21 model contains promising features, but a more rigorous evaluation approach is suggested.","Robledo-Rella, Victor;Neri, Luis;Garcia-Castelan, Rosa M.G.;Gonzalez-Nucamendi, Andres;Noguez, Julieta",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Challenge-Based learning ;  Educational Innovation ;  Higher Education ;  Online courses ;  Pandemic
Designing and implementing an AI education program for learners with diverse background at scale,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents an AI Education program. In January 2021 MIT entered into an agreement with the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to design and offer a new educational research program focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) training. The goal of this collaboration is to design and advance educational research activities that promote maximum learning outcomes at scale for learners with diverse roles and educational backgrounds, ranging from Air Force and DoD personnel to the general public. This program is expected to offer different learning tracks addressing different groups of USAF employees based on their unique professional needs and backgrounds. The first pilot is currently underway and will provide the research team with data and insights that will inform the next iteration of the program, with the ultimate goal of formulating recommendations for the USAF and general public on how to reach large numbers of learners at scale in an optimum way. Currently, the program offers three different learning journeys for each of three different cohorts of USAF employees (i.e., leaders, developers, and users). These learning journeys span from online asynchronous and synchronous courses to in-person activities. Our research goals focus on exploring and understanding the learner experience via the study and analysis of AI content and curriculum, pedagogical approaches, learning modalities, and technological innovations to deliver learning experiences at scale. Key research activities involve evaluating a range of existing digital AI courses, mapping out the landscape of educational needs and competencies, and developing and piloting experiential learning experiences (to advance innovative technology-enabled training and learning technologies and methods). This paper discusses how preliminary research findings from this first pilot are informing the design and implementation of the next program iteration. The research provides insights that will benefit AI learners across the US while supporting the DoD's objective to develop elite and world-class AI-ready services.","Salazar-Gomez, Andres F.;Bagiati, Aikaterini;Minicucci, Nicholas;Kennedy, Kathleen D.;Du, Xiaoxue;Breazeal, Cynthia",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,AI education ;  competency development ;  curriculum development ;  diverse learners ;  scalable education
An Approach to Measure Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fostering of a Curriculum by Using ABET Assessment Data,"This Research-to-Practice Full-Paper attempts to provide a quantitative method to measure a curriculum's inherent innovation and entrepreneurship through available assessment data. This paper builds on our previous works relating systems thinking and design methodology to innovation and entrepreneurship. In this work, we try to reduce the complexity associated with innovation by presenting it as a function of ""innovativeness""characteristics. This approach will use the student outcome assessment data compiled for the ABET accreditation process and obtain a measure of the innovativeness and entrepreneurship of the curriculum. The proposed scheme also reveals the usefulness of the data beyond the accreditation process. Given the nature of the collected data, the proposed approach cannot be used to compare programs, and it is only a self-assessment indicator. The paper contains examples that show complete innovation and entrepreneurship calculations for an engineering program. Institutions can use the proposed approach to further assess their curriculum's effectiveness and identify the necessary changes to advance innovation and entrepreneurship.","Azemi, Asad",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,University of Wisconsin-Platteville,ABET ;  Assessment ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation

"Reimagining faculty, student and community interactions in capstone: A synthesis of liberative pedagogies, citizen engineering and human-centered design","In this work-in-progress research-to-practice paper we present a newly integrated set of lenses for creating a senior capstone design course. Our future graduates face several concurrent challenges including both the increasing complexity of technology and rapid pace of innovations, and growing expectations of what engineers design will address in terms of technical and social considerations from users, stakeholders and other communities. Moreover, there are intensifying calls to address equity and inclusiveness across fields of engineering. This work proposes to begin addressing these challenges through a new pedagogical framework that synthesizes three lenses: liberative pedagogies, citizen engineering, and human-centered design and applies this synthesis to capstone design. We specifically focus this pedagogical framework on capstone design given its centrality to preparing students for engineering practice. We review literature on capstone design and summarize each lens. We then discuss our pedagogical design approach for integrating the lenses and present an integrated framework. Our results detail our learning and teaching objectives and assessments we developed from this integrated framework. Finally, we discuss critical reflections on our approach and future challenges we see before concluding.","Schimpf, Corey;Swenson, Jessica",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York",citizen engineering ;  human-centered design ;  liberative pedagogies ;  senior capstone
Characterizing students' subcultures in engineering and their alignment with the adoption of the Freeform pedagogical system,"This research-to-practice full paper investigates the alignment of a specific pedagogical innovation, the Freeform pedagogical system, with the student culture(s) of the mechanical engineering department of a small private college (SPC) in the upper Midwest of the United States, we ask the research question: What are the defining characteristics of the student culture or (sub)cultures in the engineering department where the Freeform system is being propagated? Based upon interviews with on-campus stakeholders (students, faculty, and staff), we constructed a 64-item survey to characterize the culture of their engineering department. We analyzed student responses using the cultural consensus theory model (CCT), a quantitative method that looks for patterns of responses to cultural statements. Grouped together, these patterns of responses indicate the values of the sub-cultures present within a participant group. Our results indicate that the best fitting model contains two student subcultures: student subculture 1 (SC1) (n = 15) and student subculture 2 (SC2) (n = 60). These two subcultures exhibit differences across a handful of items that focus on the student experience and in particular the sense of connectedness or belonging among students. Members of SC1 seem to be disconnected from both their peers and their instructors, work primarily alone, and seem to struggle to obtain access to academic assistance. SC1 members also feel overworked with (what they perceive to be) low-value-added activities, and they do not perceive alignment between how instructors teach and how they prefer to learn. In contrast, members of SC2 seem to be aligned with the institutional mission, which focuses on faculty-student relationships and learning in the community.","Dridi, Mohamed Aziz;Berger, Edward;Rhoads, Jeffrey F.;Deboer, Jennifer",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,Purdue University,Innovation propagation ;  student cultures
"Application of Outcome-Based Education Framework for the ""Design Workshop"" Course in Emerging Engineering Education","This Research to Practice Full Paper, implementing the outcome-based education (OBE) approach, introduces a new pedagogical framework in the ""Design Workshop""course for undergraduate students, strengthening and improving student learning outcomes, and theoretical and practical abilities. ""Emerging Engineering Education""(3E) requires a project-based learning method, transforming traditional knowledge-based education into an innovation-based education mode. However, lots of factors, such as project resources, sites, funds, cooperatives, and so on, limit the project-based learning of engineering majors (Architecture, Urban and Rural Planning, Landscape Architecture). Therefore, the establishment and improvement of the corresponding course system are essential. The ""Design Workshop""course, offered by the School of Architecture at Tianjin University (TJU) takes specific projects as the carrier to integrate diverse knowledge, improve students' overall abilities, and offer a solution to the concerns mentioned above. The purpose of the article is to provide a framework for the ""Design Workshop""courses, based on OBE. The course addresses the design and practice learning teaching method. The skills needed for graduation are determined based on industry demands. The task list and course teaching methods are adapted to the skills needed for graduation. The ""Design Workshop""course is offered in the third year because the main prerequisite courses have already been completed, and the core competency refers to the most intensive knowledge and tasks, besides the students will have the flexibility to be engaged in the industry. The teaching experience emphasizes the importance of a multi-level course support mechanism and the systematic nature of each support component. It was found, that the educational system focuses on competency rather than the outcome, according to the abilities it can be. Students freely meet the actual project requirements and the specific design tasks as the standards, based on the design process and the final design outputs to derive the knowledge to be learned. The ability requirements and specific tasks determine the course system, giving rise to normative thinking. Taking everything into account, students can improve their abilities through ""construction and building"", ""full life cycle support and management"", ""stakeholder coordination"", and ""activities and public occasions' preparation"". Consequently, students will be more likely to adapt to the changing industry demands. Based on this, the establishment of the ""Design Workshop""course framework provides an effective and new way to nurture emerging engineering undergraduate talents.","Hu, Yike;Grigoryan, Sara;Ullah, Nadeem;Ding, Mengyue",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,Tianjin University,Ability ;  Course Framework ;  Design Workshop ;  Industry Demand ;  Outcome-Based Education
Gamification for Teaching Sustainability to Engineering Students,"This innovative practice full paper describes sustainability teaching through game-based activities in engineering classrooms for potentially enhancing student interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Meta-analytic research indeed supports that gamification enhances student learning by increasing engagement and motivation, promoting goal setting behaviors and supporting the need for recognition. While there is a high scope for utilizing game-based tools to help students connect with global sustainability challenges, literature reflects a scarcity of such innovative pedagogical tools in engineering education. To tackle this challenge, we introduced interactive game-based modules to teach sustainability within two different education cultural contexts - one in the U.S. as a part of a Honours course at a large public university, and one in India, as a part of the first year engineering curriculum at a small private university.To broaden the outlook of engineering students towards sustainability, our game-based activity learning outcomes for students were to: 1) contextualize sustainability and its importance in contemporary global issues 2) recognize how Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could be interrelated, 3) explain how change in entropy and our actions can affect sustainability. To facilitate these broad learning outcomes, we developed two interactive gamified activities and implemented them online (due to COVID-based shift to instruction) in two different engineering institutions. This innovation article reports the design of two gamified activities used to teach sustainability, and studies its impact on student learning outcomes through SDT framework of motivation and thematic analysis of student reflections. We used surveys and minute paper to record student perceptions which were analyzed thematically. Results indicated that students enjoyed these games, saw value in peer learning, and simultaneously developed a deeper, more contextual understanding of sustainability by perceiving the interconnections between SDGs and ways in which entropy through their everyday actions influence sustainability.","Jain, Ridhima;Joshi, Rucha;Dwivedi, Vishesh;Senthil Kumar, G.;Badami, Vikas",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,Plaksha University;Madiee Games Pvt.

Which skills? A critical perspective on the skills facilitating the transfer of third-cycle students to knowledge-intensive SMEs,"This Research Full Paper relates to public-private innovation ecosystems. This loosely knit form of cooperation allows for beneficial activities such as knowledge transfer, dissemination of novel technology, and recruitment. In these contexts students graduating from third-cycle education should be able to find opportunities for transferring to knowledge-intensive positions in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).(/p)()pHowever, a 3-year study of the reasons why firms approach public organisations within a Europe-wide, public-private innovation ecosystem suggests that students might struggle to find such opportunities. Through a questionnaire provided to all firms approaching the ecosystem we identify recruitment as one of their lowest ranked interests. By interviewing members of the public organisations found in the ecosystem we identify how cooperation is initiated and maintained, and how this influences the opportunities for students to transfer into industry. The results provide nuance to the current emphasis in skill development within third-cycle (engineering) education. It is rarely recognized that fostering technical skill and academic entrepreneurship might not be enough to allow all types and sizes of firms to receive engineering students.Particularly, this study identifies the academic and industrial boundary spanning roles at knowledge-intensive SMEs as important. These roles require a third-cycle education that early on hones skills that typically do not become critical until much later for students that pursue an academic path - e.g., the inter-organisational project management skills necessary to effectively seek research funding or to negotiate goal alignment between organisations. We argue that to allow third-cycle students to practice the finer points of such skills, universities need to evolve more distributed support structures for innovation that integrate in-depth engineering knowledge with innovation skills and have an increased focus on human and social capital.","Asplund, Fredrik;Magnusson, Mats;Torngren, Martin;Vahlne, Tobias;Karlsson, Martin",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH);Northvolt Revolt AB,

Finally, this paper discusses the research status of bridge structural damage identification and health status assessment. Although some progress has been made, there are still many difficulties to be overcome for practical engineering applications. Through the introduction of the above practical engineering application cases, it is hoped to provide some guidance for the research of bridge health monitoring and intelligent detection.","Li, Zhen;Zhang, Baile",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2022 International Conference on Machine Learning, Cloud Computing and Intelligent Mining, MLCCIM 2022",2022-01-01,"Chongqing Jian Feng Industrial Group Co., Ltd",bridge health monitoring ;  damage identification ;  intelligent detection ;  IOT ;  low-power consumption wireless sensor ;  routing of UAV detection ;  UAV
Development and evaluation of a classroom activity to promote integration of engineering with other academic disciplines,"This innovative practice full paper assesses an engineering classroom activity featuring integration. Engineers are a part of a broad community that contributes to the rapidly changing and growing technological innovations demanding contributions from multiple branches of engineering and academic disciplines. Therefore, the ability to recognize and understand interdisciplinary connections between engineering and all academic disciplines is critical for students' academic success and professional preparedness. There is a need to develop novel classroom activities that enable students to recognize such connections. To that end, the objective of this research was to (a) develop a hands-on, student-led, classroom activity that can help students make interdisciplinary connections and (b) assess the impact of the activity on students' perception about the interdisciplinary connections. A two-session classroom activity was designed in which students worked in teams and mapped different areas of study within mechanical engineering (ME) as well as seven non-engineering academic disciplines (NEAD) to real world, complex technological innovations such as virtual reality goggles, drones, and 3D printers. During the activity, active learning tools such as concept maps and jigsaw method were utilized. A total of 49 sophomore, ME students from a four-year university participated in the activity and associated assessments. All students participated in two surveys administered at the beginning and end of the activity to rate their motivation and excitement towards ME areas of study and seven NEAD, and their believed level of importance and relevance of the ME areas of study and NEAD to product development. The quantitative data analysis showed statistically significant increases in multiple survey items, showing an overall success of the activity in increasing students' awareness of connections within and outside of engineering. The lack of changes in some survey items guide us towards areas and topics that need improvement to teach the relevance and integration of all disciplines to students. In future, these quantitative findings will be coupled with qualitative data from students' retrospective reflection on the activity, student focus group, faculty interviews, student learning assessments and students' concept maps to optimize the activity, assess student learning and finalize assessment instruments so the activity can be widely adopted by educators.","Hall, Olivia;Seth, Deeksha",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,Villanova University College of Engineering,Active learning ;  Curricular-design ;  Engineering design ;  Integration ;  Interdisciplinary
Reflective practitioners through design: Perspectives of second-year engineering undergraduate students,"Full Research Paper - Engineering students experience a wide range of learning practices through technical and analytical thinking and a process of reflection is needed to support them with their meaning-making process. In this study, we analyzed students' perceptions on the role of empathy in human-centered design thinking processes. The reflection assignment took on a learning community pedagogical approach which can help students gain nuanced and deeper understanding of empathy. By situating the design experience within a community of peers, there are increased opportunities for norming and exchange, shared strategies and resources, and a sense of collective progress. We explored how the diversity in the dispositions and experiences of students played a unique and major role in framing and shaping design problems and perspective-taking. This paper reports the findings through a qualitative content analysis of reflective essays written by students in a sophomore engineering design course offered in two semesters. Through such assignments, instructors and curriculum integrators can understand the different ways their students are experiencing the curriculum.","Khan, Rubaina;Asare, Philip;Romkey, Lisa;Slotta Ontario, James D.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,University of Toronto,curriculum innovation ;  empathy ;  engineering design ;  learning communities ;  reflective practice
Perception from the professors' point of view in the remote teaching of Software Testing using active methodologies during the Covid-19 pandemic,"This Research Full Paper presents an analysis of the perception of research professors of Software Engineering on the use and difficulties in the context of developing classrooms with teaching strategies using active methodologies remotely. In recent years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, professors have been facing several challenges to keep students engaged, motivated and learning. The active teaching methodologies that have been collaborating in recent years in the teaching and learning process of students, needed to adapt to the remote teaching class scenario that was implemented in several universities. This research measured the point of view of four professors, who are also researchers in computing education, about how their classes behaved in the last two years of the Software Testing subject in a graduate program at a Brazilian federal university. So that computing students have a way to obtain knowledge in a more practical way so that there is a decrease in the difficulty of students adapting to the job market. Professors are increasingly adopting active methodologies, group work and practical teaching approaches in order for students to acquire skills that will be decisive for their professional future. In view of the existing pandemic scenario and the need to adapt teaching plans for remote teaching, this paper sought to identify the perceptions that professors had, whether in the difficulties of adapting activities, adapting teaching plans to difficulties in keeping students attentive and motivated in the content that was being passed on. The objective of this work is to identify and discuss professors' perceptions about the use of active teaching methodologies using remote teaching in a software testing subject of a graduate class at a Brazilian federal university. It was also analyzed how the professors dealt with the issue of student motivation and engagement at that time. An analysis of the teaching plan of the software testing subject of the last two years of the graduate program in computing at a Brazilian federal university was carried out and each of the methodologies with the perception of the professors who participated in these subjects. The collection of these data was carried out by means of an interview with the four professors, the feedback from the students of the classes on each of the adopted methodologies was also analyzed and a triangulation of the data obtained was performed. The results indicate that there were great difficulties in adapting active methodologies from the point of view of the professors, however most of these challenges were overcome in the their views. It was also pointed out that certain methodologies and practices work better if the learning is done in an evolutionary way and that takes into account the students' previous knowledge about contents, tools and practices that the professors want to use. Thus, this paper aims to present an overview of professors' perspectives on the teaching of a computing subject that needs practical approaches using active methodologies in an emergency situation of remote teaching.","Elgrably, Isaac Souza;Ronaldo Bezerra Oliveira, Sandro",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,Universidade Federal do Pará,activities methodologies ;  educational innovation ;  remote teaching ;  software testing
Developing Skills for Industry 4.0: Challenges and Opportunities in Engineering Education,"This Research to Practice Work in Progress Paper focuses on the Education 4.0 Framework, based on built-in skill development mechanisms and innovative learning pedagogies related to Active Learning approaches. Practicing engineers are increasingly expected to act as boundary spanners who manage and participate in diverse interdisciplinary global teams, leverage cultural differences, and draw on expert knowledge from multiple fields and specialities to translate competing stakeholders' needs into practical design solutions. This demand for a holistic type of engineer stems from the requirements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: engineers who assume the role of leaders can integrate knowledge and work seamlessly across intellectual, social, and cultural challenges. Our exploratory study aims to identify the implications for practice, challenges, and opportunities in Higher Education. More specifically, we look at two engineering programs of two universities, one located in Mexico and the other in the United States of America. Both universities have implemented massive Experiential and Challenge-Based Learning efforts with industry and external organizations as educational partners to immerse students in real-life contexts. The methodology used was qualitative-experimental, involved more than 120 students, and included a post-test for skills assessment with different instruments such as rubrics, questionnaires, interviews, and surveys. The preliminary findings of this work-in-progress study reveal that the role of Higher Education professors in the training of future engineering professionals within the Education 4.0 Framework has different degrees of complexity related to the cross-border nature of educational innovation, that requires the commitment and alignment of multiple actors: students, professors, organizations, and industry.","Caratozzolo, Patricia;Lara-Prieto, Vianney;Martinez-Leon, Cecilia;Rodriguez-Ruiz, Jorge;Ponce, Roberto;Vazquez-Villegas, Patricia;Membrillo-Hernandez, Jorge",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2022-01-01,School of Engineering and Applied Sciences;Tecnológico de Monterrey,education 4.0 skills ;  educational innovation ;  higher Education ;  industry 4.0 ;  STEM education
Towards a multi-faceted framework for planning and evaluating innovation in Engineering Education,"For universities, educational change at institutional level is a slow process [1], [2]. To keep up with societal and technological advancement, education innovation project leaders at universities need practical guidelines and procedures in place that will enable sustainable and scalable innovation that can meet the needs of industry as we transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 [3]. To develop such guidelines and procedures, we need to conduct socially responsible, evidence-based educational research [4]. This paper is part of a larger study during which we will conceptualize the planning and evaluation of innovation in engineering education at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). From this conceptualization, a framework for planning and evaluation of education innovation will emerge. The data collection process will take place in six phases: (1) Exploration of the problem (2) feasibility studies; (3) conceptualization and development of the framework; (4) piloting of the framework and its associated processes; (5) field study; and lastly, (6) evaluation of the framework.

Additive Manufacturing and Printing Approaches for the Development of Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms with Improved Biopharmaceutical Attributes,"The pharmaceutical industry is moving towards the future and is witnessing innovation in drug development through the introduction of personalized medicine technologies. Instead of adapting the dose thata patient needs, they were adapted to the manufacturer’s dose. Nowpatient-specific or customized dosing methods and dosing combinations have superior persistence to the standard mass-produced drugs. Printing technology has gained interest during the last few years to manufacture personalized dosage forms. For manufacturing personalized drug products, three-dimensional printing (3DP) has expanded to the pharmaceutical industry. With the approval of the first 3DP product, an unprecedented opportunity for discovering new compounds and technologies has arisen. This article has re-evaluated various printing technology and theirutilization in personalized medicines. Further, we also discussed its history, advantages, challenges and differenttypes of printing technologies with advantages and limitations, particularly in the area of pharmaceutical research.","Kawish, Syed M.;Sharma, Shwetakshi;Almalki, Waleed H.;Alghamdi, Saad;Afzal, Obaid;Kazmi, Imran;Altamimi, Abdulmalik S.A.;Al-Abbasi, Fahad A.;Beg, Sarwar;Ahmad, Farhan J.",Journal,Current Drug Metabolism,2022-01-01,Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University;Jamia Hamdard;Umm Al-Qura University;King Abdulaziz University,3D printing ;  Additive manufacturing ;  computer aided software ;  inkjet based printing ;  laser-based printing ;  nozzle based printing ;  personalized medicines
New challenges for women workers in Brazil facing the wave of Industry 4.0 technologies,"This paper aims to understand how women’s work tends to be particularly affected by the new wave of Industry 4.0 technologies in Brazil and how public policies could actuate to reduce work gender inequalities throughout this process. We examine the 20 largest occupations for women and cross-check with estimates of automation for the Brazilian labour market from previous studies. We also analyse the women’s insertion in professional fields that have great growth potential. Among the main occupations, we identify a dual trend with high automation chance for jobs that require low or no qualifications and are low paid, and low displacement probability for caring-related professions. Furthermore, even though in Brazil women have higher education levels than men, they are under-represented in STEM (Sciences, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) areas. We point out that the main challenges for Brazil include the lack of investment in innovation and that gender-aware policies should be designed to overcome structural barriers and guarantee an equal insertion of women and men. Paid parental leave, equal pay for equal work, and public health and education services are essential to overcome inequalities based on traditional gender roles. Unemployment insurance, financial support, and incentives for qualification and requalification, as well as gender parity in educational and research institutions, are key for women to have full involvement in this new digital economy.","von Dietrich, Priscila;Garcia, Mariana Hansen",Journal,Gender and Development,2022-01-01,Universidade Estadual de Campinas,Brazilian labour market ;  gender inequalities ;  Industry 4.0
Problems and Perspectives of ICT in Higher Education Institutions of Kazakhstan,"Contemporary teaching, learning and assessment processes involve more information and communication technologies. The main goal of using information technologies in the educational process is to improve the quality of education by individualization and strengthening intellectual capabilities of students in the information society. This research considered the information communication technology use in higher education institutions of Kazakhstan, exploring its benefits for students and suggesting possible solutions for the problems arising with ICT implementation. For the purpose of this paper a small fragment of students' survey out of the ongoing research project was used. 558 students from various Kazakh universities were surveyed. One of the questions concerned IT development and digitalization level of the universities, because it enhances students' inclination for innovation and entrepreneurship. According to survey results forty three percent of students think that their universities have been sufficiently digitalized. Other forty percent remained neutral, and seventeen percent complained about the ICT equipment, which means that universities should address this issue to remain competitive. The research contributes to previous studies by focusing on students' attitudes toward ICT implementation. It describes both advantages and disadvantages of the ICT in education, and tries to summarize the current conditions of Kazakhstani higher education. For the successful policy implementation, the suggestions should come from the bottom. Therefore, the students' hands-on knowledge and experience with ICT implementation should be taken into consideration and could be helpful for further integration into educational process.","Andekina, Regina;Anartayeva, Aizhan",Conference Proceeding,"SIST 2022 - 2022 International Conference on Smart Information Systems and Technologies, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Turan-Astana University;Satbayev University,entrepreneurial universities ;  higher education ;  information communication technologies ;  teaching and learning
Innovations of Enterprises with Chinese Capital in Poland. LiuGong Dressta Machinery - case study,"Modern-day innovations have become a base requirement of civilization progress, a determinant of the socio-economic development of each country or region, as well as the basis for the competitiveness and development of economic entities or organizations. Research on enterprise innovation in Poland shows inadequate engagement in this type of activity, which results in a poor assessment in innovation rankings, both in the EU and in the whole world alike. At the same time, statistics indicate that enterprises with foreign capital that operate in Poland are characterized by a greater propensity to pursue innovative activities. Amongst the many economies of the world, which have achieved tremendous progress in the recent years, both in terms of economic development and an increase in the level of innovation, China is commonly indicated as allocating more and more funds to R&D, while raising the quality and innovation of its production. Account taken of the above, the research problem undertaken by the authors consists in seeking an answer to the question whether the high level of innovative activity recorded in the Chinese economy translates in any way to the innovation of Chinese capital invested in Poland. In view of this, the aim of the research comprises taking an attempt to answer the following research questions: do enterprises that operate in Poland on the basis of Chinese capital conduct innovative activities and how is it directed? This paper discusses the preliminary results of research on the indicated issues, which were carried out by means of a diverse methodology, including, in addition to a critical analysis of the literature, in-depth interviews with experts in the field of China's economic policy and Polish-Chinese cooperation, as well as an analysis of a case study in a selected economic entity with Chinese capital operating in Poland. The results prove that the examined Chinese capital invested in Poland undertakes innovative activity and treats it as a strategic element of development, as evidenced not only by the implementation of specific types of innovations, but also by the pursue of R&D activities in Poland. For the sake of completeness of the situation regarding the activity of Chinese capital in the field of innovative activities carried out in Poland, it is required to expand and deepen the scope of research by extending the subjective scope of companies from other sectors of the economy, identifying determinants that shape innovation of this type of investment, or analysis of Chinese business models capital invested in Poland.","Janasz, Krzysztof;Nowak, Dariusz;Piotrowska, Katarzyna;Wisniewska, Joanna",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2022-01-01,Uniwersytet Szczecinski;Poznań University of Economics and Business;Digital Hunters Katarzyna Piotrowska,Chinese investments in Poland ;  enterprise ;  innovation
Scenario-based Requirements Engineering for Complex Smart City Projects,"Various stakeholders with different backgrounds are involved in Smart City projects. These stake-holders define the project goals, e.g., based on participative approaches, market research or innovation management processes. To realize these goals often complex technical solutions must be designed and implemented. In practice, however, it is difficult to synchronize the technical design and implementation phase with the definition of moving Smart City goals. We hypothesize that this is due to a lack of a 'common language' for the different stakeholder groups and the technical disciplines. We address this problem with scenario-based requirements engineering techniques. In particular, we use scenarios at different levels of abstraction and formalization that are connected end-to-end by appropriate methods and tools. This enables fast feedback loops to iteratively align technical requirements, stakeholder expectations, and Smart City goals. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a case study with different industry partners.","Wiecher, Carsten;Tendyra, Philipp;Wolff, Carsten",Conference Proceeding,"2022 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit, E-TEMS 2022 - Conference Proceedings",2022-01-01,Fachhochschule Dortmund,Innovation Management ;  Project Management ;  Requirements Engineering ;  Systems Engineering
Business Process Web-based Platform for Multi modeling and Distributed Simulation,"Businesses and organizations constantly strive to improve their business processes (BPs). One of the critical components of creating effective BPs is the stakeholders' participation in BP management and improvement initiatives through modeling and simulation methodologies, which aim to minimize conflicts, promote innovation, boost ownership, and promote inclusive decision-making. To bridge the gap between the worlds of BP modeling and simulation, this study highlights the current development of concepts, methodologies, and tools. This article will provide an overview of recent research and suggest a method for extending Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) models with Business Process Simulation Interchange Standard (BPSIM) and converting them into simulation models for Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) based on a metamodel.

APPLICATION OF DETAIL DESIGN DATA OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN PROJECT CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF DIGITIZATION,"Building Information Modeling theory has been more and more welcome all over the world, and has been introduced into nuclear power industry. The so-called 'smart power station' being established by many nuclear power enterprises is the embodiment of BIM. With the deepening of digital design and application, the design data has become more and more detailed and accurate, to support all design work such as data exchange between systems and software, automatic drafting, automatic material and working counting, and so on. In addition to design, how should the procurement, construction, installation and power station operation engineers use these data to improve their work efficiency and accuracy is a research topic, which has been highly followed by engineering companies at present. At the same time, the design data is more for design itself. Whether its expression form, depth and breadth can meet the requirements of downstream engineers and how to improve efficiently when they are not satisfied is an important issue that all project participants should pay attention to. This paper gives a sketch of 3D design data, with pipework as an example, to elaborate how to use design data to help other engineers to break down old-style of working mode, and gives some thinking about optimizing design data efficiently to fulfill the requirement of other project participants.","Huang, Huizhen;Tian, Licheng;Yan, Jiafu",Conference Proceeding,"International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, Proceedings, ICONE",2022-01-01,"China Nuclear Power Engineering Co.,Ltd.",BIM ;  data flow ;  innovation of construction and operation ;  project information management system

A concise approach to designing an intelligent welding station system platform,"In the twenty-first century, the progressive rise of the intelligent industry has resulted in new manufacturing products and strategies to address industrial problems and new physical systems such as IoT, AI, and cyber systems. These systems are primarily concerned with iteratively improving quality by refining products and testing operations. The rise of Industry 4.0 is associated with primary research endeavours that consider genuine computerized systems, the internet of things, massive data, and human-made mental aptitude. We created a brilliant intelligent welding station framework using Industry 4.0 framework execution and dynamic advances, ongoing observation, and framework control. The stage directs the execution of a solid welding framework requiring minimal work and employing the most recent industry innovations. The results presented above are useful in learning to use RAMI 4.0, also known as the Reference Architecture Model Industry. In addition, smart welding was introduced. New techniques and inventive innovations are highlighted. The reference model is also used to connect the framework to critical engineering. It is a planned stage for an intelligent welding station framework based on five layers and three stages of reference model creation. These features enable the producer to monitor activity and control frameworks to improve execution by implementing successful, effective, and adaptable creation strategies. As a result, Industry 4.0 continues to compel the manufacturing sector to employ innovative manufacturing frameworks to address organizational issues. Finally, we can improve an intelligent welding framework’s efficiency and use it for assembling tasks where we have critical assembling resources. Lastly, smart welding is being thought about to improve the framework’s execution and control system and to show the challenges of smart welding by a reference model to help with site-specific design.","Saicharan, K.;Sai, M.

Next-generation battery technology based on solid-state electrolytes,"Advanced energy storage technology, including lithium–ion batteries (LIBs), applies to a broad range of devices from consumer electronics, such as smartphones and laptops, to large-scale energy applications including microgrids and electric vehicles. Low-cost, long-term electrochemical performance, and high energy density make LIBs promising for storing energy harnessed from renewable sources. Conventional LIBs with liquid electrolytes are unsafe due to the potential formation of short circuits, fire, and explosions. In addition, conventional batteries are approaching theoretical limits for storage capacity, preventing their deployment in emerging applications. On the contrary to batteries with liquid electrolytes, solid-state batteries are considered promising and have attracted significant attention from academia to industry due to their safety, mechanical strength, and high energy density offered by lithium metal anodes. Next-generation solid-state battery technologies will require innovations in many interdisciplinary areas, such as materials science & engineering and electrochemistry. The key historical development of solid-state electrolytes, associated technical challenges, and potential strategies toward the next-generation safer and high-energy-density solid-state batteries are discussed. Furthermore, important details regarding the battery performance defined by material properties and the roadmap for future research focused on various types of solid-state batteries are provided.","Baniya, Abiral;Pathak, Rajesh;Norris, Beau;Li, Hansheng;Rozyyev, Vepa;Elam, Jeffrey W.;Qiao, Quinn",Book,Green Sustainable Process for Chemical and Environmental Engineering and Science: Solid-State Energy Storage - a Path to Environmental Sustainability,2022-01-01,College of Engineering and Computer Science;Argonne National Laboratory,Battery safety ;  Energy storage technology ;  Interfaces ;  Lithium batteries ;  Lithium dendrite formation ;  Lithium–ion conductivity ;  Solid-state batteries
"Analysis of the study subject in Science, Technology and Innovation","Objective of this article is to demonstrate the theoretical inconsistency that exists between science, technology and innovation with the theoretical model on which it is based, because it does not have a fully defined study subject. A qualitative, exploratory research of the specialized bibliography was carried out. It was found that both history and philosophy state that science, technology and innovation represent a greater reality than technology transfer, that existing models generate development only when they are applied in the countries that represent their reality. It is concluded that there is a need to define the study subject of science, technology and innovation so that the technology transfer model is subordinated to it.","Del Carpio Ramos, Hilda Angelica;Del Carpio Ramos, Pedro Antonio;Garcia-Penalvo, Francisco Jose;Ninaquispe, Jose Carlos Montes;Morales, Valicha Cuadra;Del Carpio Hernandez, Sergio Rafael B.",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - JICV 2022: 12th International Conference on Virtual Campus,2022-01-01,Universidad Tecnológica del Perú;Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo;Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo;Universidad de Salamanca,Historical context ;  Philosophical framework ;  Research and development ;  Science ;  Study Subject ;  technology and innovation ;  Technology transfer

"Challenges, Potentials and Success Factors in Automotive HMI Concept Development in the Early Phase in the Model of PGE – Product Generation Engineering","The importance of UX is widely recognized by product developers among automotive OEMs. A distinctive UX shaping the brand is an important goal in the development of a new product generation. Trends such as advancing digitalization and connectivity of products open up numerous innovation potentials for UX developers. This contribution focuses on in-vehicle UX in terms of designing interactions between the vehicle and the user. In academia, theories and models to explain the phenomenon of user experience are widespread. Furthermore, numerous research approaches in the field of engineering sciences pursue the goal of making user experience measurable and evaluable. However, in the course of our literature review, we found that there is currently a lack of tools and methods that support product developers in eliciting user needs and subsequently synthesizing concepts. For this purpose, particularly the early phase of product development offers required creative freedom. However, this phase is also characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. These circumstances raise the question of which challenges product developers face when designing interactions. This paper aims to contribute to this question through a two-step descriptive analysis in cooperation with a leading German automotive group. Based on a literature review, challenges and strategic potentials were first discussed with UX experts in a workshop (n=11). From these results, a total of 28 hypotheses were derived, which were then evaluated in a second step in an online survey (n=45) by a broad set of experts. Subsequently, the challenges identified in this way were translated into four qualitative success factors to provide product developers with concrete recommendations for action. Additionally, a total of seven requirements were extracted from these factors to help product development research close the identified research gap in further prescriptive studies.","Hünemeyer, Sebastian;Reichelt, Florian;Rapp, Simon;Albers, Albert;Maier, Thomas",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of NordDesign 2022: How Product and Manufacturing Design Enable Sustainable Companies and Societies,2022-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Universität Stuttgart,Automotive UX ;  Challenges ;  Early Phase of Product Development ;  Interaction Design ;  Methods ;  PGE – Product Generation Engineering ;  Success Factors ;  User Experience
Promoting open research by adapting proprietary hardware to open-source software,"Physiological sensors can give valuable information about the human response when interacting with engineering products or systems, which is essential for engineers to know when developing new innovations. Observing multiple physiological reactions to the same stimuli will help researchers gain a better understanding of how the human body responds. However, there is limited availability of multimodal physiological sensor setups. This article presents an approach utilizing the open-source distribution Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) which records, synchronizes, and exports high-quality data from multiple sensory measures. The challenge is to adapt proprietary hardware to utilize LSL, as most sensors are pre-programmed to interact with their own software. The aim is to reduce the cost associated with subscriptions to proprietary software, by switching to the open-source alternative which promotes higher quality, greater reliability, greater flexibility, and lower cost. The article presents a case where the proprietary sensors, electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) provided by Shimmer, adapt to the LSL network. Given the multidisciplinary aspect of the case both Wayfaring, Extreme Programming (XP), and Scrum were used as development methodologies. A description is provided of the software architecture for collecting data from the two Shimmer sensors and how the signals are transmitted to the LSL network. In addition, the article encourages the use of open-source resources and discusses the benefits that open research brings. Open research offers similar potential as open-source development in terms of rapidity and innovation. The advantage of allowing researchers to benefit from other researchers’ findings and results leads to advances that would not have been possible in a closed, or proprietary, environment. In light of the insights acquired in the development process, questions regarding companies’ attitudes toward open research are addressed. Moreover, the article adds to the field of open research by broadening the possibilities for experimental setups facilitating the acquisition of new knowledge.","Bartnes, Cathrine;Ockernahl, Agnes;Dybvik, Henrikke;Steinert, Martin",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of NordDesign 2022: How Product and Manufacturing Design Enable Sustainable Companies and Societies,2022-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,LSL ;  Multimodal experiments ;  Open research ;  Open-source ;  Physiology sensors
Review of Evolutionary Approaches in Design Research to Support PGE - Product Generation Engineering,"In industrial practice, products are developed in generations. Innovation success with complex technical systems can only be achieved economically and with manageable risk by using existing solutions as references. These references come from predecessors, competitors, and even industry-external products or concepts from research. The model of PGE – Product Generation Engineering describes these relationships. In design research, multiple approaches such as TRIZ, technical inheritance, and evolution trees use analogies between biological evolution and product development to make knowledge from past product generations usable. The aim of this contribution is to analyze the potential of an evolutionary perspective on PGE to support product developers to develop products with high innovation potential. We first analyzed the analogies between biological evolution and innovation in the context of PGE. We then collected and clustered existing evolutionary approaches. In the next step, we evaluated the extent to which the analogies between biological evolution and PGE are already being used in the approaches from the state of the art. The existing approaches do not offer a complete evolutionary view so far. References are in some form core of the majority of the approaches but the linkage with variation operations and the influence of contextual factors are not consistently considered or explained. Existing approaches support developers in solving specific technical problems. What they do not offer is a fundamental theoretical understanding of the innovation success of products along the lines of the theory of evolution in biology and the latest results in the field of PGE. Further empirical research based on an evolutionary perspective on the model of PGE could explain relationships between innovation pressure from changing context factors and variation activities. This potential is based on the hypothesis that the evolution of technical systems can be formally described analogously to biological evolution by reference-based variation operators in the sense of PGE influenced by changing context factors.","Pfaff, Felix;Kempf, Sebastian;Rapp, Simon;Albers, Albert",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of NordDesign 2022: How Product and Manufacturing Design Enable Sustainable Companies and Societies,2022-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie,Design Research ;  Engineering Design ;  Evolutionary Design ;  Product Generation Engineering ;  TRIZ
The S.A.F.E. project: an interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach to innovation in Furniture Design,"The S.A.F.E. project is an industrial research project whose objective was the design and prototyping of furniture for schools and offices capable of transforming themselves into intelligent systems of passive and ""life-saving"" protection of people during an earthquake, integrating technical-scientific knowledge and skills as those of Industrial Design, Structural Engineering, Computer Science and Chemistry and facilitating a process of cross-fertilization of the know-how of companies belonging to very different sectors, such as that of Wood-Furniture and that of ICT and IoT. During an earthquake, furniture and mobile equipment become obstacles that aggravate the dangerous conditions and often cause death, or, on the contrary, they behave, in a completely casual way, as a protection of life in the event of collapses. This different behavior of the furniture depends above all on how they are designed and built. The design of “anti-seismic” and intelligent furniture systems, developed for public contexts (schools and offices) in highly dangerous areas, could be an alternative and integrative solution, to the seismic adaptation of buildings, for the protection of people's lives during earthquakes. The challenge of the S.A.F.E. was to innovate the design of traditional furniture for schools and offices from a structural perspective, transforming them into intelligent systems for the protection of life, which facilitate detection, localization, and rescue of survivors under the rubble during an earthquake. The paper describes the main results of the S.A.F.E. project, focusing on the methodological relevance of a systemic, interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach to innovation to be able to manage both projects and complex research problems, and accelerate the processes of transfer and cross-fertilization of knowledge and know-how, in a collaborative model between universities and companies.","Pietroni, Lucia;Mascitti, Jacopo;Galloppo, Daniele",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of NordDesign 2022: How Product and Manufacturing Design Enable Sustainable Companies and Societies,2022-01-01,Università degli Studi di Camerino,design for safety ;  design thinking ;  design-driven innovation ;  life-saving furniture
"'ART EXPERIENCES' AS DISRUPTIVE IMPULSE, AND MENTORING FOR NEW DESIGN ENGINEERING EDUCATION STRATEGIES","This research study questions the significance of understanding what it means to create the change by design in context of today's knowledge and self-management, and also to advanced design engineering education. Needless to say, holistic, sustainable and humanity-centred education begins as early on at preschool. In the future, a central interest of 'good design' is to ensure that the planet 'profits,' by utilising a variety of 'art of languages' in an interlinked way: The synergy of an art pedagogical + design didactical approach in schools and at universities, not only manifests collaborative designing across the generations; it is also giving rise to a revaluation of fine arts and the multi-level benefit of art and design, e.g., core factor in supporting self-belief as training element of mentoring culture, which supports Initial Teacher Education (ITE) systems of design teachers, which calls for you to trust your intuition to develop an excellent 'personal intelligence.' To train the trainer with embodiment, will focus on three key factors: - teaching various design methods, - developing the fundamental self and knowledge management of individual and digital systems, - including (cross)cultural education. The 'trainer' and her/his concept of leadership count. Design didactic knowledge and 'motivation to act-instruments,' these experiences, are part of the best students' education for next design engineering mentor.","Wachs, Marina Elena",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Disrupt, Innovate, Regenerate and Transform, E and PDE 2022",2022-01-01,Fachhochschule Münster - Abteilung Steinfurt,Design didactic & art pedagogical education ;  Initial Teacher Education + intuition ;  innovation by disruption with art experiences ;  mentoring as part of design engineering education ;  motivation to act - instruments
EXPLORING & DESIGNING IN THE CONTEXT OF SEARCH AND RESCUE,"In the face of extreme weather and terrain, Search and Rescue (SAR) volunteers face a growing challenge of rapid changes in environmental conditions. This demands that rescuers manage layered demands to prevent accidents and save lives. The volunteer-based work of ICE-SAR (Icelandic Association for Search and Rescue) is constantly balancing risks and rewards with each operation. With a community of 5000+ volunteers, their'workforce' compares to the marine industry, energy sector and tourism companies in Iceland. With scale, they can be involved in research and development of technical personal protective equipment (PPE). Their circumstances are valued for beta-testing equipment in different rescue specialty group trainings, including mountain rescue, marine rescue and technical teams. In the SAR context design, engineering and technology transfer happen in real-time. Designing for complex systems calls for the right know-how and creativity, coupled with extensive knowledge, practice and field testing. Industry partners contribute further expertise, funding and equipment. This paper presents an innovative model for design and engineering education with lessons learned from an innovative Technology Transfer Design Sprint that took place simultaneously in-the-field, in studio and online. Bringing user-centred design to this context with “risk-familiar users” resulted in a vibrant opportunity for hybrid (soft/hard) design education. Introducing students to these users, who are trained to deal with unknowns and high-risk situations, can engage and prepare them to design inclusive, relevant and resilient solutions. Rapid and risk-receptive design processes are needed for adapting to the demand of SAR users, or better said: its “rescuesers”.","Christianen, Susan;Fairburn, Sue",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Disrupt, Innovate, Regenerate and Transform, E and PDE 2022",2022-01-01,Kwantlen Polytechnic University;Technology Transfer Office,design innovation ;  Extreme environments ;  personal protective equipment (PPE) ;  risk ;  search & rescue ;  technical apparel ;  technology transfer
"USE OF DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS, DESIGN THINKING, AND DATA SCIENCE IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE","Precision agriculture was born with the massive introduction of GPS at the beginning of this century and consists of the use of technology to obtain data, its statistical treatment, and decision-making. At the Tecnologico de Monterrey experimental agriculture centre, precision agriculture has been implemented to obtain better sowing techniques and to optimise resources; this information has served the farmers of the Bajío region to improve their harvests. The use of satellites to obtain sensitive information, in addition with technological innovation such as the use of sensors and drones, provides a large amount of information that requires the implementation of design techniques. First, it is necessary to build databases and later, through the design of experiments and design thinking, to elaborate the statistical experiments in which the appropriate parameters will be obtained to maximise the production of agricultural products with the highest nutritional value and quality. Nowadays, supported with data science, design of experiments, and precision agriculture the present research is the base for future works applying these concepts in order to contribute to the development of Mexican agriculture.

Can Smart City Construction Promote the Level of Public Services? Quantitative Evidence From China,"Effectively improving the level of public services (PSL) has long been a key topic of concern in theoretical and practical circles. A smart city is a real product of the high integration of digital technology and urban governance, which has a close theoretical correlation with PSL, but there is no academic research to quantitatively verify the relationship between the two. To bridge this research gap, this study empirically analyzes the relationship between smart city construction and PSL by constructing panel data of 212 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2018 using the difference-in-difference (DID) model. The baseline regression finds that smart city construction significantly improves PSL during the sample period. Among them, smart city construction improved the quality of education and medical services (EAM) by approximately 5.18% and the level of social life security (SLS) by approximately 4.04%. This result holds after performing the robustness test. The mechanism analysis revealed that smart city construction has a significant positive impact on PSL through informational, technological, and economic effects. The above study examines the policy effects of smart city construction and provides a course of action to optimize PSL. The study suggests that the public service effects of smart city construction can be further improved by transforming the urban governance model and establishing a systematic technological innovation mechanism.","Zhou, Mingxing;Liu, Huiting;Wang, Zicheng",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Hunan Agricultural University,economic growth ;  informatization ;  public service level ;  Smart city ;  technological innovation

PROJECT BASED LEARNING IN THE CONTEXT OF CUTTING-EDGE ROBOTICS COMPETITION,"RoboMaster is an annual robotics competition pitting student's cutting edge robot designs in a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) gamified shoot-out battle. The highly technical-advanced competition rules are designed to encourage innovation in robotics automation and intelligent systems while placing robot battles at centre-stage. It manages to display the beauty of engineering technology and popularize robotics to the wider audience by balancing technical challenge and entertainment value. Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) sees RoboMaster as a unique platform for promoting STEM to the wider university student body. Through 4 years of team development and student participations, we have homegrown a group of outstanding scientific and technological engineers who have excelled in both academic research and entrepreneurial ventures. In this paper we review the development, growth and success of the 4 years of the HKUST RoboMaster ENTERPRIZE team and evaluate assessable learning outcomes of the competition as a project course. The degree of engineering design complexity and resulting the comprehensive learning outcomes, inspired the launch of a new bachelor programme in which many foundation engineering courses are replaced by year-long cornerstone project courses mirroring the RoboMaster project course. The outcome is a more individualized high-impact programme allowing students to build their engineering studies around technologies of our time.","Leung, Suk Wai Winnie;Li, Zexiang",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Disrupt, Innovate, Regenerate and Transform, E and PDE 2022",2022-01-01,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,multidisciplinary robotics competition ;  Project-based learning ;  team-based design
"DESIGN AND ENGINEERING PEDAGOGIES AS AGENTS FOR DISRUPTION, INNOVATION AND TRANSFORMATION AND THE TRANSFER AND APPLICATION OF REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY ACROSS DISCIPLINES","Design and engineering have individually and collectively disrupted and transformed societies, economies and the environment through innovative and regenerative practice and activities. Design and engineering education have also been transformative especially the former to which experiential, active, problem and project-based learning has always been central. This paper considers an innovative and particular teaching method - reverse psychology - that employs disruptive thinking and is being used to teach design and engineering students about sustainability. The project, results and impact are discussed in detail and were presented at EPDE21 [1]. The method proved highly successful and feedback suggested that it could be applicable to participants other than university students. This paper describes the subsequent research and its relevance to design and engineering education. The theory was tested in a workshop at an academic staff conference. Feedback was again very positive and a further workshop for academics from different disciplines was organised to develop subject-specific material and assess whether the method was transferable across disciplines. The experience proved highly beneficial to all parties who learnt from each other; the bespoke materials developed during the session were subsequently tested with students who again responded very positively, which soundly endorsed transferability. These various results show that design education remains innovative and is leading and supporting development of pioneering educational practices. Furthermore the design and engineering academics involved in the research learned from colleagues in other disciplines which supports and illustrates the benefit of transdisciplinary collaboration.","Andrews, Deborah;Newton, Elizabeth J.;Lishman, Ben",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Disrupt, Innovate, Regenerate and Transform, E and PDE 2022",2022-01-01,London South Bank University,deep learning ;  disruptive thinking ;  Reverse psychology

Simulation and experimental research on electromagnetic radiation from suspended permanent magnetic levitation train,"With the continuous development and innovation in the field of global magnetic levitation technology, the suspended permanent magnet maglev rail transit system has emerged. At present, no mature relevant technical standard references are available in the world. To study the electromagnetic radiation problem of the permanent magnet maglev train system, we use the finite element method to simulate and analyze the Halbach array track of different combinations of suspension modules, and the six-channel high-precision magnetic field test system is used to test and compare the actual engineering magnetic fields. The results show that the permanent magnet magnetic suspension rail transit system can shield the magnetic energy of the suspension module in the rail beam to reduce the influence of electromagnetic radiation. With the increase in suspension height between the rail and vehicle magnets, the generated magnetic field intensity exhibits a significantly weakening trend. The magnetic field energy of the permanent magnet maglev train is maintained at the centimeter level. Combined with the actual project, the passengers on the train and pedestrians, and residents along the red rail are not affected by the magnetic field intensity of the permanent magnet. This paper provides a theoretical basis for resolving people's concerns about the electromagnetic radiation of maglev trains, and provides important theoretical support for the development of maglev rail transit.","Wang, Yongchao;Pang, Qishou;Fan, Kuangang;Tan, Wengang",Journal,International Journal of Applied Electromagnetics and Mechanics,2022-01-01,Jiangxi University of Science and Technology;Shandong Urban Construction Design Institute,finite element simulation ;  halbach array orbits ;  orbital magnetic field ;  Permanent magnetic suspension

Research Experience as a Way to Improve Retention and Graduation Rates,"The evolution of Science and Technology is decisive for many companies to obtain innovative products. A hypothesis is that students with research experience are more prepared to contribute in the search for innovation. The experience we have in Brazilian Universities shows that this hypothesis is true. Undergraduate students with experience in research projects, together with master and PhD students, finish the course with a bigger knowledge than the ones that don't have the research experience. We observed that the research experience motivates students to proceed in their undergraduate courses, also increasing retention and success. A large number of these students are motivated to start a master or PhD.

"CAN WE GET AN INTERVENTION, PLEASE? THE UTILITY OF TEAMING INTERVENTIONS ON ENGINEERING DESIGN STUDENT PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY","Research on psychological safety has been growing in recent years due to its role in promoting creativity and innovation, among other items. This is because teams with high levels of psychological safety feel safe to express ideas and opinions. While we are becoming more aware of the importance of psychological safety in teaming, there is limited evidence in how to facilitate or build it within teams, particularly in an educational context. This paper was developed to respond to this research void by identifying the impact of teaming interventions aimed at improving psychological safety in engineering design student teams. Specifically, we studied two cohorts of students in a cornerstone design class (N = 414 students), one who received a series of video interventions and introduced role playing (intervention) and one who did not (control). These role assignments - referred to as the Lenses of Psychologically Safety - were created to promote key leadership attributes that have been shown to be crucial in facilitating psychologically safe teams. To compare the utility of the intervention, Psychological Safety was gathered at 5 key time points of a multi-week design project. The results identified three key findings. First, the interventions were successful in increasing psychological safety in engineering teams. In addition, the results indicated the utility of the Lenses of Psychological Safety throughout the design process. Finally, the results identified that groups who used these lenses had higher perceptions of Psychological Safety in their teams. Overall, these results indicated that psychological safety can be improved in engineering education through the intervention methods described within.","Scarpinella, Samantha;Cole, Courtney;Ritter, Sarah;Mohammad, Susan;Jablokow, Kathryn;Miller, Scarlett",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2022-01-01,Penn State College of Engineering;Pennsylvania State University,design education ;  design theory ;  design theory ;  methodology
DOES SYNCHRONOUS COLLABORATION IMPROVE COLLABORATIVE COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OUTPUT: RESULTS FROM A LARGE-SCALE COMPETITION,"With the growing demand for distributed collaboration for large and complex design in modern engineering, the collaboration inefficiencies of traditional computer-aided design (CAD) tools are increasingly conspicuous. Emerging cloud-based multi-user computer-aided design (MUCAD) platforms bring a new working style for CAD in the form of real-time synchronous collaboration. Little research exists to characterize collaboration in CAD, and specifically the synchronicity of collaboration has yet to be examined. In this study, we analyzed the backend action logs of 101 teams’ design processes from a large-scale virtual robotic design competition, where all designs were modelled in a commercially available MUCAD platform. Metrics of interest were analyzed with regression and mediation analyses to uncover factors that correlated to a team’s success in the competition. Results show that team size is a positive predictor of team performance. Large teams, which tend to see a large amount of time commitment from members, were more likely to perform more CAD actions and achieve high scores from the competition. This suggests that the benefits of collaboration (e.g., economies of division of labor, learning) outweigh the potential downsides (e.g., coordination overhead, free riding) in this context. While controlling for team size, increased synchronous collaboration occurrences were observed to negatively correlate to teams’ performance – a novel finding which we discuss in detail. Thus, we conclude that although large teams benefited from the MUCAD environment, a tendency for synchronous real-time collaboration did not coincide with higher performance. This study provides important evidence in the ongoing design and innovation research fields aiming to better understand collaboration. Future research should investigate the characteristics of effective collaboration strategies in MUCAD environments to develop best practice for the increasing number of design teams moving to such tools.","Deng, Yuanzhe;Marion, Tucker;Olechowski, Alison",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2022-01-01,D'Amore-McKim School of Business;University of Toronto,computer-aided design ;  multi-user CAD ;  synchronous collaboration ;  user analytics

Enhancing patent retrieval using text and knowledge graph embeddings: a technical note,"Patent retrieval influences several applications within engineering design research, education, and practice as well as applications that concern innovation, intellectual property, and knowledge management etc. In this article, we propose a method to retrieve patents relevant to an initial set of patents, by synthesising state-of-the-art techniques among natural language processing and knowledge graph embedding. Our method involves a patent embedding approach that captures text, citation, and inventor information, which individually represent different facets of knowledge communicated through a patent document. We obtain text embeddings through Sentence-BERT applied to titles and abstracts. We obtain citation and inventor embeddings through TransE that is trained using the corresponding knowledge graphs. We identify using a classification task that the concatenation of text, citation, and inventor embeddings offers a plausible representation of a patent. While the proposed patent embedding could be used to associate a pair of patents, we observe using a recall task that multiple initial patents could be associated with a target patent using mean cosine similarity, which could then be utilised to rank all target patents and retrieve the most relevant ones. We apply the proposed patent retrieval method to a set of patents corresponding to a product family and an inventor's portfolio.","Siddharth, L.;Li, Guangtong;Luo, Jianxi",Journal,Journal of Engineering Design,2022-01-01,Singapore University of Technology and Design,BERT ;  citation networks ;  graph embeddings ;  knowledge graphs ;  Patent retrieval

MARKETING IMPULSE TO PROMOTE E-LEARNING IN BASIC AND SECONDARY EDUCATION,"This research focuses on e-learning and its specific evolution applied to Basic and Secondary Education, taking into account new technological approaches, as evidenced by the marketing of school publishers in Portugal. Marketing strategies depend on educational complexity, and this research explores the possible impulse to promote e-learning in such environment. The research methodology focuses on the needs and motivations for a conceptual framework, including the development of e-learning supply processes, demand formation, and the interaction between supply and demand, which can be enhanced with appropriate public policies. The results of qualitative interpretations confirmed that beliefs about e-learning are generally influenced by most previous implementation processes and are still generally considered an unsurpassed failure. However, the evidence is modified by the new data on the impact that COVID-19 has on the entire educational organization process, specifically on technological dissemination and innovation. Price or free access and training offers forms the basis for the ""mise en valeur"" while marketing emphases the values of generosity, empathy and sharing of emotions.","Silva, Nuno Sotero;Tavares, Luís Valadares",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on E-Learning 2022, EL 2022 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2022, MCCSIS 2022",2022-01-01,Universidade Lusada de Lisboa,COVID-19 ;  e-Learning ;  Education ;  Marketing ;  Portugal

Thermo-responsive tussah silk fabric modified with nanotechnology,"Now the intelligent material is taken as the development goal of the textile technology innovation key project by the national textile industry ""14th five-year"" development plan. It will also be an important source of international competitiveness and discourse power of the textile industry. Nowadays intelligent highly bionic biodegradable and other new functional fiber materials are concerned by many researchers. As one of the important development directions of modern high-tech new materials the intelligent fiber material has been widely concerned by many researchers. Thermo-responsive textile materials can effectively transfer water with the change of external temperature. Especially on summer days with high temperature human body will sweat a lot. In order to ensure good wearing comfort of human body timely and rapid discharge of sweat mechanism is important. Chitosan is a natural widespread chitin by stripping acetyl role. As a kind of renewable and green material with a wealth of sources excellent performance and good biocompatibility chitosan is widely used in various fields including medicine food chemical cosmetic water treatment metal extraction and recovery biochemical and biomedical engineering etc. But there is still a lack of high value-added applied basic research about chitosan. It is urgently to develop a high value-added application theory and technology system of natural chitosan in the field of smart fiber to realize the wide application of renewable resources with high quality. The development of new materials with high-tech high performance and high added value functions and intelligent micro / nano fiber can provide new ideas for the development of intelligent biological new materials. In order to make the intelligent gel polymers be better applied in textile functional finish field chitosan was first modified by quaternary ammonium salt to obtain water-soluble chitosan. Based on the above in-situ polymerization interpenetrating polymer network technology was combined with the electrostatic spinning technology to prepare the chitosan quaternary ammonium salt / PNIPAAm / PEO nanofibers with temperature-sensitive responsiveness. Glutaraldehyde was used as the cross-linking agent and the nanofibers were in situ grafted to the tussah silk fabric to endow the fabric with excellent temperature-sensitive responsiveness. The molecular structure thermal properties hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and surface morphology of the modified tussah silk fabric were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR TG thermal analysis contact angle and SEM testing technology. The results indicate that chitosan quaternary ammonium salt / PNIPAAm / PEO hydrogels have good thermosensitivity and the phase inversion temperatures range from 32 ℃ to 33 ℃ which is consistent with the results of TG analysis. The chitosan quaternary ammonium salt / PNIPAAm / PEO nanofiber layer is formed on the surface of tussah silk fabric and the nanofibers are homogeneously distributed. The modified thermo-responsive tussah silk fabric has good hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity and when the temperature is higher than 45 ℃ the thermo-sensitive tussah fabric has obvious hydrophobicity. Therefore the combination of interpenetrating polymer network technology and electrostatic spinning technology is an effective method for the preparation of thermo-responsive fabrics. This provides a theoretical basis for the development of the textiles with good humidity and heat comfort. Intelligent temperature regulation outweighs the single heat preservation function of traditional textiles and can make the skin temperature always in a comfortable range when the environment changes dramatically which provides a comfortable microclimate environment for human body. Intelligent moisture permeable textiles are known as "" breathable fabrics"" for having waterproof moisture permeable windproof and thermal insulation properties. The development of intelligent temperature-sensitive textile materials not only broadens the application range of intelligent polymer materials in textile industry but also improves people's living standard. At the same time the effective combination of functional intelligent polymer materials and natural materials also provides a new idea for the research of functional and intelligent new textile materials. And it also provides great application value for intelligent wear energy conservation and environmental protection information technology and biomedical materials in respects of industries wearing medicine and military.","Li, Jia;Wang, Boxiang;Huo, Yuxin;Hao, Xu;Liu, Zhimei;Cheng, Dehong",Journal,Journal of Silk,2022-01-01,Liaodong University,chitosan ;  chitosan quaternary ammonium salt ;  electrostatic spinning technology ;  intelligent material ;  interpenetrating polymer network technology ;  temperature-sensitive responsiveness ;  tussah silk fabric

Lightweight and Optimization Acceleration Methods for Vision Transformer: A Review,"With the rapid development of technologies such as smart home, smart medical and autonomous driving, lightweight networks play an important role in promoting the application of deep learning technology on mobile and embedded terminals. The Transformer-based model changes the architecture of traditional neural networks, and performs outstanding in many fields such as natural language processing and computer vision. However, the huge computing cost and the increasing network scale have increased the demand for storage, running memory and computing, which hinders their widespread deployment on various hardware devices, such as mobile phones, robots and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, compression method for Transformer-based models need to be explored so that they can be applied more widely on mobile devices. In this paper, we focus on the lightweight and optimization acceleration methods on Vision Transformer in recent years, and summarize them as quantization, knowledge distillation, pruning and adjusting network structure, the innovations, merits and demerits of these approaches have been compared and reviewed. Through this survey, it is hoped to provide useful help for the current compression method for Vision Transformer, and also expected to point out a direction for future research in this field.","Chen, Meng;Gao, Jun;Yu, Wuxin",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Proceedings, ITSC",2022-01-01,Jianghan University,Computer vision ;  Model compression and acceleration ;  Vision Transformer

PATCHWORK: METHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL BRICOLAGE IN STEM GRADUATE EDUCATION RESEARCH,"Black American quilters have historically crafted masterpieces from remnants of cloth—telling stories, sharing knowledge, and preserving history in their quilts. As a quilter stitches pieces of fabric together to tell stories and create new images, so too does the qualitative bricoleur with theory and method. Researchers, as bricoleurs, utilize multiple theories and/or methods to “uncover new insights, expand and modify old principles, and reexamine accepted interpretations in unanticipated contexts.” Brico-lage—the product of the bricoleur’s labor—has the potential to inspire theoretical and methodological innovation in STEM higher education research. In this article, I describe applications of theoretical and methodological bricolage to my investigation of whether and how the spiritual epistemologies (i.e., ways of knowing) and ontologies (i.e., ways of seeing and being) of 16 Black Christian women in engineering served as cultural resources for them as they navigated their doctoral programs. The ways that I began to piece together different theories and methods to effectively answer my research questions reflected the sensibilities of a bricoleur, grounded in the cultural tradition of Black American quilting. Through this process, I yielded new theoretical and methodological insights that not only helped me answer my research questions, but also indelibly shaped my approach to qualitative research. I also offer implications for STEM education researchers seeking to engage in bricolage in their own work.","Morton, Christina S.",Journal,Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering,2022-01-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Black women ;  bricolage ;  graduate students ;  spirituality ;  STEM education research ;  theory and method

Experimental Research on AZ31B Magnesium Alloy Welded Using Fiber Laser with Adjustable Ring Spot,"Objective For transportation, aviation, aerospace, and defense military equipment components, the need for lightweighting is particularly urgent. Magnesium alloys have the benefits of high specific strength and stiffness, damping and vibration reduction, electromagnetic shielding, remarkable machining performance, and easy recycling. With the continuous research and innovation of new materials and technologies of magnesium alloys, their application potential will be infinite. Researchers suggested an approach of applying a tunable ring spot in laser processing that has attracted a lot of attention in the field of laser processing. Although domestic and foreign scholars have performed a lot of research investigations on magnesium alloy laser welding and have attained good findings. There is still a big gap between the existing research investigations and practical engineering applications, and it is crucial to develop novel laser welding technology. Methods In this study, AZ31B magnesium alloy butt joints with a thickness of 5 mm are welded by fiber laser with an adjustable ring spot. Based on ensuring the total power of 3 kW, pure center laser, center laser/ring laser, and pure ring laser are employed to weld magnesium alloy joints. The surface shapes, microstructures, and mechanical properties of the joints are discovered and examined. Results and Discussions In terms of weld formation, first, compared with that when using pure center laser welding, the melting width in the upper part of the weld is considerably increased when using ring laser welding, and the combination of center laser and ring laser has a greater impact on the weld cross-sectional shape. Second, when the ring laser power is greater than the center laser power, the formations of the upper and lower surfaces of the welds become unstable (Figs. 3 and 4). In terms of metallographic structure, during pure center laser welding, the columnar crystal region near the fusion line of the weld is very narrow, and the grains in the center of the weld are finer, but due to the fast cooling rate, there are small pores and cracks around the weld [Figs. 5(al)-(a4)]. When the center is welded with a ring laser, the convection heat transfer time is extended in the molten pool's upper part, increasing the grain size in the center of the weld. Even in pure annular laser welding, a wide columnar grain region is formed near the weld fusion line [Figs. 5(cl)-(c3)]. The weld zone hardness is higher than that of the base metal, and as the ring laser power increases, the weld center hardness decreases. When the central laser power is 2000 W and the ring laser power is 1000 W (sample 2#), the tensile strength and elongation of the welded joint are the largest, reaching 215 MPa and 14. 0%, respectively, which are 79.6% and 96.6% of those of the base metal [Fig. 7(a)]. The joint fracture is a brittle-ductile mixed fracture. Conclusions The existence of a ring laser has a considerable influence on the weld formation. Based on the center laser, the ring laser application can substantially increase the fusion width in the upper part of the weld. The combination of center laser and ring laser has a great influence on the cross-sectional shape of the weld, the best weld formation is generated when the center laser power is 2000 W and the ring laser power is 1000 W. The existence of ring laser has a certain effect on the microstructure of the weld. Only in the central laser action area, there is no clear heat-affected zone or columnar grain zone near the weld fusion line, and the equiaxed grains are relatively fine. In the ring laser action area, there are heat-affected and columnar crystal zones near the weld fusion line, and the equiaxed crystal grains are coarse. Further, with the ring laser power increasing, the hardness value of the central area of the weld decreases. The ring laser beam can enhance the elongation of laser welded joints of the magnesium alloys, and the welded joints have better tensile strength produced under the optimized process parameters.","Mingjun, Zhang;Lefeng, Wu;Cong, Mao;Jian, Zhang;Kaiming, Wang;Yongle, Hu;Heqing, Li",Journal,Zhongguo Jiguang/Chinese Journal of Lasers,2022-01-01,Changsha University of Science and Technology,AZ31B magnesium alloy ;  fiber laser with adjustable ring spot ;  laser technique ;  laser welding ;  microstructure ;  weld appearance
Empirically Derived Use Cases for Software Analytics,"[Background] Software engineering activities provide large volumes of data that software analytics tools can use to support decision-making. However, adopting such tools depends on the usefulness of the information provided regarding the needs of practitioners. While the needs of developers have been well-researched, the needs of managers are not getting as much attention. [Aims] This study provides an in-depth analysis of the needs of software practitioners involved in managerial decision-making from one organization that performs research, development, and innovation projects with industry partners. [Method] We identified and represented such needs as use cases by interviewing people in leadership positions and analyzing the collected data using Grounded Theory coding techniques, i.e., open and selective coding. [Results] Our analysis resulted in 19 software analytics use cases which we classified into four dimensions: quality, people, project management, and knowledge management. The use cases in the quality and project management dimensions were the most mentioned ones. [Conclusions] Although our results are particularly relevant to organizations similar to the one described herein, they aim to serve as input for implementing new analytics solutions by practitioners and researchers.","Rique, Thiago;Dantas, Emanuel;Perkusich, Mirko;Gorgonio, Kyller;Almeida, Hyggo;Perkusich, Angelo",Conference Proceeding,"2022 30th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks, SoftCOM 2022",2022-01-01,Universidade Federal de Campina Grande,Case Study ;  Grounded Theory ;  Software Analytics ;  Software Engineering ;  Software Measurement
Global Status of Genetically Modified Crops,"The biggest problem the world is facing today is hunger, malnutrition, and the rising population. Adopting advanced breeding innovation technologies for enhanced agricultural production is urgently needed to meet the rising global demand for food and nutritional security. Recent advancements in GM technology, genome editing seem promising to accelerate crop improvement by enabling effective targeted modification in most crops/plants. Biosafety regulations for genome-modified plants are essential and often variable in various countries. In India, the GM Crops Release Regulation is one of the most regulated GM technologies in the world. The USA, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India planted about 91% of the global GM crop area of 190.4 million hectares. Soybean, maize, cotton, and canola are extensively grown and are of the utmost importance among all GM food crops. On six continents, approximately 32 plants were released for commercial cultivation. In five countries all over the world, 1.95 billion people have benefited from GM food biotechnology. This book chapter highlighted the global and Indian status of research and commercialization of GM crops, regulation of GM, and genome-edited technologies in India.","Verma, Vipasha;Negi, Shivanti;Kumar, Pankaj;Srivastava, Dinesh Kumar",Book,Agricultural Biotechnology: Latest Research and Trends,2022-01-01,Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry,Biosafety ;  Biotech crops ;  Genetic engineering ;  Hunger ;  Transgenic
The Analysis of Intrinsic Game Elements for Undergraduates Gamified Platform Based on Learner Type,"This paper examines intrinsic motivation-driven game elements and designs an Intrinsic Motivation Gamification Framework to provide undergraduates with a persistent, scaffolded, and satisfying online learning experience based on different user profiles. Gamification has become the primary resolution to the low retention rate in learning platforms for undergraduates. However, most gamified learning studies focus on the player-type profiling method, while no intrinsic motivation-driven game elements are mapped to certain players. This paper refined self-needs and user motivation in the learning experience from different user behaviours through the distinction method of Grasha Learner Style, deriving six types of learners: independent, dependent, participant, avoidance, collaborative, and competitive. Based on the literature review, a gamified framework has been developed to engage undergraduates to persist in using a self-developed gamified platform, GamiClass, for up to 16 weeks. A suggested 20 game elements have been deployed based on the needs of the Octalysis Framework and Self-Determination Theory. The analysis mirrored the positive impact of game elements (group quest, challenges, and time pressure) on the undergraduates. In contrast, choices/consequences and exploration game elements negatively affect the undergraduates' continuity in the gamified platform. Furthermore, the group quest was identified as the critical game element that stimulates various types of undergraduates in competition and collaboration, thus internalising their extrinsic motivation into intrinsic motivation during their learning journey.","Kian, Tan Wei;Sunar, Mohd Shahrizal;Su, Goh Eg",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia;Raffles University Iskandar,Game elements ;  gamification ;  human computer interaction ;  intrinsic motivation

In this article, we introduce and discuss five state-of-the-art approaches to derive a reasonable innovation budget with a strong practical lens. In reviewing them, we provide rich academic insights and offer practical guidance based on the years of experience in innovation management and corporate strategy.","Hirschfelder, Oliver;Gutmann, Tobias",Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2022-01-01,EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht,Innovation ;  innovation budget ;  RandD budget ;  research and development (RandD)
Discursive Enactments of Knowledge Production in Engineering Education,"Engineering education is under the sway of wide-ranging dynamics and drifts that have bearing on how education is enacted in relation to the research and innovation obligations of universities. Academic, applied, and third mission drifts seem to configure higher education in new ways. The article sets out to critically explore how knowledge production is discursively enacted in the teaching-research-practice-nexus in engineering universities of applied science (UAS) in Denmark. This paradigmatic case study maps discursive positionings and discusses how these positionings aspire to transform engineering education in the light of the wide-ranging drifts in higher education. Based on 17 qualitative in-depth interviews with researchers, teachers, and managers, the article maps the discursive positions taken and not-taken in relation to the enactment of the teaching-research-practice-nexus. The exploration is guided by a theory-method-package inspired by situational analysis and interviewing methods developed in practice-based approaches as interview-to-the-double. The analysis identifies four discursive positions in the teaching-research-practice-nexus that enact knowledge production in engineering UAS differently. Furthermore, three unavailable discursive positions are identified. Interpretive flexibility makes different discursive enactments of knowledge production possible. The study concludes that (1) that the primary mission of UAS in Denmark is teaching; research and engagement with practice are subordinate missions; (2) that the applied and third mission drift has been effective in instituting alternative discursive enactments; (3) some positions are seemingly discursively illegitimate. The undisputability of the educational mission–and the applied and third mission drifts–seems to effectively outweigh academic drift in the Danish UAS.","Buch, Anders;Ramsay, Loren Mark;Løje, Hanne",Journal,Engineering Studies,2022-01-01,VIA University College;Jönköping University;Technical University of Denmark,discourse analysis ;  education policy ;  Engineering education ;  higher education ;  research to practice

Addressing the critical shortage of optics technicians,"The global optics industry is growing faster than the overall U.S. economy, but the technical workforce for the industry is shrinking at an alarming rate. The absence of a single technician can delay shipments and impede the productivity of an optics company. The shortage of technicians is stifling innovation and requiring engineers with advanced degrees to complete the work of technicians. Development of the current and next-generation optics manufacturing workforce is vital. To meet the growing demand for skilled optics technicians, the Monroe Community College Optical Systems Technology program created the Defense Engineering Education Program in Optics (DEEP OPS) to increase the national optics workforce. Funded by the Department of the Navy Office of Naval Research (Award #N00014-19-1- 2740), the DEEP OPS initiative is strengthening and expanding the national precision optics workforce to ensure technological superiority for the Department of Defense. This initiative has: 1) Extensively enhanced precision optics technician training with innovative approaches that meet the needs of the optics industry and students; 2) Increased the number and diversity of optics technicians nationwide; and 3) Established opportunities for student and faculty engagement with the optics industry. The DEEP OPS program is providing strategic solutions to defense challenges and is supplying the intellectual know-how that is being transferred to a national base in the AmeriCOM Workforce Initiative. This paper describes how Monroe Community College has become a national model for educating diverse optics and photonics technicians.","Vogt, Alexis",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2022-01-01,Monroe Community College,Apprenticeship ;  Diversity ;  Industry partnerships ;  Online curriculum ;  Optics technician ;  Precision optics ;  Training ;  Workforce development

FORECASTING THE SUCCESS OF HYPERLOOP TECHNOLOGY ON ITALIAN ROUTES: A BROAD FEASIBILITY STUDY,"Large Infrastructure Projects, also referred as Large Engineering Projects (or LEPs), are always controversial due to the fact that standard cost-benefit analysis and other economic evaluations are often negative due to their high implementation cost and their high level of risk related the uncertainty and innovation they bring with them. Anyway, in the last decades, the investment on LEPs in increasing all over the world (Flyvjierg, B., 2014), and the construction of LEPs is still considered a basic leverage to increase the wealth of nations. The topic is particularly relevant at EU level. In fact the decision-making process on which infrastructure (LEP) should be funded and which not by the public sector has been criticized by new “sovranist” political parties. For example, studies both in favor and against the funding of the same infrastructure have been published by different academics, even belonging to the same institution (Ponti, M. et al., 2019) (Cantarella G.E., et al., 2019). In the last few months there is a lot of discussion in Italy about the feasibility of an Hyperloop, that is a “Hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes through whith a pod may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while being very efficient, thereby drastically reducing travel times over medium-range distances” (Opgenoord, Max M.J., 2019). In particular, six possible route have been drafted, e.g. Milan-Rome, Milan Cadorna Station-Milan Malpensa Airport, Verona-Trieste and others. The Authors want to evaluate the economic feasibility of that revolutionary transpiration mode, applying a broad approach, according both the indications of the European Commission’s Guide to Cost-Benefit Analysis of Investment Projects (2014), including both ordinary costs and benefits, and evaluation also the innovation benefits that such transportation mode, if implemented, will bring: evaluating such a transportation mode as, for example, an ordinary high speed train mode, won’t be correct, because implementing it will cause innovation in several technologic fields and in the transportation sector as a whole, and these benefits must be encompassed in the analysis. In addition, the authors will evaluate other success criteria such as the one indicated by Atkinson, R. (1999), i.e. “stakeholder benefits against which projects can he assessed”. Including the approach by Turner and Zolin (2012) of taking into account multiple perspectives by multiple stakeholders over multiple time frames: In Large Engineering Projects “How different stake-holders perceive success can change with time, and so the project manager needs leading performance indicators that go beyond the traditional triple constraint to 148 forecast how key stakeholders will perceive success months or even years later” (Turner and Zolin, 2012). This research has the aim of carrying out a preliminary technical-economic feasibility study of a potential Hyperloop line connecting the cities of Rome and Milan, chosen as they are poles of attraction and generators of transportation demand. The main objective is not to analyze the validity of the technology used as to assess the feasibility and sustainability of such a project. The first section briefly describes the history and technology, the main characteristics and limitations of these vehicles. The second section presents a transportation study of the potential demand through surveys that will make it possible to identify users’ preferences, assessing the transportation demand and the willingness to pay of potential users. In the third and fourth sections a financial and economic analysis is performed, presenting assumptions and limitations that this research necessarily has, due to the lack of information on several areas. In the last section before conclusions, some consideration is made about the possible social impact on potential stakeholders involvement, presenting also preliminary feedback, from interviews to industrial stakeholder that are considering their involvement in a hyperloop venture in Italy. In the last section, the Authors make a balance of their findings and outline the further development of the research on this topic.","Maja, Roberto;Favari, Edoardo;Mariani, Costanza",Book,Sustainability and Megaproject Development,2022-01-01,,

DINNP-U: A Design Process for Digital Innovation Platforms In Energy Sector Companies,"This article proposes a process for digital innovation platforms in the energy sector called DINNPU. The research method involves the documentary review of research in the field of innovation, transformation, and digital platforms capable of generating value and innovation to its ecosystem. As a result, we generated a conceptual and theoretical basis that allowed the formalization of the disciplines for the design of digital innovation platforms. The process we propose can be used in the development of innovation platforms and can be instantiated for a specific domain. Moreover, the assets produced can be reused to generate a product from a family of domains. The main disciplines of this process are analysis, design, and implementation of digital platforms. For the case study, an interview was conducted with a group of specialists in the ICT area of an energy company (Utilities) in order to understand the digitization process or current maturity of this company. Then it was validated whether the proposed model or design is applicable or should wait until the company achieves the necessary digital maturity. The contribution of this study is to propose a process for domain engineering, which allows contributing with knowledge and experience, for digital innovation platforms in various industrial sectors. There is an interest in this phenomenon due to global trends such as digital transformation and industry 4.0.","Canelón, Rodolfo;Peña, Camilo;Salazar, Andrés",Journal,Journal of Technology Management and Innovation,2022-01-01,Universidad Central de Chile,Digital Innovation Platforms ;  Digital Platform ;  Domain engineering ;  Innovation
A Tool for Developing and Evaluating Methods (TDEM),"Digital Innovation (DI) is the use of digital technologies during the process of innovation or as the result of innovation. While we see a huge amount of interest in DI research from IS scholars, there is still scarcity in terms of using Design Science Research (DSR) for the engineering of DI, specifically from a method perspective and a possible integration of both fields. In this paper, we propose a tool for developing and evaluating methods to build method design theories, not just in the DI field, but also generally applicable to method engineering in other fields as well. Thus, we contribute systematically to the body of knowledge for information systems with a tool that shall be an effective assistant in method engineering. The tool builds on the eight components of a design theory first introduced by (Gregor and Jones, 2007) and conceptualized by (Offermann et al., 2010a) for the artifact type “method”. Finally, we analyze the role and utility of the tool in detail, concentrating on a method for the engineering of DI, in a DI project related to the microservices architecture, and lastly, we show generalizability of the tool in terms of design process evaluation, not specifically following a DSR paradigm.","Huseynli, Murad;Ogbuachi, Michael Chima;Bub, Udo",Conference Proceeding,"International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, ICEIS - Proceedings",2022-01-01,Eötvös Loránd Tudományegyetem,Design Science Research ;  Digital Innovation ;  Information Systems ;  Method Design ;  Method Engineering ;  Method Evaluation ;  Microservices ;  Process Evaluation
STATE of the ART in NEW SEMISUBMERSIBLE PLATFORM CONCEPTS,"The semisubmersible platform (Semi) shows superior performance to the Spar, TLP and FPSO owing to its unique and reasonable structure and shape, and thus is one of the most vital and promising equipment for deepsea oil and gas development. Nevertheless, its inherent disadvantages have been gradually revealed through six decades of extensive engineering practices and in-depth research. Much innovative work has been carried out during recent two decades to improve its overall performance and maximize its safety and operability to utilize it in supervisor ways. Firstly, the shape features of a conventional Semi and the operation requirements in different phases during the whole life cycle of a Semi were summarized. Then, the factors affecting the stability and the motion performance of a Semi and their internal relationship were studied according to the principles of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics. After that, representative innovative conceptual Semi designs in the academic papers and the patent documents were reviewed.

Product Innovation Design Method Based on BP Neural Network,"Innovative product design is the core problem of modern industry and the source power of enterprise development. With the continuous improvement of China's material level, product innovation design has changed from functional needs to emotional needs, and the product design method centered on users' emotional needs has attracted much attention. With the emergence of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data, the automation and intelligence of advanced algorithms and innovative design methods for online product decision driven by multimodal multimedia data in e-commerce have become inevitable trends in the field of product design, and it is a big challenge to improve the innovative design ability of products by using information technology. In order to solve this problem, based on the research of BP neural network technology, this paper puts forward an innovative product design method based on image-Kempi method. The color features of images are reconstructed and integrated, and then transferred to product modeling, so as to generate new products with both content image modeling features and style image color features, which brings visual inspiration to users. The results show that KENPI method combines the theories of Kansei engineering, convolutional neural network, and neural style transfer, and establishes a mapping model between product modeling elements and product semantics. Convolutional neural network and neural style transfer model are used to extract, reconstruct, and integrate the color features of style diagrams, and transfer them to product modeling to design new product images. By evaluating the image quality and comparing the product semantics before and after the migration, the validity and feasibility of the migration are verified. Based on BP neural network, a nonlinear mapping model between product attribute space and product semantic space is constructed, and the generalization ability of the model is evaluated, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. The research results have important theoretical guiding significance for improving the innovative design ability of enterprises, enhancing product competitiveness, and customer satisfaction.","Huang, Shihui",Journal,Advances in Multimedia,2022-01-01,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,

Applying the Delphi method with early-career researchers to explore a genderissues agenda in STEM education,"The Delphi method (DM) was initially conceived as a forecasting technique whose results are based on the consensus of a panel of experts. It has been used in many fields, assisting researchers, policymakers, and others in setting directions and future agendas. This study presents an application of the DM, with a broader interpretation of the notion of “expert” as a qualitative tool to explore gender issues in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Its aim is to analyze the use of the DM as a technique to achieve agreement among a group of early-career researchers from the UK and Mexico, who are not considered “experts” in the traditional sense. The other aim was to explore the advantages and disadvantages of using the DM in this context. We used three stages to collect information and reach a consensus. The first two were online activities, and the last consisted of a five-day face-to-face workshop. In the first stage, participants sent research questions, and organizers categorized them into themes. Participants responded to a survey ranking all research questions in the second stage. In the last, organizers analyzed the highest scored questions and arranged them into research topics in which participants worked on research proposals. The DM worked successfully with this group of participants by combining their interest in the field and engagement with the activities. The research strands and proposals of using this method are usable. The method used in this paper can serve as a model to develop research graduate courses to develop students’ skills","Hernandez-Martinez, Paul;Dominguez, Angeles;Zavala, Genaro;Kambouri, Maria;Zubieta, Judith;Clark, Robin",Journal,"Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",2022-01-01,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México;Swinburne University of Technology;University of Warwick;University of Reading;Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,Delphi method ;  Educational innovation ;  Gender research agenda ;  Graduate research training ;  Higher education ;  Stem education
THE INTERNATIONAL CASE FOR MICRO-CREDENTIALS FOR LIFE-WIDE AND LIFE-LONG LEARNING: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,"Aim/Purpose Systematic literature reviews seek to locate all studies that contain material of relevance to a research question and to synthesize the relevant outcomes of those studies. The primary aim of this paper was to synthesize both research and practice reports on micro-credentials (MCRs). Background There has been an increase in reports and research on the plausibility of MCRs to support dynamic human skills development for an increasingly impatient and rapidly changing digital world. The integration of fast-paced emerging technologies and digitalization necessitate alternative learning paradigms. MCRs offer time, financial, and space flexibility and can be stacked into a larger qualification, thereby allowing for a broader range of transdisciplinary competencies within a qualification. However, MCRs often lack the academic rigor required for accreditation within existing disciplines. Methodology The study followed the PRISMA framework (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses), which offers a rigorous method to enhance reporting quality. The study used both academic research and practice reports. Contribution The paper makes a theoretical contribution to the discourse about the need for innovation within existing educational paradigms for continued relevance in a changing world. It also contributes to the debate on the role of MCRs in bridging the gap between practice and academia despite the growing difference between their interests, and the role that MCRs play in the social-economic plans of countries. Findings The key findings are that investments in MCRs are mainly in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and Education sectors, and have taken place mainly in high-income countries and regions – contexts that particularly value practice-accredited MCRs. Low-income countries, by contrast, remain traditional and insist on MCRs that are formally accredited by a recognized academic institution. This contributes to a widening skills gap between low- and high-income countries or regions, which results in greater global disparities. There is also a growing divide between academia and practice concerning their interest in MCRs (a reflection of the rigor versus relevance debate), which partially explains why many global and larger organizations have gone on to create their own learning institutions. Recommendations We recommend that educational mechanisms consider the critical importance for Practitioners of MCRs as part of innovative efforts for life-wide (different sectors) and lifelong (same sector) learning, especially in low-income countries. MCRs provide dynamic mechanisms to fill skills gaps in an increasing ruthless international battle for talent. Recommendations We recommend focused research into skills and career pathways using MCRs for Researchers while at the same time remaining responsive to transdisciplinary efforts and sensitive to global and local changes within any sector. Impact on Society Work and society have transformed over time, and more so in the new digital age, yet academia has been slow in adapting to the changes, forcing organizations to create their own learning institutions or to use MCRs to fill the skills gap. The purpose of education goes beyond preparing individuals for work, extending further to creating an environment where individuals and governments seek their own social and economic outcomes. MCRs provide a flexible means for co-creation between individuals, education, organizations, and government that could stem global rising unemployment, social exclusion, and redundancy. Future Research Future research should focus on the co-creation of MCRs between practitioners and academia.","Msweli, Nkosikhona Theoren;Twinomurinzi, Hossana;Ismail, Mymoena",Journal,"Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management",2022-01-01,University of Pretoria;University of Johannesburg;IT4ALL-Africa,COVID-19 ;  credentials ;  digital badges ;  education 4.0 ;  micro-credentials ;  online learning
Eco-Feasibility Study and Application of Natural Inventive Principles in Chemical Engineering Design,"The early stages of the front-end process development are critical for the future success of projects involving new technologies. The application of eco-inventive principles identified in natural systems to the design of chemical processes and equipment allows one to find ways to mitigate or avoid secondary ecological problems such as, for example, higher consumption of raw materials or energy, generation of hazardous waste and pollution of the environment by toxic chemicals. However, before implementing a new technology in a real operational environment, it is necessary to completely investigate its undesirable ecological impact and to evaluate the future viability of this technology. Therefore, the research paper presents a study of ecological feasibility of an innovative process design utilising natural eco-inventive principles and analyses the correlations between applied inventive principles. Such eco-feasibility study can be considered as an important decision gate to determine whether the technology implementation should be moved forward. Furthermore, the study evaluates the practicability of natural inventive principles to the eco-friendly process design and is illustrated with an example of a sustainable technology for nickel extraction from pyrophyllite.","Mas’udah, ;Livotov, Pavel;Santosa, Sandra;Sekaran, Arun Prasad Chandra;Takwanto, Anang;Pachulska, Agata M.",Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2022-01-01,State Polytechnic of Malang;University of Applied Sciences Offenburg;iFluids Engineering,Chemical engineering ;  Eco-inventive principles ;  Feasibility study ;  Nature-inspired innovation ;  Process design ;  TRIZ
Consumer Satisfaction Using Fitness Technology Innovation,"It is not a surprise that technology is raising increasingly within the people’s fitness routine and showing a shift in customer’s mindset. Hence, the technological products’ companies have to keep on tracking customer’s purchase intentions and loyalty for their business growth. Meanwhile, customer satisfaction is essential in determining the purchase intention. Therefore, a research is conducted to find the determinants that lead to customer satisfaction using fitness technology innovation particularly. Various theories, regarding technology, are discussed to reach customer satisfaction determinants; thereby, four of them are under study, as follows, service quality, helpfulness, friendliness, and quickness to investigate their relationship with customer satisfaction. For the benefit and purpose of this study, a quantitative research is applied and data is collected using a self-directed questionnaire. Hence, the obtained results revealed that customer satisfaction is determined by helpfulness, friendliness, and quickness of the devices, in addition to the service quality provided by the companies. However, the research methodology has its limitations and imperfections where the sample’s size and selection are limited. Also, the research is not focusing on all the customer satisfaction determinants the theories discussed in the literature review. All in all, this study is vital for fitness technology companies to track the customer’s satisfaction for strengthening their Research and Development to meet the customer’s expectations that leads to higher satisfaction and business growth. Moreover, further research is necessary to decide whether the obtained results can be generalized across other innovative technological devices.","Abdo, Simona;Nahouli, Tahani H.;Daye, Karim",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2022-01-01,Lebanese International University,Customer satisfaction ;  Fitness technology innovation ;  Friendliness ;  Helpfulness ;  Quickness ;  Service quality
Using MBSE for Conflict Managing TRIZ on a Systems Engineering Level,"The objective of the presented research is to find a method to identify and resolve high level conflicts with TRIZ applications in systems engineering on a parameter level. These conflicts are caused by several competing TRIZ problem solving patterns (innovative principles) on lower system levels. Here, interference parameters result from the physical adoption of the general innovative basic principles in a specific application context (e.g. vibration, heat, additional energy consumption). To manage these conflicts on a parameter level, the system engineering point of view is matched with the physical parameter level in the engineering design of a product. Within an experimental research approach, an exemplary MBSE system model of a technical device is used to resolve parameter conflicts on a higher system level. The conflicts only arise on a higher system level consideration, which makes computer-aided conflict identification essential to design engineers. The presented method does help system engineers to foresee conflict potentials of innovative principles on a system level and to control them accordingly using a MBSE system model approach.","Julitz, Tim;Löwer, Manuel;Katzwinkel, Tim",Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2022-01-01,Bergische Universität Wuppertal;Institute for Product Innovations,Engineering design ;  MBSE ;  Methodology ;  Systematic innovation ;  Systems engineering
Development of an Ontology of Sustainable Eco-friendly Technologies and Products Based on the Inventive Principles of the TRIZ Theory (OntoSustIP) – Research Agenda,"Rising societies’ demands require more sustainable products and technologies. Although numerous methods and tools have been developed in the last decades to support environmental-friendly product and process development, an interdisciplinary knowledge base of eco-innovative examples linked to the eco-innovative problems and solution principles is lacking. The paper proposes an ontology of examples for eco-friendly products and technologies assigned to the Inventive Principles (IPs) of the TRIZ methodology in accordance with the German TRIZ Standard VDI 4521. The examples of sustainable technologies and products build a database for sharing and reusing eco-innovation knowledge. The ontology acts as a tool for systematic solving of specific environmental problems in typical life cycle phases, for different environmental impact categories and engineering domains. Finally, the paper defines a future research agenda in the field of the TRIZ-based systematic eco-innovation.","Hentschel, Claudia;Hiltmann, Kai;Huber, Norbert;Livotov, Pavel;Nähler, Horst T.;Thurnes, Christian M.;Wichowska, Agata M.",Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2022-01-01,Fachhochschule Münster - Abteilung Steinfurt;Hochschule Weihenstephan-Triesdorf;Hochschule Coburg;University of Applied Sciences Offenburg;C4pi-Center for Product-Innovation;Hochschule Kaiserslautern,Eco-design ;  Eco-innovation ;  Knowledge-based innovation ;  Ontology ;  Sustainability ;  TRIZ
Augmented Reality in Education and Remote Sensing,"Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that has attracted a lot of attention in recent times, especially, after PokemonGo and quite recently with the gaining popularity of metaverse. AR is not a new technology but its development to maturity has always been dependent on many other technologies like computer vision, mobile processing, optics, etc. We are at that stage in the development cycle of AR where all other technologies not only support but can benefit from its use. This research presents one such innovation in the domain of education-for school children or enthusiasts about geospatial technologies such as remote sensing. In this paper, we have discussed the idea, methodology, and demonstration of one such application which establishes a future trend for use of AR in the education of Geospatial Technology. Different types of remote sensing data, their acquisition method, satellite technology, and applications area are explained using AR for a more interactive experience.

Mining Industry 4.0 – Opportunities and Barriers,"Safety, development, and efficiency are the main slogans that guide modern mines. At the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution, they are familiar with innovations and modern technologies that allow them to create innovative solutions and build an environmentally friendly mining sector. The aim of the paper was to assess the feasibility of implementing the assumptions of the industrial revolution 4.0 in the mining industry. Based on the author's own research and literature research, a set of scenarios for the transformation process was developed. After the verification, three alternative scenarios related to the transformation process 4.0 in mines were used for the research. The transformation scenarios were assessed from the perspective of individual stakeholder groups. The NAIADE (Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments), which so far has not been used in the mining industry to assess development scenarios, the method was used to assess the transformation scenarios. The research identified and characterized nine groups of stakeholders. Based on the conducted structured interviews, a set of technical criteria for the assessment of scenarios was defined. The analysis results from the impact matrix and social impact matrix developed for the first time for the mining industry transformation scenarios. Based on the analysis of the impacts of individual factors, it was shown which scenario is the most acceptable for stakeholders and the best from a technical point of view. The research focuses on the deficit of digital competencies and the generational change, as well as the change in the competency requirements of the new type of worker-miner-operator 4.0.","Ulewicz, Robert;Krstić, Božidar;Ingaldi, Manuela",Journal,Acta Montanistica Slovaca,2022-01-01,University of Kragujevac;Częstochowa University Of Technology,digital transformation ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Mining 4.0 ;  mining engineering ;  multicriteria analysis ;  NAIADE ;  operator 4.0 ;  predictive maintenance ;  smart mining
Quantitative Impact Analysis of Financial Support on Regional Science and Technology Innovation and Productivity Based on the Multivariate Statistical Model,"Science and technology (S&T) innovation is a significant driving force for regional productivity, and strong financial support can effectively promote S&T innovation. As the regional main body of S&T innovation, the first thing that enterprises need to address is the demand for funds. Internal funds are needed to maintain the overall daily operation of enterprises, and regional science and technology innovation funds mainly come from external financial support. Using the factor analysis method, multiple indicators were adopted to comprehensively evaluate the level of S&T innovation in each province and city as the variables and financial scale, financial structure, and financial efficiency as the variables, and the impact of financial support on science and technology innovation in four major regions was empirically studied using a panel data model. The degree of development of banking institutions and capital markets in different regions of China varies, and the financial system's support for China's S&T innovation varies widely. Therefore, it is important to study the impact of financial support on science and technology innovation among different regions in China for the balanced development of China's regions.","Liu, Ling",Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2022-01-01,Xinjiang University of Finance and Economics,

Conducting a Home Experiment Related to the Colligative Properties of Chemical Solutions,"The experimental part of teaching chemistry in a series of laboratory activities complements the fundamental learning of the various topics covered in a chemistry course. However, alternatives are necessary when situations arise where it is impossible to have a chemistry laboratory. Conducting home experiments can be of great help in teaching various chemistry topics, as they can be used in tasks, research scenarios, and alternative laboratory practices. They can be applied to different levels of teaching depending on their orientation and the contents they address. In the absence of a laboratory to conduct chemistry practice experiments due to Covid-19 faculty and student confinements at home, we developed feasible practices to do at home with ordinary homemade materials that were not risky or dangerous. We selected solutions with desired colligative properties. Thirty engineering students taking two university chemistry laboratory classes participated, coming from programs in the chemical area such as chemical engineering and biotechnology engineering, among others. The teaching-learning process was conducted remotely via Zoom. The students appreciated the in-home practices. Motivated to understand the topics, they performed well on the exams and the laboratory reports and issued high opinions of the classes in the student survey.","Ramírez-Angulo, Javier;Portilla-Pineda, Margarita;del Carmen González-Cortés, María",Conference Proceeding,International Symposium on Project Approaches in Engineering Education,2022-01-01,Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana;Tecnológico de Monterrey,colligative properties ;  Concentration ;  educational innovation ;  higher education ;  solutions
"Multidisciplinary projects for Engineering, Business Administration and Design programs: Construction and mapping of common skills through an analysis instrument","In Brazil the Engineering, Business Administration and Design courses have, each one of them, a list of own competences, or skills, that are established on the curricular guidelines by Ministry of Education, to be developed by students along the course. This is not a closed list, and specific competences attending specifics courses demands can be included, in order to training students with innovative and current profile. The engineering courses guidelines point out that students need to be trained with active learning strategies putting them as protagonists of their training and, besides this, courses need to make use of projects to develop the soft skills desirable in this training. To achieve an integrative approach, an institution created a new curriculum in which the students of these three courses interact in multidisciplinary projects. This approach has with bases the innovation tripod supporting the collaboration of the students of these three courses, aiming training them to a global scenario that claims professional's broad vision. Each multidisciplinary project is developed in an academic semester and the students need to enrol in two projects per semester. In this context emerged the need of a convergent list of competences that translate the competences of these three courses, without lose the essence of each one. This paper presents the process of building this unique list of competences, for training professionals with an updated and innovative profile. From this, a survey was carried out to gather information on the competences developed in these projects. The research method was the documental analysis for the creation of the list of competences. To survey the competences that are offered in the projects, a questionnaire sent to the instructors was used. The list of competences allowed the creation of an activity plan, in which they declare the competences that will be developed by students, ensuring the management of the learning process.","Palú, Matheus Ferreira;Neto, Octavio Mattasoglio;da Matta, Eduardo Nadaleto",Conference Proceeding,International Symposium on Project Approaches in Engineering Education,2022-01-01,Instituto Maua de Tecnologia,Competences ;  Innovation tripod ;  Multidisciplinary projects ;  Problem Based Learning ;  Soft skills
The Generation and Realization of Dunhuang Cultural Values from the Perspective of Crosscultural Communication: Based on Spanish and Chinese Culture,"Dunhuang Feitian is a complex of Indian culture, Buddhist culture, Western culture, and Central Plains culture. It has been loved by artists since ancient times and is an important embodiment of the essence of grotto art. Dunhuang culture is an important cultural heritage used to build Chinese cultural identity. With the development of science and technology and the progress of society, the exchanges between cultures are increasingly deepened. These exchanges are not only reflected in language, economy, politics, film, and technology but also in science and technology. From a macroperspective, culture includes all products, and products are also an intuitive manifestation of culture. How to continue culture and consider the customs and taboos of the outside world while continuing retains the essence of culture to the greatest extent and integrates local characteristics, so that foreign culture can be integrated into it. Being well accepted by local people will become an important proposition for crosscultural communication and value expression. Therefore, based on cognitive thinking and Kansei engineering theory, this research explores and analyzes product design methods that integrate Spanish and Chinese cultures, hereinafter referred to as ""Western-Chinese""cultures. Analyze the two cultures separately: from a certain culture, after the image investigation, extract the target image; from another culture, get the modeling design factors and then realize the product image modeling design of crosscultural Dunhuang integration and the Dunhuang culture. Value generation and realization reasonably recognize the connection between the two cultures, form a crosscultural integration design theory, and provide new ideas for product innovation design.","Liang, Lin;Wang, Shasha",Journal,Journal of Environmental and Public Health,2022-01-01,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona;Xiamen University,

The Challenge of Biofuel: Energy Generation for a Sustainable Future,"It is increasing clear that biofuels can be a viable source of renewable energy in contrast to the finite nature, geopolitical instability, and deleterious global effects of fossil fuel energy. Collectively, biofuels include any energy-enriched chemicals generated directly through the biological processes or derived from the chemical conversion from biomass of prior living organisms. Currently it is still problematic and challenging for biofuel to be commercially competitive over fossil fuel. To address the energy crisis, the global collaborative efforts are essential for transforming biofuels into our current energy system. These collaborative activities will facilitate the cultivation methodology development and technology innovation of biofuel production, including fundamental mechanistic research, cell growth facility construction, genetic engineering of algae strains, and biofuel production condition optimization. Future research endeavors in biofuel production should be placed on the search of novel biofuel production species, optimization and improvement of culture conditions, genetic engineering of biofuel-producing species, complete understanding of the biofuel production mechanisms, and effective techniques for mass cultivation of microorganisms.","Segovia-Hernández, Juan Gabriel;Sanchez-Ramirez, Eduardo;Alcocer-Garcia, Heriberto;Romero-Garcia, Ana Gabriela;Quiroz-Ramirez, Juan José",Book Series,Green Energy and Technology,2022-01-01,Centro de Innovación Aplicada en Tecnologías Competitivas;Universidad de Guanajuato,
Soviet-Czechoslovak Technological Transfer: from the First Post-War Years to the Prague Spring (on the Base of the Foreign Trips Reports of Soviet Engineers),"In this article, a large range of unique sources from the collections of the St. Petersburg Central State Archive of Scientific and Technical Documentation is analyzed and studied for the first time. These are the reports of Soviet specialists in the field of technical knowledge on the business trips to Czechoslovakia in the period from the mid-1940s until the end of the 1960s. Their authors were employees of the Leningrad sectoral research institutes. They were technical chemists, shipbuilders, hydraulic engineers, mining engineers, machine builders, etc. The presented materials made it possible to take a fresh look at the issues of the Soviet-Czechoslovak technological transfer, both within the framework of bilateral relations and within the framework of CMEA. A distinctive feature of all the reports was their de-ideologization. These documents did not contain references to the classics of Marxism-Leninism and assurances of the superiority of socialist science over bourgeois, but they reflected a deep sincere interest in foreign technologies and engineering solutions. Noteworthy is the very respectful attitude of Soviet specialists towards their Czech and Slovak colleagues, and at the same time - deep attention to Czechoslovak technical developments. This fact clearly distinguishes the reports of engineers from the reports of their colleagues in the humanities, especially from the institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The latter often wrote such documents from the arrogant position of the “elder brother”, who has a monopoly on the Marxist truth. The Soviet authors of the reports did not separate Soviet technical science from the global context and tried in every possible way to convey the idea of the importance of exchanging experience and scientific and technical information with foreign partners. They looked with some envy at their Czechoslovak colleagues, who, albeit limitedly, had access to Western scientific and technical literature. If we talk about the transfer of knowledge and technology from the standpoint of mutual benefit, then we need to draw a conclusion about its success. Cooperation with the USSR allowed Czechoslovakia to develop a number of new technical areas, such as nuclear power, at the same time, the Soviet side got the opportunity to access promising Czechoslovak technologies in the field of mechanical engineering or polymer chemistry. However, the system of intellectual exchanges, despite the obvious mutual interest of the specialists of the two countries in it, was still fettered by ideological frameworks and party control, and the introduction of certain technical innovations often faced the sluggishness of the planned economy.","Kovalev, Mikhail",Journal,Istoriya,2022-01-01,"Institute of World History, Russian Academy of Sciences",business foreign trips ;  history of science and technology ;  Leningrad ;  research institutes ;  Soviet engineers ;  Soviet-Czechoslovak scientific relations ;  technology transfer

It has been shown that because of the fact that while developing a space control radar innovation, the developer may not always use advanced scientific knowledge as basis for creating new technology and sometimes has to look for solutions outside the scholarly research field, based on the existing research and engineering experience and technological monopoly as a result of his/her own developments and inventions. Some specific aspects of the preparatory works and related problems, as well as the possible ways for their effective solution have been considered. Several proposals aiming at ensuring the equipment efficiency at all stages of new model life cycle have been presented. Conclusions. Ukraine remains among a few countries having a full technological cycle of development and manufacture of highly advanced information systems. However, to ensure sustainable development of the in dustry, the necessary conditions are the availability of R&D experience and the development of their own innovation technologies.","Lavrich, Y.

Evolutionary Analysis of Cloud Manufacturing Platform Service Innovation Based on a Multiagent Game Perspective,"With the rapid development of cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other new generation information technologies, a new service-oriented networked intelligent manufacturing mode-cloud manufacturing (CMfg), is emerged. In the CMfg paradigm, cloud manufacturing platform service innovation is an effective way to improve the service function, service quality and service efficiency of cloud manufacturing platforms. However, the service innovation of cloud manufacturing platforms is complex system engineering, which needs to consider many participants with independent interests simultaneously. If one party's behaviour strategy changes, the whole system will be affected. In order to adapt the decision-making management of manufacturing service innovation in cloud manufacturing system, to provide the effective decision-making support for service innovation of cloud manufacturing system in uncertain environment, to explore the interaction mechanism and equilibrium strategy of various stakeholders in the evolution process of cloud manufacturing system. This research constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model among participants based on evolutionary game theory, Analyses the influence of participants' strategy choices, The Cloud manufacturing platform's service quality coefficients and users' preference Coefficients on the equilibrium state stability of cloud manufacturing systems, and uses MATLAB software for numerical simulation. The results show that the evolutionary stability strategy of cloud manufacturing enterprises plays a decisive role in the service innovation of the cloud manufacturing platform. When cloud manufacturing enterprises choose a noncooperation strategy, the evolutionary stability strategy of the cloud manufacturing platform is innovation. When cloud manufacturing enterprises choose a cooperation strategy, the evolutionary stability strategy of the cloud manufacturing platform is affected by the platform's service quality coefficient and the user's preference coefficient, and both factors can promote the evolution of cloud manufacturing platform service innovation. The platform's service quality coefficient has a threshold value, which depends on the relative size of benefits, costs and user's preference coefficient generated by the service innovation of the platform. Therefore, in the cloud manufacturing mode, the cloud manufacturing platform must rely on different enterprises to provide their own innovation resources to realize the service innovation of the cloud manufacturing platform, so the cloud manufacturing platform should focus on introducing a group of high-quality cloud manufacturing enterprises for cooperation. In addition, users' strong demand for high-quality services can provide sufficient impetus for cloud manufacturing enterprises to choose cooperation and cloud manufacturing platforms to choose innovation, which can not only encourage cloud manufacturing platforms to provide personalized services for users but also avoid the extra waste of resources.","Xin, Yuhong;Liu, Dehui;Zhou, Xindi",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Jinan University;Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University,Cloud manufacturing platform ;  multiagent perspective ;  service innovation ;  tripartite evolutionary game

Based on the random forest algorithm, a preparation setup model of accounts receivable and payable audit is constructed, and its application in case corporations is analyzed, which provides new ideas for the modern audit work mode and creates a dynamic and open business simulation environment for the financial administration experiment. The results show that the classification accuracy of the improved K-fold random forest algorithm is 1.54% higher than that of the traditional random forest algorithm, and the accuracy of the crisis preparation setup model in predicting the actual enterprise financial crisis reaches 90.327%, which is feasible and effective in the preparation setup of enterprise financial administration and provides a new research idea for the construction of the preparation setup model of enterprise financial administration. Financial management is the core part of enterprise management activities, and it is also an important factor affecting the comprehensive competitiveness of corporations. Therefore, on the basis of fully studying the objective regularity of financial activities, improving the financial administration algorithm, applying the random forest algorithm to enterprise management, and building a perfect management system can comprehensively control the financial administration activities of corporations and realize the innovation of financial administration activities from the aspects of data collection, fund management, and internal control, which is conducive to promoting the continuous improvement of the efficiency of enterprise financial administration.","Zhao, Fang",Journal,Mobile Information Systems,2022-01-01,Henan Industry and Trade Vocational College,
Global Requirement Engineering Through Secondary Market Research: Lessons From Real Consulting Projects,"Requirement Engineering (RE) for determining a product's value proposition involves a close relationship with potential customers in order to better understand their requirements. The startup community investigates market demands through a series of experiments in which assumptions are continually validated as the product evolves. Validation is typically accomplished through colocated meetings with consumers, an activity that will be hampered by the pandemic's constraints. Due to pandemic effects and resource constraints, targeting worldwide markets and taking advantage of global demand is not viable without technological support and innovation in the way RE is conducted. Secondary market research using Google technologies, for instance, Google Market Finder and Google Ad Preview tool, could be effective for worldwide market expansion for the startup community. Small- and medium-sized firms have adopted this as one of the best practices for global market expansion - lessons learnt through internal strategy management and marketing management disciplines. The ideal way to investigate global RE, RE conducted with worldwide markets, is to use Google technology's analytical support, followed by primary research. Secondary research allows resource-constrained startups to explore wide global markets with minimum effort, narrowing them down to valuable information, making primary research with focused market segments possible. The interdisciplinary research will make a significant contribution to the pandemic while also serving as a model for the new normal.","Gupta, Varun;Rubalcaba, Luis;Gupta, Chetna",Journal,IT Professional,2022-01-01,Jaypee Institute of Information Technology;Universidad de Alcalá,

Framework for Assessment of Societal Impact of Innovation: A Case of Transport and Mobility Sector,"A slow-down in economic performance of various countries created a huge attention in seeking the solutions and new sources of growth that can improve the GDP growth. These include the role of science, technology and innovation. However, there is also a recognition that innovation can be used for improvement of society in terms of health, education, mobility, food security, water security, security, etc. While there is a plethora of frameworks that deal with research, technology and innovation assessment for economic impact, there is still a knowledge gap regarding the impact on society. The challenges include the absence of common assessment framework and in some cases the lack of comparable indicators. A framework for assessment of innovation for social impact is proposed in this paper by identifying internationally comparable social indicators. Through citation analysis of scientific publications, the identified societal issues are then mapped to the science, technology and innovation activities. A transport and mobility sector is used as a case study. Both transport and mobility have great influence on the societal dynamics and quality of life.","Letaba, Petrus",Conference Proceeding,"PICMET 2022 - Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology: Technology Management and Leadership in Digital Transformation - Looking Ahead to Post-COVID Era, Proceedings",2022-01-01,University of Pretoria,

Earthquake and Structural Engineering Science for Civil Protection,"The importance of a close relationship between civil protection organizations and scientific community is widely recognized today at international and European level. In this perspective, research projects on risks are more and more focused on the production of outcomes that are application oriented, requiring the involvement of civil protection organizations, and creating a well-structured knowledge network within a European civil protection framework. For about forty years, the Italian civil protection has relied upon the scientific community to find the best solutions, or at least those based on the most advanced and consolidated knowledge, for activities that concern the entire disaster risk management cycle: from forecasting and prevention to the management and overcoming of the emergency, as well as for repair and reconstruction activities after major events. The interactions between civil protection and scientific community take place in Italy mostly through the so-called Competence Centers and the Major Risk Commission. They both work with an interdisciplinary, multisectoral and, when needed, multi-hazard risk approach. This paper aims to describe how the Competence Centers, i.e. the scientific operational partners that provide products resulting from research and innovation activities that can be integrated in civil protection activities, operate in a way that has evolved over the years, as the advice of the scientific community has become increasingly fundamental in the decision-making process for civil protection. The focus will be especially on the scientific activities and some important results and products related to seismic risk and structural engineering applications.","Dolce, Mauro",Book Series,Springer Proceedings in Earth and Environmental Sciences,2022-01-01,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,Civil protection ;  Competence centers ;  Disaster risk reduction ;  Earthquake engineering ;  Structural engineering

Legal Accountability as Software Quality: A U.S. Data Processing Perspective,"Software and hardware innovation has led to new consumer products and services with significant benefits to consumers and society. These advances, however, can come with great cost to society when they fail to comply with government laws and regulations. While compliance failures do result from technical missteps in design, there is also a wide gap between the technical expertise and culture of legal analysts and software engineers, as well as competing priorities between legal requirements and business objectives. In this perspective paper, we propose changing legal compliance from a corporate oversight activity to a principal design activity, wherein lawyers and software engineers employ enhanced methods and tools tailored to bridge the cultural and knowledge gap and assess legal and business trade-offs. To that end, we describe a new software quality, called Legal Accountability, which can be evaluated alongside other qualities, such as usability, modifiability, performance and testing. Legal Accountability has five properties that lawyers and designers must attend to, including legal traceability, completeness, validity, auditability and continuity. We illustrate the quality with examples from the U.S. data processing perspective, and prior work in requirements engineering, before concluding with future and ongoing research challenges.","Breaux, Travis D.;Norton, Thomas",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering,2022-01-01,School of Computer Science;Fordham University,compliance ;  law ;  regulations ;  software quality
Profitable development technology of the Changning-Weiyuan National Shale Gas Demonstration Area in the Sichuan Basin and its enlightenment,"Since the approval to establishment, the Changning-Weiyuan National Shale Gas Demonstration Area in the Sichuan Basin (hereinafter referred to as Demonstration Area) has been built up into a shale gas industry demonstration base characterized with scale, technology, management and green after more than 10 years of exploration and practice. And its successful experience is of great guiding significance to the efficient development of unconventional oil and gas resources in China. In this paper, the technologies which were developed for the benefit development of the Demonstration Area during the 13th Five-Year Plan are systematically reviewed and summarized. Then, some countermeasures are proposed to solve the difficulties and challenges to the long-term benefit and stable production of middle-deep shale gas in this area. And the following research results are obtained. First, during the construction of the Demonstration Area, the ""three-control"" shale gas enrichment and high-production theory is innovatively proposed, and the shale gas enrichment model in the southern Sichuan Basin is clarified. Second, a high-production well cultivation method based on geology-engineering integration is established by developing six main technologies for shale gas exploration and development, which effectively supports the large-scale benefit development of shale gas in the Demonstration Area. Third, the benefit development model of middle-deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin is preliminarily formed, and the benefit and efficiency of productivity construction are improved comprehensively. Fourth, the three measures of ""controlling the decline rate, enhancing the reserve production and expanding the periphery"" are used to support the replacement and stable production of middle-deep shale gas. In conclusion, to sustainably ensure the long-term benefit and stable production of shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin, it is still necessary to deepen fine reservoir description and complex mechanism understanding and explore EOR technologies and methods. What's more, the important mean to improve the single-well shale gas production rate in this area is to strengthen the fine fracturing design and implementation under the deep integration of geology and engineering and improve the construction quality of fracturing network continuously. Furthermore, the only way to the low-cost development of the demonstration area is to promote the management reform and innovation continuously and improve the benefit development model further. .","Yong, Rui;Chen, Gengsheng;Yang, Xuefeng;Huang, Shan;Li, Bo;Zheng, Majia;Liu, Wenping;He, Yiping",Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2022-01-01,PetroChina Company Limited;China National Petroleum Corporation,"Changning-Weiyuan ;  Geology-engineering integration, Profitable development ;  Middle-deep formation ;  National shale gas demonstration area ;  Resource Enrichment and high-production ;  Sichuan Basin ;  Stable production optimization"
"Deep shale gas exploration and development in the Weirong and Yongchuan areas, South Sichuan Basin: Progress, challenges and prospect","Benefit development of shale gas has been achieved in areas above 3 500 m in depth in China, and relatively thorough geological theories and exploration & development technologies have been formed. Although the deep shale gas at such depth is of good geological parameters, it is difficult to develop effectively due to worse engineering and geological conditions. In order to improve the exploration and development benefit of deep shale gas, based on comparison of geological–engineering parameters between deep and medium shale gas, taking the deep shale gas in the Rongwei and Yongchuan areas as an example, this paper summarizes the technical progresses in geology, drilling, completion, fracturing, production, and transportation, analyzes the involved problems and challenges, and predicts the future development direction. The following results were achieved. (1) The basic geological characteristics of deep shale, such as geochemical indicators, content of brittle minerals, porosity and gas-bearing property, are similar to those of medium–deep shale, but the engineering and geologic features are more complex, with the characteristics of high geostress, high horizontal stress difference, high plasticity and high formation pressure. (2) Due to the less developed fractures within the deep shale and complex geostress of the study area, the effective fracturing volume is small, leading to a low initial productivity, rapid production decline, low EUR and high fracturing fluid backflow rate, which have restrained the benefit development of deep shale gas. (3) A complete set of key matching techniques have been established for the exploration and development of deep shale gas, such as evaluation and prediction of sweet spots, integration of geological modeling–fracturing simulation–numerical simulation, excellent and fast drilling and completion, volume fracturing, production management with ""three-precises"" and intensive gas production. (4) Currently, the exploration and development of deep shale gas are facing several key problems (such as casing deformation, fracturing pressure channeling and poorly reservoir reconstruction effect), so technological research on geological evaluation, geological modeling–numerical simulation, drilling, fracturing, production–transportation should be carried out constantly. In conclusion, to form key technologies for deep shale gas exploration and development is of great significance to improving China's shale gas supportability. However, the theoretical understanding and engineering technology innovation during exploration and development of deep shale gas is a long-term process, which needs long-term investment and progressive breakthrough to realize large-scale and benefit development of deep shale gas.","Guo, Tonglou;Xiong, Liang;Lei, Wei;Zhao, Yong;Pang, Heqing",Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2022-01-01,Sinopec,Challenge and prospect ;  Deep shale gas ;  Exploration and development ;  South Sichuan Basin ;  Technical progress ;  Weirong ;  Yongchuan
Deep shale gas exploration and development in the southern Sichuan Basin: New progress and challenges,"There are abundant marine shale gas resources in the Sichuan Basin. After almost one decade of exploration and development, three national shale gas demonstration areas have been built in the Sichuan Basin and its periphery, and large-scale commercial development of middle and deep (above 3 500 m in depth) shale gas has been successfully achieved. The volume of deep shale gas resources (3 500 – 4 500 m deep) of the Upper Ordovician Wufeng Formation-Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation in the southern Sichuan Basin is 6.6×1012 m3, with huge exploration and exploitation potential, so it is an important area for large-scale shale gas production increase in China during the 14th Five-year Plan. Deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin is influenced by complex geological engineering conditions, such as great burial depth, high temperature and pressure, and large stress and stress difference, and its high-quality development faces many challenges. After systematically summarizing the new progresses and achievements in deep shale gas exploration and development in the southern Sichuan Basin, this paper analyzes the difficulties and challenges in deep shale gas exploration and development and puts forward the next research directions. And the following research results are obtained. First, based on early practical exploration and independent innovation, key shale gas exploration and development technologies with good area selection, good well deployment, good well drilling, good well killing and good well management as the core are formed, and the cultivation mode of high production well is established, which supports the large-scale benefit development of deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin. Second, systematical analysis indicates that the exploration and development of deep shale gas still faces a series of challenges in such three major fields as basic theory, key technology and management mode. Third, in the face of challenges, it is necessary to deepen basic theory research related to exploration and development, continuously improve key main technologies and constantly innovate mechanisms, systems and management modes. In conclusion, after years of continuous researches and pilot tests, a series of main exploration and development technologies suitable for the working conditions of deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin have been basically formed, the first deep shale gas reserves of trillion cubic meters has been submitted, and the first deep shale gas production increase block of ten billion cubic meters has been selected. Thus, great progresses have been made in the exploration and development of deep shale gas, which confirms the confidence and determination in exploring and developing deep shale gas and is of great guiding significance to the rapid development of shale gas industry in China.","He, Xiao;Chen, Gengsheng;Wu, Jianfa;Liu, Yong;Wu, Shuai;Zhang, Jian;Zhang, Xiaotao",Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2022-01-01,China National Petroleum Corporation;Ltd.,Challenge ;  Deep shale gas ;  Exploration and development progress ;  Geology–engineering integration ;  Southern Sichuan Basin ;  Wufeng–Longmaxi
Key technologies and prospects of deep shale gas engineering in the southern Sichuan Basin,"There are abundant deep shale gas resources in the Sichuan Basin, and their exploration and development prospect is promising, but deep shale gas reservoirs are of great burial depth, high temperature, and Complex geological condition, which bring a series of challenges to drilling and completion engineering, so benefit development of deep shale gas faces great challenges. Since 2018, distinguished drilling & completion technologies for shale gas above 3500 m in depth have been explored and developed by analyzing and summarizing the engineering technologies for shallow shale gas below 3 500 m in depth. And six key series of technologies are mainly developed as follows. (1) Drilling efficiency is greatly improved by optimizing efficient bits and ROP improvement tools, controlling pressure and reducing density, and using coiled tubing. (2) The complex accident prevention and treatment technology with casing program optimization and three-pressure profile prediction as the main body is improved, so the complex accident prevention and control ability is improved. (3) Supporting high-temperature rotary steering tools are optimized, and combined with the independently developed cooling device, the downhole operating environment of the tools is improved and the number of trippings is reduced. (4) Fracturing operation parameters are enhanced, and the characteristic technologies such as volume fracturing and ultra-high pressure fracturing are improved, which improves the stimulation effects significantly. (5) The engineering operation intelligent support system for the whole professional chain of wellbore engineering is developed and the digital wellsite is constructed, which empowers the engineering technology and assists the scientific decision making, so as to improve the remote technical support. (6) the drilling waste treatment technology is developed independently, which meets the requirements of green and low-carbon and realizes clean production. These technologies effectively support the exploration and development of deep shale gas and play a leading role in technological progress and management innovation. In conclusion, deep shale gas engineering technologies need continuous technological research and management innovation, so a series of key technologies suitable for the working conditions shall be developed as soon as possible to meet the need of sustainable exploration and development of deep shale gas, so as to ensure the effective production of deep shale gas from the perspective of technology.","Tan, Bin",Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2022-01-01,China National Petroleum Corporation;National Energy R&D Center of High Sulfur Gas Exploitation,Deep shale gas ;  Development prospect ;  Drilling and fracturing ;  Engineering technology ;  Intelligent support ;  Southern Sichuan Basin
A Spontaneous Adoption of AR Technology a manufacturing industrial context,"Digital transformation is a process encompassing all organizations, requiring a proactive attitude and willingness to change. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the relevance of digitization through an increased awareness and implementation of digital tools for working life. The next wave of successful innovation in industry demands high-pitched adoption of technologies for production and workplace learning systems. Organizations are trying to understand which technologies to invest in, based on usability measures, cost effectiveness, and sustainability. It can be hard to predict which technology is best suited for specific tasks. This implies a growing risk regarding investments in technology. This paper describes the spontaneous use of technology for augmented reality (AR, Microsoft HoloLens 2) in a Norwegian manufacturing company during Covid-19. The case illustrates how AR technology can be used in assembling, installation and acceptance testing of machinery for selective soldering in the production of circuit boards. Data were collected through case study research and a qualitative research design, through observation and interviews with the participants. The results show that Microsoft HoloLens 2 is easy to adopt and could contribute to immediate and real value creation in industrial production companies. We believe that the spontaneous usage of AR technology in such extraordinary circumstances as a pandemic could motivate and guide other businesses facing important decisions related to technology implementation.

Improving Students' Learning Motivation and Attitude in Physical Education by Using Algorithm Thinking Innovation Teaching Method,"Physical education (PE) learning activity types can influence students' motivational beliefs, physical activity participation, and persistence/effort in class. Due to motivational and attitudinal aims in the curriculum and the lack of study on student experiences with physical activity, the technological features of today's society have favored the presence of information and communication technology (ICT) and the advent of new training methods in educational institutions. This article addresses the flipped learning-based thinking innovation teaching method (FL-TITM) as an innovative methodology for teaching and learning physical education to improve students' motivation and attitude. This research aims to briefly present the flipped learning method and determine and critically analyze the crucial pedagogical models. This allows us to identify the approaches and electronic tools on the Web. Physical education 2.0 and ICT as an online learning environment may better aid and establish physical education content and motivate learners in flipped learning. The data were collected using semistructured interviews. A total of 100 learners from an educational center in China participated and were compared with nonflipped learning students. These participants have been chosen intentionally. The outcomes show that the flipped learning method linearly and positively impacts academic performance and correlational support and motivation. The test results show that our FL-TIIM has a high self-efficacy ratio of 96.7%, a positive attitude level of 98.6%, a student motivation ratio of 95.3%, an interaction ratio of 98.5%, and a performance ratio of 90.3%.","Qu, Xiaobo",Journal,International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems,2022-01-01,Pingdingshan University,
Innovation Network Reconfiguration Makes Infrastructure Megaprojects More Resilient,"Innovation management of infrastructure megaprojects is a challenging task. There are many risks in the process of innovation in engineering technology, such as shortage of funds, policy fluctuations, and difficulties in the transformation of achievements. Meanwhile, innovation organizations involve multiple participants, which makes cooperation complicated. Therefore, resilient innovation is proposed and considered as a tool that can optimize innovation management. The resilience of innovation depends largely on partnerships at the organizational level, which is rarely explored in current studies. This research aims to examine the relationship between organizational resilience and innovation network characteristics. Based on a survey of 164 participants in infrastructure innovation projects, the structural equation model (SEM) is used to explore the factors that influence organizational resilience. The findings show that there is a positive correlation between network characteristics and organizational resilience. Furthermore, the strength of network connections has a direct impact on the preventive and resistance ability of resilience. Network heterogeneity has an impact on the dual ability of resilience. Finally, a case study of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway innovation network shows that based on the above influence paths, we can find a strategy to reconstruct the network to improve resilience.","Sun, Ruijiao;Liu, Yisheng;Zhao, Jianghu",Journal,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2022-01-01,Beijing Jiaotong University;Ltd.,
Modeling aquaponics: a review on available models and simulation tools,"Introduction. Aquaponics is quickly expanding. Specific models and modeling tools have been developed within different studies.

Furthermore, it identifies the current needs to lead further modeling developments. Conclusions. Several powerful models and modeling tools have been developed but are highly specific to their research scope and are often inaccessible. The modeling knowledge specific to aquaponics is at an advanced stage but is scattered among many different works. Therefore, it is evident that a shared and accessible modeling tool, which is currently missing, would greatly accelerate the development of aquaponics.","Stalport, Benoît;Raulier, Pierre;Jijakli, Mohamed Haïssam;Lebeau, Frédéric",Journal,"Biotechnology, Agronomy, Society and Environment",2022-01-01,Université de Liège,Agricultural innovation ;  aquaculture engineering ;  mathematical models ;  numerical analysis ;  precision agriculture

Catalysis research in rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries,"Due to increasingly high demands for advanced energy storage systems, rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries have received extensive attention in recent years for the advantages of low cost, high theoretical energy density, and environmental friendliness. However, the shuttle effect induced by lithium polysulfide intermediates and kinetically slow redox reactions limits the utilization of active materials and results in rapid capacity degradation, therefore hindering practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries. In order to solve these problems, researchers firstly have adopted physical confinement and/or chemisorption of polysulfides to alleviate the shuttle effect. However, these strategies confront a dilemma that physically confined or chemisorbed polysulfides will eventually become saturated and so to trigger shuttle effect. If the adsorbed polysulfides can be rapidly converted to immobile solid phases, the shuttle effect could be mitigated. In this regard, researchers have adopted the concept of “lithium-sulfur catalysis” to promote kinetics of polysulfide conversion reactions. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances in designing principles of catalytic materials and systems adopted in lithium-sulfur batteries, with aspects to both heterogeneous and homogeneous systems. For heterogeneous systems, one research direction is to regulate processes at both cell and electrode levels using solid catalysts. At the cell level, considering the “dissolution-deposition” mechanism in which active materials are subjected to multiple phase transitions (solid-liquid-solid), it is vital to define the key step that determines the apparent reaction rates so that researchers could employ materials able to selectively catalyze the key processes. Therefore, some works are discussed with a focus on methods to quantify all-phase catalysis kinetics. To simultaneously catalyze multiple processes, “bidirectional” catalysts are introduced to enable regulation of both discharge and charge processes. At the electrode level, progress regulation focuses on the synergy between electron conduction, adsorption, and catalysis. Bulk electrical conductivity and surface polarity are identified as two key parameters of solid catalyst design for lithium-sulfur catalysis. Some works propose heterostructured catalysts to incorporate the above two parameters into one design. In addition to the catalytic processes, the reconstruction and deactivation of solid catalysts are also important processes occurring in a working battery. Some meaningful works are summarized, highlighting the dominant role of complex interactions between catalysts and polysulfides or other electrolyte components in this aspect. Once the diffusion process is no longer rate-determining, the catalytic efficiency will be governed by the adsorption/desorption and surface reaction. This motivates the optimization of catalytically active sites and catalyst structure, which presents as another research direction of heterogeneous lithium-sulfur catalysis. There are a number of effective methods to regulate the structure and catalytic performance of solid catalysts, include doping, vacancy engineering, and cooperation between multisites. On one hand, introducing heteroatoms or vacancy defects to solid catalyst can induce changes in the local electronic structure and thus modify the properties of these sites. On the other hand, cooperation between multisites with controlled “sulfiphilicity” and “lithiophilicity” is proposed beyond single-site catalysis. The cooperative sulfiphilic and lithiophilic sites that simultaneously bind heteropolar Li/S atoms are able to facilitate the dissociation or reorganization of end-group Li−S bond in polysulfides. Representative catalysts with multisite synergy are reviewed. For homogeneous systems, the soluble and mobile nature of a homogeneous catalyst allows it to fully contact immobile reactants in lithium-sulfur batteries, such as sulfur and lithium sulfides solids. Homogeneous lithium-sulfur catalysis process is usually realized by the use of soluble redox mediators (RMs). By tuning the redox potential and diffusivity of RMs, both sulfur reduction reactions and lithium sulfide oxidation reactions could be delicately regulated. A number of typical RMs are discussed. However, similar to polysulfides, soluble RMs also suffer from severe shuttle effect. Hence, a (semi-)immobilization strategy for RM design is proposed to circumvent the inherent RM shuttle problem. Moreover, the semi-immobilization strategy can be extended to heterogeneous lithium-sulfur catalysis to endow catalysts with both heterogeneous and homogeneous characteristics. As a consequence, strongly coupled heterogeneous and homogeneous processes in lithium-sulfur batteries can be regulated concurrently. At the end of this review, the main challenges and possible directions for future innovations in lithium-sulfur catalysis are proposed, which are expected to boost development of practical lithium-sulfur batteries and analogous energy chemistry devices.","Zou, Bo Bo;Liu, Xinyan;Peng, Hong Jie",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2022-01-01,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,heterogeneous catalysis ;  homogeneous catalysis ;  lithium-sulfur battery ;  shuttle effect

Discussion on New Engineering Talent Training System of Petrochemical Emergency Based on Multi-Integration,"A deep understanding of the existing problems in the traditional engineering specialty plays a curial role in building the new engineering curriculum. The achievement orientation, curriculum crossover, and content connection induce the lack of practical, innovative, and forward-looking in traditional engineering, which weakens the high-quality development of engineering students. Here, we propose a new engineering curriculum based on a multi-disciplinary and cross-integration system, meeting the development requirement of the engineering ability and scientific-technological innovation. We adopt the multi-integration training mode, collaborating with multi-resources of government-user-industry-university-research and cross-collaborating with multi-disciplinary of science-engineering-literature-management-law-medicine. The new curriculum system promotes students' comprehensive ability on the petrochemical emergency foundation, engineering practice, engineering innovation, and multi-innovation, fulfilling the theoretical, practical, engineering, and innovation cultivation requirements, respectively. We apply this curriculum system to cultivate under-graduates of petrochemical emergency engineering disciplines, improving their comprehensive ability significantly. The results may reference the new engineering education reform and associated curriculum system construction.","Men, Jinlong;Liu, Mei;Kang, Fangchao;Zhao, Fulei",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2022 International Symposium on Educational Technology, ISET 2022",2022-01-01,Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology;University of Petrochemical Technology,curriculum system construction ;  multi-integration ;  new engineering ;  petrochemical emergency response

Where Does Digital Entrepreneurship Go? A Review Based on a Scientific Knowledge Map,"There is more and more digital entrepreneurship emerging in practice, but research on it is rare and scattered, meaning that a review of digital entrepreneurship is important and necessary. Based on a data set covering 19 years of research, from 2003 to 2021, this article reviews 469 available articles from the Web of Science Core Collection. Using a scientific knowledge map, it divides digital entrepreneurship research into two stages, namely the ""emerging stage""(2003-2017) and the ""booming stage""(2018-2021). Research developed slowly in the emerging stage, focusing on the definition of digital entrepreneurship, the influence of digital technology, and antecedents of digital entrepreneurship. In the booming stage, however, digital entrepreneurship research grew explosively. This article sorts out the topics from three aspects, that is, organizational behavior, digital entrepreneurial ecosystem, and business model innovation. Longitudinal research, multi-case studies, mixed methods, and quantitative studies become mainstream, replacing the earlier single-case studies and conceptual analyses. The frontiers of research on digital entrepreneurship focus on digital entrepreneurial ecosystems, business model innovation, digital academic entrepreneurship, digital transformation, and the antecedents of digital entrepreneurship. This article proposes four future directions, including the interaction of digital entrepreneurship elements, the process of digital entrepreneurship with a dynamic perspective, digital entrepreneurship research at the community level, and digital entrepreneurship research in different contexts.","Long, Dan;Xie, Yulu;Wei, Yalong;Zheng, Jie",Journal,Mobile Information Systems,2022-01-01,Hefei University of Technology,
Introduction to ‘Pedagogy of Active and Practical Learning Online’,"Laboratory and practical learning activities play an essential role in delivering Engineering and Science Education. While these activities have traditionally been delivered face-to-face, technology allows moving lab-based learning activities online. In this context, pedagogical considerations must also be part of the implementation. This chapter offers examples of applying these principles to practical and active online learning activities. It demonstrates that more research is required into the efficacy of the diverse delivery mechanisms. Online learning often implies technology-mediated learning, which also offers opportunities for innovation, for example using learning analytics to drive pedagogy. This is important as teacher presence is diminishing at the same time.","Kist, Alexander A.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2022-01-01,University of Southern Queensland,
Investigating Innovation Ecosystems for Wearable Medical Devices,"Wearable medical technologies (wearables) are a type of digital health technology that have the potential to transform the delivery of healthcare by offering a personalized, predictive, and preventative form of patient care.

S2SNet: A Pretrained Neural Network for Superconductivity Discovery,"Superconductivity allows electrical current to flow without any energy loss, and thus making solids superconducting is a grand goal of physics, material science, and electrical engineering. More than 16 Nobel Laureates have been awarded for their contribution in superconductivity research. Superconductors are valuable for sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as climate change mitigation, affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and infrastructure, and so on. However, a unified physics theory explaining all superconductivity mechanism is still unknown. It is believed that superconductivity is microscopically due to not only molecular compositions but also the geometric crystal structure. Hence a new dataset, S2S, containing both crystal structures and superconducting critical temperature, is built upon SuperCon and Material Project. Based on this new dataset, we propose a novel model, S2SNet, which utilizes the attention mechanism for superconductivity prediction. To overcome the shortage of data, S2SNet is pre-trained on the whole Material Project dataset with Masked-Language Modeling (MLM). S2SNet makes a new state-of-the-art, with out-of-sample accuracy of 92% and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.92. To the best of our knowledge, S2SNet is the first work to predict superconductivity with only information of crystal structures. This work is beneficial to superconductivity discovery and further SDGs.","Liu, Ke;Yang, Kaifan;Zhang, Jiahong;Xu, Renjun",Conference Proceeding,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2022-01-01,Yunnan University;Zhejiang University,

"Preparing healthcare, academic institutions, and notified bodies for their involvement in the innovation of medical devices under the new European regulation","Introduction: Favoring innovation by making timely medical technology available to people and by securing patients’ safety is a challenge. Areas covered: The new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) will have a central implication in the development of new devices and could affect their innovation and availability, as well as discourage investment in research within Europe. Expert opinion: Start-ups and small companies might not be able to cope with the increasing complexity and the required changes of perspective. Health-care institutions are facing an increasing availability of complex technologies, while data on their clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness are rarely provided. A partnership/collaboration between health-care institutions, academia, and private industries will enhance their own specific interests with the common goal of improving overall health and quality of life. The complexity of the subject combined with the variety of specialists and stakeholders involved requires the implementation, in hospital centers of clinical excellence, of units dedicated to the whole path of the medical device innovation. Stakeholders should quickly provide adequate measures to facilitate the complex medical device innovation path under the more stringent MDR aimed to increase safety and quality of care.","Garzotto, Francesco;Comoretto, Rosanna Irene;Dorigo, Lorenzo;Gregori, Dario;Zotti, Alessandro;Meneghesso, Gaudenzio;Gerosa, Gino;Bonin, Mauro",Journal,Expert Review of Medical Devices,2022-01-01,Università degli Studi di Torino;Università degli Studi di Padova;Azienda Zero;Thoracic;ASL VCO,clinical investigation ;  clinical trial ;  cost-effectiveness ;  effectiveness ;  engineering ;  innovation ;  MDR 2017/745 ;  Medical device ;  Medical Device Regulation ;  regulatory ;  safety ;  statistics ;  surveillance ;  Value based healthcare

Influence of Management Education on Enterprise Scientific and Technological Innovation Based on K-Means Clustering Algorithm,"Scientific and technological innovation is the source of the survival and development of enterprises and the key to the realization of the goal of prosperity. In recent years, more and more companies have begun to focus on technological innovation, but the results are not significant, so companies have begun to explore the factors that affect their technological innovation. The management is the helm of the development of the enterprise, the main body of the company's actual production activities, and the direct person in charge of the company's management. Its influence on the innovation of the enterprise is self-evident, and the education level of the management directly determines the manager's ability and vision. However, the current research on management mainly focuses on the position change of management and the rights of management and does not involve the level of education of management. Based on this, this article started from the management education and subdivided it with the K-means clustering algorithm, so as to explore the impact of management education on the technological innovation of enterprises. The experiment showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the educational level of management and the technological innovation ability of enterprises, and the correlation coefficient was 1.521. It fully shows that the management with a higher education background will promote the enterprise to carry out scientific and technological innovation practice and continuously improve the enterprise's innovation ability.","Ma, Jun;Li, Zhigang;Liu, Zichan;Zhang, Shan;Lai, Wenling",Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2022-01-01,Wuchang University of Technology;Guangzhou City Construction College,

"4D textiles: Materials, processes, and future applications","Today, electronic sensors, digital controllers, and motors as actuators are required for the function of many technical systems that react to stimuli (robotics, building technology, and medical technology). Four-dimensional (4D) structures can replace these construction principles with reduced complexity. However, the materials, manufacturing, and design methods used are still inadequate. In hybrid manufacturing processes, the advantages of textile manufacturing processes can be combined with the advantages of generative manufacturing processes. In the field of 4D structures, Tibbits (2017) has provided the proof of concept of a hybrid 4D structure consisting of prestressed textile surfaces with printed thermoplastic reinforcements for the first time. Thomas Gries and his research group filed a patent application for 4D textiles in 2016. What is new is the purposeful change in the shape of the hybrid material over time as a result of the interaction of a prestressed, anisotropic textile carrier structure and printed heterogeneous beam structures as reinforcement. Systematic consideration of the elements’ textile surface and selective reinforcements and their relation on the level of interfaces and superior mechanics of elements enables the engineering of the hybrid material. In this chapter, models for the calculation, selection, design, and characterization of possible solutions and test methods are discussed for the elements and their relations. Materials are selected under consideration of the constraints resulting from the relations. Finally, a design methodology based on design thinking for 4D structures is proposed. The hybrid material 4D textile is validated on four application examples (gripper, glove, orthosis, and sportswear). In particular, the application field of end effectors for collaborative robot systems seems to be economically meaningful. An open innovation concept in the form of a collaborative prototype workshop is proposed for the introduction of technology.","Schmelzeisen, David;Kelbel, Hannah;Gries, Thomas",Book,"Smart Materials in Additive Manufacturing, volume 2: 4D Printing Mechanics, Modeling, and Advanced Engineering Applications",2022-01-01,Institut für Textiltechnik of RWTH Aachen University,4D textiles ;  Elastane fibers ;  Gripper ;  Multimaterial ;  Paraboloidal ;  Reinforcements
Forging the Forge: Executing a Renewed Initiative in Concept Engineering at NASA JSC,"Have you ever brought up an idea to your group, organization or company, just to have someone respond 'We've tried that before and it didn't work'? Or 'We looked into that years ago and rejected it'? As if the further back someone had generated the original idea, the worse it was? Popular culture views the past as disposable, and that we must look forward to the future for innovation and big ideas. But the past is valuable. As Dr. John Lennox, a professor at Oxford University, writes, 'New things are old things happening to new people.' Teams at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) started exploring ways to implement our vision statement of 'Dare Unite Ex-plore', a vision acknowledging the need to continually evolve to meet the demands of the future. Through brainstorming and benchmarking other NASA Centers, the authors proposed an'Innovation Team' to meet the vision to work with greater speed and agility, communicate effectively between organizations, improve innovation and increase workforce flexibility. However, when the idea was proposed, it was met with some skepticism given an analogous effort in a prior decade or two. This paper describes how the authors overcame these challenges to implement a collaborative, concurrent engineering framework tailored to JSC's needs. Our process to drive cultural change, the steps taken, and challenges encountered are discussed, including the aspects that were considered given JSC's operation-focused, Program-driven landscape. Modeled after rapid concept development teams like NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Innovation Foundry and NASA Glenn Research Center's Compass team, NASA JSC is laying the foundation of an innovation team called 'The Forge'. This team is as much about getting employees tempered in the ways of innovative thinking as it is about refining design studies and hammering out proposals. The first two pilots of the teaming framework are described with initial results presented in terms of employee engagement and fostering innovation. We also describe the planned future work and next steps to continue to push the initiative forward. Building upon JSC's long heritage in human spaceflight programs and operations, we are forging a renewed emphasis to Dare to expand frontiers, Unite with our partners and Explore space to benefit humanity.","Bannon, Molly;O'Neill, William;Interbartolo, Michael;Black, Jacquelyne",Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2022-01-01,NASA Johnson Space Center,

"Regional opportunities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the capital region Berlin-Brandenburg, Germany","The agricultural sector is expected to grow in importance, but it is also facing several threats along the whole bioeconomy production chain, which must be addressed through both research and knowledge transfer to end users. Innovation in the sector typically comes from research, private industries and farmers themselves, and the growing amount of complex information needs to be quickly and clearly conveyed. In this respect, open innovation frameworks facilitate local validation, testing and adoption of innovations. In 2021, the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy (ATB) started to coordinate the development of the ""Leibniz Innovation Farm for Sustainable Bioeconomy"" in the Berlin-Brandenburg region, including companies and associations, aiming to favor stakeholder dialogue and to secure the acceptance and implementation of innovative methods. Combining Brandenburg rural areas with the tech and innovation ecosystem of the capital city of Germany allows to set-up a unique model farm for circular bioeconomy, where research institutions and stakeholders perform joint inter- and transdisciplinary research. The aim is to develop holistic approaches for a sustainable bio-based circular economy, optimally linking sustainable crop and livestock agriculture, production of healthy food and bio-based materials, and residue management. In detail, the Leibniz Innovation Farm aims to: i) regionally produce healthy food and bio-based materials; ii) close carbon and nutrient cycles; iii) adapt to climate change; iv) promote biodiversity. Three essential strategies will be followed: diversification; digitalization; microbiome management. This Living Lab will be a forward-looking agricultural research facility coupling high-end interdisciplinary research with intensive stakeholder interaction.","Amon, Barbara;Sturm, Barbara;Dragoni, Federico;Hansen, Anja;Weltzien, Cornelia;Amon, Thomas;Prochnow, Annette",Conference Proceeding,2022 ASABE Annual International Meeting,2022-01-01,Leibniz-Institut für Agrartechnik und Bioökonomie e.V.

Critical Success Factors for ERP Systems' Post-Implementations of SMEs in Saudi Arabia: A Top Management and Vendors' Perspective,"Although numerous case studies have determined the critical success factors (CSFs) for enterprise resource planning (ERP) during the adoption and implementation stages, empirical investigations of CSFs for ERP in post-implementation stages (after going live) are in scarcity. As such, this study examined the influence of top management support and vendor support as CSFs on the post-implementation stage of ERP systems in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) established in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). A total of 177 end-users of ERP systems from two manufacturing organizations in KSA that had implemented on-premises ERP systems were involved in this study. Data gathered from structured questionnaires were analyzed using SmartPLS3 and SPSS software programs. The regression analysis was performed to assess the correlations among the variables. Out of seven CSFs identified from the literature, the impact of top management support was significant on user training, competency of internal Information Technology (IT) department, and effective communication between departments, but insignificant on continuous vendor support. Meanwhile, continuous vendor support had a significant influence on continuous integration of the system, but was insignificant on user interfaces and custom code. The study outcomes may serve as practical guidance for effective post-implementation in ERP systems. Referring to the proposed research model, ERP post-implementation success in KSA was significantly influenced by top management support, whereas continuous vendor support displayed a substantial impact on the continuous integration of ERP systems.","Salih, Sayeed Haider;Abdelsalam, Samah;Hamdan, Mosab;Abdelmaboud, Abdelzahir;Hamzah, Muzaffar;Hilal, Anwer Mustafa;Motwakel, Abdelwahed",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University;Omdurman Islamic University;Khartoum University;King Khalid University;Universiti Malaysia Sabah,critical success factors (CSFs) ;  enterprise resource planning (ERP) ;  kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) ;  Post-implementation ;  small and medium enterprises (SMEs) ;  success factors
Research on Technological Divisive Faultlines in Cliques: Evidence From China's Biomedical Industry Innovation Network,"Social identity theory and self-classification theory provide theoretical supports for explaining the formation and action of the technological divisive faultlines. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of technological divisive faultlines on a clique's innovation performance and the moderating effects of geographical proximity and closeness centrality. The data of 119 firm alliance and 351 firms in cliques are collected in China's biomedical industry from 2010-2017. Then, we perform the negative binomial regression by STATA software with these data as samples. The results show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the technological divisive faultlines and clique's innovation performance; geographical proximity has no moderating effect on the inverted U-shaped relationship; closeness centrality has a significant negative moderating effect on the inverted U-shaped relationship between them. Besides, it suggests that the clique's innovation performance under high closeness centrality is higher than that under low closeness centrality, which provides a new perspective for the previous research that forming cliques could break the relational redundancy.","Zhao, Yan;Li, Zheng;Li, Luying;Qi, Niannian",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Shanghai University,cliques ;  Innovation network ;  innovation performance ;  technological divisive faultlines
Development of AMES: Automated ML Expert System,"There has been an exponential rise in the quantity of data in the last few decades and as a consequence of this, the need for Machine Learning based applications has increased in every domain. In recent years, Machine Learning has been used in many fields to achieve significant breakthroughs. These fields include financial services, transportation, healthcare, e-commerce, retail, etc. wherein Machine Learning has been used for innovation, transformation, and optimization to get highly promising results. In today's world, Machine Learning is not used only for research and development applications but also in the enterprise domain. However, traditional Machine Learning methods are dependent on humans and that is not a feasible option for businesses having limited resources and those which cannot invest in a highly qualified data science team. Even in the case of Machine Learning engineers who are in high demand across various industries, improving the efficiency of tasks related to Machine Learning has become a challenge. This calls for the creation of an application that can automate the end-to-end process of applying machine learning solutions to real-world problems. 'AMES: Automated ML Expert System' will make Machine Learning truly available, even to people with minimal expertise in this field. Such a system will increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks, help to avoid errors that might creep in due to manual processes, and democratize Machine Learning by making the power of ML accessible to everybody. Tasks such as Hyperparameter Optimization, feature engineering, data preprocessing, visualization, and even model selection, if automated, will prove to be of great benefit to ML engineers and novice users alike. This project aims to automate all these tasks and make the process of building a model simple, quick and efficient.","Patil, Prithviraj Sanjay;Kappuram, Keertana;Rumao, Russel;Bari, Poonam",Conference Proceeding,"2022 International Conference on Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud and Parallel Computing, COM-IT-CON 2022",2022-01-01,Fr.

Introduction to machine learning techniques: An optical communication's perspective,"Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized a number of science and engineering disciplines over the past few years. It is also being considered as a new direction of innovation to transform future fiber-optic communication systems. Recently, there has been an increasing amount of research in both industry and academia to embed and benefit from ML-based frameworks in various aspects of optical communications and networking and state-of-the-art results have already been achieved in many cases. However, in order to fathom real potential of ML in fiber-optic communication systems, it is imperative to have a basic understanding of fundamental ML concepts. In this chapter, we will describe the reasons behind recent popularity of ML paradigm in optical networks and why/where/how it can play a decisive role. We will discuss mathematical foundations of several key conventional ML techniques as well as modern deep learning (DL) methods from communication theory and signal processing perspectives and identify the kind of problems in optical communications and networking where they can be particularly helpful. The future role of ML as an enabling technology for next-generation intelligent and autonomous software-defined optical networks will be highlighted. A brief discussion on ML tools along with some useful links for online resources will also be provided for the sake of completion.","Khan, Faisal Nadeem;Fan, Qirui;Lu, Chao;Lau, Alan Pak Tao",Book,Machine Learning for Future Fiber-Optic Communication Systems,2022-01-01,Tsinghua University;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Artificial intelligence ;  Autonomous networks ;  Deep learning ;  Machine learning ;  Network intelligence
THE ROLE OF THE QUANTITY SURVEYOR IN ACHIEVING CIRCULAR BUILT ENVIRONMENT AT THE DESIGN STAGE,"The construction industry is becoming more circular by reducing waste, reusing building materials, and embracing regenerative solutions for energy generation and biodiversity conservation. The ramifications of circularity on building operations are complicated, necessitating a comprehensive assessment of the consequences before deciding on the best course of action. In addition, professionals need to perform diversified services in achieving Circular Built Environment (CBE). Thus, the investigation of the involvement of Quantity Surveyors (QSs) with the CBE is important in achieving the CBE during the Design stage. Hence, the study aimed at investigating the role of QSs in achieving a CBE. The research apprehends a qualitative approach inclusive of two expert interview rounds adhering to the Delphi technique and manual content analysis for data analysis. The research findings revealed the important roles of QS in achieving CBE at the Design stage. Accordingly, cost control, cost planning, feasibility studies, measurement and quantification, risk management, value engineering and innovations and technologies were highly agreed upon by the majority of interviewees as important roles of QS during the Design stage.","Victar, H.

Study on Innovation Capability Data of Central Cities in Pearl River Delta Based on Factor Analysis,"In recent years, the innovation capability of the Pearl River Delta region has undergone significant changes. The paper, based on cluster analysis and factor analysis, seeks to analyze the development level, differences, and influencing factors of the innovation capability of the central cities in the PRD in 2020. The results indicate that those factors driving innovation include spending on research, science and technology profit, science and technology output, research potential, education, and consumption level. Based on the scores of the three factors, Shenzhen ranks first with an overall score of 1.233, while Zhuhai ranks last with an overall score of -0.468. The development of innovation capability in the PRD city clusters forms an innovative city network with Guangzhou and Shenzhen as the core, Foshan, and Dongguan as the sub-centers, and other cities such as Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, Huizhou, Zhuhai, and Zhongshan as the third echelon. To enhance the overall innovation capacity in the PRD, an innovation community must be built based on the integration strategy of the PRD region. Greater efforts must be made to enhance the innovation capacity in three aspects: spending on research as well as science and technology profit, science and technology output together with research potential, and education and consumption level.","Gao, Yubo;Li, Rui",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2022-01-01,Guilin University of Electronic Technology,empirical analysis ;  factor analysis ;  innovation capability ;  Pearl River Delta region

BIM-LEAN RELATIONSHIP ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK: A CONCEPTUAL ESTABLISHMENT,"The construction industry is seeking ways to reduce waste (material and production-related process waste) to improve productivity and efficiency. Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Lean are two vital innovations for the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) industry used in the industry to improve aspects of productivity and efficiency. BIM has been used to generate and compare designs to ensure optimum use of resources, reduce design time, improve collaboration between stakeholders, and reduce errors in design and construction. On the other hand, the main agenda of Lean is to reduce (both material and production process) waste, increase value, and thrive for continuous improvement. In the construction industry, BIM and Lean have been mostly used in isolation. However, studies suggest that BIM and Lean have mutual relationships and are complementary to achieve each other’s objectives. To do so, it is very crucial to understand the mechanism behind the relationship and the interaction between BIM and Lean. Informed analysis and understanding of the mutual relationship would help construction management decision-makers to achieve the utmost benefits from the implementation of these two drivers. However, previous studies have explored BIM and Lean relationships, but limited studies were done to support construction management decision-makers in identifying relevant BIM functions to enable Lean or to identify relevant Lean principles to support BIM. Therefore, this paper aims to represent a conceptual BIM-Lean relationship assessment framework by using Design Science Research methodology to identify and measure the relationship between BIM and Lean to support construction management decision-makers.","Rahman, Mohammad Afjalur;Belayutham, Sheila",Conference Proceeding,World Construction Symposium,2022-01-01,Universiti Teknologi MARA,BIM ;  Framework ;  Lean ;  Relationship
"The Multidisciplinary Integration of Knowledge, Approaches and Tools: Toward the Sensory Human Experience Centres","The technological progress of the last decades has significantly contributed to the development and innovation of several areas, such as engineering, architecture, and medicine, providing new possibilities to measure, control, simulate and assess most of the physical phenomena of the environment, and the corresponding reactions of the individuals. This has shifted the attention of researchers toward the need to understand, in depth, the mechanisms which influence the perception and well-being of humans in complex environments (e.g., cities, urban parks). In this light, it can be expected that the first-person experiences will be assumed as the new frontier of future decision-making and design processes, as they may involve representatives of local communities and groups of interest. This approach leads to a multidisciplinary integration and contamination of the scientific competencies for all research groups involved in the so-called holistic research. Overcoming the concept of noise that has dominated until the end of the last century and considering the environmental sounds as a 'resource' rather than a 'waste', with the introduction of the Soundscape approach, psychologists and sociologists have provided several tools (e.g., questionnaires, scales, tasks) to measure the perceptual, emotional, and cognitive reactions of the individuals when they are exposed to the sounds. Different multidisciplinary research groups are involved in studies that adopt, refine, or propose new investigation tools, to assess, modify and manage the sound of cities, and their effects on the satisfaction and well-being of the population. Moreover, the huge development of miniaturised and powerful hardware and software of the last decade allowed the reconstruction of audio-visual scenarios with a very high degree of realism and the possibility of interacting ecologically with the virtual environment in a fully functional immersive experience. The recent possibility to measure the physiological and neurological reactions of the individuals has opened a further road to extend the knowledge about the effects of noise and the weight of the other physical factors on the populations. A scheme of Sensory Human Experience Centres, where approaches, tools, competencies of various disciplines are integrated, is presented. These kinds of centres could represent, in future, the places where they concentrate the selection and validations of design alternatives (e.g., product, building, city and infrastructure scale) at the local and national levels.","Masullo, Massimiliano;Maffei, Luigi",Journal,Vibrations in Physical Systems,2022-01-01,Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli,approaches ;  experiences ;  multidisciplinary ;  multisensory ;  virtual reality
Harnessing the Power of Responsible Innovation: The Shift towards Human-centered Skills and Competences in AI Engineering,"Particularly against the backdrop of several notable incidents of abuse and malicious use of technology, in recent years, ethical issues across all technological fields, including artificial intelligence, have become a prominent topic for public discussion. The European Union, with its industry and academia at the forefront, is now viewed as a pioneer on the world stage for the implementation of an ethical approach toward an ethically-driven, data-empowered society, with efforts such as the High-Level Expert Group of the EC on AI and the European Act on Artificial Intelligence (AIA), to name a few. The rising set of ethical standards for empowering trustworthy and technically sound Artificial Intelligence has unavoidably resulted in an industrial movement toward human-centered skills and competences. The industry demands at any phase of the AI lifecycle are rapidly changing, posing considerable difficulties to academia and its ability to quickly design and implement an industry-relevant curriculum, encompassing both the technical and the ethical requirements for AI professionals. This paper will investigate this shift of demands in the context of the rising body of legal, regulatory, and compliance frameworks, using current research and a needs and market study done as part of HCAIM – a project aimed at establishing a Human-Centered Master’s Program on Artificial Intelligence.","Sharkov, George;Todorova, Christina;Varbanov, Pavel",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2022-01-01,The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences;European Software Institute Center Eastern Europe;Paisii Hilendarski University of Plovdiv;Biopharmaceutical Laboratory Complex,Artificial Intelligence ;  competences ;  education ;  ethics ;  lawfulness ;  skills ;  trustworthy AI

With the concept of ""civic education as the soul, general education as the root, professional education as the foundation,""the strategy of integrating civic education from ""point to surface (Wei, 2015), from history to the present, from inside to outside""is summarized, and a system of assessment, evaluation, and continuous improvement is established. It also establishes a system of assessment, evaluation, and continuous improvement. The strategy has proved to be effective in combining ideological and political education with moral education, enabling students to develop theoretical, institutional, and cultural confidence on the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2004).","He, Zheng Wan",Journal,Journal of Sensors,2022-01-01,Public Foundation College,
Multi-paradigm Modelling for Policy-driven Socio-technical Systems,"Today’s socio-technical systems, intertwined with fast-changing cyber-physical infrastructures, are becoming increasingly complex and must be able to cope with major unexpected events - e.g. health, economic and ecology crisis; digital innovation, pandemics, etc. As a result, these systems, which are governed by policies, experience rapid developments in their regulation requirements. In this context, traditional policy-making processes are slow relative to the present pace of changes they face, often leading to outdated inappropriate governance. We present a research plan for developing a highly configurable framework and set of tools to help policy making by providing support to better specify, analyse, monitor and assess socio-technical systems, taking into account governing policies and their impacts. The framework is inspired from model-based systems engineering approaches, which have been successful for Cyber-Physical Systems, to better formulate, characterise and analyse socio-technical systems and their governing policies. It makes use at its heart of Multi-Paradigm Modelling, to develop, reuse and integrate appropriate domain-specific modelling languages and tools, views and analyses to better address policy making of nowadays rapidly changing complex heterogeneous socio-technical systems.","Diaconescu, Ada;Blouin, Dominique;Ludvig, Alice",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2022-01-01,Institut Polytechnique de Paris;BOKU University,Cyber-Physical Systems ;  Model Analyses ;  Model-Based Systems Engineering ;  Multi-Paradigm Modelling ;  Self-Adaptive Systems ;  Simulation ;  Socio-Technical Systems

"Research on Teaching Reform of ""Tunnel Engineering Construction"" Course Based on BIM Technology","With the continuous development of information teaching, the traditional and single teaching mode can no longer meet the teaching needs. In order to improve the teaching level and cultivate high-tech and high-skilled talents that meet the needs of the society, it is necessary to continuously carry out teaching innovations and reforms. Higher vocational students have a weak foundation, lack of interest in learning tunnel engineering construction, and fail to realize the importance of tunnel engineering construction courses to their professions. Based on many years of teaching experience, in view of the current teaching status of tunnel engineering construction courses in higher vocational colleges, a teaching reform method based on BIM technology to promote tunnel engineering construction courses in higher vocational colleges is proposed. Incorporate BIM theory into the teaching of tunnel engineering for municipal engineering technology students, guide students to learn BIM software independently, and better serve the study of tunnel engineering construction courses with BIM theory. Student performance has been significantly improved, which greatly increases the number of vocational students learning tunnels. Interest in engineering construction, teaching effect is good. At the same time, the teaching quality of tunnel engineering construction courses in higher vocational schools has been improved, and the employment competitiveness of higher vocational students has been improved.","Hong, Qiankun",Conference Proceeding,ICETIS 2022 - 7th International Conference on Electronic Technology and Information Science,2022-01-01,Zhejiang Tongji Vocational College of Science and Technology,

System for Analyzing Innovation Activities in Mergers and Acquisitions by Measuring Technological Distance,"In this study, we construct an analysis system for the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on innovation activities using large-scale patent data in Japan, the U.S., and German. In the analysis, we focus on the technological similarity between the acquirer and the target companies in M&A. Specifically, we use natural language processing to analyze the patent document data and measure the technological distance among companies. In addition, we measure the innovation output in M&A using the patent data and classify the analysis targets according to the size of the technological distance. We also analyze the trend of the innovation output after the announcement. By conducting the analysis, we confirm that the innovation output after M&A announcement tends to increase in the M&A group with medium technological distance. In this result, one of the novelties is the applicability of unstructured data and machine learning methods to the research field of M&A and innovation.","Tamagawa, Nozomi;Takahashi, Hiroshi",Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2022-01-01,Keio Business School,Innovation ;  M&A ;  Natural language processing

"Challenges in developing and deploying AI in the engineering, procurement and construction industry","AI in the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) industry has not yet a proven track record in large-scale projects. Since AI solutions for industrial applications became available only recently, deployment experience and lessons learned are still to be built up. Several research papers exist describing the potential of AI, and many surveys and white papers have been published indicating the challenges of AI deployment in the EPC industry. However, there is a recognizable shortage of in-depth studies of deployment experience in academic literature, particularly those focusing on the experiences of EPC companies involved in large-scale project execution with high safety standards, such as the petrochemical or energy sector. The novelty of this research is that we explore in detail the challenges and obstacles faced in developing and deploying AI in a large-scale project in the EPC industry based on real-life use cases performed in an EPC company. Those identified challenges are not linked to specific technology or a company's know-how and, therefore, are universal. The findings in this paper aim to provide feedback to academia to reduce the gap between research and practice experience. They also help reveal the hidden stones when implementing AI solutions in the industry.","Dzhusupova, Rimma;Bosch, Jan;Olsson, Helena Holmstrom",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE 46th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2022",2022-01-01,Malmö Universitet;Chalmers University of Technology;McDermott,AI in the EPC industry ;  Artificial Intelligence ;  Deep Learning ;  engineering ;  innovation ;  Machine Learning ;  procurement and construction (EPC) industry
Flexible and Robust Real-Time Intrusion Detection Systems to Network Dynamics,"Deep learning-based intrusion detection systems have advanced due to their technological innovations such as high accuracy, automation, and scalability to develop an effective network intrusion detection system (NIDS). However, most of the previous research has focused on model generation through intensive analysis of feature engineering instead of considering real environments. They have limitations to applying the previous methods for a real network environment to detect real-time network attacks. In this paper, we propose a new flexible and robust NIDS based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a multi-classifier to generate a detection model in real time. The proposed system adaptively and intelligently adjusts the generated model with given system parameters that can be used as security parameters to defend against the attacker’s obfuscation techniques in real time. In the experimental results, the proposed system detects network attacks with a high accuracy and high-speed model upgrade in real-time while showing robustness under an attack.","Yu, Kicho;Nguyen, Khanh;Park, Younghee",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Khoury College of Computer Sciences;San Jose State University,Long short-term memory ;  network intrusion detection system ;  real-time data analysis ;  recurrent neural network
Status and prospect of intelligent demolition technology for long-span prestressed concrete bridges,"In order to realize the safe and controllable demolition of long-span prestressed concrete bridges, by analyzing the characteristics and existing technical problems of bridge demolition, the concept of bridge intelligent demolition based on digital twin technology is clarified, and the development stage of bridge intelligent demolition technology is clarified. The application prospect of intelligent bridge demolition based on digital twin technology is prospected, and the research status of digital twin technology in bridge engineering is reviewed. Combined with the case of a bridge demolition project, the application of digital twin technology is explored and applied to continuously improve the internal force of bridge demolition process. State prediction and control accuracy to avoid secondary damage of reused components. The research results show that the demolition of long-span prestressed concrete bridges has the characteristics of uncertain internal force state under constant load and uncontrollable construction state. The structural mechanical behavior during demolition is an instantaneous release process. When the bending moment is positive, there is a risk of floor cracking and roof collapse in the beam section at the pier-beam junction; the structural performance of bridges in service continues to deteriorate under the long-term coupling action of load and environment. There is an urgent need to improve the structural performance through maintenance and reinforcement, but the rate of structural performance deterioration of the “over-medical” bridge structure will continue to accelerate after long-term operation, which will greatly shorten the service life of the bridge. Therefore, appropriate maintenance measures should be taken at the best maintenance time. It can effectively prolong the service life of bridges; however, a series of maintenance and reinforcement measures will make it more difficult to accurately assess and predict the state of bridge structures; intelligent bridge demolition is to use a new generation of information technology to grasp the real stress state of the whole process of bridge demolition in real time. Through the data-driven virtual bridge to carry out self-perception, self-evolution, self-learning, self-assessment, self-decision and self-execution in the process of demolition, the construction innovation mode of human-machine collaborative demolition and automatic intelligent demolition is gradually realized; The station instrument digitally reconstructs the bridge structure, accurately grasps the dead load distribution of the bridge and the hoisting weight of the demolished beam sections, and uses the state inversion method to verify the appearance of the damage before demolition and the structural response during demolition. and evolution law, grasp the internal force state of the structure under constant load, dynamically adjust the monitoring threshold to gradually approach the real stress state of the bridge, so as to identify risk conditions in advance and take active and efficient safety control measures to achieve accurate prediction and control of the bridge demolition process; Then use components for accurate measurement, destructive testing, durability test and real-time monitoring of long-term performance, which helps to improve the measurement accuracy and efficiency of digital detection technology, and promote the research on the long-term performance evolution of bridge structures; bridges based on digital twin technology The research direction of intelligent demolition should focus on the nondestructive testing technology and reduction.","Liu, Yong Jian;Tang, Zhiwei;Xiao, Jun;Liu, Jiang;Gong, Boxu;Wang, Zhuang",Journal,Journal of Architecture and Civil Engineering,2022-01-01,"Chang'an University;China Communications Second Public Bureau Engineering Design and Research Institute;Shaanxi Province ""Four Subjects and One Union"" Bridge Engineering Intelligent Construction Technology School-Enterprise Joint Research Center",Digital twin ;  Full life cycle ;  Long-span prestressed concrete bridge ;  New generation information technology ;  Smart dismantling ;  State Assessment

Research on Modular Management of Railway Bridge Technology Innovation in Complex and Difficult Mountainous Areas,"With China's government facilitating railway projects, more railway bridges (RBs) are gradually built in complex and difficult mountainous areas (CDMAs). The construction activities of RB in CMDAs are facing formidable challenges in terms of the natural environment, technology, and organization management, which are hardly solved by traditional bridge design and construction techniques. Therefore, there is an urgent need for technology innovation (TI). Studies on the management of RB-TI in CMDAs are limited. As such, this study aims to offer an effective modular management approach to RB-TI in CMDAs. A system of demand and obstacle factors for RB-TI in CMDAs was identified firstly based on the literature review and the grounded theory, including seven intermediate codings and 29 initial codings. Then these factors were regarded as the system requirements for modular decomposition, to establish a ""cut-to-fit""modular management approach to RB-TI in CMDAs. A case (i.e., the LD bridge project of the CZ railway) was selected to demonstrate and validate the developed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can be applied to manage RB-TI in CMDAs. The innovation of this study lies in the integration of grounded theory and modular theory and provides modular management ideas and measures for bridge engineering technology innovation. Findings from this study enrich the knowledge body of RB-TI and guide innovation subjects in the practical management of RB-TI in CMDAs.","Chen, Huihua;Cheng, Qintao;Xie, Yingxue;Cai, Chaoxun;Ban, Xinlin;Hu, Xiaodong",Journal,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2022-01-01,Central South University;China Academy of Railway Sciences;Guangzhou Municipal Engineering Design and Research Institute,
Driving Force Mechanism of the Core Green Technology Innovation of Equipment Manufacturing Enterprises towards Industry 5.0 in China,"Green innovation is an important way for enterprises to achieve high-quality economic development, and it is also the way to achieve the goal of double carbon. Green innovation has therefore become a research hotspot. With the acceleration of the digitalization process in equipment enterprises, intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises located at the top of the industrial chain are in urgent need of green core technology innovation activities. In order to explore the internal mechanism of core green technology innovation, this research introduces reputation theory into the evolutionary game analysis process. By constructing an evolutionary game model between the government and intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises, this research analyzes the dynamic factors that affect the selection and evolution of the main strategies of the players in the evaluation game. The results show that corporate reputation, core green technology innovation profit, government subsidies, government reputation, and the cost for the government to support core technology, among other factors, importantly affect the game between the government and the enterprises. At the same time, since both the government and the enterprises are affected by the initial state and the maximization of the interests of both sides of the game, it is difficult for them to spontaneously reach an ideal stable and balanced state through a virtuous circle. The greater the profits and the reputation premium the core green technology innovation brings to the enterprises, the more favorable it is for the enterprises to choose core green technology innovation; government subsidies within a certain range will also drive enterprises to choose core green technology innovation. When the value of enterprise core green technology innovation is low, the cost for the government to support core green technology innovation is lower, enterprises will lose more opportunities and decline in global competitiveness, and it will become more favorable for the government to evolve towards supporting core green technology innovation. On the contrary, the government will gradually transfer its tangible hand to the intangible hand of the market based on the consideration of subsidies, innovation costs, and reputation. The results of this research are intended to provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for Chinese intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises to better achieve green core technology innovation.","Li, Baohong;Song, Peng",Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2022-01-01,Jiangsu University;Harbin Normal University;Harbin Engineering University,

A Green(er) World for A.I.,"As research and practice in artificial intelligence (A.I.) grow in leaps and bounds, the resources necessary to sustain and support their operations also grow at an increasing pace. While innovations and applications from A.I. have brought significant advances, from applications to vision and natural language to improvements to fields like medical imaging and materials engineering, their costs should not be neglected. As we embrace a world with ever-increasing amounts of data as well as research & development of A.I. applications, we are sure to face an ever-mounting energy footprint to sustain these computational budgets, data storage needs, and more. But, is this sustainable and, more importantly, what kind of setting is best positioned to nurture such sustainable A.I. in both research and practice? In this paper, we outline our outlook for Green A.I. - a more sustainable, energy-efficient and energy-aware ecosystem for developing A.I. across the research, computing, and practitioner communities alike - and the steps required to arrive there. We present a bird's eye view of various areas for potential changes and improvements from the ground floor of AI's operational and hardware optimizations for datacenter/HPCs to the current incentive structures in the world of A.I. research and practice, and more.

The Future of Technology-Based Learning at the Open University of Tanzania,"Today, digital transformation in higher education reshapes traditional educational systems toward technology-based learning. In the wake of the global pandemic COVID-19, digital transformation has even accelerated at many universities worldwide due to the pressure put on policymakers and university management to adopt educational technology at their institutions to allow education to continue. Using the case of the Open University of Tanzania (OUT), this article discusses critical factors needed for the successful implementation of technology-based learning and other technological innovations like adaptive learning, for example, in higher education in an African context. We applied a Delphi design, a rigorous research method used for structuring a group communication process to allow a group of experts, as a whole, to deal with a complex problem effectively. In total, 24 experts (e.g., instructors, staff, and students) from different regional OUT centres participated in the Delphi study. The paper presents the results of the first round of the Delphi study on the challenges of technologybased learning identified at OUT providing the first insights into the perceived role, probability, and estimated realisation time of adaptive learning at OUT in the future.

Energy Conservation by using the Integration of Distributed Energy System in Smart Vehicles,"Energy conservation has been the concern of researchers in automobile engineering since the German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. We aim to contribute by developing the case of the independent distribution of energy between the wheels. Our goal is to enable the integration of smart panels in the suspension system for the interpretation of road irregularities. The innovation of this research work is based on the provision of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system for intelligent vehicles that will allow the system to detect the road surface in terms of friction and inclination independently on each wheel. Hence, the vehicle's computer system will be able to provide exactly the energy required for torque Thus, energy consumption will be significantly reduced, while ensuring stability of operation. Through this research work, we propose a Pressure-Sensitive Panel to Vehicle (PSP2V) system in conjunction with digital fluid dynamics simulation. The implementation of the program is based on the solutions of the Navier-Stokes fluid flow equations. Our algorithm could run in real-time on PSPs and interact with the vehicle operating system. The objective is to distribute the appropriate energy between the wheels based on the torque required for proper operation, taking into account the pressure exerted by the road.","Andreas, Andreou;Mavromoustakis, Constandinos X.;Mastorakis, George;Batalla, Jordi Mongay;Pallis, Evangelos",Conference Proceeding,"ENERGYCON 2022 - 2022 IEEE 7th International Energy Conference, Proceedings",2022-01-01,University of West Attica;University of Nicosia;Hellenic Mediterranean University;Politechnika Warszawska,energy conservation ;  energy consumption ;  Internet of Things IoT ;  Internet of Vehicles IoV
Analysis and Practice of Using Modern Information Technology for Classroom Teaching Mode Reform,"In the context of continuous technological progress, the application of information technology in the field of education has gradually opened the door to innovation. The integration of information technology and curriculum is the use of information technology to present the curriculum in a new way in the teaching process. Therefore, compared with the traditional teaching mode, the integration of information technology and curriculum is more flexible and can show the boring classroom vividly and graphically in front of students, thus motivating students to learn actively and improving classroom efficiency. In recent years, with the continuous development of computer technology, the rise of information technology such as data analysis and the Internet of Things has caused a wave of ""Internet+""education. With the promotion of education informatization, the smart classroom has been developed based on modern education technology. As a result, the classroom teaching mode based on modern information technology has become one of the hot spots for research. As a product of the integration of new technologies and teaching, the smart classroom creates a better learning environment for students with features such as intelligence, diversity, and personalization. At the same time, this teaching model gradually cultivates the information literacy of teachers and students while improving learning effectiveness. Also, with the rapid development of modern information technology, integrated teaching has become a popular and common teaching method. In this context, integrated teaching has a great impact on traditional teaching methods. This requires teachers to make corresponding changes in classroom teaching methods, approaches, and strategies in line with the trend of the times. However, although there are many changes, the corresponding teaching theory has not been updated. While modern information technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data have been widely used to track, collect, and analyze human behavior, it has been difficult for teachers to integrate these technologies into their teaching to help them teach effectively. In recent years, a growing number of experts and scholars have joined the discussion on instructional design that incorporates modern information technologies. There is a need to explore how to teach students in depth through big data and other tools, but there is no complete theoretical chain. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the reform and practice of modern Internet-based classroom teaching models. This study begins with an understanding of the current utilization of smart learning platforms in some schools and the teaching needs of IT subjects. After identifying the value of the IT smart classroom teaching model, the current research status of the smart classroom is outlined, and related concepts and theories are outlined and understood. After that, the characteristics of smart classrooms are summarized, and the traditional classroom, flipped classroom, and smart classroom are compared and analyzed.","Liu, Mei;Zhou, Rujin;Dai, Jing;Feng, Xiaoling",Journal,Mobile Information Systems,2022-01-01,Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology,
Analysis and Construction of Software Engineering OBE Talent Training System Structure Based on Big Data,"Software engineering is one of the most active fields of entrepreneurship and innovation in the world, and it is also the core field of the information technology industry. Software talents as the foundation and support are an important weight to determine the future direction of my country's software engineering. How to make colleges and universities cultivate compound software talents with innovative ability and engineering ability and how to guide students to closely combine innovative thinking with social practice are a major challenge faced by the current software process education in colleges and universities in my country. At present, the overall quality of software engineers is poor, which cannot meet the needs of enterprises and training objectives. This paper puts forward the application of the OBE (outcome-based education) model in the training of software talents, which can effectively solve the current problems of talent quality and social demand. The analysis shows that there is a high correlation between collaborative education and satisfaction, and the collaborative education model can effectively improve satisfaction. The investment of scientific research funds can effectively improve the overall quality of scientific research team members. The OBE talent training mode can effectively improve the overall test effect, whether in the experimental set or the test set, the test result of the OBE talent training structure is still the highest, the accuracy rate can reach 94.23%, the recall rate can reach 94.51%, and the F1 value can reach 95.13%. It is fully explained that the identification accuracy is the highest when the OBE talent-training structure is adopted.","Jie, Zhang",Journal,Security and Communication Networks,2022-01-01,Jishou University,
Methodological Prerequisites for the Integration of Modern Paradigms of Engineering and Humanities Education,"The article presents an analysis of modern research aimed at improving existing and building new theoretical models of education. In the context of the industrial revolution “Industry 4.0” in science, along with the most common models, such as personality-oriented, engineering, etc., many other models are used that meet the specifics of education. The literature review also shows that innovation models are an improvement on one of the existing basic paradigms, which brings them closer and increases the possibility of subsequent integration. This indicates the relevance of the formation of a new holistic paradigm of education. The logic of scientific and technological progress also leads to the unification of engineering and humanitarian paradigms. A feature of the methodology of the 6th technological order (Glazyev) is that its key factors, in addition to technical sciences, are cognitive sciences and socio-humanitarian knowledge. The study confirms the need to include the humanities in the content of modern professional engineering education. As a result of the study, it was concluded that further productive technological development of society requires the unification of disparate educational models into a single modern educational paradigm. The fundamental prerequisites for combining models built on the basis of various theoretical directions are contained in scientific methodology, starting with the definition of a single goal of education.","Kuznetsova, Alvina",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2022-01-01,Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University;Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,Engineering education ;  Goals of education ;  Integration of educational paradigms ;  Methodological foundations ;  Scientific revolution
ATSC 3.0 as a Use Case for Public Safety Communications,"Many Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and Fire services across the United States still rely on analog voice paging technology to communicate emergency incident information to responders. The infrastructure for these paging systems is typically owned, operated, and maintained by the local government or agency to ensure coverage includes as close to 100% of the jurisdiction as possible. This paper proposes the use of datacasting technology to provide a redundant method for critical data distribution over a wide area to serve the paging needs of public safety and uses North Carolina as a test case. This concept could lead to cost-sharing, higher reliability, greater collaboration across jurisdictions, and reduced response times. The public deserves the best possible response from the public safety sector and therefore, public safety deserves the best technology available in order to achieve their mission. PBS North Carolina, along with the North Carolina Department of Information Technology First Responder Emerging Technologies Program (FirstTech), presented this concept at the 2019 National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Broadcast Engineering and Information Technology Conference. Much progress has been made since then. Starting in early 2020, a United States Department of Homeland Security Small Business Innovation Research grant was awarded to develop a prototype system that included an encoder and a custom ATSC 3.0 paging receiver with a miniature antenna. This paper will discuss the overall concept and current progress using ATSC 3.0 to address a critical emergency communications need [1].","Engel, Fred;Grasso, Red;Lamb, Chris",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting, BMSB",2022-01-01,The Foundation for PBS North Carolina;Project Technology Strategy Device Solutions Incorporated;FirstTech Program,ATSC 3.0 ;  call alerting ;  digital paging ;  dispatch ;  Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)
Thoughts on Data-driven Discursive Logic and Triangulation of Think Tank,"The rapid accumulation of data resources and the development of analysis technologies have expanded the scope of think tank research, and prompted think tanks to pay more attention to data intelligence. Meanwhile, higher requirements are put forward on the quality and innovation of the think tank. Facing the development needs of think tanks, i.e., modernization, innovation, and conscientization, this paper demonstrates the change of data-driven think tank researches from the perspective of the information chain. The paper analyzes the urgent need to reshape the discursive logic of the think tank, and discusses the construction scheme of triangulation for data-driven think tank research. Finally, several suggestions for optimizing the construction of think tanks are put forward, such as paying attention to the complementarity of correlation and causality, integrating the technical rationality and humanistic values, analyzing from the perspective of cyber-physical-human ternary space, seeking support from multidisciplinary knowledge, and constructing the engineering services of the think tank.","Sun, Jianjun;Pei, Lei;Ma, Yaxue;Li, Yang",Journal,Bulletin of Chinese Academy of Sciences,2022-01-01,Nanjing University;Jiangsu Zijin Media Think Tank,data-driven ;  discursive logic ;  think tank
Culture-shaped Mental Models and the Governance of Innovation in Tourist Destinations - Comparative Evidence from Ecuador and Azerbaijan.,"Destinations in Developing Countries often display shortages when it comes to the creation and use of new innovative knowledge, thus inhibiting their possibilities to unfold the potential of tourism as a means for sustainable regional development. Findings from tourism research increasingly point to the nature of tourism stakeholders' mindsets as an inhibiting factor in this regard. However, empirical evidence is scarce on the complex structure and (culture-shaped) development-processes of those mental models that form the basis of these mindsets. This comparative study of two regional destinations in both Azerbaijian and Ecuador presents a new qualitative approach, based on the GABEK semantic modelling technique, where latent and manifest forms of collective mental models are uncovered together with the cultural ""traces"" left by their formation-process. As a main result, intervention areas for a targeted ""cultural engineering"" are identified on the basis of the extracted mental models that may serve as a starting point for a more systemic governance of innovation in DC-destinations.","Schuhbert, Arne;Muñoz-Barriga, Andrea;Thees, Hannes",Journal,PASOS Revista de Turismo y Patrimonio Cultural,2022-01-01,Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador;University of Eichstaett-Ingolstadt,Azerbaijan ;  Destination Governance ;  Ecuador ;  Innovation ;  Mental Models ;  Role of Culture

Blended learning-based projects as an alternative to innovative learning at this time. This study aims to explore and explain the application of blended learning-based projects in electronics engineering education courses. The research method used is a project-based product design and development carried out by blended learning. We conduct our project activities in higher education special students from Electronic Engineering Education that take part in the learning of this project. Students who participate are only limited to small groups to avoid the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, in 1 small group consisting of 3-5 people and there is 1 group leader who manages the work, while other members are supportive and help complete joint projects. The results of this study show the ability of students to work by implementing project-based learning in producing products, namely Exhaust Fan products based on Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) as a form of a mini prototype that can be used for small household scale industries. The ability of students to work on product manufacturing by applying the principles of project-based learning in the category already has the ability to, skilled and thoroughly working on the project that was planned until it succeeded in becoming a product prototype which was carried out in a project-based blended learning.","Anwar, Muhammad;Hidayat, Hendra;Yulistiowamo, Ika Puspa;Budayawan, Khairi;Zulwisli, ;Osumah, Obaze Agbonluae;Ardi, Zadrian",Journal,International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies,2022-01-01,Universitas Negeri Padang;Ambrose Alli University,blended learning ;  electronics engineering education ;  electrostatic precipitator ;  learning innovation ;  project
An Exploration into Artificial intelligence based advancement in education field,"The improvisation of artificial intelligence inspired technologies like augment and virtual reality for implementation of blended learning in classrooms has created a buzz in the field of education. We conducted a research study to investigate the usage of virtual or augmented reality in teaching, as well as two separate theme analyses, to get a better overview of the challenges and expectations of the educators by adopting these technologies. The first analysis looked into the implementations and reported motives offered by instructors in academic literature for building virtual reality learning environments, whereas the latter looked into the issues that have been documented. According to these assessments, the majority of academics utilize virtual reality to improve students' intrinsic motivation and build their interactions using a limited set of variables such as constructivist pedagogy, collaboration, and gamification. Similarly, the great majority of educational virtual reality deployments discovered in our research are in a small number of educational disciplines. Following that, we introduced and compared a variety of contemporary virtual reality technologies, highlighting their potential to address some of the issues raised in our studies. However, these tools are not without problems, therefore we end this study by proposing various innovative ways to potentially solve them, and prospective possibilities for future academics interested in using these developing innovations to learning.","Sengupta, Eshan;Saini, Munish;Singh, Madanjit;Singh, Jaswinder",Conference Proceeding,"2022 2nd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering, ICACITE 2022",2022-01-01,Guru Nanak Dev University,Augmented reality ;  Classroom Pedagogy ;  Education Technology ;  Modern Education ;  Sustainable Education ;  Virtual Reality
A Service Value Chain Co-Creation Strategy for Citizen-Centric Organizations,"This paper proposes a knowledge-based strategic framework for Service Value Chain Co-Creation (SVCC) in public sector organizations. It adopts an exploratory research design that uses a descriptive research method based on the literature review of relevant studies. The proposed model is rooted in knowledge management (KM), service value chain, and Business Processes Re-engineering (BPR). The integrative citizen-centric SVCC framework demonstrates how public service organizations and citizens get involved, engaged, and participate in service value co-creation. The SVCC framework proposes to capture data from citizens as input, subjects the data to various processes to create information, and offers knowledge-based customized SVCC. This research seeks to help managers focus on re-designing services and offering personalized opportunities to create greater value co-creation. The study could assist in developing the training skills required for service personnel to build effective relationships with citizens, leading to service value co-creation, satisfaction, trust, and confidence in public sector services.","Al-Shammari, Minwir M.",Journal,"Journal of Logistics, Informatics and Service Science",2022-01-01,University of Bahrain,process innovation ;  public service ;  value chain; service co-creation
Design and Research of Low-Cost and Self-Adaptive Terrestrial Laser Scanning for Indoor Measurement Based on Adaptive Indoor Measurement Scanning Strategy and Structural Characteristics Point Cloud Segmentation,"Nowadays, TLS (terrestrial laser scanning) has been a relatively mature measuring equipment categorized to indoor measuring robots, but it is not widely adopted in indoor construction measurement at present. What accounts for its limited application are as follows: (1) the high cost of high-accuracy laser LIDAR and (2) existing TLS equipment does not possess self-adaptation scanning planning and takes no account of efficiency of point cloud processing and consumption of computing power. This paper proposes a novel TLS equipment and a high-efficiency point cloud processing method customized for the novel equipment, with purpose to achieve self-adaption measurement on the basis of indoor characteristics of construction during civil engineering at low cost. This paper mainly presents two parts of innovations: (1) for planning of scanning, the novel TLS features planning sampling density of scanning according to room size and converting scanning data from poses to point clouds, and (2) for processing of point clouds, this paper proposes two novel segmentation algorithms, namely, ""on-boundary segmentation algorithm""and ""on-angular-distance segmentation algorithm,""based on indoor spatial structure features and characteristics of TLS. Besides, this paper presents modified RANSAC-TLS (random sample consensus-total least squares) plane fitting algorithm, on basis of TLS point cloud distribution characteristics and spatial transformation. Through actual measurement test, it is concluded that the ""on-boundary segmentation algorithm""and ""on-angular-distance segmentation algorithm""are suitable for point cloud segmentation in different types of scenes. The modified RANSAC-TLS have made a great improvement on accuracy of fitting versus LS (least squares), TLS (total least squares), and RANSAC-LS. Finally, this paper conducts an experiment by executing an actual measurement and then preliminarily testifies the potential and future application of the proposed novel TLS (terrestrial laser scanning) equipment, with measurement parameters from it being changed in the experiment, by comparing with one existing TLS equipment - FARO. The test thus proves the relatively high feasibility and potential of the novel TLS presented in the paper (terrestrial laser scanning) in actual indoor measurement.","Zhang, Zhongyue;Zhou, Huixing;Wang, Shun;Xu, Chongwen;Lv, Yannan",Journal,Advances in Civil Engineering,2022-01-01,Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture;Beijing Engineering Research Center of Monitoring for Construction Safety,

Status and future development suggestions for China’s polyolefin industry,"In this paper, the development trends of the polyolefin industry at home and abroad are summarized, the challenges and bottlenecks encountered by China’s polyolefin industry for development are analyzed, and some proposals are made from the perspectives of technological creation and research mechanism innovation. While China’s polyolefin industry enjoys the advantage of the largest scale with facilities practicing the most varieties of process technologies for the most diversified feedstocks in the world, also some crucial issues are obvious such as weak international competitiveness and structural contradictions. The reasons are expounded. Firstly, activities in both basic research and applied research are insufficient to initiate breakthroughs in technological innovation with originality. Secondly, inadequate pilot-scale research platforms constrain the speed of translation from bench-scale achievement to industrialization. Thirdly, the technical barrier in engineering, equipment manufacturing, and industrial norms and standards restrict the autonomy and the risk control of the industrial manufacturing of high-end products. Finally, the dependency on the import of crude oil leads to the uncontrollable cost of olefin feedstocks. Some proposals are made to improve the current situation of the polyolefin industry. To achieve technological leadership in the polyolefin industry, areas of breakthrough are identified for research and innovation, which include feedstock and key monomers, high performance catalysts, advanced polymerization process and engineering, high-end product development, innovation in processing technology, product applications and recycled utilization of polyolefin waste for sustainability. To improve the mechanism for research and innovation, the seamless collaboration of “industry-university-research-application” should be encouraged and deepened to carry out fundamental and theoretical researches on polymer physics and chemistry for the advancement in key scientific and technological aspects including catalyst, reaction engineering, process intensification, processing and application. Meanwhile, it is critical to formulate the norms and standards for pilot plant test for the breakthrough of the barrier from bench-scale test to industrialization. In the end, innovation throughout the whole industrial chain is essential to the development of innovative polyolefin package technology with originality, the transformation of polyolefin products to a green future with higher performance and more functionalities and intelligent features, and the high-quality development of China’s polyolefin industry at large.","Wu, Changjiang",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2022-01-01,Beijing Research Institute of Coal Chemistry,catalyst ;  high-performance materials ;  pilot plant ;  polymerization ;  polyolefin industry
Integration of Wearable Devices and English Teaching under Positive Psychology,"Positive psychology, as a core subject to the study of people's positive power and positive quality, is intended to cultivate positive personality traits and positive emotions, and to promote the development of inspiring creativity, cooperation, and interest. The study of positive psychology provides a new perspective for our research in the field of education. The ""New Curriculum Standards for Junior Middle School English""clearly states: ""Students can only maintain the inner driving force of English learning and achieve results only if they have positive emotions in English learning. Negative emotions will not only affect the effect of English learning, but also affect students' long-term development. In English teaching, teachers should pay attention to students' emotions from beginning to end, and strive to create a relaxed, democratic, and harmonious teaching atmosphere. Therefore, how to infiltrate the theory of positive psychology into the frontline English teaching of junior high school becomes especially important. With the advancement of science and technology and the advent of the Internet era, various high-tech information technologies have gradually flourished, and the rapid development of information technology has promoted the reform and innovation of the teaching industry. Wearable technology is the current trend and direction of the information technology revolution. It realizes the interconnection and deep integration of people, machines and objects through the functions of collecting, sorting and analyzing mobile Internet and cloud data. The realization of wearable technology-based wearable technology not only can highly integrate educational resources, improve learning interest, but also enhance the pertinence of teaching, cultivate students' creativity, and realize personalized teaching in ""full time, all-round, all fields.""This article explores the integration of wearable devices and junior high school English teaching in the context of positive psychology. First of all, this paper introduces the theoretical basis of the integration of wearable devices with English teaching. Secondly, it introduces the research methods of this paper.

Sustainability of Concrete as A Civil Engineering Material,"With increasing concern about the environment, energy consumption, climate change, and depletion of natural resources, the importance of sustainability has become mainstream among engineering and scientific communities. Concrete infrastructure is superbly durable and comes with a myriad of benefits. Yet, the production of concrete is energy intensive and represents a substantial portion of air pollution. Largely due to cement manufacturing, concrete represents 7% of greenhouse gas emissions globally and 1% in the United States. Focusing on sector-specific emissions in the United States., this paper outlines the environmental concerns of concrete production and discusses the forefront of research in reducing these effects including innovations in cement manufacturing, alternative clinker technologies, and carbon capture use and storage. Also discussed are various approaches and efforts in concrete recycling and incorporation of industrial wastes and supplementary cementitious materials into concrete. Finally, this study reviews the role of civil engineering design at various scales in the sustainability of concrete infrastructure.","Spelman, David;Lee, Yoon Si",Journal,Engineering Journal,2022-01-01,Bradley University,cement ;  concrete ;  greenhouse gas ;  infrastructure ;  recycled ;  Sustainability
Research on the Automated Generation and Evaluation for Logical Architecture of Complex Products Based on MBSE,"During the early stage of complex products scheme planning, traditional engineering management method based on document has the deficiencies of low precision, inconsistency, incompleteness and poor traceability. Therefore, it is the inevitable tendency of design technique to transfer to digital R&D mode of Model-based systems engineering (MBSE). This paper presents an approach used for logical architecture’s automated generation and evaluation, which is the core technique of MBSE method. A kind of architecture representation language is studied to standardize architecture elements and reduce the solution space size of feasible architectures. Two key techniques are developed to generate and evaluate logic architecture of complex products, one is a mapping method based on case, flow and function-base to generate logic architecture set, and the other is called TOPSIS evaluation method to select optimal logical architecture. A prototype system is developed to verify the feasibility and correctness of proposed theories and methods. It can be well expected that this study can help design innovation, decrease times of product iterations, and improve product design quality.","C. G. Li, ;Liu, Z. D.;Jia, X. D.;Wan, Y.

Deriving Experiments from E-SECO Software Ecosystem in the Technology Transfer Process for the Livestock Domain,"The process of transferring technology from research institutes to industry involves benchmarking it in exhaustive experiments to assure it reaches the established quality criteria. This is also true for the livestock domain, in which the technologies developed to sustainably raise animals production are submitted to experiments while preserving their health and wellness. However, since such institutions often conduct several parallel innovation projects, the establishment of an infrastructure to support those experiments can be costly, repetitive, and error-prone. For that purpose, we developed E-SECO, a software ecosystem that encapsulates a lifecycle model for scientific experiments and its supporting platform and actors. The main contribution of this paper is presenting how the E-SECO architecture was successfully applied to create a livestock architecture (named e-Livestock architecture) from which two different (and independent) scientific experiments involving real systems were deployed and executed in the livestock domain. The first experiment involved a Compost Barn production system, i.e., the environment and surrounding technology where bovine milk production takes place; whilst the second experiment involved an automated monitoring environment for aviaries. Preliminary results showed the effectiveness of E-SECO to (i) abstract concepts of scientific experiments for livestock domain, (ii) support reuse and derivation of an architecture to support engineering real systems for different livestock sub-domains, and (iii) support the experiments towards a future transfer of technology to industry.CCS CONCEPTS • Applied computing ?

Business Driven Microservice Design: An Enterprise Ontology Based Approach to API Specifications,"As technology is evolving rapidly and market demand is changing quicker than ever, many are trying to implement service orientation and adopt market standards to improve adaptivity. A microservice architecture makes applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features. The question then arises how to design a manageable and stable set of microservices that is sufficient for the business. In this paper we systematically deduce an algorithm to derive a set of microservices, expressed according to the OpenAPI standard, from the ontological model of an enterprise, that is stable by nature, sufficient for the business, and based on units of clear size. This algorithm has the DEMO operating cycle at its heart and has been evaluated with the real-life Social Housing case at ICTU by creating a SwaggerHub implementation. Further research should clarify the role of implementation choices in the algorithm.","Krouwel, Marien R.;Op ’t Land, Martin",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2022-01-01,Antwerp Management School;Radboud Universiteit;Capgemini Nederland B.V.,API ;  DEMO ;  Enterprise Engineering ;  Microservices
Static Malware Analysis Using Machine and Deep Learning,"In the era of digital advancement and innovation, malware (malicious software) still poses major threats to users’ privacy and leads to many security breaches. Due to the exponential rise in malware attacks, malware analysis and detection continue to be a hot research topic. Malware analysis plays a vital role in the malware detection process. Currently, the detection process adopts the malware signatures (static analysis) and behavior patterns (dynamic analysis) that have been proven time-consuming and less effective in identifying unknown malware in real time. Recent malware uses abstraction, packing, encryption, polymorphic, and other cryptic methods to hide and change the malware behavior and its signature which makes the detection process complex. Most of the new malware is the variants of existing malware, where machine learning techniques are effective in identifying such malware. However, the traditional machine learning technique is time-consuming because it requires substantial feature engineering and learning. By using the state-of-the-art learning technique such as deep learning, compel the learning process faster. By utilizing the high-level machine learning techniques, the training stage can be completely avoided. In this paper, first, we analyze the old-style MLAs and profound learning models for malware detection using publicly available datasets. Second, we analyze the deep learning models to examine the accuracy over the traditional machine learning technique. Third, our major commitment is in proposing an efficient and accurate model which combines the capabilities of the machine and deep learning technique which detect the zero-day malware efficiently. Our model shows that our proposed method outflanks traditional MLAs and deep learning models.","Singh, Himanshu Kumar;Singh, Jyoti Prakash;Tewari, Anand Shanker",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2022-01-01,National Institute of Technology Patna,Deep learning ;  Dynamic analysis ;  Machine learning ;  Malware ;  Static analysis
The Promotion Strategy Analysis for Green Degree of Railway Engineering Based on a System Dynamic Flow Diagram,"This article made a system dynamics flow diagram (SD flow diagram) to describe the green railway engineering (GRE) system, which provides a theoretical basis for discussing the source and change process of the green degree of railway engineering(GDR) and also provides a practical basis for accurate policy implementation and evaluation promotion of GRE management. Based on the definition of GDR and using ""input-output""relationship to analyze system structure of GRE, set two green goals of environmental and resource cost decreases as the clue, deconstructed practice process based on the principle of construction to form GRE system dynamic flow diagram, which aims to reveal the key influencing factors and promotion path of GDR. The results of the research show that (1) the green schemes set the foundation of GDR, including 3 schemes of green planning, green design, green construction, and determine the expected control values (VE) of 4 status, namely ecological damage degree, environmental pollution degree, land occupation degree, and resources consume degree. (2) The deviation of expected control values (VE) and actual control values (VA) from 4 status is the premise of whether the GDR needs to be optimized or improved, and 2 practice achievements of green knowledge innovation and green culture creation provided different promotion paths for GDR. (3) According to the SD flow diagram constructed by research, the 3 schemes are influenced by regional ecological carrying capacity, social material resource reserve, green knowledge reserve, green talent reserve, reasonable goals setting, strengthening preliminary research, making full use of resources, deepening the connection of procedures, and so on are conducive to build a foundation for GDR. (4) The 4 status are directly controlled by seven rate variables, which promote the dynamic optimization of GDR by technology, equipment, institution management, and behavior management. The SD flow diagram of GRE provides 2 contributions. The first provides an analytical basis for the study of the promotion strategy of GDR, and the second provides a model basis for further quantitative study of GDR.","Tang, Juanjuan;Wang, Mengjun;Tang, Xiaoying;He, Zheng",Journal,Journal of Environmental and Public Health,2022-01-01,Central South University,
Water Care System (WCS) for Numeric Water Quality Criteria (NWQC) with IoT/IoUT-Educational Implications of Sustainability Goal SDG 14,"In most developing countries and evolving countries, availability of potable water is scarce, and the water sources are very often unattended or unmonitored. Island states have the additional problems associated with unheeded pollution from wastewater from the industries and household as well as various ships and tankers. Some of our research efforts have been focused on environmental pollution and continuous monitoring of water quality based on turbidity, temperature, and pH. We focus on selected numeric water quality criteria (NWQC) and present NWQC monitor using an IoT (Internet of Things) and IoUT (Internet of Underwater Things) platform concept, based on already existing systems. Based on field data, some results in monitoring water quality in selected applications are presented. An IoT/IoUT platform realized for monitoring air pollution in Problem-Based Learning (PBL) projects for BSc and MSc students, working with real data and focusing on developing environmentally friendly technological solutions seemed to motivate the students. The project is then extended to the realization of continuous supervision of the waters of both developed and developing nations using IoUT. Useful IoT/IoUT based alerts can reach these ""digitalized""citizens, who can thus be trained to use these NWQC data for an environmentally conscious living and to exert pressure on regulators to safeguard water resources as well as to implement proper environmentally friendly wastewater management and water care system (WCS). Some results and practices with respect to NWQC in the EU, particularly in France and Germany will also be presented in this paper. Finally, the paper addresses one of the sustainability goals of the United Nations, SDG 14, using EE (Electrical Engineering) and IT tools with innovations for environmental protection.","Tretjakova, Rasma;Halvorsen, Hans Petter;Viumdal, Hakon;Mylvaganam, Saba;Timmerberg, Josef;Thiriet, Jean Marc",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2022 31st Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering, EAEEIE 2022",2022-01-01,Jade University of Applied Sciences;University of South-Eastern Norway;Rēzeknes Tehnoloǵiju Akadēmija;Université Grenoble Alpes,digitalizing Water Care System (WCS) ;  Health ;  IoT/IoUT for NWQC ;  Numeric Water Quality Criteria (NWQC) ;  Problem-Based Learning (PBL) ;  Safety and Environment (HSE) ;  Surveilance and Response System (SRS) ;  UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) ;  WHO (World Health Organization)
A framework to enhance students' soft skills within the context of international engineering project collaboration,"Engineers who possess the so-called soft skill competencies are highly valued in today's society. Soft skills include, for example, the ability to communicate well, to negotiate, and to organize an entire project in a contemporary engineering industry. Soft skills go as far as interdisciplinary and intercultural collaboration. Hence, universities must offer an environment where engineering students develop these soft skills competencies within the scope of, e.g., international project collaboration, with possibilities for intercultural and interdisciplinary contacts. Nevertheless, the reality of organizing an international collaborative project is very challenging. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for organizing international engineering project collaboration to enhance students' soft skills. As an example of applying the framework, an innovation project that could be executed by 10 students from different European universities with different cultural backgrounds will be showcased. Their project team is asked to develop a technical invention which could be a patentable idea, meaning it could potentially develop itself towards an interesting innovation. In such an international project, soft skill competencies are key for successful collaboration. The research question which will guide this paper is: What is a suitable framework for organising an international engineering project collaboration among universities to enhance the soft skills of their engineering students? The answer is the provided 7-step framework for developing such an international engineering project collaboration.","Geraedts, Hay;Bencheva, Nina;Albuquerque, Abigail;Karampidis, Konstantinos;Papadourakis, Giorgos",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2022 31st Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering, EAEEIE 2022",2022-01-01,Hellenic Mediterranean University;University of Rousse;STICHTING FONTYS,Framework ;  Innovation Engineering projects ;  International Collaboration ;  Soft skills
Pattern Recognition Method for Detecting Engineering Errors on Technical Drawings,"Many organizations are looking for how to automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual work and free up resources for innovation. Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning, increases the chance of achieving this goal while working with technical documentation. Highly costly engineering hours can be saved, for example, by empowering the manual check with AI, which helps to reduce the total time for technical documents review. This paper proposes a way to substantially reduce the hours spent by process engineers reviewing PIDs (Piping Instrumentation Diagrams). The developed solution is based on a deep learning model for analyzing complex real-life engineering diagrams to find design errors - patterns that are combinations of high-level objects. Through the research on an extensive collection of PID files provided by McDermott, we prove that our model recognizes patterns representing engineering mistakes with high accuracy. We also describe our experience dealing with class-imbalance problems, labelling, and model architecture selection. The developed model is domain agnostic and can be re-trained on various schematic diagrams within engineering fields and, as well, could be used as an idea for other researchers to see whether similar solutions could be built for different industries.","Dzhusupova, Rimma;Banotra, Richa;Bosch, Jan;Olsson, Helena Holmstrom",Conference Proceeding,"2022 IEEE World AI IoT Congress, AIIoT 2022",2022-01-01,Malmö Universitet;Chalmers University of Technology;McDermott,Artificial Intelligence ;  Deep Learning ;  engineering drawings ;  object recognition ;  Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)

A review of strategies for implementing learning technologies in organizations,"The performance and survival challenges faced by many organizations require dynamic processes and tools to accelerate the acquisition, retention, and transformation of capabilities. Organizations are continuously looking at their learning strategies as a key factor to prepare their human capital for the rapid changes and demands. Learning technologies are positioned as an enabler that provides different opportunities to learn and are at the same time the taskmaster that, if well implemented, can leverage learning organization. The design of strategies for implementing learning technologies in organizations is hard to overview. Only a few contributions address technology as a crucial point to accelerating performance, innovation, and competitiveness. Based on a review of strategies for implementing learning technologies in organizations, this article presents the state of the art regarding the challenges that organizations are facing in the learning landscape, the technologies being used, and the impact expected with those technologies.

Advancing Extended Reality Teaching and Learning Opportunities Across the Disciplines in Higher Education,"The emergence of Extended Reality (XR) technologies in diverse fields, along with research demonstrating opportunities for innovation in teaching and learning, warrants further exploration. However, investigation into the supports required by instructors for experimentation, design, and deployment of XR technologies is needed. This study explores the benefits and challenges of XR technologies for teaching and learning, and reviews XR pedagogical initiatives at three universities. The research aims to discern strategies to promote and support XR initiatives in higher education, develop best practices for using and integrating XR technologies into university courses, and guide future research into XR technologies in higher education. To develop an empirical understanding of the opportunities and challenges faced by instructors using XR technologies, we performed a thematic analysis of sixteen semi-structured interviews to capture insights from instructors' experiences. We found that instructors were cognizant of the many benefits associated with XR use in terms of experiential learning, making learning content more accessible, and the potential for its application. However, the findings also highlight the lack of guidance and support available to instructors in the implementation of these technologies in educational contexts. Our results provide recommendations for future institutional supports that could advance XR and expand the current teaching and learning opportunities available to instructors and students.","Idrees, Amna;Morton, Mark;Dabrowski, Gillian",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2022 8th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network, iLRN 2022",2022-01-01,University of Waterloo,extended reality (XR) ;  higher education ;  learning ;  teaching
Safe Reinforcement Learning Benchmark Environments for Aerospace Control Systems,"Recent advancements in reinforcement learning techniques demonstrate an ability to make decisions in high dimen-sional state spaces and complex real-time strategy games. In contrast to supervised learning which features large data sets, there are relatively few existing environments for training rein-forcement learning agents. In addition, small differences in re-wards or action spaces can drastically change the difficulty and results of the training environments. Benchmarks seek to tackle both of these challenges by creating common environments, in the form of 'Gyms' to train and compare reinforcement learning techniques, approaches, and algorithms. Many gyms, such as the classical control and Atari games environments, have become standard in new research on reinforcement learning. Researchers can easily compare and benchmark competing so-lutions across publications on these universal baselines enabling rapid innovation and collaboration. However, there are currently no standard set of environments for aerospace problems, and many of the gyms in the literature do not include safety con-straints or run time assurance systems that intervene when the reinforcement learning agent violates safety constraints. This manuscript describes the development of the Aerospace SafeRL Framework and accompanying Aerospace SafeRL Benchmarks that include interactive environments, safety constraints, soft-ware interfaces for run time assurance safety monitors with base implementations, and an initial set of baseline solutions. This initial set of scenarios introduces simple RL environments that expose the kinds of motion patterns, dynamics, and safety constraints encountered in air and space problems in 2D and 3D. This manuscript also describes standardized evaluation metrics for these environments to provide a consistent performance measurement with aerospace relevance. These benchmarks pro-vide a structured foundation for future reinforcement learning algorithms, run time assurance designs, and neural network verification techniques for the aerospace domain.","Ravaioli, Umberto J.;Cunningham, James;McCarroll, John;Gangal, Vardaan;Dunlap, Kyle;Hobbs, Kerianne L.",Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2022-01-01,University of Cincinnati;Air Force Research Laboratory;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.;Toyon Research Corporation;Matrix Research Inc.,

Research on the Application of Artificial Neural Network-Based Virtual Image Technology in College Tennis Teaching,"At the same time that my country has shifted from high-speed development to high-quality development, my country has also put forward new requirements for education development. Due to the limited study time during college, each student's study habits and learning process are also different, and the degree of connection between tennis lessons is high, so there will be polarization when learning tennis. With the development of science and technology, more and more technological innovations are integrated into the classroom, and traditional teaching methods can no longer keep up with the pace of the times. Tennis teaching is a subject of equal proportion between theory and practice. The traditional teaching method simplifies the theory, which makes students to have some bad phenomena when they practice. Aiming at this series of problems, this paper uses algorithms such as softmax function and threshold function to construct an application model of virtual image technology based on the artificial neural network in tennis teaching. The research results of the article show that: (1) the average accuracy rate of the method in this paper is 97.22%, and the highest accuracy rate is 99.17%. The average accuracy rate also tends to increase with the increase of sample size; the recall rate is the highest, and the highest recall rate is 99.36%. The average recall rate is 96.77%; the highest correct rate is close to 100% and is significantly higher than the other three methods; the average correct rate reaches 98.8%; the response time is the shortest; the average response time is 33 ms; and the response time increases with the increase of the sample size. (2) After using this model, tennis skills have been improved, with an average of 12 in situ flips, an average of 7 in situ rackets, an average of 5 in situ forehand draws, and an average of 3 in situ backhand draws. (3) The average forehand and backhand scores of the class after the experiment were 90 and 86; the average forehand and backhand stability were 8 and 7; and the average forehand and backhand accuracy were 31 and 29, respectively. The average depth of forehand and backhand is 36 and 32.

An Analysis on the Factors Affecting Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Research Programs,"Enhancing undergraduate programs with interdisciplinary collaboration is increasingly important to prepare students for the demands of the competitive multi-stakeholder market. In this study, the Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Experience (INCLUDE) program brings undergraduates from disciplines such as industrial and systems engineering, computer science, psychology, ethics, art, and marketing together and grants them the opportunity to network with practitioner mentors from large stakeholder organizations (e.g., NASA, Dynetics, AOA, the U.S. Army, and Navy) to solve a Grand Challenge. Although interdisciplinary teams are key to innovation, monodisciplinary programs tend to be divergent in nature and may not expose students to project teamwork. Problems arise when trying to foster effective outcomes for students who are unfamiliar with the skills necessary for self-managed teamwork. The purpose of this study is to share the results of exploratory qualitative research designed to better understand the challenges that senior undergraduates from two separate teams (Fall 2020-Spring 2021 and Fall 2021-Spring 2022) faced in the INCLUDE program at The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). This analysis focuses on the individual, institutional, and gender factors that shaped student perceptions between the two focus groups who were tasked with different Grand Challenges and access to the same campus resources. Data sets from observations and interviews are used in this study. This approach, combined with extensive literature research, provides valuable insight into their perceptions and attitudes about interdisciplinary teamwork and possible conflict resolutions. The results are expected to reveal the complexity of interdisciplinary collaboration for educational researchers.","Leder, Sheri J.;Weger, Kristin;Mesmer, Bryan",Conference Proceeding,"2022 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2022",2022-01-01,The University of Alabama in Huntsville,collaborating ;  interdisciplinary ;  teamwork ;  undergraduate research

Institutional Framework for Synthesis of Market and A Priori Approaches to Industrial Policy,"The spread of anti-globalisation trends against various forms of economic internationalisation requires the adjustment of the system of economic management in general and industrial policy in particular. Using new institutional approaches, the paper examines industrial policy along with the market subsystem and non-market regulated sectors. All these subsystems interact through the intersection of conventions between economic agents. Industrial convention is characterised by continuous production, technology demands compliance, and standards as an information source (as opposed to the market convention that relies on prices). The research shows that the circulation of production means cannot function only based on universal norms of market behaviour, as it happens in the movement of high liquidity consumer goods. Circulation of production means can be determined by long-term agreements, engineering performance specifications and set prices. The paper demonstrates that the inefficient use of market instruments in the innovation sector may lead to state intervention in the circulation of production means. Therefore, by choosing a coordinated, associative management approach, industrial policy can focus on the creation and implementation of relevant strategic documents, as well as on the adjustment of interactions between economic agents and authorities. The presented findings can be used as a methodology for developing regional and national industrial policies.","Kayukov, Vladimir V.;Shikverdiev, Arif P.",Journal,Economy of Regions,2022-01-01,Syktyvkar State University;Uhtinskij Gosudarstvennyj Tehniceskij Universitet,circulation of production means ;  economic liberalism ;  flaws in universal norms of market behaviour ;  industrial policy ;  institutional and neoclassical features of circulation ;  synthesis of institutional environment heterogeneities ;  theory of conventions

Effect of low molarity alkaline solution on the compressive strength of fly ash based geopolymer concrete,"The escalating of cement production had significant effect on greenhouse gases emission, thus innovation of geopolymer concrete is crucial to reduce the environmental impacts. Besides, high concentration of alkaline solution not only exhibits corrosive nature, but also increases the cost of construction. Therefore, this research studies the engineering properties and effect of elevated temperature on fly ash-based geopolymer concrete using low molarity alkaline solution. The alkaline solution used in this research is sodium hydroxide (NaOH) combines with sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) with different molarity of 2M, 4M and 10M. The binder to solution ratio of 0.45, NaOH mixed with Na2SiO3 at mass ratio of 2.5 and binder to aggregates with proportion of 1:3 was fixed. Test specimens was prepared and tested at the age of 3, 7 and 28 days. Results show that with reduced alkaline solution molarity, the compressive strength reduced by 45 and 55% for geopolymer with 4M and 2M, respectively. However, the compressive strength exhibits are within the normal strength geopolymer concrete with comparable density and workability. Therefore, it can be concluded that low molarity geopolymer concrete can be applied in construction due to more environmentally friendly and lower cost.","Qin, Tan Shea;Lim, Nor Hasanah Abdul Shukor;Jun, Teng Zhang;Ariffin, Nur Farhayu",Journal,International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development,2022-01-01,Faculty of Engineering;Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah,alkaline molarity ;  compressive strength ;  elevated temperature ;  geopolymer concrete
The development of a typology and guideline for selecting innovation-encouraging procurement strategies in civil engineering,"Stimulating innovation through public procurement can lead to improved performance, contribute to organizational and policy goals, but can also play a key role in addressing societal challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by conventional solutions. A significant amount of research has been carried out on stimulating innovation through the public procurement of goods and services. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on which procurement strategies and tendering methods can be effectively used to encourage specific types of innovation within larger public initiatives such as civil engineering projects and programmes. The aim of this study is therefore to provide a coherent overview of innovation-encouraging procurement strategies and tendering methods, and to relate their potential effective use to the technology readiness of the targeted innovations, the required level of cooperation between public client and contractor and the willingness of public clients to bear innovation risks, and to provide incentives, budget and solution space for these innovations. Based on a literature review and a multiple case study, an innovation-encouraging procurement typology is developed. In addition, a guideline is provided that can be used by public clients to select an appropriate procurement strategy for their innovation projects and programmes.","Lenderink, Bart;Boes, Johan;Halman, Johannes I.M.;Voordijk, Hans;Dorée, André G.",Journal,Innovation: The European Journal of Social Science Research,2022-01-01,Universiteit Twente,civil engineering ;  innovation procurement ;  PPI ;  procurement selection guidelines ;  procurement strategies ;  tendering methods ;  typology

Financial engineering and its impact on audit efficiency in the opinion of experts,"The present study aimed to examine the impact of financial engineering on audit efficiency by analyzing the results of a research sample that included banks, auditors, financial analysts, and academics in Europe, as previous studies did not examine the relationship between these variables. Three major findings are outlined in this study. First, there is a statistically significant relationship between financial engineering and audit efficiency based on the results of the tests of the hypotheses. Second, there is a statistically significant relationship between financial engineering and the quality of financial reports, as the use of financial engineering innovations leads to a decrease in the credibility and relevance of financial reports for users. Finally, there is a statistically significant relationship between financial engineering and the expectations gap in the audit process, due to the increased need for more details about the financial instruments in the auditor's report. The findings of this study are important for auditors, financial engineers, bank executives, and bodies that set standards for accounting and auditing.","Tamimi, Oday;Orbán, Ildikó",Journal,Journal of International Studies,2022-01-01,Debreceni Egyetem,audit ;  creative accounting ;  financial engineering ;  financial instruments ;  financial reports
Through a different lens: The perceived quality of light field visualization assessed by test participants with imperfect visual acuity and color blindness,"Light field visualization technology has progressed significantly in the past two decades. With the emergence of commercially-available devices, both industry and academia have begun research on the potential use cases of future society, including medical visualization, 3D digital signage, telepresence, military applications and many more. During the evaluation and quality assessment of such usage contexts and display types, test participants are typically screened for visual acuity via the Snellen chart and color vision via the Ishihara plates. However, there is an unfortunate global trend that the eyesight of the new generations is getting notably worse, and other sight-related issues, such as color vision deficiency, are becoming more common as well. Therefore, while medical technologies do relentlessly combat the diseases and disorders of the human eye, long-term innovations of visualization must also account for such users. Yet at the time of this paper, those with imperfect vision are underrepresented in light field research. In this paper, we present the results of the series of subjective tests carried out on light field displays, exclusively with test participants that otherwise would not qualify to assess visualization quality in a regular study. The experiments aim at investigating the most relevant research questions of light field visualization quality, such as spatial resolution, angular resolution and viewing distance. Test participants with imperfect visual acuity are classified by the diopters of their corrective lenses, and correlations between diopters and subjective ratings are addressed. Similar analyses were performed for color-blind test participants as well.","Simon, Aniko;Guindy, Mary;Kara, Peter A.;Balogh, Tibor;Szy, Laszlo",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2022-01-01,Holografika Kft.;Kingston University;Budapest University of Technology and Economics;Pazmany Peter Katolikus Egyetem;Radicon;Sigma Technology,angular resolution ;  color vision ;  Light field visualization ;  spatial resolution ;  viewing conditions ;  visual acuity
Explainable Online Lane Change Predictions on a Digital Twin with a Layer Normalized LSTM and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation,"Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twins play an integral role in driving innovation in the domain of intelligent driving. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a leading driver in the field of lane change prediction for manoeuvre anticipation. However, the decision-making process of such models is complex and non-transparent, hence reducing the trustworthiness of the smart solution. This work presents an innovative approach and a technical implementation for explaining lane change predictions of layer normalized LSTMs using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). The core implementation includes consuming live data from a digital twin on a German highway, live predictions and explanations of lane changes by extending LRP to layer normalized LSTMs, and an interface for communicating and explaining the predictions to a human user. We aim to demonstrate faithful, understandable, and adaptable explanations of lane change prediction to increase the adoption and trustworthiness of AI systems that involve humans. Our research also emphases that explainability and state-of-the-art performance of ML models for manoeuvre anticipation go hand in hand without negatively affecting predictive effectiveness.","Wehner, Christoph;Powlesland, Francis;Altakrouri, Bashar;Schmid, Ute",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2022-01-01,Fortiss GmbH;IBM Deutschland GmbH;Universität Bamberg,Digital Twin ;  Manoeuvre anticipation ;  Prototype ;  Safety-critical AI ;  XAI
ABOVE OR BELOW - this is the QUESTION,"The subject of bridges and bridge design is amply covered in literature and research. It is less so as far as tunnels are concerned, and what is there is almost exclusively engineering biased, while a stigma of perception is attached to the idea of tunnels, especially non-vehicular ones. This paper sets out to offer a glimpse into situations where a decision had to be made as to whether a bridge or a tunnel was the most appropriate solution to a crossing. Cases presented relate to situations where the decision went in favour of a tunnel. These include the proposed Waitemata Harbour crossing, the Channel Tunnel, Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link, the proposed tunnel linking the Isle of Wight with the UK mainland. It also offers a provocative comparison between la Habana and Sydney, with a tunnel in La Habana port and a bridge in Sydney.

Prospective elementary teachers' attitude toward technology-based mathematics assessment,"This research is motivated by the rapid development of information communication and technology (ICT) in the era of the industrial revolution 4.0. Most teachers seem to be unfamiliar with the use of technology in teaching and learning mathematics. In the present study, we are interested in investigating prospective elementary teachers' attitudes towards technology-based mathematics assessment. We surveyed 70 prospective elementary teachers from a teacher education study program in Riau province, Indonesia. The study results show that prospective elementary teachers have positive attitudes towards the technology-based mathematics assessment. More than 75% and 55% of third and first-year students agreed with technology usage in mathematics assessment. They provided several reasons underlying the agreeableness of technology-based mathematics assessment, such as innovation, practices, and need to be used in line with the current situation.","Putra, Zetra Hainul;Rahmadhani, Desri;Noviana, Eddy;Hermita, Neni",Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2022-01-01,Universitas Riau,
Using Lean to Transform the Product Development Process in a Marine Company: A Case Study,"The motivation of this research is to investigate if the Lean concept can be used to improve a company's product development (PD) process and thereby providing cost-effective methods for development, engineering and manufacturing of products to sustain competitiveness. This longitudinal study builds upon an initial assessment of Lean practices in a company in the Nordics Marine sector starting in 2017. An improvement opportunity identified was defining measures to ensure improved integration of functional areas, especially manufacturing, from the beginning of the PD process. As a follow-up of the assessment, we studied the application of a set of new PD practices outlined for the development stage of a new, optimized tunnel thruster. The purpose of this paper is to share our findings related to the application of these practices and their effect on a Lean transformation in PD. Data collection was done through a participatory approach for observing team activities, including two workshops with key people in the thruster project. The results indicate that early integration of manufacturing competence in PD is important to improve production (integration), reduce time and cost. In addition, the use of design demonstrators and physical testing enable improved cost control and leverage learning throughout the PD process. A re-assessment of company practices relative to Lean, made during the autumn of 2020, identifies that six out of thirteen capabilities are improved in terms of the gap between current and desired future states. However, increased capability gap is identified in utilizing rigorous standardization to reduce variations, since existing company standards are challenged by new project innovations. It is concluded that the effect of introducing new PD practices to reduce capability gaps in Lean Product Development (LPD) is promising, especially for principles that are managed within the project control.","Synnes, Elisabeth Lervåg;Welo, Torgeir",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2022-01-01,,capability gaps ;  case study ;  Lean Product Development ;  marine sector
Ergonomics in built environments: Prospects of human thermal comfort research,"Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, which have been around since the early 20th century, were originally designed to support fine industrial processes and thus pursue the goal of uniform, steady-state environmental control. And the HVAC systems for civil buildings which were widely used later followed such an idea to create uniform and steady-state thermal environments. For decades, a large number of domestic and foreign research results have shown that the uniform and steady thermal environment is not necessarily the most beneficial to people’s comfort and health, but it needs more energy consumption. As one of the earliest scientific theories formed in the field of ergonomics in built environments, the theory of human thermal comfort has effectively guided the development of the building thermal environment control methods, technologies, and products globally during the process of industrialization. In the new era of global warming and low-carbon buildings, the theoretical science of human thermal comfort undertakes the new mission of promoting the discipline of building technology and achieving the goals to develop “low-carbon” and “healthy” buildings. The future development of human thermal comfort research will have two important directions. One is the in-depth scientific understanding of the complex relationship between human and the multi-factor thermal environment, not only for human comfort needs, but also paying more attention to the impact on health. The other is the technological innovation that these new scientific understandings may bring, which can not only enhance personalized thermal comfort of people, but also effectively reduce the energy demand of thermal environment control in buildings. The first development direction above requires the combination of traditional engineering with medicine and public health, that is, the intersection of medicine and industry. The second development direction requires interdisciplinary cooperation between the discipline of built environment and other engineering disciplines such as materials, information, and energy. Based on the review of the development process of human thermal comfort as well as the research practice of our team, we have formed the following prospects centering on the above two future directions. (1) Compared with steady-state thermal environments, the dynamic thermal environment is more in line with people’s thermal comfort needs. The natural outdoor environment is a typical dynamic thermal environment, which is often more pleasant than steady neutral indoor environments. Attention should be paid to the use of suitable outdoor natural conditions, or the technologies to imitate natural conditions when creating indoor environments, so as to enhance people’s pleasure. (2) By providing local heating or local cooling, the human body can achieve thermal comfort in a cold or hot environment, so that the indoor comfortable temperature range can be greatly expanded. Therefore, future HVAC systems should focus on providing individual scale “precise thermal service” for indoor personnel, and develop personalized and wearable individual thermal comfort equipment, which can not only meet the different thermal comfort needs of people, but also help to save building energy. (3) Staying in a neutral thermal environment for a long time could weaken the heat stress ability of the human body, while moderate cold or hot exposure is beneficial to maintain human health. In the future, the indoor thermal environment system should be able to connect sensors to monitor the key thermal physiological indicators of the human body, and then support users to carry out cold or hot exposure exercise in accordance with health needs by adjusting the indoor thermal environment, so as to enhance their heat stress ability and keep healthy.","Cao, Bin;Zhu, Yingxin;Hou, Yuchen;Wu, Yeyu;Li, Sishi;Liu, Sijing",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2022-01-01,Tsinghua University;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China;Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control,air conditioning ;  ergonomics ;  health ;  personal comfort system (PCS) ;  thermal comfort ;  thermal environment
Initial stage of an industrial investigation of the knowledge management practices in a large-scale multinational automotive company,"Automotive systems engineering (SE) design and high-quality manufacturing, are highly reliant on the valuable knowledge and experience embedded within corporate processes, guides, rules, and practitioners. However, current knowledge management (KM) strategies are not entirely well suited to effectively capture all the new SE knowledge generated during continuous innovation so that it is readily accessible throughout the complete vehicle product lifecycle. This paper reports on an investigation into KM practices within the product development (PD) environment of a large-scale multinational automotive manufacturer. An initial exploratory industrial investigation involving automotive PD practitioners, was conducted with the central focus on the real-world implications of creating, sharing, storing and accessing SE knowledge. This paper presents an appraisal of the KM practices and reveals the types of SE knowledge utilised and the KM taxonomies employed throughout the SE lifecycle on multigenerational vehicle programs. The research conclusions in this paper form the foundation for further work.","Saunders, Timothy;Tite, Caroline;Gao, James",Journal,International Journal of Product Lifecycle Management,2022-01-01,University of Greenwich;University of Winchester,knowledge management ;  knowledge management practices ;  knowledge management strategies ;  knowledge management taxonomies ;  multinational automotive company ;  product development environment ;  systems engineering design ;  systems engineering knowledge ;  systems engineering lifecycle
Teaching Programming Amid the Digital Churn: Guidelines and Curriculum for a Laboratory,"In the modern and digital society, the importance of software development is undeniable. Therefore, educating the next generation of software developers is crucial. However, learning how to program is challenging, and research on improving programming pedagogy is essential. Adding a laboratory component to programming courses can enhance the education. In this work, we first elicited requirements and guidelines for an introductory programming lab curriculum based on a literature review and feedback by instructors with years of experience. These included the use of (1) current and adequate tools, (2) collaborative learning environment, (3) formative assessment, (4) appropriate assignments for the target audience, (5) pedagogical innovations, and (6) to prepare students to be lifelong learners of the subject. Following, we present a curriculum for an introductory undergraduate programming lab based on the Raspberry Pi platform. It teaches students how to program following software development best practices and integrate software and hardware through a series of cyber-physical assignments, including developing a rover vehicle. We successfully piloted the curriculum with 30 students, and we present the highly positive feedback provided by them. Although the course was based on the C programming language, the underlying foundation on programming principles will allow students to apply the concepts in any language. Furthermore, this curriculum is not intended to be a one-size-fits-all approach to programming education. However, it can be a strong starting point for readers to tailor it to fit their audience, school needs, and student learning outcomes.","Tezza, Dante;Abbott, Ben",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2022-01-01,St. Mary's University San Antonio,Curriculum ;  Education ;  Engineering education ;  Programming ;  Software
Young female arm body shape recognition based on MEA-BF neural network,"The research on human arm shape is the key to improving the fit and comfort of the sleeve. Young females' arm shape has multiple nonlinear features. Since the initial threshold and weight are randomly selected, the single BP neural network is prone to the problems of unstable model and low accuracy when dealing with the complex nonlinear relationship of human body shape. The thought evolution algorithm is a global optimization algorithm, which can optimize the initial threshold and weight of BP neural network through multiple ""convergence"" and ""alienation"" operations, so as to improve the stability of the model and prediction accuracy. In order to quickly and accurately identify a young female arm shape, this paper constructs a MEA optimized BP neural network based arm shape recognition model for young females. Firstly, the arm data of 611 young women aged 18 -25 are obtained by [TC]2 3D body measurement, and the values of 14 measurement items are extracted. SPSS software is used to preprocess the data, and descriptive statistical analysis of the indicators is conducted. Secondly, through principal component factor analysis, five morphological factors affecting young female arm shape arc obtained, namely, arm circumference factor, arm root factor, arm root morphology factor, arm length factor and arm proportion factor. The characteristic factors corresponding to the maximum load of the five factors arc: upper arm circumference, root circumference, root flattening rate, whole arm length and upper arm length/forearm length, which arc selected and divided into five categories by two-step clustering method; long fat arm, middle arm, long thin arm and short flat arm, accounting for 17.4% , 30.7% , 22.4% and 29.5% , respectively. Finally, Matlab software is used to construct a young female arm body shape recognition model based on MEA-BP neural network. MEA optimizes the weight and threshold value of BP neural network, which promotes the learning process of the whole network and improved the stability and recognition accuracy of the model. The innovation of this paper is reflected in the research object and research method. Existing studies arc based on the subdivision and cross combination of typical indicators to obtain the complex arm shape, but there are a large number of body shape subdivisions, and there is a lack of studies on the overall classification and recognition of the arm shape. In this paper, it is an innovation to select the arm shape for the whole classification and recognition research. The MEA-BP neural network has a good application in satellite clock prediction, electric stealing identification, remote sensing image classification, soil nutrient grading evaluation and other fields. This paper tries to introduce the thought evolution algorithm (MEA) optimized BP neural network into the field of human engineering for the identification of youngremote sensing image classification, soil nutrient grading evaluation and other fields. This paper tries to introduce the thought evolution algorithm (MEA) optimized BP neural network into the field of human engineering for the identification of young female arm shapes, which is an innovation of research method. Compared with the single BP neural network and GA-BP neural network, the MEA-BP neural network model has higher prediction accuracy and better nonlinear mapping ability. The introduction of mind evolution algorithm ( MEA) into BP neural network body shape recognition model can not only improve the accuracy of the model recognition, but also provide a new research method for body shape recognition using neural network, which broadens the application field of MEA-BP neural network, and has a wide range of research value.","Ni, Shiming;Bai, Yunlong;Jiang, Yiqun",Journal,Journal of Silk,2022-01-01,College of Engineering;College of Architecture and Art Design,arm shape ;  body type classification ;  MEA-BP neural network ;  recognition model ;  young females
"A systematic review of digital technology and innovation and its potential to address anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability in the pharmaceutical supply chain","Introduction: The urgent need to acquire medical supplies amidst the COVID-19 pandemic has led to bypassing of controls that govern the global pharmaceutical supply chain, increasing the risk of corruption. Hence, promoting anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability (ACTA) in supply chain and procurement has never been more important. The adoption of digital tools, if designed and implemented appropriately, can reduce the risks of corruption. Areas Covered: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an interdisciplinary systematic review of health/medicine, humanities/social sciences, engineering, and computer science literature, with the aims of identifying technologies used for pharmaceutical supply chain and procurement optimization and reviewing whether they address ACTA mechanisms to strengthen pharmaceutical governance. Our review identified four distinct categories of digital solutions: e-procurement and open contracting; track-and-trace technology; anti-counterfeiting technology; and blockchain technology. Expert Opinion: Findings demonstrate an increase in research of technologies to improve pharmaceutical supply chain and procurement functions; however, most technologies are not being leveraged to directly address ACTA or global health outcomes. Some blockchain and RFID technologies incorporated ACTA mechanisms and mentioned specific policy/governance frameworks, but more purposeful linkage is needed. Findings point to the need for targeted policy development and governance to activate these innovative technologies to improve global health.","Saeed, Gul;Kohler, Jillian C.;Cuomo, Raphael E.;Mackey, Tim K.",Journal,Expert Opinion on Drug Safety,2022-01-01,"University of California, San Diego;University of Toronto;UC San Diego School of Medicine;Global Health Policy Institute;WHO Collaborating Centre for Governance",Access to medicines ;  accountability ;  corruption ;  COVID-19 ;  e-procurement ;  global health ;  good governance ;  improved health outcomes ;  pharmaceutical procurement ;  supply chain ;  technology ;  transparency
Recognition Research and Innovative Design of Icons in In-Vehicle Infotainment System,"The icons and their recognition are of great significance to the development of electrification, intelligence, networking and sharing of vehicles all over the world. The intelligence of vehicles also puts forward higher requirements for the icon design of the in-vehicle display screens. Based on relevant research results at home and abroad, based on user experience and user needs, this paper adopted the case study method, used 24 icons for different purposes in three different systems such as Carplay, Android Auto, and CarLife to carry out paired tests, carried out a questionnaire survey, and discussed the usability of icon design, as well as the characteristics for recognition and the reasons for confusion or misunderstanding. The experimental results showed that the correct recognition rate of 4 icons was more than 90%, and the correct recognition rate of 13 icons was less than 60%. 73.6% of the subjects thought that the quality of the icons was very important and would affect the use of the car. At the beginning of using the car, 68% of the subjects often or occasionally misunderstood the icons of the in-vehicle system. The subjects held that the current in-vehicle system had some problems, such as low accuracy, single color, poor human-computer interaction experience and insufficient usability optimization in the driving environment. Finally, the paper has put forward the influence of six key elements for discussion, such as interface, color, icon recognition rate, icon features, icon shape, research and sorting, in order to make efforts in usability and innovation.","Tang, Sizhuo",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2022-01-01,Zhongnan University of Economics and Law,Icon ;  Icon design ;  In-vehicle infotainment system ;  Usability ;  User experience
When the future meets the past: Can safety and cyber security coexist in modern critical infrastructures?,"Big data technologies are entering the world of ageing computer systems running critical infrastructures. These innovations promise to afford rapid Internet connectivity, remote operations or predictive maintenance. As legacy critical infrastructures were traditionally disconnected from the Internet, the prospect of their modernisation necessitates an inquiry into cyber security and how it intersects with traditional engineering requirements like safety, reliability or resilience. Looking at how the adoption of big data technologies in critical infrastructures shapes understandings of risk management, we focus on a specific case study from the cyber security governance: the EU Network and Information Systems Security Directive. We argue that the implementation of Network and Information Systems Security Directive is the first step in the integration of safety and security through novel risk management practices. Therefore, it is the move towards legitimising the modernisation of critical infrastructures. But we also show that security risk management practices cannot be directly transplanted from the safety realm, as cyber security is grounded in anticipation of the future adversarial behaviours rather than the history of equipment failure rates. Our analysis offers several postulates for the emerging research agenda on big data in complex engineering systems. Building on the conceptualisations of safety and security grounded in the materialist literature across Science and Technology Studies and Organisational Sociology, we call for a better understanding of the ‘making of’ technologies, standardisation processes and engineering knowledge in a quest to build safe and secure critical infrastructures.","Michalec, Ola;Milyaeva, Sveta;Rashid, Awais",Journal,Big Data and Society,2022-01-01,University of Bristol;Bristol Cyber Security Research Group,critical infrastructure ;  cyber security ;  expertise ;  materiality ;  risk ;  Safety
Research on the Development of High-Tech Imported Jewelry Composite Media Creation,"The 21st century belongs to the era of digital technology. Technology leads the development of craftsmanship, and innovative thinking is the world trend. With the help of technology, jewelry creation is different from traditional gold and silver craftsmanship and contemporary goldwork creation, spanning time and space. This study aims to explore: what are the possible contexts for the combination of metal jewelry and composite media. And how to use high-tech equipment to make creation more “freedom” and “imaginative”. The above analysis is summarized as follows: (1) Creators can break through the previous limited framework when they conceive, let creative ideas not be restricted by the production process. (2) If the creator wants to weld extremely fine metal lines, Avoid time-consuming pro-duction engineering. (3) Relative position of welding hollow objects, more precises. (4) Complete repair function for metal repair. The continuous innovation of technology provides a strong guarantee for the development of jewelry craftsmanship, forming the so-called “Knowhow”, but in the end, it is still the creator’s concept that drives the progress. As far as the research samples are concerned, it is found that the creators make good use of modern technology to bring them into full play, and use the characteristics of equipment to make up for their own shortcomings. In addition, they also develop their own creative features.","Chen, Yen Ju;Lin, Rungtai;Lin, Chih Long",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2022-01-01,Jinwen University of Science and Technology;National Taiwan University of Arts,Craft design ;  Jewelry craft ;  Multi-material
Systems Engineering Methods and Their Applications in Field of Advanced Semiconductor Equipment,"Systems engineering methods have played an important role in the research and development of complex equipment and systems represented by aerospace, defense technology, and ship engineering at home and abroad. For the research and development of advanced semiconductor equipment such as lithography machines, it is particularly important to develop independent innovation and integrated design and manufacturing capabilities led by forward design and guided by systems engineering methods. Starting from the origin of systems engineering, this paper gives a survey of the common methods of systems engineering, and focuses on the related systems engineering tool chains and key technologies of model-based systems engineering with the applications in the field of semiconductor equipment as the background.

Machine learning and security in Cyber Physical Systems,"With the approach of new era, we also entered the fourth modern uprising of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs). There is the need of secure network system frameworks and intrusion detection frameworks to recognize attacks. Utilization of machine learning for abnormality recognition in systems faces difficulties that limit its vast commercial usage. CPSs are being considered as the most interesting and developing research area that has attracted the attention of many researchers. CPSs are estimated to become the backbone of designing and developing of engineering systems in future. This chapter discusses the need for understanding the machine learning techniques in order to implement them in various application fields and the exploration challenges for characterizing a proper formal platform that speaks to more than systems administration and data innovation—the data and information will be incorporated into physical objects.","Sharma, Neha V.;Yadav, Narendra Singh;Sharma, Saurabh",Book,Cyber-Physical Systems: AI and COVID-19,2022-01-01,Manipal University Jaipur;Amity University Rajasthan,Cyber Physical Systems ;  internet of things ;  machine learning ;  network intrusion detection ;  social networking
Developing a paediatric healthcare research network: key learnings from the 'starworks' child prosthetics project,"The context of child prosthetics is a complex and important area for research and innovation. Yet, like many areas of paediatric medical technology development, there are several barriers to innovating specifically for the unique needs of children (i.e., a relatively small patient population or ‘market’). As such, much child prosthetics technology is developed from the downsizing of adult prosthetics, leading to suboptimal outcomes for children and young people. Since 2016, the Starworks Child Prosthetics Research Network has been exploring this space, bringing children and their families together with key opinion leaders from the NHS, clinical Academia and leading National Research Centres with capabilities in child prosthetics with the aim of increasing research across the system. Above all else, Starworks is centred on the needs of children and their families, ensuring they have an equal voice in driving the ongoing research agenda. This article will share key learnings from the creation and development of the Starworks Network that may be applicable and/or adaptable across a wider paediatric medical technology research and innovation landscape. In particular it will discuss how it addressed three key aims of; (1) Addressing child-specific issues; (2) Building a sustainable network; and (3) Fostering impactful innovation.","Needham, Abigail;Wheeler, Gemma;Mills, Nathaniel;Head, John",Journal,Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology,2022-01-01,Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust;University of Salford;Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust,co-design ;  medical technologies ;  outcomes ;  Paediatric
Research on the Influence of Weak-Ties Social Interaction on the Gamification Experience of Science and Technology Museums,"With the advent of the era of experience economy, museums in our country have ushered in a new development trend - gamification experience, attracting more and more young people to visit and explore museums. At the same time, under the dual stimulation of Internet technology and experience economic innovation, Science and Technology Museums are shifting from the traditional functional space emphasizing popular science knowledge and education to a diversified experience space [1]. Among them, social experience has attracted attention as an indispensable factor in gamification experience and museum experience. However, in Science and Technology Museums, there is very little interaction between a large number of strangers, making it difficult to arouse the positive emotions of science and technology science popularization learning. This paper concludes that weak ties social interaction has a positive impact on the gamification experience of Science and Technology Museums through the comparative experiment method, and uses the correlation analysis method to obtain the correlation between gamification interaction and user experience factors in Science and Technology Museums.","Jia, Hongli;Dai, Linong",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2022-01-01,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Correlation analysis ;  Gamification ;  Science and Technology Museum ;  User experience ;  Weak-ties social interaction
Computer Science,"Possible for science itself, conceptually, to have and will understand differently, let alone science also seen as technology, such as computer science. After all, science and technology are viewpoints diverse by either individual, community, or social. Generally, it depends on socioeconomic capabilities. So it is with computer science has become a phenomenon and fashionable, where based on the stream of documents, various issues arise in either its theory or implementation, adapting different communities, or designing curriculum holds in the education system. Generally, there are gaps between rich and poor, masculine and feminine, and basic sciences, engineering, and social sciences in accessing and using computer science. In particular, there have been various developments in hardware, software, and brain-ware from computer science in the application. There are recurring problems shortly, in the same or different places, both in developed and technologically lagging countries. Although computer science is still new, it has provided various innovations through research, which is proven by many documents. Therefore, following the growth of computer science - documents in the reputable indexed database, Scopus - there are clues for showing the trends. That is, dividing documents into three-time sessions: sloping, increasing and decreasing. That is by using a growth graphic. Then equip it with some parameters: topics and the weights from hit counts of databases. It gives the meaning as an interpretation to support the reviews. Therefore, this paper will provide a commentary related to that growth. It is for showing that despite the spread of studies, at the last time-session, the issues were always present simultaneously at the same time in accumulation. That is for describing a study title of computer science about what the world already has, going, and will understand about computer science. It is a view regarding its philosophy, basic science, applications, and technology as concepts and solutions that make computer science the primary foundation for skills and professions in the 21st century through the education system. Therefore, other scientific fields such as informatics, computer engineering, information science, information technology, and data science, which are at the crossroads of computer science, are also scientific fields that raise different issues.","Nasution, Mahyuddin K.M.;Hidayat, Rahmat;Syah, Rahmad",Journal,"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology",2022-01-01,Universitas Medan Area;Politeknik Negeri Padang;Universitas Sumatera Utara,Algorithms ;  Complexity ;  Information ;  Learning ;  Mathematics ;  Philosophy ;  Programming ;  Science ;  Teaching ;  Technology

Land Use Change and Landscapes in Rural Areas in China in Forty Years of Reform and Opening Up,"Over the past 40 years, great changes have taken place in rural areas in China. The huge changes, including reform of the rural land system, the reform of the purchase and sale system concerning agricultural products, and the rapid development of township enterprises, have had significant impacts on China's economic and social development. From 1979 to 2019, the land system had faced different problems in different historical periods. The reform of the rural land system, the improvement of land use laws, and the protection and management of land rights and farmland have been given attention in Chinese rural land management practice. The reform of and innovation in the rural land system have been remarkable achievements. Rural land circulation, transfer of agricultural land and land with construction, taking the protection of farmers’ interests as the basic criterion, have been institutionalized, which is not only conducive to the intensive management of the scale of agricultural activity, but also meets the farmers’ social security interests. Land resources’ utilization planning had adapted the balance sheet accounting of land resources and the assessment of land ecological conditions, deepening the research on carbon emissions from the perspective of land use. In rural areas, the goal of returning farmland to forests and grassland had been implemented and consolidated the achievements. The scientific management of farmland had been strengthened. Land use has shown evidence of innovations land use patterns, the construction of a land space planning system and furthering of village level planning. Research on land engineering and technology had gradually deepened in fields of comprehensive improvement of agricultural land, technological innovation in reclamation and in methods of land pollution remediation. In the process of urbanization, cultivated land resources and national food security generate seriously questionable and challenging situations, and the comprehensive improvement and reclamation technology of agricultural land has assumed an important role. The constant changes taking place in Chinese land use and landscape are caused by many factors. Only rational policy on land management and land use planning can bring tangible benefits to the society. Research about rural landscapes is currently at an early stage in China, but some risks are already noticeable in relation to the country's cultural landscapes. Rapid and dynamic urbanization has produced some negative impacts on rural landscapes in recent years. Planned investments usually interfere with the environment, sometimes extending to the liquidation of valuable green areas, which constitute a cultural heritage. Another problem is the lack of the country's cultural landscape protection in land management. There are not specific rules for determining when planning disturbs the harmony of the landscape.","Chen, Gaiying;Noszczyk, Tomasz;Nawieśniak-Caesar, Maria;Pazdan, Maria;Hernik, Józef",Book Series,Environmental History (Netherlands),2022-01-01,Beijing University of Agriculture;Uniwersytet Rolniczy im.

Managing interorganisational collaborations to develop medical technologies: the contribution of interpersonal relationships,"The development of medical technologies that effectively meet clinical and patient needs increasingly relies upon collaborative working between clinicians, businesses and universities. While this “open” innovation process may provide access to additional resources, knowledge, and expertise the process is not frictionless. At the personal level, individuals may have different ways of working and incentives and at the organisational level, partners may have their own cultures and processes. Thus, interorganisational collaboration is not necessarily a panacea, but has advantages and disadvantages. The challenges are somewhat heightened in the MedTech sector where collaborative working cuts across established professional boundaries, brings together diverse knowledge from an array of disciplines, and often disrupts existing medical practice. Given these factors, this article presents a review of the extant management literature examining the complexities within multi-party collaboration and ways to drive these partnerships forwards. The article emphasises the critical value of interpersonal relationships within collaborations and offers means of strengthening them.","Olubajo, Linda;Dimitri, Paul;Johnston, Andrew;Owens, Martin",Journal,Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology,2022-01-01,Sheffield Business School;Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust;Coventry University,Collaboration ;  health technology innovation ;  interorganisational ;  medical device development ;  partnership
Toward Integrating Intelligence and Programmability in Open Radio Access Networks: A Comprehensive Survey,"Open RAN is an emerging vision and an advancement of the Radio Access Network (RAN). Its purpose is to implement a vendor and network-generation agnostic RAN, provide networking solutions across all service requests, and implement artificial intelligence solutions in different stages of an end-to-end communication path. The 5th Generation (5G) and beyond the 5th Generation (B5G) of networking introduce and support new use cases, such as tactile internet and autonomous driving. The complexity and innovative nature of these use cases require continuous innovation at a high pace in the RAN. The traditional approach of building end-to-end RAN solutions by only one vendor hampers the speed of innovation - furthermore, the lack of a standard approach to implementing artificial intelligence complicates the compatibility of products with the RAN ecosystem. O-RAN Alliance, a community of industry and academic experts in RAN, works on writing Open RAN specifications on top of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards. Founded on these specifications, the aim of this paper is to introduce open research topics in Open RAN that overlap the interests of both AI and telecommunication researchers. The paper provides an overview of the architecture and components of Open RAN, then explores AI use cases in Open RAN. Also, this survey includes some plausible AI deployment scenarios that the specifications have not covered. Open RAN in future cities creates opportunities for various use cases across different sectors, including engineering, operations, and research that this paper addresses.","Arnaz, Azadeh;Lipman, Justin;Abolhasan, Mehran;Hiltunen, Matti",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,University of Technology Sydney;AT&T Inc.,5G ;  artificial intelligence ;  B5G ;  intelligent systems ;  machine learning ;  open RAN ;  radio access networks
FRAME-BREAKING THINKING AND ENGINEERING CREATIVITY—A SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION ON AN INNOVATIVE THINKING CLASS IN THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING,"Purpose In an “innovative thinking” class offered in the school of engineering, we systematically analyzed how frames manifested themselves at the layers of press, person, and process while students were working on projects. We further explored the influence that adopting four types of frame-breaking thinking—constructionist, dialectical, analogical, and exploratory thinking—might have on the way students conducted their projects. We proposed a framework systematically presenting the Janusian nature of innovative thinking, which could serve as an exemplar for designing innovation development courses for engineering students. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a qualitative study featuring theme analyses with theory-driven coding on data (including creative thinking manuals, term reports, and end-of-semester team interviews) collected from 21 students who took the class. We also administered a questionnaire to collect students’ opinions on the course and presented the results of their descriptive statistics. Findings/results Students’ mental calculations determine the meanings of the frames from the external press. Personal experiences on wellstructured problems could negatively influence the efficacy of solving ill-structured problems, at least at the beginning of the process. Using four types of frame-breaking thinking to perturb extant cognitive schema may produce the innovative tensions that breed creativity. In addition, descriptive statistics provide evidence for students' approvals on the course's methods and outcomes. Originality/value Exploring the nature of Janusian thinking in innovation by systematically investigating the nature of the three-layered frames and the impacts of the four types of frame-breaking thinking presents an analytical framework and a research angle new to the literature. Suggestions/implications Innovation development should be driven by systematic operations on diverse or opposing ideas in problem-solving situations rather than activities that manipulate ideas in context-free scenarios.","Tzeng, Jeng Yi;Hung, Jui Hsuan",Journal,Contemporary Educational Research Quarterly,2022-01-01,National Tsing Hua University;Chinese Culture University Taiwan,Analogical thinking ;  Box-breaking thinking ;  Constructionist thinking ;  Creativity ;  Dialectical thinking ;  Engineering education ;  Exploratory thinking
Lean Software Startup Practices and Software Engineering Education,"In the modern economy, software drives innovation and economic growth. Studies show how software increasingly influences all industry sectors. Over the past 5 decades, software engineering has also changed significantly to advance the development of various types and scales of software products. Software engineering education plays an essential role in apprising students of software technologies, processes, and practices popular in industries. Furthermore, approaches to teaching software engineering are becoming more interdisciplinary and team-centered, comparable to startup contexts. In this PhD work, I want to answer the following research questions: (1) To what extent are software engineering trends present in software engineering education research? (2) What set of common software engineering practices employed in lean software startups is transferable to the software engineering education context? (3) What is the impact of lean startup practices on software engineering students and curricula? I utilize (1) a literature review, (2) mixed-methods approaches in gathering empirical evidence, and (3) design-based research. In the first phase of the research, I pinpoint the relevance of the lean startup in software engineering education through an extensive literature review. I gather empirical evidence on lean startup practices and assess their potential transferability to software engineering education during the second research phase. I demonstrate that the lean startup is an emerging trend in software engineering education research. I demonstrate that students can acquire soft, hard, and project management skills in a more realistic context in the introduction of the growth phase of lean startup practices throughout external course activities. I expect software engineering curricula to benefit from the model and framework that I propose and validate, thus facilitating lean startup practice transfer to software engineering curricula.","Cico, Orges",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,2022-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,General and reference → Empirical studies ;  Social and professional topics → Software engineering education
An Exploratory Study on the Design and Management Model of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Safety Traceability System Based on Blockchain Technology,"Aiming at the problems of long life cycle complex roles of participants, diverse risk factors, poor supervision coverage and difficult information traceability of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) supply chain, this paper constructs a TCM quality safety traceability system based on blockchain technology by analyzing the business process and supervision characteristics of TCM supply chain. Blockchain technology is a new application mode of computer technology such as distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanism, encryption algorithm, and other computer technologies. It has the characteristics of ""decentralization, nontampering, transparent and open, and data traceability.""The function of nontampering, hash function, and time stamp can effectively solve the traceability problem of TCM supply chain. Through the analysis of the blockchain TCM traceability principle and network structure, combined with the actual business process of TCM traceability, this paper designs the blockchain TCM quality safety traceability system, analyzes its overall structure, data storage mode, digital signature, consensus algorithm, and main functions, and preliminarily constructs a new model of TCM quality safety traceability management based on blockchain technology. Using blockchain technology to realize the quality safety traceability of TCM, we can complete the omnidirectional, multiangle, and wide coverage of the data and information in whole supply chain of TCM breeding and seedling raising, planting, innovation and research and development, processing of TCM pieces, circulation of TCM, and consumption, so as to realize that the main body of responsibility of TCM can be put on record, the production records can be queried, product flow can be traced, quality safety can be forewarned, main responsibility can be identified, regulatory information can be shared, and product source can be traced.","Li, Dacan;Gong, Yuanyuan;Zhang, Xianhui;Huang, Min",Journal,Security and Communication Networks,2022-01-01,Shanghai Public Health clinical Center;Hebei University of Economics and Business;Beijing University of Chinese Medicine;Hebei Collaborative Innovation Center On Morality and Law-based Social Governance,
"A Framework for Educational Innovation in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, a Research Agenda","This work presents a conceptual framework for educational innovation within Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LSCM) to develop relevant learning experiences in the discipline. Nowadays, education is shifting from traditional passive approaches in which students listen and see into active settings involving learn-by-doing real-life experiences to develop appropriate competencies. LSCM educational innovation commonly refers to fragmented aspects such as the appropriateness of contents or specific teaching methods; however, the educational model transformation has little attention and the recognition of a high pertinent and engaging learning. Therefore, we presented a comprehensive framework for educational innovation to define a structure of educational components to recreate active learning experiences. Finally, we described the implementation of this framework, the progression within the MIT SCALE Network in Latin America, and insights for future work.","Salinas-Navarro, David Ernesto;Ovando, Agatha Clarice Da Silva;Argueta, Christopher Mejia;Chong, Mario",Conference Proceeding,"EDUNINE 2022 - 6th IEEE World Engineering Education Conference: Rethinking Engineering Education After COVID-19: A Path to the New Normal, Proceedings",2022-01-01,MIT School of Engineering;Aston Business School;Universidad Privada Boliviana;Universidad del Pacífico,Educational Innovation ;  Industrial Engineering ;  Logistics ;  Supply Chain Management
Value creation through insourcing - Additive Manufacturing as efficient in-house production technology,"AVL List GmbH (AVL) is the world's largest independent company for development, simulation and testing in the automotive industry, and in other sectors. The business unit Instrumentation and Test Systems (ITS) is focusing on the development, realization and manufacturing of high-precision measurement, development and test solutions for automotive components and systems. While the focus of in-house production at ITS is on assembly processes, manufacturing of the required components is mainly outsourced to external suppliers. With the foundation of the AVL Additive Manufacturing (AM) Initiative in 2017, manufacturing was partially in-sourced again. Since then, several activities have been conducted to successfully integrate AM as enabling technology. This paper presents how AM was methodically implemented and how AM contributes to the ITS value chain. For research and (pre-) development, Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) enables novel and innovative measurement concepts with advanced functionalities. Feasibility studies, including experimental results on key performance indicators, are described and the proof of concept is discussed. Going further, design departments benefit from rapid realization of prototypes with in-house AM production. Especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, long delivery times from external suppliers influence the development process. This paper shows how AM has contributed during this phase in terms of speed, innovation and costs but also the importance of relevant know-how to start an AM transformation. Besides rapid prototyping, the existing AM machines already produce 65 serial parts for AVL's measurement devices. First results show that not only delivery times were reduced by 80% but also substantial cost savings of up to 40% - compared to the external purchasing - could be achieved. With that in mind, the in-house AM production ecosystem will be further expanded to bring value and manufacturing know-how into the company.","Höller, Christian;Karanovic, Stefan;Wiltsche, Manuel;Klug, Andreas",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2022-01-01,AVL List GmbH,3D printing ;  Additive manufacturing ;  Measuring instruments ;  Product development ;  Production engineering

Wireless interfaces for brain neurotechnologies,"Wireless interfaces enable brain-implanted devices to remotely interact with the external world. They are critical components in modern research and clinical neurotechnologies and play a central role in determining their overall size, lifetime and functionality. Wireless interfaces use a wide range of modalities including radio-frequency fields, acoustic waves and light to transfer energy and data to and from an implanted device. These forms of energy interact with living tissue through distinct mechanisms and therefore lead to systems with vastly different form factors, operating characteristics, and safety considerations. This paper reviews recent advances in the development of wireless interfaces for brain neurotechnologies. We summarize the requirements that state-of-the-art brain-implanted devices impose on the wireless interface, and discuss the working principles and applications of wireless interfaces based on each modality. We also investigate challenges associated with wireless brain neurotechnologies and discuss emerging solutions permitted by recent developments in electrical engineering and materials science.

ProtoAtlantic: Innovation in the Marine Environment in the Atlantic Area Region,"Blue Growth, a term first coined by the European Commission as ""an initiative to harness the untapped potential of Europe's oceans, seas and coasts"", identified rich marine resources as an unique asset for economic development in coastal regions and on islands. The European Commission has through the Blue Growth objectives for the first time highlighted marine sectors as unique market opportunities with high growth potential which carry socio-economic importance to the development of coastal regions. Particularly marine sectors such as aquaculture, marine robotics, and marine renewable energy which fulfil global needs in food safety and security, enable monitoring and exploration in harsh and remote conditions, and globally growing energy needs were recognized as catalysts to achieve sustainable development. Marine start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) were identified as potential drivers in emerging marine sectors. However, they require support mechanisms tailored to their needs as they are competing for the same business and financial support as land-based SMEs, yet the research and development infrastructure is more difficult to access.ProtoAtlantic, an Interreg Atlantic Area funded project, provided marine-specific support mechanisms to marine start-ups and SMEs in emerging sectors, including business support through the accelerator and mentorship programs, enabling companies to fast track their product development through access to prototyping and testing facilities in all partner regions. The Interreg Atlantic Area encompasses partner regions in France, Ireland, Portugal, Scotland, and Spain. The consortium partners consist of Technopôle Brest Iroise (Brest, France), University College Cork - UCC (Cork, Ireland), County Council Cork (Cork, Ireland), INESC TEC (Porto, Portugal), the European Marine Energy Centre - EMEC (Orkney, Scotland), EMERGE (Canary Islands, Spain), and the lead partner, Innovalia Association (Canary Islands, Spain). The strategic collaboration between the partners provided marine start-ups access to testing facilities in the Atlantic Ocean. The extreme living laboratories provided by EMEC, the LiR National Ocean Testing Facilities at UCC's Centre of Marine and Renewable Energy (MaREI centre), and INESC TEC promise harsh real-life conditions which test the suitability of marine technologies to the limit thereby providing start-ups and SMEs with an extra layer of confidence in developing their technologies. This cross-regional collaboration puts the ProtoAltantic program in a unique position, as it is the first of its kind to dedicate marine-specific support to marine start-ups and SMEs which have benefited from the opportunities that ProtoAtlantic has provided.ProtoAtlantic developed a holistic model for the prototyping and exploitation of innovative ideas in emerging maritime sectors. After the identification of ideas from the research community, start-ups, and SMEs with product innovation capacity in the maritime sector, an acceleration program with a normed and structured process was implemented, thus creating a unique ecosystem in the Atlantic that is addressing a co-creation paradigm with the local European start-ups communities and all the stakeholders.","Lima, Ana Paula;Hernandez, Hector Martinez;Giannoumis, Jessica;O'Suilleabhain, Darragh;Oreilly, Anthony;Heward, Myles;Presse, Pauline;Santana, Moises;Falcon, Jorge Galvan;Silva, Eduardo",Conference Proceeding,Oceans Conference Record (IEEE),2022-01-01,"Technop&ocircle Brest-Iroise;Cork County Council;University College Cork;Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science;European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) Limited;Innovalia Association;Empresas de Base Tecnológica e Inversores Ángeles (Emerge)",acceleration program ;  blue growth ;  prototyping ;  regional economic development sustainable development ;  sustainable blue economy

Understanding the slow diffusion of alternative delivery systems using interpretive structural modelling,"The slow uptake of the alternative delivery systems (ADSs) can potentially waste an astronomical amount of precious public funds that can be used to meet other critical needs (e.g. education and healthcare). The existing literature mainly focussed on performance evaluation of the ADSs and few provided decision support to select ADSs matching a particular project’s characteristics or external environment. Nonetheless, there lacks of research exploring the slow diffusion of ADSs, especially a deep understanding of the interaction mechanisms of the influencing factors. This research aims to increase the use of ADSs in practice. To achieve the objective, based on the data retrieved from literature, case study and interviews, this study, therefore, aims to: identify the internal and external influencing factors; reveal the interplays of these factors using interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and analyse the driving and dependence power of the factors based on Matrice d’Impacts Croisés-Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement analysis (MICMAC). Based on the 25 identified factors, the ISM built a hierarchical structural model, which reveals the interaction mechanism of the factors and the fundamental factors. The MICMAC analysis discovered the high driving, high dependent, transitive/linkage and independent factors on the diffusion of ADSs. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge about what and how the factors influencing the slow diffusion of ADSs and help contractor administrators formulate effective strategies to improve the usage of ADSs.","Zhang, Yuanxin;Wang, Zeyu;Lin, Wenhao;Minchin, R.

"TRUST, ETHICS AND AUTOMATION: Anticipatory imaginaries in everyday life","The concept of trust has become central to discussions about the future of automated systems. This chapter interrogates how trust, as an anticipatory category, is associated with future ambitions for Automated Decision-Making (ADM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) within research and innovation narratives about how to accrue the supposed benefits of future technologies. For industry and policy stakeholders, and in academic disciplines such as human-computer interaction, computer science and engineering disciplines, ethics and subsequently trustworthiness can be designed in automated technologies themselves. As part of a digital capitalist innovation agenda, trust is thus conceptualised as the outcome of technological innovation and the production of ethical machines. In contrast, in design anthropology, trust is seen as emergent from the contingent circumstances of the everyday and inextricable from everyday ethics. Subsequently we need to re-define and re-engage anticipatory categories and concepts associated with automation in order to restructure and revise the terms of interdisciplinary collaboration to account for everyday ethics.","Pink, Sarah",Book,Everyday Automation: Experiencing and Anticipating Emerging Technologies,2022-01-01,Monash University;Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society,
The Innovative Development of Russian Modern Oil Painting under the Background of Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence,"Contemporary Russian oil paintings have realized the inheritance and development of classical paintings. Although it is deeply influenced by European and American oil painting creations, it is commendable that it did not fully follow the creative framework of Western works, but realized the image of absorbing the essence of it and then integrating it into Eastern literature and art, and finally formed the integration of Chinese and Western oil paintings in Russian oil painting with a unique creative style. With the continuous development of science and technology, mankind has put forward higher-level requirements for nature, society, science, and technology, and many new things are rising in these aspects. As an emerging industry, Internet of things technology is becoming an important part of modern information technology. It can not only change the way and content of information dissemination and processing but also improve people's quality of life and meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people. This paper first introduces the basic structure, style characteristics, and development process of Russian modern oil painting, then expounds the application of Internet of things technology and artificial intelligence technology, and then uses the method of questionnaire to investigate the innovation and development of Russian modern oil painting. Finally, the survey shows that senior students know more about Internet of things technology, while applied majors know more than non-applied majors. The grade that knows the least is freshmen, which is related to the degree of exposure to professional knowledge. Students majoring in Russian modern oil painting can share their painting experience through the Internet of things, learn online painting resources through the Internet of things, and add extra income to their part-time painters through the Internet of things. However, due to the Limited breeding technology of students, a small number of students can be part-time online painters, and most students use the Internet of things for knowledge input. Senior students majoring in Russian modern oil painting know more about artificial intelligence, and junior and sophomore students have a general understanding of this field. Through research, the team proposed the innovative development of modern Russian oil painting under the background of Internet of Things and artificial intelligence for reference, and formed our own oil painting creation style by integrating a variety of techniques.","Mou, Yanlin",Journal,Security and Communication Networks,2022-01-01,Chengdu University,

Digital monitoring and modeling of construction supply chain management scheme with BIM and GIS: An overview,"For a decade the construction industry has been on its all-time low in productivity due to its lack of adaptability to the digitization of society. In comparison, the manufacturing and production industries have been able to successfully integrate computer applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT) into their processes. As a result, their economic progression has received a significant uplift. Digitization and automation in the construction industry is a relatively young sector with a lot of opportunities for research and innovation. An excellent instrument for surveying resources and operations is a digital environment for monitoring the construction supply chain management framework (CSCM). For infrastructure projects, building information modeling and geographic information systems are strongly encouraged for improved productivity and better coordination. The convergence of BIM and GIS creates a complete digital representation of the physical environment. BIM may be used to produce, manage, and exchange operational data of building structures, whereas GIS could be used to handle the logistic aspect of the construction project and store, organize, and analyze data representing the horizontally spread urban environment. As a result, the unified utilization of BIM and GIS is crucial in Urban Sustainability applications that require data from both facilities and the urban environment. Because BIM has only been around for around ten years, and combined BIM and GIS applications have only been around for an even shorter time, there is no solid framework on the latter for individuals who are just getting started with BIM and GIS in Civil Engineering. Review and analysis of previous works are required to have a better grasp of the current condition and future direction of the budding discipline. This article reviews the visual flow of a model prepared in which BIM is used for initial construction operations, In addition, GIS is incorporated in the present model to allow for a wide spectrum of geographical analysis in the CSCM's logistics perspective (storage of goods and transit).","Uzairuddin, Syed;Jaiswal, Mohit",Conference Proceeding,Materials Today: Proceedings,2022-01-01,National Institute of Technology Raipur,BIM ;  CSCM ;  Digitization ;  GIS ;  IOT

Knowledge Mining Based Collaborative Framework for Manufacturing Value Chains,"Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems have been widely used to support teamwork in various fields such as design, education, research projects, etc. However, there is a great deal of knowledge generated directly or indirectly in the process of collaboration which is not well utilized and usually ignored instead of being reused and shared to help improve work efficiency. To bridge the gap between knowledge generation and utilization through CSCW, in this paper, we propose a knowledge mining based collaborative framework and first apply it to manufacturing value chains to achieve better work efficiency and reduce repetitive work in collaboration. Overall, this paper introduces the following novel insights and innovations: (1) we argue that there is a gap between the generated knowledge and the utilization of it during cooperative work; (2) a novel collaborative framework with knowledge mining approaches is proposed to bridge the gap; (3) a prototype system is further built and first applied to the manufacturing value chains. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to deal with knowledge reusing in CSCW of manufacturing value chains.","Qin, Bo;Zhang, Jian;Ma, Ke;Peng, Peng;Wang, Hongwei",Conference Proceeding,"2022 IEEE 25th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, CSCWD 2022",2022-01-01,"International Campus, Zhejiang University;Tsinghua University",computer supported cooperative work ;  knowledge graph ;  knowledge mining ;  manufacturing value chains
Potentials of Design Thinking for knowledge transfer of Model-Based Systems Engineering,"Industrial products are becoming increasingly complex due to the use and development of mechatronic systems. This increasing complexity is addressed by virtual representations of the systems in the form of interdisciplinary models. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) supports product development from the early development phase through validation, verification and integration up to later life cycle phases of the product by means of system modeling.Typical drivers for innovations in the industrial environment are business viability, technology driven feasibility and human driven desirability. While business viability and feasibility are considered in most product development processes and innovation driven projects, the human factor is often neglected in this context. This is addressed by a MBSE Capability and Maturation Matrix (CMM), which consists of capabilities for the acquisition and mastering of the MBSE competencies. The authors have considered Design Thinking as a feasible approach to transfer MBSE knowledge and thus support this acquisition MBSE competencies. This publication shall present the first findings on the application of Design Thinking for the creation of a user-centered MBSE introduction event. This event shall be used in further iterative steps to teach non-experts in the MBSE field the required competencies for their work and thus support the CMM development capability.","Manoury, Marvin;Horlander, Toni;Zimmermann, Thomas",Conference Proceeding,"SysCon 2022 - 16th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin;Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK,Education and Training ;  Model-Based Systems Engineering ;  Modeling and Simulation ;  Research in Systems Engineering ;  Systems Engineering Competency

Ideas Generation and Integration: A Method For Teamwork In A Virtual Environment,"The ideas generation becomes something fundamental, even outside, of design student education. The challenge presented in our research, following of this paper results, is to correctly implement an intuitive category method (progressive type) to generate solutions, unifying individual proposals or ideas through virtual platform and real-time communication with software or applications. The objective of this first paper is to identify the implementation impact from the perspective of first-use perception, and experience segmented by study area and gender. Our research begins with the design of an idea generation method, from design professionals experience, various tools are integrated and run-in digital platforms. This method was called ICRI from the acronym in Spanish 'Ideacion, Categorizacion, Reagrupamiento, Ideación'. Subsequently, this method is applied in two university courses, one with students of design, art, urbanism, and the other course with students of chemical engineering. The application of the method was conducting through the MIRO platform and the communication by ZOOM for remote work. The method consists of two main stages, the initial stage is 4 steps where the students define, investigate, and establish findings, including team formation, to move on to a second stage. This second stage is composed by 4 steps where students generate ideas, review, define and group them, finally the final stage is composed by 5 steps to able to bring to a point of re-grouping, discussion, fusion and writing of new ideas. This method was applied to start a product design process or design strategy. The results revealed a high level of acceptance of the method, highlighting its practicality, rapidity, and functionality to generate ideas, as well as an active participation of the students in an equitable way. Also, the acceptance and perception of equity and equality of generation of ideas between gender was found, in addition to spotlight that no academic profile had a negative influence. The creation of the ICRI method is the consequence of the changes that have been created as a result of the need for virtuality for higher education.","Canizares, Juan Carlos Marquez;Rojas, Juan Carlos",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2022-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Design ;  Educational Innovation ;  Gender ;  Higher Education ;  Ideas

A hydraulic 3D-lab based on virtual Gora dam visits at Call of Duty Warzone to Develop Student's Competencies During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The experience of going through a pandemic like Covid-19 forced many sectors of the economy to evolve, including education, specifically higher education. Teaching methods in Engineering, Architecture, and Construction (IAC) adopted tools, which had been developed primarily for industry, to adapt them to teach. These tools have been added to the already existing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and in this study, they are used as didactic teaching techniques. These tools are Building Information Modeling (BIM), Virtual Reality (VR), and the video game (VG) Call of Duty: Warzone (CoD: Wz). Some investigations have studied the scope that the use of BIM, VR, and video games can have in teaching separately. However, no research so far has been found that unites the three tools in a single methodology. This study aims to show the methodology and its results when implementing the Hydraulic 3D Lab (Hydr3D-Lab) tool for teaching in IAC. As will be explained later, in the procedure of implementing the methodology, the use of BIM, VR, and CoD: Wz software was promoted during teaching hours to improve skills and help students understand concepts that are difficult to comprehend and teach theoretically. The implementation of this technological tool was developed in the context of IAC's national higher education programs at a university in Mexico. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using the collaborative tool Hydr-3D-Lab as a teaching method for IAC. Additionally, this study proves that the learning experience can be enhanced using other technology tools such as Unreal Engine and Revit.","Ballinas-Gonzalez, Romeo;Abella, Rashid;Barrios, Julio;Garibay, Raul;Garrido, Juan",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2022-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,BIM for education ;  CoD: Wz for education ;  engineering education ;  higher education ;  innovation in education ;  VR for education

Standards and Interoperability of Equipment and Systems for Smart Grid in India,"The smart grid is the complex system which leverages the convergence of communication, various hardware and software technologies adding intelligence to the electric power industry. To achieve this objective, standards and interoperability of the various system is a pre-requisite. Standardization of the product/services would be required for scaling up of the prototype. A standard is an established norm for accomplishing defined task. Standardization is a formal document to establish engineering design, technical parameters, guidelines, processes, and practices. These standards are formulated to bring together all stakeholders towards achieving common objective. Interoperability is the capability of two or more devices, systems, appliances, networks, applications, or components to share and readily use information securely and effectively without any inconvenience to the stakeholders. It promotes open architecture of technologies considering both physical and logical interaction with other systems. An interoperable SG fosters competition among suppliers, innovation, choice, reduced costs and reduced capital risk caused by technology or vendor obsolescence, and enables automation to improve system value and reliability. Unfortunately, interoperability cannot realistically be achieved by a single entity and requires collaboration from numerous organizations including utilities, regulatory bodies, standards bodies, market players, stakeholders and more. Due to the system complexity, scalability and devices involved in creating an effective SG solution, interoperability between the various systems is the key to success. Utilizing a standardized approach methodology to develop use cases and functional requirements to support integration of emerging technologies as well as identify gaps in existing standards providing focus for research and development.","Jindal, Amit;Bansal, Manoj;Kumar, Amit",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,2022-01-01,"PricewaterhouseCoopers Pvt.

Materials Selection in Product Development: Challenges and Quality Management Tools,"Selecting the optimal material from a wide range of competitive variants significantly affects the final technical success of the product development. It avoids undesirable cost consequences and possible premature failure in the marketplace. Today, among the criteria for choosing materials, the emphasis has shifted more towards considering economic aspects and environmental impact. Various defects can occur during the life cycle of a material, from the production of original components to the commissioning of a product in the field. The nature of the deficiencies must be quickly identified and appropriate action taken. It has created a tendency to solve material selection problems using root cause analysis as the most useful problem-solving method in the engineering toolbox.

A review of the elements of a fabrication laboratory to develop engineering prototypes,"Unemployment is a global problem which, as well as being the source of scarcity and other problems, threatens people's well-being. Effectively addressing the issue is one of the new challenges of the workplace in the age of digital technology. Tertiary education institutions strive to develop people's potential before they enter the world of work. Developing the necessary skills - including operational skills with tools - requires laboratory training. A fabrication laboratory is an open space that promotes tooling skills, along with systematic and creative thought processes and inventiveness. All these can, in turn, form the basis of innovations that will benefit the community as a whole. This study began by looking at the trends and research related to fabrication laboratories. Then, in Step 2, it analysed and synthesised the relevant research, examined the elements of the fabrication laboratory, created a synthetic table and, finally, summarised the results. These showed that most of the research consisted of eight elements: 1) design spaces, 2) rapid prototyping tools, 3) electronic instruments, 4) mechanical tools, 5) scientific instruments, 6) a Group Learning Toolkit, 7) other tools, and 8) learning exchange or publishing spaces. This study is a review, therefore, of the research relating to the elements in the proper learning environment of a tertiary education fabrication laboratory. It is necessary if we are to develop the potential of learners across all sectors before they enter the world of work.","Srisawat, Sutthinee;Wannapiroon, Panita;Nilsook, Prachyanun",Conference Proceeding,"2022 International Conference on Decision Aid Sciences and Applications, DASA 2022",2022-01-01,King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok,Fab Lab ;  Fabrication laboratory

Tripartite Game Analysis of Military-Civilian Technology Transfer from the Perspective of Technology Characteristics,"Given the enterprise technology corporation technological learning problem of challenging to reduce the efficiency of technology transfer based on evolutionary game theory, from the nature of technical knowledge, military field, and civilian field of technology spillover, recessive and technical complexity, and other technical features, construction of bounded rationality under the condition of the private enterprise, the enterprise, and the government's three evolutionary game models, the influence of different technical characteristics on the three parties is analyzed by Matlab numerical simulation. The results show that intratechnological recessive only negatively inhibits the cooperative behavior of private enterprises. Both technology spillover and technology complexity promote the evolution of noncooperative behavior between military and civilians. The evolution speed of government support behavior is faster under high-intensity technology spillover. Finally, it is suggested that the technology transfer can be effectively promoted by strengthening the technology level of the private military enterprises, improving the technology transferability of the military enterprises, and perfecting the property right incentive mechanism of technological innovation.","Qu, Ying;Guo, Fei",Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2022-01-01,Hebei University of Science and Technology,
Where do we go from here? An interdisciplinary exploration of leveraging new technologies in education,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are at work behind the scenes in many aspects of life today. Research to examine the impact of these technologies on education is at a nascent stage. In response to these emergent technologies, the authors employ critical policy analysis to identify gaps where curriculum and educational policies have not yet responded to these emergent innovations. The authors argue that innovative technologies should be examined using critical, interdisciplinary approaches which combine the knowledge, theory and processes from more than one discipline or way of knowing. These approaches across disciplines allow the examination of authentic problems through different lenses, including where different disciplines intersect. For example, text-to-speech applications are available to the public but their use in school settings may label these same apps as assistive technologies and their use will be regulated. Interdisciplinary approaches stimulate critical questions that challenge taken-for-granted assumptions. The authors analyze both artificial intelligence and machine learning in educational settings. This work is exploratory and generative. They provide a framework to examine the efficacy and equity of these innovations and examine ways forward. It is hoped that multiple disciplines can contribute and help to interrogate these emergent findings.","Robertson, Lorayne;Muirhead, Bill",Conference Proceeding,"ICSIT 2022 - 13th International Conference on Society and Information Technologies, Proceedings",2022-01-01,Ontario Tech University,Artificial intelligence ;  Assistive technology ;  e-Education ;  Leveraging technology ;  Machine learning
Science of 2.5 dimensional materials: paradigm shift of materials science toward future social innovation,"The past decades of materials science discoveries are the basis of our present society–from the foundation of semiconductor devices to the recent development of internet of things (IoT) technologies. These materials science developments have depended mainly on control of rigid chemical bonds, such as covalent and ionic bonds, in organic molecules and polymers, inorganic crystals and thin films. The recent discovery of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a novel approach to synthesizing materials by controlling their weak out-of-plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Artificial stacks of different types of 2D materials are a novel concept in materials synthesis, with the stacks not limited by rigid chemical bonds nor by lattice constants. This offers plenty of opportunities to explore new physics, chemistry, and engineering. An often-overlooked characteristic of vdW stacks is the well-defined 2D nanospace between the layers, which provides unique physical phenomena and a rich field for synthesis of novel materials. Applying the science of intercalation compounds to 2D materials provides new insights and expectations about the use of the vdW nanospace. We call this nascent field of science ‘2.5 dimensional (2.5D) materials,’ to acknowledge the important extra degree of freedom beyond 2D materials. 2.5D materials not only offer a new field of scientific research, but also contribute to the development of practical applications, and will lead to future social innovation. In this paper, we introduce the new scientific concept of this science of ‘2.5D materials’ and review recent research developments based on this new scientific concept.","Ago, Hiroki;Okada, Susumu;Miyata, Yasumitsu;Matsuda, Kazunari;Koshino, Mikito;Ueno, Kosei;Nagashio, Kosuke",Journal,Science and Technology of Advanced Materials,2022-01-01,Institute of Advanced Energy;The University of Tokyo;Osaka University;Hokkaido University;University of Tsukuba;Kyushu University;Tokyo Metropolitan University,2.5 dimensional materials ;  2D heterostructures ;  bilayer graphene ;  hexagonal boron nitride ;  intercalation ;  interlayer nanospace ;  moiré superlattice ;  multidimensional materials ;  transition metal dichalcogenide ;  van der Waals interaction
3D Spheroid Cell Cultures and Their Role in Bone Regeneration: a Systematic Review,"Recently, the 3D spheroid cell culture application has been extensively used in the treatment of bone defects. A wide variety of methodologies have been used, which has made the comparison of results complex. Therefore, this systematic review has two aims: (i) to perform an analysis focused on the role of 3D spheroid cell culture in bone regeneration strategies; and (ii) address the main challenges in clinical application. A search of the following keywords ""3D cell culture"", ""spheroid"", and ""bone regeneration"" was carried out in the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases and limited to the years 2010-2020. Studies were included if their primary objective was the behavior of cell aggregates to formed spheroids structures by different 3D cell culture techniques focused on the regeneration of bone tissue. To address the risk of bias for in vitro studies, the United States national toxicology program tool was applied, and descriptive statistics of the data were performed, with the SPSS V.22 program. A total of 16 studies were included, which met the established criteria corresponding to in vitro and in vitro/in vivo studies; most of these studies used stem cells for the 3D cell spheroids. The most often methods used for the 3D formation were low adherence surface and rotational methods, moreover, mesenchymal stem cells were the cell line most frequently used because of their regenerative potential in the field of bone tissue engineering. Although the advances in research on the potential use of 3D spheroids in bone regeneration have made great strides, the constant innovation in cell spheroid formation methodologies means that clinical application remains in the future as strategy for 3D tissue bioprinting.","Cuevas-González, María Verónica;Suaste-Olmos, Fernando;Cuevas-González, Juan Carlos;Álvarez-Pérez, Marco Antonio",Journal,Odovtos - International Journal of Dental Sciences,2022-01-01,Instituto de Fisiologia Celular de la UNAM;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México;Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez,3D cell culture ;  3D culture environment ;  3D spheroid ;  Bone regeneration ;  Bone tissue engineering ;  Mesenchymal stem cells
Reflections on the correlation between the construction of new liberal arts and design discipline,"The construction of new liberal arts has become an important research topic and work direction of higher education. In view of various doubts about the construction of the new liberal arts, it is necessary to clarify its concept and connotation. However, the emphasis on the construction of new liberal arts is not to mechanically innovate, but to inherit fine tradition and take on new perspectives, pursue interdisciplinarity, and to cultivate humanities and social scientists and art creators to meet the development needs of the new era, especially the intelligent era. Design is a discipline with special interdisciplinarity. Under the inevitable tide of the construction of the new liberal arts, the first step is to develop and promote the role and significance of design abreast of the time. When looking at design discipline from the perspective of interdisciplinary integration, we will find that the interweaving between it and the construction of new liberal arts cannot be ignored. For example, it is found in the film and television industry that design is ubiquitous. For example, the design of posters and scenes is closely related to design discipline. The meaning of the construction of new liberal arts lies in the newness of quality, that is, the newness of innovation. It is innovative to use various methods to broaden the vision of the discipline. Therefore, to eliminate people's doubts, the only way is to inherit fine tradition and take on new perspectives as mentioned in the new liberal arts manifesto. It is necessary to build different humanities and social sciences on the basis of human wisdom, its original intention and temperament, original regulations and original basic spirit. Innovation relies on this basis, and we should strive to infuse more fresh factors and fresh ideas into the discipline, so as to promote its expansion and present a new landscape and a new look. From perspectives of the new engineering, new agricultural, and new medical sciences, it is a discipline with rich technical contents. In fact, the design discipline can also be classified, and it must be combined with more interdisciplinary factors. Innovation has a special meaning. In conclusion, first of all, the training requirement of the new liberal arts is to look forward to cultivating humanistic scientists who can think and analyze. Design shouldbe aimed at the new liberal arts, and enable itself and the entire new liberal arts to design some requirements and rules on how to present a better landscape. Secondly, the new liberal arts strengthen the cross-combination and cross-reference of disciplines. Although it is not too difficult for the design discipline, it is necessary to excavate theoretical summaries and strengthen it. The design discipline itself is intertwined with engineering and art. At the same time, the design discipline can naturally obtain some elements from the construction of the new liberal arts. It absorbs multiple disciplines to make itself have a richer connotation and extension ambition. Design itself as the carrier of the close relationship between engineering and art needs a more rational framework to establish a close correlation with the new liberal arts. Third, the design or the artistic design of the new liberal arts is mainly aboutinheriting fine tradition and taking on new perspectives. If it includes design such as industrial design, product design, garden design, etc., it must be inseparable from the core of adapting to people. Design should meet people's spiritual and emotional needs, that is, practical but in line with the laws of beauty. Design is the embodiment of comprehensive literacy, a collection of interdisciplinary, and a flash of humanistic spirit. People engaged in the design discipline usually place their designs in specific categories and detailed design results. But for us, the reason why the design discipline is so huge and all-encompassing is that we see more in the design of society, even the design of concepts and the more subtle design in the development of the whole art. In other words, design should be regarded both as a microscopic concrete and a macro-level thinking about the entire conceptual form and creative presentation, regardless of material presentation, industrial design, or spiritual presentation. In other words, artistic design has a kind of macroscopic observation power. Therefore, sometimes we think that design seems to be a kind of thought and artistic perception of a person who is inclusive of all things in a certain green space, a certain garden, a certain piece of furniture, and a certain kind of landscape.","Zhou, Xing;Lu, Xi",Journal,Journal of Silk,2022-01-01,Zhejiang Sci-Tech University;Beijing Normal University;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China;Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council;China Health Education Center,art design ;  construction of new liberal arts ;  interdisciplinarity ;  to inherit fine tradition and take on new perspectives ;  to take to the future

The Impact of Media Attention on Enterprises' Green Technology Innovation,"Using the A-share industrial companies from 2015~2019 as samples, this paper takes financing constraints as the intermediary variable and the nature of enterprise property rights as the moderating variable to explore the impact of different types of media attention on enterprises' green technology innovation. The empirical results show: Media attention can promote the green technology innovation of enterprises. Total media attention, eight mainstream media attention, paper media attention, and online media attention can significantly improve enterprises' green technology innovation level. Financing constraints play a part of the intermediary role between the eight mainstream media attention and green technology innovation, while the intermediary role between total media attention, paper media attention, online media attention and green technology innovation is not significant. The nature of corporate property rights positively regulates the relationship between total media attention, eight mainstream media attention, paper media attention, online media attention and green technology innovation. This study contributes to a more profound and comprehensive understanding of the influence of the media on corporate green innovation behavior, and provides experience and reference for the research and practice of corporate governance and innovation effects that the media pay attention to.","Zhao, Wanting;Xia, De;Tao, Qianyu",Conference Proceeding,"2022 7th International Conference on Big Data Analytics, ICBDA 2022",2022-01-01,Wuhan University of Technology,financing constraints ;  green technology innovation ;  media attention ;  nature of enterprise property rights
Construction Research Congress 2022,"The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is introduced to a lot of innovations and changes in various types such as technology (software and hardware informational systems), management process (alternative project delivery, alternative procurement methods, and process improvements), and business structure (mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations, prefabrication, etc.). The industry is rapidly adopting different types of changes. The objective of the study was to determine if certain types of change are harder than others to successfully adopt and implement. An industry-wide approach was taken using an online survey methodology to collect more than 500 cases of organization-wide changes from AEC firms across the United States and Canada. The method of analysis includes reliability testing, principal component analysis, and group differences. The results showed that successful adoption rates of different types of change were not significantly different for certain change types than the others. Further analysis was performed to determine if different demographical considerations of adopting organizations (type and size) had different rates of successful adoption of change. The overall successful adoption rates were generally consistent between different demographical considerations of adopting organizations, but there were minor differences. The discussion addresses those minor differences and provides possible explanations. For example, higher rates of successful adoption were found in specialized firms (roofing contractors, plumbing contractors, etc.) when compared to wide-focused firms (general contractors, EPC firms, etc.). This study contributes an industry-wide view of successful change adoption rates between different types of changes and different demographical considerations of adopting organizations in the AEC industry.","Maali, Omar;Shalwani, Amirali;Lines, Brian;Hurtado, Kristen;Sullivan, Kenneth",Conference Proceeding,"Construction Research Congress 2022: Project Management and Delivery, Controls, and Design and Materials - Selected Papers from Construction Research Congress 2022",2022-01-01,KU School of Engineering;Ira A.

Load Balancing and Parallel Computation Model for Performance and Accuracy over the Cluster of Nodes,"Cloud Computing can be online based network engineering which contributed with a rapid advancement at the progress of communication technological innovation by supplying assistance to clients of assorted conditions with aid from online computing sources. It's terms of hardware and software apps together side software growth testing and platforms applications because tools. Large-scale heterogeneous distributed computing surroundings give the assurance of usage of a huge quantity of computing tools in a comparatively low price. As a way to lessen the software development and setup onto such complicated surroundings, high speed parallel programming languages exist which have to be encouraged by complex operating techniques. There are numerous advantages for consumers in terms of cost and flexibility that come with Cloud computing's anticipated uptake. Building on well-established research in Internet solutions, networks and utility computing, virtualization et cetera Service-Oriented Architectures and the Internet of Services (IoS) have implications for a wide range of technological issues such as parallel computing and load balancing as well as high availability and scalability. Effective load balancing methods are essential to solving these issues. Since such systems' size and complexity make it impossible to concentrate job execution on a few select servers, a parallel distributed solution is required. Adaptive task load model is the name of the method wesuggest in our article for balancing the workload (ATLM). We developed an adaptive parallel distributed computing paradigm as a result of this (ADPM). While still maintaining the model's integrity, ADPM employs a more flexible synchronization approach to cut down on the amount of time synchronous operations use. As well as the ATLM load balancing technique, which solves the straggler issue caused by the performance disparity between nodes, ADPM also applies it to ensure model correctness. The results indicate that combining ADPM and ATLM improves training efficiency without compromising model correctness.","Vasuda, V.;Srividya, K.;Anusha, M.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Innovative Practices in Technology and Management, ICIPTM 2022",2022-01-01,Vasavi College of Engineering,Cloud Computing ;  Load balancing ;  Parallel computing ;  Service Oriented Architectures
"3D Bioprinting, Nanotechnology, and Intellectual Property","Like many modern technologies, 3D printing and nanotechnology improve every day through new innovations and improvements upon current systems, methods, and materials. These innovations and improvements are made possible by inventors and researchers striving to benefit society. In addition to the satisfaction of benefitting society, the inventors and researchers, as well as the institutions and companies that fund and enable research and testing, need assurance that the time and money spent advancing technology will be recovered, to fund additional research with successful innovations. Intellectual property (IP) laws provide this assurance by protecting innovations and improvements, including many aspects of 3D bioprinting and nanotechnology. But there are exceptions to protection, and there are legal and ethical challenges to enforcing IP rights for 3D bioprinting and nanotechnology in tissue engineering.","Ferrill, Elizabeth D.;Rajan, Kai",Book,3D Bioprinting and Nanotechnology in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine,2022-01-01,"Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett and Dunner L.L.P.",Copyright ;  Infringement ;  Innovation ;  Intellectual property ;  IP ;  Patent ;  Trade secret ;  Trademark
Seeking High IMP Reliability in Maintenance of the 1970s ARPAnet,"During the first years of ARPAnet operations, computers were not highly reliable, but the network was built from standard computers and was expected to function as a utility with high reliability. We managed to achieve the desired reliability, as perceived by ARPAnet users, by making innovations in hardware, maintenance procedures, software, and network operations. This article draws heavily on the personal experiences of the authors, many of which have not been previously reported in the literature. Our focus is on the 1969-1975 time period when ARPAnet was the sole responsibility of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). A 2018 paper (Fidler et al., 2018) discusses ARPAnet maintenance after 1975. The preparation of this article was spearheaded by David Walden. David recruited the other 2 authors, prepared the outline of the paper he envisioned, and drafted some sections.

"Robots Are Actor-Networks: Awareness, Bottom-Up Ethics and Transforming Responsibility","Robotic systems increasingly take part in many practices of the everyday life. Technological development and innovation continuously transform fields, including the realm of industrial robotics. However, new sets of possibilities challenge new forms of responsibilities. This paper discusses responsibility and ethics in robotics. Based on three expert talks, three qualitative expert interviews and five qualitative narrative interviews with robotic engineers, it gives three preliminary findings of the research project Collective Ethical Responsibility for Robotic Systems Engineering with Safety & Security (CERSE): 1. Robotics are networks (The term network, used in this paper, does not refer to computer or technological networks, but to the assemblage of interconnected actors [1, p. 228] as used in Actor-Network Theory (ANT).) formed by hybrid actors. 2. These networks distribute and (self-)govern responsibility. 3. Engineers call for pro-active reflection and communication to raise awareness. This paper supports a radical transformation of the notion of responsibility within the realms of robotics. In line with the complexity, interconnectedness, and fluidity of robotics, robot ethics must move towards more openness, inclusion, and transdisciplinary research.","Duller, Nicole",Book Series,Mechanisms and Machine Science,2022-01-01,Universität Klagenfurt,Actor-Network Theory ;  AI ethics ;  Governance ;  Process-ethics ;  Responsibility ;  Robot ethics ;  Robots

According to the specific characteristics of the building, the surrounding environmental traffic, geology and hydrology, climate conditions and other conditions, combined with the subjective conditions of construction and construction, a comprehensive balance analysis is required to make various resource allocation plans and implement measures. In terms of dynamic deformation monitoring, through three technical means of measuring robot, high-frequency GPS, and photogrammetry, real-time monitoring and data analysis of buildings are carried out, and the deformation conditions of buildings are predicted in advance, and corrective measures are taken to realize the actual situation once. The research on the construction measurement technology of super high-rise buildings has a positive role in promoting the development of super high-rise building construction technology itself, and has also played a role in promoting and reforming domestic construction methods and construction concepts. Through the application research of this technology, it has reserved scientific and technological innovation talents for engineering projects and enterprises, and provided valuable experience for the construction measurement control of similar large-scale construction projects. It has significant technical, economic, and social benefits.","Yan, Jiabin",Conference Proceeding,Springer Proceedings in Physics,2022-01-01,Yunnan University,
"Women in Engineering: Myths, Measures and Policies","Quality Education and Gender Equality are among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. Girls and women are the greatest untapped population who would contribute enormously to the growth of innovation. With evolving policies and institutional efforts to promote women scientists globally, there is a significant gap still lies in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. A recent ground-breaking report of UNESCO reveals that only 35% of STEM students in higher education are women who result in 28% of the STEM workforce across all the world’s researchers. Differences are observed much wider in the hard sciences like mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Other international research also shows that women make up just 12–15% of all engineers around the world. However, a recent survey report by the Royal Academy of Engineering revealed that over 80% of female engineers are happy in their job and 98% of women engineers find their job rewarding. Despite these facts, most of the nations are losing potential women engineers at every stage of life, and it starts from a young age because of bias and misconceptions in media. There are societal, cultural, institutional factors, and belief systems which are impediments to women in STEM. Gender stereotypes are part of societal belief and govern the attitudes towards female and male roles, their occupations, and their perception of masculine and feminine work. There are many myths and stereotype in a society which push women back in engineering career like girls are bad in Mathematics, engineering is ‘too difficult’ and require physical strength. Divergent attitudes formed by girls and boys in childhood and systemic biases limit the range of career options and opportunities available to them in adulthood. This study engages with women engineers to record the impact of available myths, unconscious biases, stereotypes, ongoing policies & programs and compare the findings to unfold some of their struggles which is linked to retaining women in engineering professions. Though no single strategy can entirely plug the leak, there is a need for a multi-faceted approach for debunking the myths and spreading the facts. Strengthen the capacity of countries to deliver gender-responsive education, including through the involvement of women role models, their photographs in textbooks, teachers’ training, and enhance awareness of the importance of engineering education for girls and women. To achieve all targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and future wellbeing, the engineering workforce must equally represent by women.","Sharma, Jyoti;Yarlagadda, Prasad K.D.V.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2022-01-01,"Ministry of Science And Technology, India;Queensland University of Technology",Engineering ;  Girls ;  STEM ;  Women
Innovation in Health at the Service of Emergency Department and Clinician-Researchers: the Journey and Clinical Evaluation of a Medical Device,"The alliance of the world of health with that of new technologies can generate a new field for research and medical practice. The new European Community (CE) marking regulations (2017/745) now require any medical device (MD), including computer software, to undergo a rigorous clinical evaluation. Emergency services are particularly at the forefront in terms of their appetite for new technologies. They are increasingly solicited by existing or new companies working in the field of engineering for the health sector, but also by researchers in fundamental engineering. In view of these elements, it seemed relevant to us to define the stages and milestones of an innovative health project involving a MD for doctors and clinician-researchers in emergency medicine. After passing the first stages of development, materialized by the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale, clinical investigations are necessary in order to obtain a CE mark from a notified body. Depending on the characteristics of the medical device, different ways of being covered by the community are possible, and may require additional clinical, medico-economic or organizational evidence. The expectations of stakeholders and the steps associated with the market access process can be a barrier to the development of future MDs. The association between researchers, clinician-researchers and industrialists should allow the emergence of innovative and practical tools for tomorrow's emergency medicine, provided that these steps are well understood.","Vuillaume, L.

A Survey-driven Feature Model for Software Traceability Approaches,"Traceability is the capability to represent, understand and analyze the relationships between software artefacts. Traceability is at the core of many software engineering activities. This is a blessing in disguise as traceability research is scattered among various research subfields, which impairs a global view and integration of the different innovations around the recording, identification, evaluation and management of traces. This also limits the adoption of traceability solutions in industry. In this sense, the goal of this paper is to present a characterization of the traceability mechanism as a feature model depicting the shared and variable elements in any traceability proposal. The features in the model are derived from a survey of papers related to traceability published in the literature. We believe this feature model is useful to assess and compare different proposals and provide a common terminology and background. Beyond the feature model, the survey we conducted also help us to identify a number of challenges to be solved in order to move traceability forward, especially in a context where, due to the increasing importance of AI techniques in Software Engineering, traces are more important than ever in order to be able to reproduce and explain AI decisions.","Batot, Edouard Romari;Gérard, Sebastien;Cabot, Jordi",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2022-01-01,"CEA, Institut LIST;Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats;Universitat Oberta de Catalunya",
Organizational-Technological Genesis as the Basis for Information Modeling of the Building Systems Changes,"Global economic concepts are increasingly focusing on the renewability and sustainability of the product life cycle. These approaches in relation to the final product of the construction industry (building and its life cycle) require analysis, accounting and information modeling of the causes and impact of changes at different stages of the life cycle of buildings. In terms of content, exploring the possibilities and ways of accommodating future changes in building maintenance requirements and designing the building’s innovative receptivity is consistent with genetic research methods. Genesis is effective for information modeling and project development of the life cycle of building systems, since it meets the specifics of construction and the life cycle of a building. The application of organizational and technological genesis as a methodology for studying the emergence, formation and subsequent development of an engineering facility and building systems is considered. The article analyzes the groups of factors influencing the life cycle of the building and the information models of building systems necessary for the analysis of their changes. It is shown that the genetic method of information modeling allows building systems to adequately and quickly reflect technological and organizational innovations and to increase the overall adaptive resource of the designed building. This will help to increase not only the innovative susceptibility of building subsystems and the adaptive resource of the building, but, as a result, to raise the efficiency of the entire life cycle of the building.","Gusakova, Elena A.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2022-01-01,Moscow State University of Civil Engineering,Adaptation resource ;  Construction project ;  Full life cycle ;  Information model ;  Innovative receptivity ;  Organizational-technological genesis
A Framework for Well-Being Integrated Development Environments (WIDEs): Research Preview,"[Context and Motivation] To date there are very few approaches for systematic requirements modelling of software from a mental-well-being-awareness perspective. There are even less technological innovations that address the need for mental-well-being-aware learning and teaching environment among Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics higher education (STEM HE) students. STEM HE student that study computing would typically work with integrated development environments (IDEs) for prolonged periods. This can make them more susceptible to technostress factors. Technostress is the inability to cope in a healthy way with technology. Technostress factors threaten the long-term mental health, productivity, and achievement outcomes of these students. [Question/Problem] In this paper, our target problem is the lack of systematic requirements modelling support and design guidelines for producing mental-well-being-aware IDEs that cater for technostress factors. [Contribution] We address this problem by proposing a novel idea for a framework that includes guidance for modelling the requirements for and designing the architectures of Well-being Integrated Development Environments (WIDEs). WIDEs aims to communicate programming errors such as runtime and syntax errors in a mental-well-being-aware manner.","Hassan, Sara;Wilson, Andrew Sean;Galvin, John",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2022-01-01,Birmingham City University,mental well-being ;  software architectural modelling ;  software design framework ;  software design guidelines

"Comprehensive review on biotechnological production of hyaluronic acid: status, innovation, market and applications","The growing, existing demand for low-cost and high-quality hyaluronic acid (HA) needs an outlook of different possible production strategies from renewable resources with the reduced possibility of cross-infections. Recently, the possibility of producing HA from harmless microorganisms appeared, which offers the opportunity to make HA more economical, without raw material limitations, and environmentally friendly. HA production is mainly reported with Lancefield Streptococci A and C, particularly from S. equi and S. zooepidemicus. Various modes of fermentation such as batch, repeated batch, fed-batch, and continuous culture have been investigated to optimize HA production, particularly from S. zooepidemicus, obtaining a HA yield of 2.5 g L−1–7.0 g L−1. Among the different utilized DSP approaches of HA production, recovery with cold ethanol (4°C) and cetylpyridinium chloride is the ideal strategy for lab-scale HA production. On the industrial scale, besides using isopropanol, filtration (0.22 um), ultrafiltration (100 kDa), and activated carbon absorption are employed to obtain HA of low molecular weight and additional ultrafiltration to purify HA of higher MW. Even though mature technologies have already been developed for the industrial production of HA, the projections of increased sales volume and the expansion of application possibilities require new processes to obtain HA with higher productivity, purity, and specific molecular weights. In this review, we have put forth the progress of HA technological research by discussing the microbial biosynthetic aspects, fermentation and downstream strategies, industrial-scale scenarios of HA, and the prospects of HA production to meet the current and ongoing market demands.","Ucm, Ruschoni;Aem, Mera;Lhb, Zamudio;Kumar, Vinod;Taherzadeh, Mohammad J.;Garlapati, Vijay Kumar;Chandel, Anuj Kumar",Journal,Bioengineered,2022-01-01,"Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan;Högskolan i Borås;Universidade de São Paulo;Cranfield University",downstream processing ;  fermentation ;  Hyaluronic acid ;  industrial scenario ;  streptococcus zooepidemicus
SFTSDH: Applying Spring Security Framework with TSD-Based OAuth2 to Protect Microservice Architecture APIs,"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) combines medical devices and applications that use network technologies to connect healthcare information systems (HIS). IoMT is reforming the medical industry by adopting information and communication technologies (ICTs). Identity verification, secure collection, and exchange of medical data are essential in health applications. In this study, we implemented a hybrid security solution to secure the collection and management of personal health data using Spring Framework (SF), Services for Sensitive Data (TSD) as a service platform, and Hyper-Text-Transfer-Protocol (HTTP (H)) security methods. The adopted solution (SFTSDH = SF + TSD + H) instigated the following security features: identity brokering, OAuth2, multifactor authentication, and access control to protect the Microservices Architecture Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), following the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Moreover, we extended the adopted security solution to develop a digital infrastructure to facilitate the research and innovation work in the electronic health (eHealth) section, focusing on solution validation with theoretical evaluation and experimental testing. We used a web engineering security methodology to achieve and explain the adopted security solution. As a case study, we designed and implemented electronic coaching (eCoaching) prototype system and deployed the same in the developed infrastructure to securely record and share personal health data. Furthermore, we compared the test results with related studies qualitatively for the efficient evaluation of the implemented security solution. The SFTSDH implementation and configuration in the prototype system have effectively secured the eCoach APIs from an attack in all the considered scenarios. The eCoach prototype with the SFTSDH solution effectively sustained a load of (≈) 1000 concurrent users in the developed digital health infrastructure. In addition, we performed a qualitative comparison among the following security solutions: SF security, third-party security, and SFTSDH, where SFTSDH showed a promising outcome.","Chatterjee, Ayan;Gerdes, Martin W.;Khatiwada, Pankaj;Prinz, Andreas",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Universitetet i Agder;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,API Security ;  eCoach ;  HTTP ;  OAuth2 ;  spring framework ;  TSD

R-Set COPRAS (R-COPRAS) Methods-Based Multi-Attribute Decision-Making with RBM and RGBM Operators: A Case Study of Smart Mine Project Safety Assessment,"The R-set is modeled by considering the risks associated with sources of information and future events. In the current work, there is no research on the aggregation operator of the R-set, and no in-depth research on its multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods. In order to extend the application of R-set more widely, this paper aims to propose a new risk-based fuzzy complex proportional assessment (R-COPRAS) method. First, the R-set Bonferroni mean (RBM) operator and the R-set geometric Bonferroni mean (RGBM) operator are investigated. Then, the correlation properties of these operators are studied. Based on these two operators, COPRAS methods in R-set environment are proposed, which consider the decision risk and can provide stable decision results. Ultimately, a smart mine safety assessment project is proposed to test and check the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed R-COPRAS methods.","Fan, Jianping;Cheng, Rui;Wu, Meiqin",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,Shanxi University,complex proportional assessment ;  multi-attribute decision-making ;  R-set ;  R-set Bonferroni mean operator ;  R-set geometric Bonferroni mean operator
Digital Value Creation in sociotechnical Systems,"Digital value creation poses a challenge for many organizations. In line with our research, value is created by combining hybrid service bundles into product service systems. Companies combine resources and human performance to create and distribute goods and services. In doing so, they create sociotechnical systems of value creation. The human factor within sociotechnical systems is a significant contributor to value creation. This study compares the contribution of organizational and human factors in developing digital product service systems. A computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) with 200 German companies was conducted to understand how organizational structure, business model innovation (BMI) processes and employer qualification influence BMI. Results show that human factors have the strongest impact on developing digital networked business models. Hereby, the form of equipping the workforce plays a crucial role. As a result, organizations should focus on qualification of work to equip themselves and their employees for digital value creation.","Trabert, Thomas;Beiner, Sebastian;Lehmann, Claudia;Kinkel, Steffen",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2022-01-01,Handelshochschule Leipzig;Institut für Lernen und Innovation in Netzwerken,digital transformation ;  human factor ;  sociotechnical systems ;  value creation
Bridging the gap: Brain drain to brain circulation: Researching successful strategies to support effective change,"The human capital of a region or an entire country is an essential contribution to the formation of a European scientific community of well-educated and professional people and crucial for the preservation of competitiveness and work ability, as well as for responsible resources management of the world and its - primary and secondary - raw materials. Funded by the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT), the project 'OpESEE MSc ENTER' and its Master degree programme, was developed through the cooperation of 6 partners, where the Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg (TUBAF) has the lead. The project aims at supporting entrepreneurs and releasing highly qualified mechanical engineers whose goal is to create a start-up in the raw materials sector within the East-Southeast Europe (ESEE) region. The authors' main part in the project was to investigate brain drain and its' effects on talent retention and attraction in order to better understand the primary motives for study and subsequent labour market choices, with a focus on start-up creation. In addition, a significant contribution can thus be made to cross-regional exchange to counteract the brain-drain phenomenon and to legal migration. A secondary literature desk review was conducted covering previous studies and articles on the topic and from various sources, which in turn provided the foundation for setting up a primary pilot study and analysis with the ESEE target audience to test premises that were found in the secondary research. Finally, this study was upscaled and executed with all 6 project partner institutions, current students, Alumni, and Professionals to form the basis of recommendations on successful strategies to be incorporated into the project in the form of an action plan named 'Back to ESEE'; bridging the gap; from brain drain to brain circulation.","Murphy, Mariaelena;Pacher, Corina",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2022-01-01,Montanuniversitat Leoben;Technische Universitat Graz,Brain Circulation ;  Brain Drain ;  Engineering Education ;  Master Education

From Innovation to Eco-Innovation: Co-Created Training Materials as a Change Driver for Research and Technology Organisations,"The concept of the circular economy has been a major driver in establishing new perspectives in innovation, product design and in technology management. Technological innovation in the context of a circular economy has become a factor of competitiveness, of success in national and European calls for projects, as well as a source of attractiveness for employees. A transition management is operating today in worldwide organisations from innovation intended to only provide additional economic incomes, to innovations that are willing to be sustainable by staying under the planetary boundaries limits and by satisfying some targeted societal needs. The term 'eco-innovation' is among the most cited design for sustainability methods associated with this transformation. The required paradigm shift is a new challenge that technology-intensive organisations must handle with the companies and industries included in this socio-technical system. Such a paradigm shift cannot be achieved without adapting the innovation processes. Moreover, the concept and implementation of eco-innovation remain unclear, lacks in the validation and the experimentation processes are frequent. The overall approach therefore needs to be supported by practical tools and methods for design engineers and applied researchers. This article provides feedback on a project collaboration between a large public-funded research organisation (CEA: Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission) and academic researchers from university (Grenoble Institute of Technology), with the aim of formalising an approach needed to conduct eco-innovation R&D projects. One of the levers in this perspective is the dissemination of applied knowledge (known-how) by providing training materials in order to make R&D engineers aware of the importance of innovation within the circular economy framework. This paper presents the process of development of such educational training conducted in a collaborative way. This training content has the ambition to empower engineers in developing a systemic vision and practical insights in four main topics: sustainability challenges, environmental impact assessment, circular economy vision, and eco-innovation methods. It was tested during pilot workshops and then transformed into an online format.","Rejeb, Helmi Ben;Monnier, Elise;Rio, Maud;Evrard, Damien;Tardif, François;Zwolinski, Peggy",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2022-01-01,Université Grenoble Alpes,Change management ;  Circular Economy ;  D ;  Design for Sustainability ;  Eco-innovation ;  Education ;  R ;  Training

The Application of Adaptive Analytic Hierarchy Process Driven by Multisource Big Data in the Training of School-Enterprise Joint Engineering Ability,"The Chinese government has pointed out in relevant literature that by 2020, China is in short supply of high-level innovative technology talents, and China's engineering education will face unprecedented challenges. Based on the needs of China's future economic development, the Ministry of Education urgently launched the ""Excellent Engineer Education and Training Program""in 2010, which aims to cultivate a large number of solid theoretical foundations, strong practical skills, and high innovation capabilities for the industry, the world, and the future. An outstanding engineer is the one who can quickly adapt to the needs of economic and social development. The program is divided into three levels of undergraduate, master, and doctoral training. The undergraduate level focuses on training in a series of high-quality applications capable of not only being competent in the management and marketing of the production site but also in the design, development, and operation of engineering projects. Talent: to achieve this training goal, the in-depth cooperation between schools and enterprises has become the key. In order to achieve the undergraduate-level training goals of the ""Excellence Program,""various local colleges and universities have adopted the method of school-enterprise cooperation, combined with their own school positioning, trying to explore a training path suitable for their own development. This research takes China's local application-oriented universities as the research object and uses the literature method to sort out and summarize the status quo of the school-enterprise cooperation in training outstanding engineers in China's local application-oriented universities. Select two different application-oriented universities located in areas with large economic development gaps, analyze their common problems, and try to put forward countermeasures and suggestions.","Zhang, Liqing",Journal,Scientific Programming,2022-01-01,Changchun University,
"Factors Impacting Highly Innovative Designs: Idea Fluency, Timing, and Order","Ongoing work within the engineering design research community seeks to develop automated design methods and tools that enhance the natural capabilities of designers in developing highly innovative concepts. Central to this vision is the ability to first obtain a deep understanding of the underlying behavior and process dynamics that predict successful performance in early-stage concept generation. The objective of this research is to better understand the predictive factors that lead to improved performance during concept generation. In particular, this work focuses on the impact of idea fluency and timing of early-stage design concepts and their effect on overall measures of ideation session success. To accomplish this, we leverage an existing large-scale dataset containing hundreds of early-stage design concepts; each concept contains detailed ratings regarding its overall feasibility, usefulness, and novelty, as well as when in the ideation session the idea was recorded. Surprisingly, results indicate that there is no effect of idea fluency or timing on the quality of the output when using a holistic evaluation mechanism, such as the innovation measure, instead of a single measure such as novelty. Thus, exceptional concepts can be achieved by all participant segments independent of idea fluency. Furthermore, in early-stage concept generation sessions, highest-rated concepts have an equal probability of occurring early and late in a session. Taken together, these findings can be used to improve performance in ideation by effectively determining when and which types of design interventions future design tools might suggest.","Mirabito, Yakira;Goucher-Lambert, Kosa",Journal,Journal of Mechanical Design,2022-01-01,Department of Mechanical Engineering,conceptual design ;  creativity and concept generation ;  design theory and methodology

Designing a Console for Future Space Operations,"The launch of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Demo-2 Capsule generated a wave of new technology and inspiration for innovation within the space industry, especially in function and design. One major difference observed by those that watched the launch was the prominent use of a touch screen console. The question this research addresses: are touch screen consoles superior to those that use mechanical switches and controls? With implementing new technology, concerns have been made about both the safety of the new design and its efficiency. Through the utilization of journal articles and public information released by space agencies, this research focuses in survey of current and past console design through an industrial engineering lens. As there are many factors to consider that are atypical to traditional touch screen when considered for use in a spacecraft including g-forces, vibrations, redundancy requirements and user traditionally wearing multi-layer protective equipment, many aspects of the usefulness were evaluated. Additionally, assumptions about current technological advancements like autonomous navigation are considered being a part of the ultimate spacecraft system. Recommendations on how the console design should be conducted in the future are included in this paper. Ultimately, it is determined that a hybrid solution would be the best path for a dual-fault tolerant system. This would allow for the infusion of technology, enabling a more diverse space traveler, while prioritizing safety in this path of exploration and operations.","Seidel, Alexander Gerald",Book Series,Springer Aerospace Technology,2022-01-01,Pennsylvania State University,Commercial spaceflight ;  Console design ;  Mechanical consoles ;  NASA ;  Touch screens consoles

Technological innovation and economic growth in Southern Africa: Application of panel dynamic OLS regression,"The effect of technological innovation on economic growth has received significant attention in the developed world over the last decades due to its speedy development and potential impacts. However, little is known in the context of developing countries, arguably due to data challenges. This paper uses panel dynamic Ordinary Least Square regression with annual data from the World Bank and global economy (2004–17) to examine the empirical link between technological innovation and economic growth in Southern Africa. The study finds that technological innovation indicators such as researchers in research and development, graduates from information and communication technology, patents-nonresidents, graduates from science, technology, engineering and mathematics and scientific and technical outputs have significant positive relationship with per capita economic growth in the long run, but no relationship exists for patents-residents and government expenditure with per capita economic growth. Based on the findings, policy intervention and strategies that promote these indicators are recommended.","Anakpo, Godfred;Oyenubi, Adeola",Journal,Development Southern Africa,2022-01-01,"University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg",economic growth ;  panel dynamic OLS ;  Southern Africa ;  Technological innovation
Research on Hospital Information System Course Design and Evaluation Based on Project-Driving Method,"Health Information System (HIS) course, which is a discipline that combines hospital management with computer science, is generally taken at the undergraduate level and has strong comprehensiveness and practicality. However, most traditional teachings are separated from practical operation in the current teaching process, which is cannot really promote students' practical ability. To solve these problems, we propose a course teaching system based on project-driving method to carry out the design and applied research of HIS course teaching. It includes the project-driving design, theory teaching modules, practical teaching design, and grading plan. Then we design a questionnaire on the needs for students' evaluation feedback. The results show that compared with traditional teaching methods, our teaching method can better improve the learning interest, self-learning ability, engineering practice ability, and innovation and as well as teamwork of students.","Liu, Wei;Zhang, Jin",Conference Proceeding,"2022 11th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology, ICEIT 2022",2022-01-01,Hainan Medical University,improving classroom teaching ;  media in education ;  mobile learning ;  post-secondary education ;  teaching/learning strategies
Driving Transformational Sustainability in a University Through Structural and Academic Innovation: A Case Study of A Public University in Spain,"Higher education institutions (HEIs) are increasingly engaged in the urgent and important work involved in the global transition towards sustainable development. They are potentially well suited to address key challenges, being as they are knowledge and talent ‘factories’. Beyond their educational mission, HEIs are particularly well placed to convene other actors as well as enable the conscious collision of disciplines in pursuit of solutions. However, academic programs that ostensibly focus on sustainability are in fact too narrow in scope and can stand isolated. The academic custom disciplinary and organizational silos can also exacerbate the intellectual and structural difficulties to fuller immersion in sustainability by the academy. Using a case-study approach, we examine an academic innovation (Master’s Program in Strategies and Technologies for Development), and a structural innovation (Innovation and Technology for Development Centre, itdUPM), two discrete change agency initiatives at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Going on to explore the interactions between the Master’s and itdUPM, the case identifies how the latter structural innovation as a supporting structure enables the development of transformational sustainability at the university-level, generating longterm societal impacts through a transformative learning. Our findings suggest that pan-institutional inter-disciplinary sustainability-oriented programs may serve as a powerful lever for HEIs to contribute to sustainability challenges, representing vehicles for effecting change within an institutional context. Nevertheless, academic innovation is considered a necessary condition, but is not sufficient alone. The case shows that the innovation processes must go beyond the borders of educational programs to promote changes in the internal structure of universities and new multi-stakeholder ecosystems. They may furnish learning and research opportunities for students and staff, and income generating activities for universities. However, to keep this “virtuous loop” active at HEIs, innovative intermediate structures such as itdUPM are required to cultivate trust capital and foster value creation.","Moreno-Serna, Jaime;Sánchez-Chaparro, Teresa;Purcell, Wendy M.;Mataix, Carlos",Journal,Advances in Engineering Education,2022-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Harvard University,Partnerships ;  Structural and academic innovation ;  Transformative learning
Animal models and animal-free innovations for cardiovascular research: current status and routes to be explored. Consensus document of the ESC Working Group on Myocardial Function and the ESC Working Group on Cellular Biology of the Heart,"Cardiovascular diseases represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality, necessitating research to improve diagnostics, and to discover and test novel preventive and curative therapies, all of which warrant experimental models that recapitulate human disease. The translation of basic science results to clinical practice is a challenging task, in particular for complex conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, which often result from multiple risk factors and comorbidities. This difficulty might lead some individuals to question the value of animal research, citing the translational 'valley of death', which largely reflects the fact that studies in rodents are difficult to translate to humans. This is also influenced by the fact that new, human-derived in vitro models can recapitulate aspects of disease processes. However, it would be a mistake to think that animal models do not represent a vital step in the translational pathway as they do provide important pathophysiological insights into disease mechanisms particularly on an organ and systemic level. While stem cell-derived human models have the potential to become key in testing toxicity and effectiveness of new drugs, we need to be realistic, and carefully validate all new human-like disease models. In this position paper, we highlight recent advances in trying to reduce the number of animals for cardiovascular research ranging from stem cell-derived models to in situ modelling of heart properties, bioinformatic models based on large datasets, and state-of-the-art animal models, which show clinically relevant characteristics observed in patients with a cardiovascular disease. We aim to provide a guide to help researchers in their experimental design to translate bench findings to clinical routine taking the replacement, reduction, and refinement (3R) as a guiding concept.","van der Velden, Jolanda;Asselbergs, Folkert W.;Bakkers, Jeroen;Batkai, Sandor;Bertrand, Luc;Bezzina, Connie R.;Bot, Ilze;Brundel, Bianca J.J.M.;Carrier, Lucie;Chamuleau, Steven;Ciccarelli, Michele;Dawson, Dana;Davidson, Sean M.;Dendorfer, Andreas;Duncker, Dirk J.;Eschenhagen, Thomas;Fabritz, Larissa;Falcão-Pires, Ines;Ferdinandy, Péter;Giacca, Mauro;Girao, Henrique;Gollmann-Tepeköylü, Can;Gyongyosi, Mariann;Guzik, Tomasz J.;Hamdani, Nazha;Heymans, Stephane;Hilfiker, Andres;Hilfiker-Kleiner, Denise;Hoekstra, Alfons G.;Hulot, Jean Sébastien;Kuster, Diederik W.D.;van Laake, Linda W.;Lecour, Sandrine;Leiner, Tim;Linke, Wolfgang A.;Lumens, Joost;Lutgens, Esther;Madonna, Rosalinda;Maegdefessel, Lars;Mayr, Manuel;van der Meer, Peter;Passier, Robert;Perbellini, Filippo;Perrino, Cinzia;Pesce, Maurizio;Priori, Silvia;Remme, Carol Ann;Rosenhahn, Bodo;Schotten, Ulrich;Schulz, Rainer;Sipido, Karin R.;Sluijter, Joost P.G.;van Steenbeek, Frank;Steffens, Sabine;Terracciano, Cesare M.;Tocchetti, Carlo Gabriele;Vlasman, Patricia;Yeung, Kak Khee;Zacchigna, Serena;Zwaagman, Dayenne;Thum, Thomas",Journal,Cardiovascular Research,2022-01-01,"Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences;Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri Spa – SB;PARCC - Paris-Centre de Recherche Cardiovasculaire;Departement Cardiovasculaire Wetenschappen;Faculteit Diergeneeskunde;Pharmahungary Group;Centre for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology;Universitäre Herz- und Gefäßzentrum UKE Hamburg GmbH;Deutsches Zentrum für Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung e.

Visualizing the next frontiers in wine yeast research,"A range of game-changing biodigital and biodesign technologies are coming of age all around us, transforming our world in complex ways that are hard to predict. Not a day goes by without news of how data-centric engineering, algorithm-driven modelling, and biocyber technologies - including the convergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, automated robotics, quantum computing, and genome editing - will change our world. If we are to be better at expecting the unexpected in the world of wine, we need to gain deeper insights into the potential and limitations of these technological developments and advances along with their promise and perils. This article anticipates how these fast-expanding bioinformational and biodesign toolkits might lead to the creation of synthetic organisms and model systems, and ultimately new understandings of biological complexities could be achieved. A total of four future frontiers in wine yeast research are discussed in this article: the construction of fully synthetic yeast genomes, including minimal genomes; supernumerary pan-genome neochromosomes; synthetic metagenomes; and synthetic yeast communities. These four concepts are at varying stages of development with plenty of technological pitfalls to overcome before such model chromosomes, genomes, strains, and yeast communities could illuminate some of the ill-understood aspects of yeast resilience, fermentation performance, flavour biosynthesis, and ecological interactions in vineyard and winery settings. From a winemaker's perspective, some of these ideas might be considered as far-fetched and, as such, tempting to ignore. However, synthetic biologists know that by exploring these futuristic concepts in the laboratory could well forge new research frontiers to deepen our understanding of the complexities of consistently producing fine wines with different fermentation processes from distinctive viticultural terroirs. As the saying goes in the disruptive technology industry, it take years to create an overnight success. The purpose of this article is neither to glorify any of these concepts as a panacea to all ills nor to crucify them as a danger to winemaking traditions. Rather, this article suggests that these proposed research endeavours deserve due consideration because they are likely to cast new light on the genetic blind spots of wine yeasts, and how they interact as communities in vineyards and wineries. Future-focussed research is, of course, designed to be subject to revision as new data and technologies become available. Successful dislodging of old paradigms with transformative innovations will require open-mindedness and pragmatism, not dogmatism - and this can make for a catch-22 situation in an archetypal traditional industry, such as the wine industry, with its rich territorial and socio-cultural connotations.","Pretorius, I.

Research on the Mechanism of the Role of Innovation-Influencing Factors on the Performance of Construction Projects,"At present, innovation has gradually become an inevitable trend of the digital transformation and competitive advantage of enterprises in the construction industry. In this paper, the structural equation model is constructed from four aspects of innovation-influencing factors, such as hindering, driving, enabling, and investing, as well as project and enterprise performance. The participants of engineering construction projects from several regions in China have been investigated. Factor analysis and structural equation model analysis have been carried out on the collected data using SPSS and AMOS software. Both drive factors and enabling factorss can play an important role in promoting innovation input. As an intermediary variable, innovation input can directly stimulate project and enterprise performance, and the improvement of enterprise performance is also positively dependent on project performance.","Wang, Shiming;Li, Caiyun",Journal,Advances in Civil Engineering,2022-01-01,Liaoning Technical University,
The Impact of Network Ties on SMEs' Business Model Innovation and Enterprise Growth: Evidence from China,"In the context of digitalization, business model innovation has become a key way for enterprises to obtain competitive advantages. However, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still do not know how to effectively realize business model innovation. Exploring the factors affecting the realization of business model innovation or the effective path to promote business model innovation in SMEs has become a hot topic of research. Exogenous growth theory points out that network ties have become an important way for SMEs to obtain external resources and promote enterprise growth. However, the existing research ignores the impact of network ties on the SMEs' business model innovation. Focusing on this theoretical gap, this study constructs a 'network ties - business model innovation - enterprise growth' model to explore the influence mechanism of five network ties of SMEs: customer ties, supplier ties, competitor ties, political ties, and knowledge ties on business model innovation and enterprise growth. Based on a questionnaire survey of 234 SMEs in Chengdu, China, the research hypothesis was tested using PLS-SEM and fsQCA. The PLS-SME results show that the customers, suppliers, competitors, and knowledge ties of SMEs have a significant positive effect on business model innovation, and business model innovation has a significant positive effect on enterprise growth. In addition, business model innovation plays a mediating role between supplier ties, competitor ties, knowledge ties, and enterprise growth. The fsQCA results show that three paths lead to high-level business model innovation of SMEs, among which customer ties, supplier ties, competition ties, and knowledge ties are the necessary conditions, and three paths lead to high-level growth of SMEs, among which business model innovation is the most core necessary condition. The conclusion of this study not only enriches the relevant research on social network theory and business model innovation but also provides practical insights for SME managers to use network ties to realize business model innovation and promote enterprise growth.","Yang, Zhou;Likai, Zhang;Ruoyu, Lu",Journal,IEEE Access,2022-01-01,School of Management and Economics of UESTC;University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,business model innovation ;  enterprise growth ;  fsQCA ;  network ties ;  PLS-SEM ;  SMEs
Construction of Maker Educational Resource Sharing Platform Based on Web Technology,"With the advent of the era of knowledge economy, knowledge, as an intangible resource, is gradually replacing material resources in the traditional sense and becoming a key factor in promoting social progress. The openness and exchange of knowledge has become an urgent need for people. With the popularization of the global Internet, various resource management platforms based on network technology have been favored by all walks of life, and enterprises in the education field have become the focus of attention in particular.

Circular Economy (CE) Innovation and Internationalization of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): Geographical Overview and Sectorial Patterns,"The functional processes and the upgrading strategies in a company environment depend not only on the firm’s internal and external sourcing strategies but also on international experience and interactions developed outside the company per se. It is also apparent that internationalization motivates firms to deal with the exclusive needs of customers while competing with successful products of their competitors, thus pursuing innovation as an entrepreneurial necessity. In this context, emerging-market SMEs could learn and innovate by imitating and reverse engineering successful products. This study explored the key characteristics on innovative and internationalization efforts reported to SMEs companies at a wide geographical and sectorial coverage. In this research context, the managerial constraints, the entrepreneurial challenges, and the future prospects of SMEs have been systematically reviewed and discussed in alignment with their innovation and internationalization perspectives offered from the side of circular economy (CE).","Kyriakopoulos, G.

Education for Advancing the Implementation of the Green Deal Goals for Bioeconomy,"Evolving complex concepts, such as bioeconomy, in the most effective way, can be applied through the education of students and professionals. In recent years changes in the education system can be observed with the development of knowledge-based learning. Competence-based learning will also be used more and more in higher education. Higher education plays a crucial role in achieving the goals of the Green Deal and the bioeconomy. The main emphasis is on creating new and innovative technologies and methods to achieve these goals. A new master's study program, 'Environmental Engineering', has been established at the Institute of Energy Systems and Environment of Riga Technical University. One of the study directions is 'Bioeconomy'. Considering the developed direction 'Bioeconomy', the importance of this sector is visible. Attention should also be paid to the goals of the Green Deal. This study summarised research on education, bioeconomy and Green Deal topics and analysed the interrelationships between these studies using the VOSviewer tool. During the analysis, it is possible to conclude the main keywords that characterise these studies. The obtained keywords should indicate the development trends of future research, which is in line with education, the 'Green Deal', and bioeconomy.","Kalnbalkite, Antra;Pubule, Jelena;Blumberga, Dagnija",Journal,Environmental and Climate Technologies,2022-01-01,Riga Technical University,Competency-based education ;  Higher education ;  Sustainable education ;  VOSviewer
Innovation and equality: an approach to constructing a community governed network commons,"Networked computing affords users distinct opportunities to communicate with each other, build relationships, transact business, and create. Yet, the digital divide perpetuates existing disparities between social groups. Interventions that rely on private ownership or philanthropy often fall short. Efforts to redress these disparities require collaboration across academic disciplines and with government and private sector organizations. This paper chronicles efforts in Harlem to address this through a collaborative approach to networked computing. We draw on two concepts--responsible innovation and co-governance--to sketch a community-based approach to networked computing. Second, the article identifies two potential systems, based in property law, through which a cross-section of community stakeholders could govern this networked computing infrastructure. In the end, this article seeks to integrate aspects of co-design and responsible innovation and reflects upon building bridges between researchers across academic disciplines, as well as the opportunities and difficulties of partnering with entrepreneurs and civic leaders.","Foley, Rider W.;Sylvain, Olivier;Foster, Sheila",Journal,Journal of Responsible Innovation,2022-01-01,University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science;Fordham University;Georgetown Law,community-first engineering ;  constructed commons ;  Digital divide ;  transdisciplinary research
A typology of social procurement champions in the construction and engineering industry,"Social procurement is re-emerging as an innovative collaborative policy tool for governments around the world to leverage their construction supply chains to help them address intransigent social problems such as long-term unemployment. Such policies challenge deeply rooted institutional norms and structures in the construction industry and research shows that they are being championed by a small and largely undefined group of social procurement professionals who suffer significant role conflict and ambiguity. Contributing new insights to this nascent research, this paper traces etymological definitions of champion roles, merging them with organisational theory to present a new typology of social procurement champions in the construction industry. Drawing on a thematic analysis of snowballed interviews with fifteen recognised champions of social procurement in the Australian construction industry, findings highlight four distinct types of social procurement champion: champions of organisations; champions of the concept; champions of people; and champions of a solution. It is found that there is no one pure type of social procurement champion. Rather, champions have to adapt their social procurement roles to the highly dynamic and varied organisation contexts in which they operate. These findings advance the emerging social procurement debate within and outside construction by highlighting the many different roles which are needed to implement social innovations like social procurement into a project-based industry like construction. It is concluded that organisations which see this as one person’s responsibility are likely to fail in implementing these new policy reforms.","Loosemore, Martin;Keast, Robyn;Barraket, Jo",Journal,Construction Management and Economics,2022-01-01,Melbourne Social Equity Institute;University of Technology Sydney;Southern Cross University,champions ;  corporate social responsibility ;  professionals ;  Social innovation ;  social procurement ;  social value
Research on Innovative Design of Product Packaging Based on Big Data Technology,"Traditional product packaging design mainly relies on the designer's personal experience and intuition, but there are problems such as uncontrollable content and lack of knowledge and guidance in the field of product design. With the development of big data technology, product packaging design in the era of big data is carried out under the support of a large amount of real data, which has high predictability, success rate, and short development cycle. Compared with structured data, unstructured data such as text, images, and audio has a higher value. Among them, text big data and image big data have good application prospects in the field of product packaging design due to their easy data acquisition, mature processing technology, and simple operation. This paper proposes a combination of big data technology and neural style transfer model and proposes an innovative design method for product packaging that can generate high-quality images and controllable content. First, the perceptual engineering theory is used to obtain user needs, to build a mapping model between product modeling elements and product semantics, and to guide the selection of product semantics and style maps; second, use neural style transfer models to reconstruct and combine the color features of style maps. After the integration, it migrated to product packaging design, based on big data product packaging innovation design methods, and developed a product innovation design auxiliary prototype system based on actual needs to improve the company's R&D and innovation capabilities, shorten product development cycles, and reduce R&D costs. Improve product success rate and user satisfaction.","Gan, Fang;Romainoor, Nurul Hanim;Guo, Zhimin",Journal,Scientific Programming,2022-01-01,Guangxi Normal University for Nationalities;Universiti Sains Malaysia;Ltd,
"Leveraging faculty knowledge, experience, and training for leadership education in engineering undergraduate curricula","Leadership is vital in engineering for individual career advancement and innovation across the profession. Although engineering educators have a key role in developing students’ leadership, it is unclear what leadership training and experience they have. This research explores the sources of knowledge, experiences, and roles that engineering educators draw upon to inform their understanding of leadership. The second objective is to examine how, if at all, these experiences and roles influence educators’ teaching of leadership. This study employed an exploratory qualitative approach and thematic analysis, drawing on interviews with 16 engineering educators in the United States. Findings indicated the importance of learning and practicing leadership in their current role, drawing on industry experience or speaking with professionals, leveraging personal experiences and relationships, and learning from formal training. These sources manifested in three ways in the classroom: intentional leadership instruction, informal leadership modelling and encouraging, and not feeling prepared to teach leadership. The findings contribute to a conceptualisation of the experiences that inform educators’ understanding of leadership while pointing to the lack of formal training. Implications include considerations for faculty hiring and development, ways for faculty to draw on their experience, and suggestions for creating a culture supportive of leadership education.","Polmear, Madeline;Volpe, Elizabeth;Simmons, Denise R.;Clegorne, Nicholas;Weisenfeld, Danielle",Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2022-01-01,Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering;Kennesaw State University,curriculum ;  faculty development ;  Leadership ;  qualitative
Teaching Mode Based on Educational Big Data Mining and Digital Twins,"Data mining technology has gradually become an important data analysis and knowledge discovery technology widely used in many modern industries. Data mining is a technique to find its regularity from a large amount of data by analyzing each data. It mainly includes three steps: data preparation, regularity search, and regularity representation. Data preparation is to select the required data from relevant data sources and integrate them into a data set for data mining; regular search is to find out the regularity contained in the data set by a certain method; regular expression is to be as user-readable as possible. The way of understanding (such as visualization) will represent the found patterns. This research mainly discusses the improvement of teaching mode based on digital twin-based education big data mining. Through the research on the basic principles of data mining and digital twin technology, the student evaluation tool module based on digital twin and the relevant data analysis tool module of students based on digital twin education big data mining are developed. Data mining is carried out from the data of student performance, personal basic information, and evaluation information to find the correlation between various factors, find the hidden laws, and provide support for teaching decision-making. This paper also solves the problem of frequent communication with remote databases according to the characteristics of the database data required by students and improves the efficiency and scalability of education big data mining technology based on digital twins. The goal of the virtual interactive system of the digital twin-based CNC platform is to have both three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control functions based on a three-dimensional virtual CNC panel. This research integrates the three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control of the virtual interactive system, analyzes the system operation process, develops the system interface, and improves the system sub-functions; it builds an experimental environment, conducts example tests on various functions of the digital twin platform virtual interactive system, and performs virtual interactions system performance indicators are analyzed. 60% of students believe that their innovation ability has been improved after the implementation of the digital twin teaching model; 50% of students believe that their self-evaluation ability has been improved. Applying digital twin's educational big data mining to student information management, university teaching evaluation, student performance analysis, and examination system, it has played a very good guiding role in improving the level of school teaching management.","Zhou, Xueyun;Wu, Xinling",Journal,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2022-01-01,Guangzhou College of Technology and Business;Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University,

Unraveling the potential of non-conventional yeasts in biotechnology,"Cost-effective microbial conversion processes of renewable feedstock into biofuels and biochemicals are of utmost importance for the establishment of a robust bioeconomy. Conventional baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, widely employed in biotechnology for decades, lacks many of the desired traits for such bioprocesses like utilization of complex carbon sources or low tolerance towards challenging conditions. Many non-conventional yeasts (NCY) present these capabilities, and they are therefore forecasted to play key roles in future biotechnological production processes. For successful implementation of NCY in biotechnology, several challenges including generation of alternative carbon sources, development of tailored NCY and optimization of the fermentation conditions are crucial for maximizing bioproduct yields and titers. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that is facilitated through the 'YEAST4BIO' COST action. YEAST4BIO fosters integrative investigations aimed at filling knowledge gaps and excelling research and innovation, which can improve biotechnological conversion processes from renewable resources to mitigate climate change and boost transition towards a circular bioeconomy. In this perspective, the main challenges and research efforts within YEAST4BIO are discussed, highlighting the importance of collaboration and knowledge exchange for progression in this research field.","Geijer, C.;Ledesma-Amaro, R.;Tomas-Pejo, E.",Journal,FEMS Yeast Research,2022-01-01,Instituto IMDEA Energía;Imperial College London;Chalmers University of Technology,biochemicals ;  biofuels ;  lignocellulosic sugars ;  non-conventional yeasts ;  volatile fatty acids
Re-visiting sustainable development: sustainability and well-being from the perspectives of indigenous people in rural Ghana,"Although the Brundtland Commission’s definition of Sustainable Development (SD) is widely accepted and central to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it presents some limitations for application in the traditional African context. Drawing on a qualitative research design, this study interrogated indigenous knowledge systems of land governance among the Grune people in northern Ghana and the implications for SD. The emergent perspectives on land and land ownership are compelling and underpin the need for re-conceptualisation SD. To adapt SD to Grune worldview, it is imperative to redefine the frontiers of SD, by embracing a three-generational framework for addressing needs and achieving total wellbeing. In the context of decentralisation in Africa, an Endogenous Development (ED) approach to development planning is imperative for engineering social innovations and learnings that ensure socially and culturally acceptable development and the well-being of indigenous people and communities.","Derbile, Emmanuel Kanchebe;Atanga, Raymond Aitibasa;Abdulai, Ibrahim Abu",Journal,Local Environment,2022-01-01,Simon Diedong Dombo University of Business and Integrated Development Studies,Africa ;  development planning ;  endogenous development ;  indigenous knowledge systems ;  Sustainable development ;  well-being

Target Mining and Recognition of Product Form Innovation Design Based on Image Word Similarity Model,"Product Kansei image design is one of the research hotspot of product emotional design. Due to the subjectivity, low efficiency, and low level of intelligence in the existing product form innovation design methods in the mining of design goals. This study combines the semantic dictionary of Tongyici Cilin with Kansei engineering theory and uses clustering analysis algorithm, semantic difference method, and word similarity calculation method to realize product Kansei image design. Tongyici Cilin is a computable Chinese semantic dictionary. In this study, we innovatively introduced Tongyici Cilin into the image word similarity calculation in product image design. First, the product image design process based on Tongyici Cilin is proposed. Then, we establish a model of image word similarity calculation using the common distance, difference distance, common adjustment parameter, and differential adjustment parameter. By comparing with international standard data, it is confirmed that the image word similarity calculation model proposed in this article is effective and efficient. Using the sedan image design of middle-aged, middle-income men as an example, the sedan form style of each target image was successfully derived from the Internet-based questionnaire. Based on the case studies, we determined that it is effective to use the Tongyici Cilin semantic dictionary to determine the target image and improve the efficiency of product image design.","Zhang, Qinwei;Liu, Zhifeng;Zhang, Xinxin;Mu, Chunyang;Lv, Shuo",Journal,Advances in Mathematical Physics,2022-01-01,North Minzu University;Hebei University of Technology;Hefei University of Technology,
Developing a Methodology for Design of Patient-Specific Plate Type Implants and Defining the Relative Deformation of the Implant,"Nowadays, one of the common fields where Engineering collaborates with Medicine is the field of Implantology where the cooperation between engineers and surgeons results in creation of personalized implants. The aim of those innovations is to create a methodology from the beginning of the process, where the CT (computer tomography) scan data of the injured area is received to the end of the process where the implants are inserted. After the Virtual Prototyping the Physical prototyping could be accomplished with additive technology—the technology of 3D printing. In some clinical cases, the additive technology via 3D printing is very suitable for creating patient-specific implants, because of the variety of the materials. In the whole process are involved group of researchers including engineers and neurosurgeons. The research is based on introduced design process solution which consists of six steps and few proposed software. The research focuses on the design of a patient-specific implant and the ability to define in advance its relative deformations via FEA (Finite Element Analysis). It is important to note that after the production of the implant and before its insertion the implant should cover the Standard Test Methods for Spinal Implant Constructs in a Vertebrectomy Model.","Sofronov, Yavor;Dimova, Krasimira",Book Series,Mechanisms and Machine Science,2022-01-01,Technical University of Sofia,FEM analysis ;  Patient-specific implant ;  Spine

Applied Artificial Intelligence: Risk Mitigation Matters,"Digital technology is the main driver of the transformation process that is already on its way and expected to take up speed. Science and engineering are challenged to realize the significant innovation potential while keeping an eye on economic and societal sustainability. Research methodology in science as well as development practice in engineering provide well-established approaches to risk management and mitigation relating to this technological transformation. Artificial intelligence, though, brings in new features to address which this chapter shall help to deal with. As such we take into view machine learning, automated decision making and autonomous systems, and data utilization. We look upon characteristic risks within the application lifecycle, and on functional, societal, and cybersecurity risks. We derive suggestions for an approach to proactive risk management addressing the lifecycle of Artificial Intelligence applications. Along with a preparatory section on terminological clarification regarding artificial intelligence, data, and risk this paper is intended to build awareness of risk mitigation matters and set the scene for the development of accountable risk management approaches.","Jastroch, Norbert",Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2022-01-01,MET Communications,Artificial intelligence ;  Automated decision making ;  Autonomous systems ;  Data analytics ;  Machine learning ;  Risk management ;  Risk mitigation
Research on Children's Education App Network Transmission Based on 5G Mobile Computing Technology,"With the continuous improvement of China's scientific and technological level, the popularity of mobile network technology is becoming more and more widespread. Many big data technologies and wireless sensor technologies have brought new changes to people's lives. At present, the functions of communication technology and network transmission have moved from perfection to new innovation and development. 5G mobile network technology has played an important role in various fields. When China's economy and science and technology develop better and better, people pay more and more attention to children's education. The research on children's education has become a hot topic. From the above background, this paper studies the network transmission function and network transmission path of children's education app in 5G era mobile computing technology. First, starting from the development trend and main functions of 5G, this paper briefly describes the functional requirements of children's education app. The efficient data transmission in the 5G mobile wireless sensor network is applied to children's education app. Starting from the distance of network transmission nodes, the data transmission optimization algorithm is adopted, and the network transmission module is composed of the best transmission path of nodes. Combined with the energy-saving effect of mobile computing technology, the problem of excessive consumption of network transmission resources is optimized. Finally, the data transmission path is studied in the 5G mobile network. The results show that 5G mobile computing technology can optimize the network transmission performance, improve the operation efficiency of the server, and has a good effect in solving the problems of delay and low coverage.

Strategic value and choice on construction of large CMG industry in China,"China is very rich in coal measure gas (CMG) resources. Although the CMG industry has been developed for more than 30 years, the production from surface wells only accounts for 3.07% of the total national natural gas production in 2020, which scale is not satisfactory. To overcome the dilemma, the Chinese Academy of Engineering organized a strategic discussion on the effective CGM development for building a large industry. The authors in this paper look at a broader field, consider other types of natural gas in coal measures, demonstrate the strategic value and possibility of building a large CMG industry in China, deliberate the current difficulties and challenges, and put forward some suggestions on the choice of technical strategy and the improvement of guarantee conditions to overcome the dilemma. By analogy with the development process of coalbed methane (CBM) industry in the United States, it is considered that the formation of a large CMG industry is marked by two aspects, i.e., the annual production of more than 30 billion cubic meters and the contribution of more than 4.5% to the total annual production of natural gas in China. The development of a large CMG industry has three strategic values. Firstly, the large industry is one of the cornerstones of national natural gas security. Secondly, the effective CMG development will continue to help the healthy development of China's main energy industry. Thirdly, the large-scale development and utilization of CMG will help the favorable realization of the national ""double carbon"" goal. China has a feasible foundation for building a large CMG industry, including a strong national demand, a great potential in CMG resources, implemented solid industrial layout and broad scientific and technological basis. China still faces five difficulties and challenges in realizing an effective CMG development and then building a large industry, i.e., losing patience in the industry, the single well production that has still not been doubled overall, the insufficient attention to the utilization rate of proved CBM reserves, the insufficient efforts to explore new fields and new directions, and the separately set mining rights for different types of CMG. The analysis shows that the development of applicable technology is the only way to extract CMG resources under different geological conditions in China with high efficiency and low cost, and the mechanism innovation is the guarantee basis for the rapid development of the industry. It is suggested to continuously tackle key technologies in five aspects, including the low-cost and efficient gas extraction in underground coal mines, the reserves and production enhancement of CBM wells in old areas, the evaluation and development of high-quality deep CMG reservoirs, the exploration and orderly development of thin interbedded CMG resources, and the UCG (underground coal gasification)-CMG combined mining. It is considered that the key to the construction of guarantee conditions lies in two aspects:firstly, continuously implements the national major scientific and technological plan of CMG to promote the formation of the large industry as soon as possible; secondly, tries the integration of CMG mining rights to stimulate the maximum release of CMG resources potential. The relevant understandings and suggestions in this paper may provide reference for strategy formulation and scientific and technological research in the industry.","Qin, Yong;Shen, Jian;Shi, Ru",Journal,Meitan Xuebao/Journal of the China Coal Society,2022-01-01,China University of Mining and Technology,Challenge ;  Coal measure gas ;  Coalbed methane ;  Effective development ;  Industrial development ;  Strategic thinking
Leveraging App Technology to Measure the Impact of Transportation Disadvantage: The Development of MyAmble,"Widely used data-collection methods fail to fully capture the lived experiences and un-met travel demands of marginalized populations and those at disproportionate risk of experiencing transportation disadvantage (TD). This study describes an interdisciplinary collaboration between social work, civil ­engineering, and computer science on the development of a transportation data collection tool, MyAmble. The theoretical framework of social exclusion was used as part of the study design in order to better understand the process of marginalization as a result of inability to participate in wider society, in part through lack of transportation. Thus, MyAmble augments the best practices in transportation daily diary research using features designed to characterize and quantify latent travel demand among individuals experiencing TD, as well as the subjective impact of lack of transportation on quality of life and well-being. MyAmble includes several innovations–a daily digital trip planning that captures latent demand, a text-messaging based qualitative interview tool, a self-guided travel history survey, and a challenge logger. We describe the design process and implementation that occurred during a five-day pilot test and present a case study. Finally, findings from the case study suggest that MyAmble was able to successfully capture planned, unplanned, and unserved trips as well as the lived experiences of TD.","Fields, Noelle L.;Cronley, Courtney;Mattingly, Stephen P.;Miller, Vivian J.;Ramezanpour Nargesi, Saeed Reza;Bharmal, Ebrahim I.;Chace, Moriah",Journal,Journal of Technology in Human Services,2022-01-01,"University of Texas at Arlington College of Engineering;Bowling Green State University;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville;The University of Texas at Arlington;Thryve;Presidio",app-based travel diary ;  latent demand ;  social exclusion ;  Transportation ;  transportation disadvantage
Fit of Professional Setting and Regional Industrial Structure of Financial Colleges in the Greater Bay Area from Industry-Education Integration,"Promoting the initiative and subjectivity of the two main bodies of schools and enterprises, as well as fully exploiting their synergy in practice, is a necessary prerequisite for reflecting the benefits of school-enterprise integration, and without it, China's vocational education cannot improve the quality of professional and technical personnel training. Simultaneously, it allows for high-level economic and social development. This is also the focus and challenge of current vocational and technical education reform and innovation. We discovered that the integration of industry and education, as well as school-enterprise cooperation, has made significant progress in City C's higher vocational colleges through questionnaire surveys and on-site interviews: the cooperation mechanism has been steadily established and innovated, the talent joint training model is diverse; the level of cooperation between the two parties has been continuously improved; the benefits of enterprise cooperation are complementary, and s The current situation is ""schools are hot and enterprises are hot,""and both supply and demand are booming, contrary to the empirical view that the education industry integrates ""schools are hot and enterprises are cold.""The engineering talent training industry-education integration collaboration model is to establish and combine multiple case studies to illustrate its application scenarios, and then propose the characteristics of the collaboration model and the level analysis of the collaboration elements based on different systems, dynamics, and dynamic training models. This study collects data through questionnaire surveys and investigates the synergistic elements using the fs QCA empirical analysis method. These synergistic elements can help the integration project be more effective. Reproducible guidance is provided by various types of integration projects. Finally, in light of the current state of talent training in the integration of production and education, this research suggests three countermeasures: government optimization of top-level design, hierarchical implementation of the collaborative main model, and project implementation scope to coordinate school and enterprise path selection.","Liu, Shuyuan",Journal,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,2022-01-01,Guangdong University of Finance & Economics,

About a Process-Technology Fit for Process Improvements in an Ambidextrous Environment,"Since business process management (BPM) can become more disruptive due to new technologies, both explorative and exploitative BPM approaches are being combined to improve business processes. This combination of approaches refers to the notion of ambidexterity. The question, however, remains which emerging technology is appropriate for which type of process improvement. Therefore, this research is designed to translate the original task-technology fit (TTF) theory into a process-technology fit (PTF) theory by also acknowledging an ambidextrous BPM environment. We have derived an initial theoretical model from existing theories and frameworks. Afterwards, we have conducted an expert panel with a content analysis of 19 interviews. Our findings demonstrate ambidextrous BPM practices, and uncover what it means when processes fit or do not fit certain technologies. Novelty resides in translating TTF into PTF and BPM ambidexterity, and so contributing to BPM’s theoretical underpinnings. In addition, we provide more insight into related practical issues.","Ahmad, Tahir;Van Looy, Amy",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2022-01-01,Universiteit Gent,Ambidexterity ;  Digital innovation ;  Process improvement ;  Process innovation ;  Process-technology fit
Characteristics of Team Dynamics Influencing Success in Engineering Student Teams,"Introducing team projects into the engineering curriculum and teaching good teaming skills is one of the challenges for today’s engineering instructors. One of the challenging tasks is to form project team that can be successful. The question becomes: what information can be used to avoid bad teams. This article uses the experience of introducing real-world projects into the curriculum of the Department of Innovation in Chemical Technology of Kazan National Research Technological University to explore two key questions that might influence team success: 1) whether culture is a large factor in determining team success and 2) whether the diversity of styles of managing conflict influences success. In Kazan, there are two distinct cultures: Tatar which is predominantly Muslim and European Russian which is predominantly Orthodox. This situation offers an excellent opportunity to study these questions. Student teams were formed around projects according to their area of interest. During the project students were given three surveys from www.itpmetrics.com : on their personality and on their individual style of conflict management and a final survey on assessing the health and performance of the team. The approach in this article to analyze the results of these surveys to explore what factors had the most influence. All the students regardless of sex or culture showed a very high degree of integrative decision making. However, there are distinct differences in conflict management styles between the men and women of Tatar and Russian cultures. Having a high integrative style in the team leaders correlated to high team satisfaction. Surprisingly, the lack of contribution equity or the presence of personal conflict in the team had no to minimal influence on success.","Maliashova, Anna;Sultanova, Dilbar;Sanger, Phillip A.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2022-01-01,Kazan National Research Technological University;Purdue Polytechnic Institute,Competency building ;  Conflict management ;  Cultural diversity ;  Project team dynamics

Recent Progress of Biomimetic Dry/Wet Friction Adhesion Devices,"In nature, organisms have evolved many unique dry/wet friction and adhesion organs to adapt to their living environment. Based on the deep study, understanding and summary of these natural friction/adhesion phenomena, researchers have put forward corresponding bionic surface and interface friction/adhesion mechanisms, theories and models to guide the synthesis of artificial intelligent friction/adhesion materials and smart application devices. At present, the design strategies of biomimetic friction/adhesion material systems and devices are mainly based on surface microstructure, surface/interface physical and chemical interactions, and mechanical deformation. However, with a deeper understanding of biological friction/adhesion mechanism, the design concept of coupling multi-strategies has gradually become the main research direction. In this design concept background, this paper reviews the latest research progress of biomimetic friction/adhesion devices from four parts: Single strategy such as surface microstructure design, interface chemical modification, mechanical deformation control, and multiple coupling strategies. This paper also analyzes these design concepts of single and multi-strategies respectively, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of these design strategies. The innovation of different design principles, surface and interface friction/adhesion properties of these devices and their potential applications, and existing problems of them are also described. Finally, this review prospects the future development direction of biomimetic friction/adhesion materials and devices, and this review is of guiding significance to the research of surface engineering, biomedicine and microelectronics.","Yun-Lei, Zhang;Wei-Yi, Zhao;Shuan-Hong, Ma;Feng, Zhou",Journal,Chinese Journal of Applied Chemistry,2022-01-01,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences,Bionic friction and adhesion ;  Mechanical deformation ;  Surface chemistry ;  Surface microstructure

System of systems lessons to be learned in the development of air power for the future – a small state’s perspective,"Sweden, as a small alliance free state with powerful neighbors, has a military history of what we nowadays call systems of systems thinking. Since the beginning of the Cold War this has been expressed in an air force on the forefront of exploiting military innovations, not least with regard to sensor networks, datalinks, information sharing and distributed decision making. How can this history and the lessons learned come to use when future systems and technologies are to be developed to meet the uncertain future and changing threats? How does this fit with current trends such as capability-based approach and system of systems engineering methodology? What could this mean for the development of the next generation fighter aircraft-after the Gripen E and contemporary aircraft? These questions have been studied from both a government and industry perspective, following the trend in the defense sector of a more intertwined relationship between the two, necessitated by adopting a capability view on aircraft development. This paper presents preliminary lessons identified from a case study on the project Flygvapnet 2000 (FV2000), which preceded the Net Centric Warfare era at the turn of the millennium. The analysis was based on characteristics of best practice systems of systems engineering derived from a review of literature presenting the methodology theory on capability-based approaches for analyzing, acquiring, developing, and managing military capabilities. The findings from this project will contribute to the development of systems of systems engineering methods and will spur proposals for future research.","Andersson, Karl Kindström;Andersson, Kent;Jouannet, Christopher;Amadori, Kristian;Krus, Petter",Conference Proceeding,"AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition, AIAA SciTech Forum 2022",2022-01-01,Försvarshögskolan;Saab AB;Linköpings Universitet,
The Use of Augmented Reality in Latin-American Engineering Education: A Scoping Review,"As part of a recent change, Augmented Reality (AR) has filled engineering classrooms, being employed for various pedagogical purposes around the world. However, little is known about the different features and uses of this technology in Latin America. This Scoping Review asks how are educational AR systems designed, used and evaluated in the region, comparing this to the international literature. To address this question, we charted 36 conference papers and scientific articles, taking care of the quality gaps and methodological diversity within our sample. Our results show that, even though most converge on conventional research, design and pedagogical practices, engineering educators working at institutes are taking the lead of design, pedagogical and research innovation. Furthermore, we show that Latin-American literature distinctively reveals how teachers adapt to the particular contexts of teaching, and the special importance of the usually overlooked conference papers literature.","García, Roberto Santiago Bellido;Borjas, Luis Gerardo Rejas;Cruzata-Martínez, Alejandro;Mancisidor, Merce Concepción Sotomayor",Journal,"Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",2022-01-01,Universidad César Vallejo;Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola;Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos,augmented reality ;  engineering education ;  Latin America ;  post-secondary education ;  PRISMA-ScR
Ensuring the High Performance of Design and Engineering Firms in Mexico's Aerospace Industry: A Qualitative Comparative Analysis,"The aerospace industry is considered strategic for economic and national security reasons because it generates short- and long-term benefits for countries, such as new investments, technology transfers, and spillover. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the high performance of design and engineering firms (DEFs) in Mexico's aerospace industry. Taking a resource-based perspective enhanced by absorptive capacity and entrepreneurship approaches, this study contributes to understanding the causal ambiguity and social complexity characterizing the relationship between firms' performance and resource allocation.

"Future Cities as a system of systems: Its concept, mechanism and creation","As information technology advances rapidly, cities have become more complex and irreducible. In the Anthropocene, the process of planetary urbanization continues to affect the health of the natural and social environment, and the future of cities has a profound impact on the future of mankind. The concept of Future Cities is based on the scrutiny of the urban evolution process in human history. Future Cities are different from agricultural cities as the containers of human settlement and industrial cities as the center of production. Based on interdisciplinary and rational thinking, research on Future Cities aims to establish a way toward humanity's well-being and sustainable development. From the perspective of a system of systems, Future Cities cannot be regarded as a single system as is usual. They are a much more complex system involving many systems, and this concept needs to be understood and interpreted through systems thinking. The driving force for the change is the information revolution, which has changed the carrier of information from entity to data. Thus, information as a medium has improved its operational efficiency and strengthened the interaction and interoperation between the systems in Future Cities, which emphasizes ""systemhood"" than ""thinghood"", and triggers the formation of a system of systems. When data-based information penetrates the urban space, the ""information space"" emerges, and Future Cities become a combination of physical-information-social space. The ""information space"" also opens a new dimension for systems and people in Future Cities. As for systems, technological inventions take place in the process of digitization and informatization, including human settlement systems, energy systems, traffic systems, health systems, and environmental systems. With regard to individuals, a human being becomes ""human being + information terminals"", which in turn gives birth to new lifestyles and brings social innovation. Furthermore, because of the flow of information, the boundaries of different systems will blur and the gap between the systems and inhabitants will be bridged, and the well-being of humankind can be guaranteed through the precise matching of supply and demand. The creation of Future Cities requires not only bottom-up strength and self-organization but also top-down guidance and effective regulation. Urban problems need to be solved in stages from the aspects of technology invention and social innovation. When Future Cities revolve around the people themselves, people's creation of the city will return to normal life, enhancing the sense of happiness and belonging. How to stimulate the vitality of people's creativity, form a cooperative power distribution mechanism, and improve the city's ability to self-organize and operate will be important issues for future urban society. Future Cities research is a combination of theory and practice, which should adapt to the characteristics of a system of systems. Based on the practical experience of urban strategic planning and system engineering, the research can form an ""overall strategic group"" for the design of the system of systems, to make full use of multidisciplinary advantages and diversified perspectives. The integration of future urban research will be an iterative process of resolving conflicts; this integration requires a long-term cycle of four main steps, including reaching consensus on basic concepts, revealing the formation mechanism, refining the characteristics of different systems, and integrating the system of systems. In conclusion, the concept of Future Cities explores how the city meets people's needs for a better life. Against the backdrop of the information revolution, it is urgent to discard reductionist thinking, use systems thinking to understand the future city instead, plan and build Future Cities through continuous iterative practice, and realize the sustainable development of mankind.","Wu, Tinghai;Gong, Peng;Li, Yan",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2022-01-01,Tsinghua University;The University of Hong Kong,Future Cities ;  System of systems ;  Systems thinking ;  Urban planning
Seismic Design of Bolted Connections in Steel Structures—A Critical Assessment of Practice and Research,"The importance of connections in steel structures is paramount, not only because it greatly influences the cost of construction and provides room for innovations, but also due to the connections’ impact on global structural behaviour. Therefore, research into innovative connections for seismic applications and related design criteria has significantly grown in recent years. However, it has been pursued mostly on local—connection or frame—levels, leaving the system analysis and code compliance levels with a meagre investigation. Moreover, less than 1% of published papers concerning steel connections and earthquake engineering are review articles. To overcome this gap, this systematic review of more than 240 references, including scientific contributions and design codes in the field aimed to cover both recent research and current shortcomings in practice and regulations. It has been found that European design rules updated to a fully performance-based design philosophy is imminent and is deemed to bring pre-qualified joints and increased complexity. Design rules have been systematized, and current hindrances have been highlighted. A deeper look into research needs and trends showed that investigations in connections for concentrically X braced frames are still a necessity, while developments in self-centring and replaceable connections as well as in simple solutions for increasing damping are expected to modify how joints are designed, as soon as semi-rigid and partial strength connections are more easily allowed by design codes.","Ribeiro, Tiago;Bernardo, Luís;Carrazedo, Ricardo;De Domenico, Dario",Journal,Buildings,2022-01-01,Università degli Studi di Messina;Universidade de São Paulo;Universidade da Beira Interior;Tal Projecto Lda,Bolted connections ;  Cover-plate ;  Earthquake engineering ;  Eurocode 8 ;  Joints ;  Review ;  Seismic design ;  Steel design ;  Structural design ;  Structural engineering

The Patent Eligibility of 3D Bioprinting: Towards a New Version of Living Inventions’ Patentability,"A combination of 3D printing techniques and synthetic biology, 3D bioprinting is a promis-ing field. It is expected that 3D bioprinting technologies will have applications across an array of fields, spanning biotechnology, medical surgery and the pharmaceutical industry. Nonetheless, the progress of these technologies could be hindered, unless there is adequate and effective protection for related applications. In this article, the authors examine the patent eligibility of 3D bioprinting technologies. This issue raises concern given that existing patent systems are generally averse to nature-derived inventions and many of them exclude products of nature or discoveries from patentability. This qualitative study analyses the current patent systems in key jurisdictions, particularly, the U.S. and the EU, and their applicability, as well as effectiveness, in the context of 3D bioprinting. The study argues that the main reason for the apathy of existing patent systems towards bio-inventions is that they were designed to deal with mechanical inventions. It suggests an innovation framework that encompasses both mechanical and biological inventions to cater adequately to emerging technologies.","Althabhawi, Nabeel M.;Zainol, Zinatul Ashiqin",Journal,Biomolecules,2022-01-01,Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,3D bioprinting ;  Discovery ;  Patentable subject matters ;  Products of nature
"Narrowband organic photodetectors-towards miniaturized, spectroscopic sensing","Omnipresent quality monitoring in food products, blood-oxygen measurement in lightweight conformal wrist bands, or data-driven automated industrial production: Innovation in many fields is being empowered by sensor technology. Specifically, organic photodetectors (OPDs) promise great advances due to their beneficial properties and low-cost production. Recent research has led to rapid improvement in all performance parameters of OPDs, which are now on-par or better than their inorganic counterparts, such as silicon or indium gallium arsenide photodetectors, in several aspects. In particular, it is possible to directly design OPDs for specific wavelengths. This makes expensive and bulky optical filters obsolete and allows for miniature detector devices. In this review, recent progress of such narrowband OPDs is systematically summarized covering all aspects from narrow-photo-absorbing materials to device architecture engineering. The recent challenges for narrowband OPDs, like achieving high responsivity, low dark current, high response speed, and good dynamic range are carefully addressed. Finally, application demonstrations covering broadband and narrowband OPDs are discussed. Importantly, several exciting research perspectives, which will stimulate further research on organic-semiconductor-based photodetectors, are pointed out at the very end of this review.","Wang, Yazhong;Kublitski, Jonas;Xing, Shen;Dollinger, Felix;Spoltore, Donato;Benduhn, Johannes;Leo, Karl",Journal,Materials Horizons,2022-01-01,Technische Universität Dresden,

How R&D subsidies alter firm activities and behaviour,"Public research and development (R&D) subsidies are often used to increase firms’ R&D investments and innovation efforts and to spur firm-level additionalities, such as increased R&D inputs and innovation outcomes. However, relatively little is known about how such firm-level additionalities develop and interrelate over time. This study examines 15 cases of successful R&D projects to explore how additionalities from public subsidies are developed over time. We develop a process model outlining how different types of additionalities from public R&D subsidies develop and interrelate at the beginning of, during and after a project for science- and engineering-based firms. For science-based firms, public R&D subsidies appear to strengthen innovation and knowledge development after projects are completed and to increase firms’ strategic R&D orientation. For engineering-based firms, subsidies leverage internal credibility and collaboration, which leads to increased R&D activities, mainly during projects. Given these results, we provide guidance for policy and practice regarding how different types of firms benefit from subsidised R&D projects both during and after the project period.","Steinmo, Marianne;Lauvås, Thomas;Rasmussen, Einar",Journal,Innovation: Organization and Management,2022-01-01,Nord Universitet,Additionality ;  firm behaviour ;  innovation ;  public R&D subsidies ;  R&D collaboration ;  R&D projects

Micro-arterial Flow Simulation for Fluid Dynamics: A Review,"The planet is evolving technologically in all respects, but mortality due to various diseases continues to be a concern. In particular, the cardiovascular disease mortality rate is high and affects people of all ages. Innovation and technology are the only resources that exponentially and quickly progress in every industry. The use of technology in the medical field is currently limited. Many developments are being made in this area so that the treatment can be done easily and efficiently. One such cost-effective technology that maximizes the efficiency of performance is computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is a mechanical engineering approach that uses simulation to analyze fluid flow, heat transfer, and some other phenomena. CFD is increasingly being utilized in biomedical research of coronary artery disease due to its high performance in hardware and software.

Technopreneurial intentions: The effect of innate innovativeness and academic self-efficacy,"Several factors can affect students’ intention to start a new technology-based venture (technopreneurial intentions). Understanding these factors is important when developing technical educational programs. This study investigates the effect of innate innovativeness and academic self-efficacy on technopreneurial self-efficacy and the forming of technopreneurial intentions. It does this by developing a conceptual model that relates technopreneurial intentions, technopreneurial self-efficacy, academic self-efficacy, and innate innovativeness. The data was collected from 378 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a Jordanian university with a self-administered questionnaire survey. The results of the structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS showed that technopreneurial self-efficacy had a positive and significant impact on technopreneurial intentions. Academic self-efficacy had both a direct and indirect positive effect on technopreneurial intention. The indirect effect occurred through increased technopreneurial self-efficacy. Innate innovativeness had a direct effect on technopreneurial intentions, but it did not have a significant indirect effect through technopreneurship self-efficacy as was initially hypothesized. The findings suggest that those who show interest in starting a new technology-based venture have a strong belief in their abilities to perform the technological and entrepreneurial tasks needed, are confident about their ability to acquire the academic technical skills required, and have the inner motivation to seek what is technologically new and different.","Salhieh, Sa’Ed M.;Al-Abdallat, Yousef",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-01-01,British University in Dubai;The University of Jordan,Academic self-efficacy ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innate innovativeness ;  Technopreneurial intentions ;  Technopreneurial self-efficacy

Using research and development indicators to shape innovation in Mauritius,"Research and Development (R&D) measurements are widely used in the formulation of evidence-based policies to boost a country’s innovation performance. This paper showcases how traditional (Expenditure and Number of Researchers) and country specific R&D data were used for the first time in Mauritius to formulate informed policy measures. A national survey covering the financial year 2019/2020 was conducted. Five hundred and fifty-three Researchers (Full Time Equivalence) per million of inhabitants were recorded. Gross Expenditure and Business R&D Expenditures as a percentage of GDP were 0.37% and 0.07% respectively. Highest expenditures for Business, Government and Higher Education sectors were in Engineering & Technology, Agricultural and Natural Sciences respectively, hence demonstrating a lack of synergy between the three sectors. Bibliometric analysis was conducted to evaluate the trend in publication output over the last five years. 6.2% of Mauritian publications were in Ocean Sciences and 21% of international publications were co-authored with a partner from Africa. These call for a realignment of R&D strategies for Mauritius to attain its goals to become a Blue Economy and a regional knowledge hub. Potential policy recommendations include mechanisms to be put in place for enhanced- public/private sector dialogue and targeted Research Funding schemes in relation to country goals.","Madhou, M.;Moosun, S.

Molecular Engineering of 2D Nanomaterial Field-Effect Transistor Sensors: Fundamentals and Translation across the Innovation Spectrum,"Over the last decade, 2D layered nanomaterials have attracted significant attention across the scientific community due to their rich and exotic properties. Various nanoelectronic devices based on these 2D nanomaterials have been explored and demonstrated, including those for environmental applications. Here, the fundamental attributes of 2D layered nanomaterials for field-effect transistor (FET) sensors and tunneling FET (TFET) sensors, which provide versatile detection of water contaminants such as heavy-metal ions, bacteria, nutrients, and organic pollutants, are discussed. The major challenges and opportunities are also outlined for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance. Translation of these FET/TFET sensors from fundamental research to applied technology is illustrated through a case study on graphene-based real-time FET water sensors. A second case study centers on large-scale sensor networks for water-quality monitoring to enable intelligent drinking water and river-water systems. Overall, 2D nanomaterial FET sensors have significant potential for enabling a human-centered intelligent water system that can likely be applied to other precarious water supplies around the globe.","Chen, Junhong;Pu, Haihui;Hersam, Mark C.;Westerhoff, Paul",Journal,Advanced Materials,2022-01-01,Robert R.

"Risk factors and disease profile of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app: a prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study","Background: COVID-19 vaccines show excellent efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in real-world data, but some people still become infected with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. This study aimed to identify risk factors for post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the characteristics of post-vaccination illness. Methods: This prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study used self-reported data (eg, on demographics, geographical location, health risk factors, and COVID-19 test results, symptoms, and vaccinations) from UK-based, adult (≥18 years) users of the COVID Symptom Study mobile phone app. For the risk factor analysis, cases had received a first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021; had either a positive COVID-19 test at least 14 days after their first vaccination (but before their second; cases 1) or a positive test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (cases 2); and had no positive test before vaccination. Two control groups were selected (who also had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination): users reporting a negative test at least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (controls 1) and users reporting a negative test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (controls 2). Controls 1 and controls 2 were matched (1:1) with cases 1 and cases 2, respectively, by the date of the post-vaccination test, health-care worker status, and sex. In the disease profile analysis, we sub-selected participants from cases 1 and cases 2 who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3 and cases 4, respectively). Controls 3 and controls 4 were unvaccinated participants reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 test who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after the test, and were matched (1:1) with cases 3 and 4, respectively, by the date of the positive test, health-care worker status, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and age. We used univariate logistic regression models (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) to analyse the associations between risk factors and post-vaccination infection, and the associations of individual symptoms, overall disease duration, and disease severity with vaccination status. Findings: Between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021, 1 240 009 COVID Symptom Study app users reported a first vaccine dose, of whom 6030 (0·5%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 1), and 971 504 reported a second dose, of whom 2370 (0·2%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 2). In the risk factor analysis, frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults (≥60 years) after their first vaccine dose (odds ratio [OR] 1·93, 95% CI 1·50–2·48; p<0·0001), and individuals living in highly deprived areas had increased odds of post-vaccination infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 1·11, 95% CI 1·01–1·23; p=0·039). Individuals without obesity (BMI <30 kg/m2) had lower odds of infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 0·84, 95% CI 0·75–0·94; p=0·0030). For the disease profile analysis, 3825 users from cases 1 were included in cases 3 and 906 users from cases 2 were included in cases 4. Vaccination (compared with no vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more than five symptoms in the first week of illness following the first or second dose, and long-duration (≥28 days) symptoms following the second dose. Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older. Interpretation: To minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection, at-risk populations must be targeted in efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness and infection control measures. Our findings might support caution around relaxing physical distancing and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if these individuals are vaccinated, and might have implications for strategies such as booster vaccinations.

Nuclear energy: A pathway towards mitigation of global warming,"Global warming is the ongoing rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system. Over the past 50 years, the average temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history due to uncontrolled generation of greenhouse gases. Nuclear power is low carbon energy, and it is contributing on a large scale to a low carbon economy and a green energy grid. 442 nuclear power reactors are operating worldwide generating 393 GWe of electricity providing continuous and reliable low carbon power. Nuclear electricity accounts for 11% of total global electricity generation, and this amounts to a third of the low-carbon electricity produced in the world. New innovations are taking place which make nuclear power a more affordable and attractive energy option. These include advances in large reactors, emerging technologies such as advanced fuel and small modular reactors, engineering breakthroughs extending the operational lifetime of existing reactors, and new developments in materials and better waste management. Fast breeder reactor technology has become a commercial reality and it helps not only in generating electricity, but also in producing more fuel than it consumes, besides burning nuclear waste more efficiently compared to any of the existing commercial reactor technologies. The Sun's energy is generated by nuclear fusion. Mastering nuclear fusion technology can guarantee energy security in terms of clean, safe and affordable energy. Nuclear fusion, and plasma physics research of very complex nature are being carried out in many countries. Fusion reactions have been successfully demonstrated although for a fraction of a second and without demonstrating a net gain of electric power. The world's largest international fusion reactor facility called ITER is in an advanced stage of construction with the aim of demonstrating the scientific and technological success of fusion energy research for commercial production. Fusion fuel is plentiful and easily accessible. It is expected that fusion energy is the pathway towards energy security for thousands of years. Nuclear fission and fusion reactors do not emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and play a major role in mitigating climate change.","Mathew, M.

Trending Technologies in Vertebrate Vocalisation Applications,"The technological developments have opened more multidisciplinary opportunities worldwide, especially in the medical and engineering fields. Apart from many other opportunities, audio signal processing takes a significant role because it can provide a broader range of applications with the integration of trending technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality and virtual reality (ARVR), cognitive computing, internet of things (IoT), intelligent apps (I-Apps) and robotic process automation (RPA). However, these technologies need to be applied in vertebrate vocalisation-based applications, including monitoring species biodiversity, conserving endangered species, tracking environmental pollution, precision livestock farming, frightening tools and biology-based studies. This chapter showcases some vertebrate vocalisation related applications that can be newly invented via trending technologies. In addition, this chapter provides some suggestions to improve a few existing vertebrate vocalisation related applications. Thus, these applications may cooperate to various fields of studies to get extreme benefits, especially in medical, industrial, agricultural, scientific research works and many more to improve their findings and innovations.","Murugaiya, Ramashini;Mahagammulle Gamage, Manisha Milani;Murugiah, Krishani;Perumal, Madhumathy",Book Series,SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology,2022-01-01,RV Institute of Technology and Management;Uva Wellassa University;Universiti Brunei Darussalam;Pavendar Bharathidasan College of Engineering,Artificial intelligence (AI) ;  Augmented reality (AR) ;  Citizen science projects ;  Cognitive technologies ;  Internet of things (IoT) ;  Robotic process automation (RPA) ;  Trending technologies ;  Vertebrate vocalisation ;  Virtual reality (VR)
Medicine Based Engineering and Informatics to Foster Patient Physician Relationship,"Biomedical Engineering and Medical Informatics can improve patient physician relationship by means of new instruments and software applications designed by interdisciplinary teams. Already in the 1980s with the Perinatal Information System, SIP, and now with the Personalized Perinatal Follow-up System, SEPEPE, the first prescription App, biomedical engineering works towards good quality medicine. SIMIC, another personalized prescription App for cardiac failure patients and DINABANG, a torque/velocity measurement device for the sports field are further examples. Synergy with medicine is not found, on the contrary, in clinical records systems based on a naive translation of industrial information systems with no interdisciplinary design. A disruptive innovation, PRAXIS, captures a physician’s case mix to assist solve his or her future cases based on medical reasoning sequences. Further examples of technology developed from clinical perspectives are ABDOPRE, a servo controlled vacuum bell to treat intra-abdominal hypertension and NEFROVOL a non invasive measure of polycystic kidney volume. Technology transfer is the desired epilogue of research with examples described here: the pulmonary mechanics instrument MECVENT, the hyperbilirrubinaemia reduction lamp BiliLED and the portable lower limb kinetics metre DINABANG.

"The impact of China's R&D subsidies on R&D investment, technological upgrading and economic growth","This paper investigates the impact of research and development (R&D) subsidies on R&D inputs and their wider economic effects. The empirical analysis employs a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model using a panel of Chinese provinces during the 2000–2010 time period. In support of a partial crowding-out view, public R&D subsidies allocated to large and medium-sized enterprises (LMEs) are found to increase total R&D inputs proxied by total R&D personnel, despite reducing privately-financed R&D inputs. Specifically, we find that an increase of R&D subsidies by one standard deviation decreases private R&D expenditures in LMEs by 6.5%, but increases total R&D personnel in LMEs by 2.6%. We also find evidence that the effects of R&D subsidies extend beyond their main effect on corporate R&D, promoting technological upgrading, capital deepening, and economic growth. We further find evidence suggesting some misallocation of research-oriented public funds. The findings help shed important insights into the ongoing debate regarding the role of the state in promoting innovation in a transitioning economy context.","Boeing, Philipp;Eberle, Jonathan;Howell, Anthony",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-01-01,Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung GmbH;Peking University;Philipps-Universität Marburg;Arizona State University,China ;  Panel VAR ;  R&D inputs ;  R&D subsidies ;  Regional development

Scaffolding Biomaterials for 3D Cultivated Meat: Prospects and Challenges,"Cultivating meat from stem cells rather than by raising animals is a promising solution to concerns about the negative externalities of meat production. For cultivated meat to fully mimic conventional meat's organoleptic and nutritional properties, innovations in scaffolding technology are required. Many scaffolding technologies are already developed for use in biomedical tissue engineering. However, cultivated meat production comes with a unique set of constraints related to the scale and cost of production as well as the necessary attributes of the final product, such as texture and food safety. This review discusses the properties of vertebrate skeletal muscle that will need to be replicated in a successful product and the current state of scaffolding innovation within the cultivated meat industry, highlighting promising scaffold materials and techniques that can be applied to cultivated meat development. Recommendations are provided for future research into scaffolds capable of supporting the growth of high-quality meat while minimizing production costs. Although the development of appropriate scaffolds for cultivated meat is challenging, it is also tractable and provides novel opportunities to customize meat properties.","Bomkamp, Claire;Skaalure, Stacey C.;Fernando, Gonçalo F.;Ben-Arye, Tom;Swartz, Elliot W.;Specht, Elizabeth A.",Journal,Advanced Science,2022-01-01,The Good Food Institute,

Application of Computer Multimedia Technology in the Design of English Education Curriculum,"With the vigorous development of CMT (computer multimedia technology), it is widely used in teaching. At present, mankind is entering a new period of technological development. The emergence of CMT provides a new material foundation for the reform of English teaching methods and teaching models. The wide application of MT (multimedia technology) in teaching provides students with a brand-new learning form and promotes the innovation of traditional teachin. Many years of teaching method reforms have consumed a lot of financial and manpower, but the students’ English proficiency has not been significantly improved. How to organically combine CM technology with traditional teaching methods to form teaching advantages is particularly important. The application of CM technology in the design of EE (English education) curriculum is the focus of this article. First, analyze the results of the two classes. The results show that the multimedia teaching mode can improve students’ listening, reading, vocabulary, writing, and students’ comprehensive English scores. The average score of the control group is 83.3. 12.4 points higher than the control group. Secondly, analyze the effect of CM technology on English courses. 41% of students believe that MT teaching can stimulate students’ interest in learning English. 22 and 19 people respectively think that MT can strengthen the communication between teachers and students and enrich the teaching content. The remaining 18 people pointed out that this teaching model is conducive to cultivating teachers’ quality, improving teaching structure and efficiency.","Du, Jingjing",Book Series,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2022-01-01,Shaanxi University of Science and Technology,Applied research ;  English education ;  English performance ;  Multimedia technology
Innovative Design of Immersion Teaching Aids for Children’s Art Based on Augmented Reality Technology,"With the continuous development of science and technology, augmented reality (AR) technology is emerging. It is a multi-disciplinary interdisciplinary research field, involving many fields of development research. It also has development and application in children’s teaching. At present, more and more attention has been paid to children’s education. Parents attach importance to children’s physical and mental education and cultivate their artistic accomplishment. Traditional children’s teaching products mainly use the operator or parents, and children are in the position of passive learning and acceptance. Children’s teaching products based on AR technology use realistic three-dimensional models to interact with children, so that children can immerse themselves in happy learning. Through intelligent devices, children can immerse themselves in visual, auditory, tactile and other senses, realize interactive teaching. This paper mainly studies the innovative design of immersion teaching aids for children’s art based on AR technology. This paper expounds the advantages of children’s art teaching aids (CATA) based on AR technology, expounds the design principles of CATA based on AR technology, and still chooses children’s reading books, AR children’s picture books, cognitive cards and game teaching aids for innovation in the form of CATA design innovation. In this paper, through the collection of children’s sensitivity to the color design of teaching aids, we also conducted a questionnaire survey to understand the importance of teaching aids to children’s art education in the hearts of parents. The results show that 51.02% of parents think art teaching aids are important to children, 20.19% think art teaching aids are not very important to children, and 28.79% think art teaching aids are not important to children.","Sun, Yu",Book Series,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2022-01-01,Changchun Normal University,Augmented reality technology ;  Children’s art ;  Immersion teaching ;  Teaching aids
Social innovation: Integrating product and user innovation,"The paper introduces a conceptual approach explaining how end users, user communities and /or for-profit firms provide benefits to society through new product or service development. We show that innovation may occur in different economic environments including non-market ones as well as that social innovation will not occur on its own in a purely producer for-profit environment. To explain such cases, we suggest integrating product and user innovation paradigms into the Producer-User Social Innovation (PUSI) Model that demonstrates how infrastructure and enabling technology is provided either by producer or user to introduce new market product or service. To provide face validity and illustrate the versatility of the proposed approach we consider five very different cases. These illustrative examples allowed to provide evidence that user-driven innovation is socially oriented in its nature as it implicitly addresses community or societal needs. In addition to providing insights into the nature of social innovation, the model can be utilized to help understand why social innovation may fail and how to increase the likelihood of success by engaging with appropriate for-profit producers, communities, and users. Implications to policy and practice are provided, including the opportunity for government to encourage social innovation directly and indirectly.","Fursov, Konstantin;Linton, Jonathan",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-01-01,HSE University;The University of Sheffield;Polytechnic Museum,Do-it-yourself ;  Enabling technology ;  Innovation policy ;  Product innovation ;  Social innovation ;  User innovation
Development of Teaching Mode of Digital Electronic Technology Based on Virtual Simulation,"With the rapid development of electronic technology, and society’s requirements for talent training continue to increase. At present, the traditional teaching mode and teaching methods of the school have been difficult to meet the needs of teaching. At the same time, computer technology and software development technology are changing with each passing day, and the use of microcomputers is becoming wider and wider. Therefore, it is imperative to study how to apply VS technology to the teaching of electronic technology courses and use advanced teaching methods to change the past teaching mode. It is imperative to reform the school’s teaching mode. As a local applied undergraduate college, a college in this city has a place to serve. It is based on a local, applied, open, and international orientation. At the same time, it has formulated a solid foundation, strong application, ethics, innovation, and high-quality the training specifications are in line with the new engineering talent training concept. “Digital electronic technology” is the core basic course of electronic information engineering. It is the basis for the subsequent courses of “Single-chip Microcomputer Principles and Interface Technology”, “DSP and Sensor Principles” and so on. The traditional digital electronic technology teaching model has the disadvantages of fixed knowledge, aging teaching content, single teaching method and high experimental teaching cost. The traditional teaching mode of digital electronics technology has the disadvantages of fixed knowledge, aging teaching content, single teaching method and high cost of experimental teaching, which cannot meet the specific practical teaching requirements of the new engineering construction in China in the new era, to adapt to the changes in the current industrial development and to meet the needs of the future industrial development. Based on this, in order to respond to the teaching background of “new engineering”, this paper designs and develops a new teaching model of digital electronic technology based on Virtual Simulation (VS). Research shows, in innovative teaching practices, students in the experimental classes will be able to fully understand and master the basic theory, basic methods and basic skills of knowledge, students’ practical skills will be greatly enhanced, as well as their language skills. In addition, most students will be able to fully apply their knowledge and expertise in digital electronics in their first year of study.","Xiong, Yongyong",Book Series,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2022-01-01,Nanchang University,Digital electronics ;  Electronic technology ;  Teaching mode ;  Virtual simulation
Industry Commons: an ecosystem approach to horizontal enablers for sustainable cross-domain industrial innovation (a positioning paper),"This paper introduces the background, concept and definition of the Industry Commons. It initiates a discussion on the positioning of the Industry Commons Ecosystem (ICE) with respect to current research directions in advanced manufacturing and production systems that shape advances in engineering and technology, novel business models and innovation breakthroughs. The potential value of data sharing across industrial domains is estimated at over $100 billion, particularly in view of optimising manufacturing processes. Data sharing across domains however faces a series of well-documented challenges associated with the lack of semantic interoperability and related standards, management of trust and sustainability. Solving bottlenecks in data sharing requires a systemic approach to data management, which can account for all aspects of data use, levels of application, attribution and dynamic exchanges. In this paper we propose a high-level ecosystem approach that integrates societal values with digital affordances of industry’s cognitive-assisted processes, remote interfacing, hybrid applications and large-scale value networks. Early development of an Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES) is presented as the key enabling framework for Industry Commons interoperability and a series of enabling frameworks form the basis of future research directions in Trusted Data Sharing and Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management for greater sustainability.

Social barriers to open (water) data,"Although the proliferation of open water data platforms and initiatives in recent years is a laudable phenomenon, there is little empirical evidence indicating whether and to what extent these efforts are generating anticipated benefits of improved transparency, citizen participation, innovation, and water resource decision making. Relatedly, water resource researchers have devoted little attention to identifying and accounting for barriers that may be limiting open water data efforts from realizing their potential. The premise of this overview is that (a) open water data efforts could be improved with a better understanding of the non-technical challenges and that (b) water researchers interested in open water data would benefit from delving into the emerging body of research in public policy, information science, and other disciplines on open data barriers more broadly. However, the research on open data barriers has neglected water sustainability issues. In light of this asymmetry, the aim of this overview is to foster interdisciplinary engagement on this topic by introducing the water resource community to this literature via a discussion of key social barriers to open data. Additionally, I hope to motivate water resource researchers to develop a two-way interdisciplinary engagement by making original research contributions to this larger literature.

"The Smart City, Smart Contract, Smart Health Care, Internet of Things (IoT), Opportunities, and Challenges","The smart city idea is discussed in the literature in multitude of ways. Researcher Komninos specifies the smart cities and surrounding larger regions as environments with a high potential for learning and innovation, utilizing the ingenuity of population and societies with digital infrastructures to function in the physical, uniform, and numerical spaces of cities. The smart city model is defined in the literature in numerous types of ways. As cities develop and expand their services, governance and management are becoming more and more complex. Consequently, cities must adapt to address the economic, social, engineering, and environmental challenges of these transformations. Cities must become smart to face the challenges properly and increase livability and quality of life. This secondary research utilizes detailed literature review of multifaceted sources of information, such as peer-reviewed and quality academic journal articles from renowned databases. With the introduction of blockchain, numerous fields like banking, finance, health care, and supply chain shall experience positive effects. The sustainability of the smart cities can be further enhanced and ensured with the application of the blockchain technology. One important area in which the blockchain represents the important future is real estate and smart cities. Real estate has been going through global transformation. The challenges surfacing in record keeping in scenarios where the same household and/or property is put up for sale to several parties by the means of fraudulently forging the documents or records.

The role of technology innovation and renewable energy in reducing environmental degradation in Malaysia: A step towards sustainable environment,"The current industrial era has turned into a rapidly evolved world that relies abundantly on technological advancements and robotics intelligence. However, the trends of global economic appraisals showed that the process of advancement is mostly accompanied by environmental degradation. Therefore, this research studies the connection of renewable energy and technological innovations in affecting ecological footprint and carbon dioxide emission in Malaysia. In doing so, the study employs the bootstrapped autoregressive distributed lag (BARDL) model for scrutinizing the connection between environmental degradation proxies. The findings disclose that the consumption of renewable energy helps to reduce the level of environmental degradation. In addition, technology innovation also helps to reduce both carbon emission and ecological footprint. Moreover, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is also validated for the country by showing the inverted U-shape link of economic growth with the both environmental degradation proxies. These findings give a benchmark for the policymakers to encourage local and foreign investors to invest more in renewable energy production and technology innovation in Malaysian economy whereas the results demand policy implication in the form of increased emphasis on the utilization of green energy via renewables especially in domestic businesses.","Suki, Norazah Mohd;Suki, Norbayah Mohd;Sharif, Arshian;Afshan, Sahar;Jermsittiparsert, Kittisak",Journal,Renewable Energy,2022-01-01,"Othman Yeop Abdullah Graduate School of Business;College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia;Universiti Utara Malaysia;Dhurakij Pundit University",EKC ;  Environmental degradation ;  Malaysia ;  Renewable energy ;  Technology innovation

Human Resources Development and Management System Based on “Five New” Strategy,"Human resources are the first to be determined in the production factors of various enterprises and units. Nowadays, human resource management is getting more and more attention. Human capital is business profit and the driving force of development and competitiveness. Therefore, effective human resource management has become the focus of the normal development of enterprises. The purpose of this article is to study the development and management of current human resources from the perspective of the “five new” strategy, determine the development and management of new human resource concepts, and encourage new trends in innovation and sustainability. According to social and local needs, training human resources, focusing on new human concepts. This article starts from the perspective of the “five new” strategies for human resource management. These strategies are increasingly important on the basis of relevant realistic assumptions and theories, and aim to provide new ideas for the development and management of human resources. The “Five New” strategy is based on the effective development and breakthrough of talent training in applied universities as specific research topics, and has created a framework to research development and human resource management systems from all aspects of education, technology, science, talent, and local economy. The experimental results show that based on the new perspective of the “five new”, more effective means can be used to develop and manage human resources. In the future, there are reasons to believe that all enterprises and departments in various industries will be under the “five new”. Human resources management and talent development must be integrated, especially application-oriented universities that provide the source of human resources are the top priority.

From responsible to responsive innovation: A systemic and historically sensitive approach to innovation processes,"Responsible innovation has emerged as a field of research dedicated to introduce sensitivity to societal values in innovation processes. However, much of the academic literature on RI deals with single technologies instead of technological systems and is future-orientated without explicitly using specialised knowledge of past developments. In this paper, we present a problem-focused approach to RI that aims to support researchers and stakeholders in developing potential solutions from a perspective of systemic awareness and historical sensitivity. We then describe the application of this approach in an 18 months long interdisciplinary research project on plastics. We show that the approach has generated new and unexpected research projects, formed new inter- and transdisciplinary collaborations, and has impacted some participants’ understanding of the systems in which their work is embedded. We conclude that with appropriate willingness to engage by individual researchers, our approach is able to, firstly, influence highly experienced researchers to engage more responsibly with their work, and secondly, to make research projects responsive by including societal concerns and their historical emergence from the start.","Rödl, Malte B.;Boons, Frank;Spekkink, Wouter",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022-01-01,Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet;Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam;The University of Manchester,Co-production ;  Event graphs ;  Historical sensitivity ;  Learning Histories ;  Plastics ;  Responsible innovation ;  Systems thinking
Assessment on the deflection amplification factor of steel buckling-restrained bracing frames,"Researchers in the field of earthquake engineering are always looking for new ways to improve the seismic behavior of structures. The buckling-restrained brace (BRB) is one of these exciting innovations that are employed to increase the ductility capacity of traditional steel braced frames. Understanding the nonlinear response of these novel systems in estimating maximum displacements due to an earthquake has been of significant importance for structural designers. Accordingly, this research is carried out to study of deflection amplification factor (Cd) in BRBs, which have recently been presented in seismic design provisions as one of the seismic lateral-resisting systems. To this end, five 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15-story BRBs are modeled in the software framework of OpenSees. Ground motion simulation is performed by selecting several scaled earthquake records, and the values of elastic and ultimate displacements of structural systems are computed through pushover and nonlinear time-history analyses. The results showed that the deflection amplification factor suggested within famous building codes (such as ASCE-7-16) compared to the obtained values is, in some cases, for certainty; conversely, it is underestimated under some conditions. In fact, the findings indicate that the magnitude of Cd in these systems is strongly related to the height of the building.","Mahmoudi, Mussa;Jalili Sadr Abad, Mohammad",Journal,Advances in Structural Engineering,2022-01-01,Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University,Buckling-restrained brace ;  deflection amplification factor ;  nonlinear response ;  pushover ;  steel frames ;  time-history analysis

Experimental and numerical study on flow characteristic and thermal performance of macro-capsules phase change material with biomimetic oval structure,"The emergence of bionics provides new ideas for the innovation of engineering technology, which has been widely used in energy storage, heat transfer enhancement, and solar thermochemical reactions. To improve the flow characteristic and thermal performance of phase change material (PCM) capsules, the idea of heat storage unit with biomimetic oval structure is proposed. An experimental system is developed, and PCM capsules with different structures (bionic-oval, sphere, and ellipse) are prepared by 3D printing. The experimental and numerical analyses show that the unconstrained melting time of oval-shaped capsule is 12% shorter than that of sphere capsule, and the average Nusselt number of oval-shaped capsule is 20% higher than that of sphere capsule. The optimization results show that the oval-shaped capsule can provide a lower resistance coefficient when the long-short ratio and long-symmetry ratio are 1.25 and 1.67, respectively. The research results can provide guidance and new ideas for the application of bionics in the field of energy storage.","Dong, Yan;Wang, Fuqiang;Zhang, Yaqi;Shi, Xuhang;Zhang, Aoyu;Shuai, Yong",Journal,Energy,2022-01-01,Harbin Institute of Technology,Biomimetics ;  Oval ;  Phase change material ;  Solar energy ;  Thermal energy storage

Russia’s novel weapons systems: military innovation in the post-Soviet period,"This article identifies the principal drivers of Russian military innovation involving five novel nuclear, conventional, or dual-capable delivery systems—Avangard, Burevestnik, Poseidon, Kinzhal, and Tsirkon—and analyzes the interplay between these drivers over the course of the innovation process. It does so by means of a structured, focused comparison of the five systems and their progression to date, distinguishing “innovation” from concepts like “invention” and “diffusion,” and defining the stages of an innovation life cycle. The article also distills prior research on Soviet weapons innovation and investigates its continued validity. The analysis finds external factors to be central in driving innovation, specifically Russian threat perceptions around (1) US missile-defense development and (2) the development of Western conventional warfighting capabilities. It also discusses the roles of a range of internal factors, including industry and high-level political support for specific systems, the availability of Soviet-legacy research and engineering initiatives, and the appeal of anticipated industrial and ancillary benefits from the development of specific systems. Cooperation between design bureaus and other industry players is also examined, as is the role of status considerations in driving innovation. Finally, the relative importance of individual factors in explaining innovation is shown to differ across the systems. The structured comparison identifies the continued validity of certain aspects of past studies on Soviet military innovation, while also bringing to light new insights about contemporary Russian weapons innovation.","Notte, Hanna;Bidgood, Sarah;Sokov, Nikolai;Duitsman, Michael;Potter, William",Journal,Nonproliferation Review,2022-01-01,,military innovation ;  missiles ;  nuclear weapons ;  research and development ;  Russia

Advancing nature-based solutions by leveraging Engineering With Nature® strategies and landscape architectural practices in highly collaborative settings,"The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)'s Engineering With Nature® (EWN®) initiative consistently promotes the use of collaboration for identifying innovative, nature-based solutions (NBS) that lead to more resilient communities and water-based infrastructure. In recent years, EWN researchers, in partnership with landscape architects (LAs) affiliated with the Dredge Research Collaborative (DRC), have championed an innovative, collaborative strategy that offers traditional planners an opportunity to participate in visioning exercises during the initial phases of coastal storm risk management projects. This has resulted in the identification, development, and incorporation of design concepts that prioritize NBS and the placement of natural and nature-based features (NNBF). These concepts, and their development process, have been documented in reports for the use of both the participating planners and other audiences interested in innovative NNBF. Upon observing these favorable outcomes, it has become clear that the integration of disciplines—landscape architecture, applied science, and engineering—has increased our ability to process, utilize, and communicate complex information. Both groups (i.e., DRC's LAs and EWN engineers and scientists) have considerable experience related to infrastructure design and performance; they elucidate ways to achieve functional engineering criteria while also maximizing ecological value and/or promoting more recreational opportunities. However, this partnership also produces a complementary set of uniquely acquired skills and expertise, which advances the development of NBS through accelerated and more meaningful communications. This study will offer insight into the partnership, collaborative techniques, and resulting products that have fostered innovation as well as advocacy for more sustainable infrastructure.

Evolution of Iran’s gas turbine sectoral innovation system as a complex product system (CoPS),"Many scholars have studied various sectoral innovation systems that are categorized as mass-produced goods, whereas there are only a few previous studies that have investigated complex product systems (CoPS). CoPS are defined as high-cost, engineering, and software-intensive goods, systems, networks, infrastructure, engineering constructs, and services. However, many differences between these two categories of industries have been reported by a large number of scholars. To address this shortcoming, this paper intends to study the evolution of Iran’s gas turbine sectoral innovation system as a CoPS industry. To this end, a qualitative approach and a case study research design were employed. To do this, we conducted 17 in-depth interviews, participated in different conferences and conventions, as well as studied various documents as secondary data. Our findings suggest that: firstly, technological capabilities in Iranian gas turbine producers have evolved from assembling to manufacturing, and re-designing existing gas turbines; Secondly, diverse and dynamic governmental policies associated with the gas turbine industry over the last two decades have played a key role in encouraging domestic firms to acquire technological capabilities; and thirdly, the large and growing domestic market not only justified investing in R&D and building infrastructure by the government but also contributed to improved interaction and collaboration between domestic and overseas’ companies. As the main policy implication, our paper suggests that the transition from product-using to product-manufacturing in CoPS industries is not an automatic process. It is important to design the corresponding policies and institutional arrangements following the evolving technological capabilities and demand conditions. Finally, this paper has contributed to sectoral innovation systems and CoPS literature by shedding light on the evolution of the gas turbine industry as CoPS in the context of Iran as a developing country with some restrictions in global technology collaborations.","Safdari Ranjbar, Mostafa;Ghazinoori, Soroush;Manteghi, Manochehr",Journal,"African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development",2022-01-01,Allameh Tabataba'i University;University of Tehran,co-evolution ;  complex product systems ;  gas turbine ;  Iran ;  sectoral innovation system
Physical modelling of large wood (LW) processes relevant for river management: Perspectives from New Zealand and Switzerland,"In the last 30 years, work on large wood (LW) has expanded and matured considerably, and river scientists, managers and practitioners now have a better appreciation of the role of LW in maintaining ecosystems, forming or stabilizing riverine landforms, and interacting with river morphodynamics. We have gained a better understanding of the hazards posed by the recruitment and transport of LW in the river channel and associated infrastructure. While LW dynamics have traditionally been studied in the natural river environment, innovations in laboratory techniques have enabled important advances in understanding LW process dynamics, using physical scale models, new sensors, scanners and sophisticated model boundary conditions. Current trends in LW laboratory research focus on (1) mobilization and transport of logs, (2) trapping and deposition of sediment in the presence of LW and (3) LW contribution to hydraulic flow resistance. Ultimately, a combined process understanding is needed to assess impacts upon infrastructure with erodible boundaries, such as bridge piers and LW retention racks. In this review, we present a critical analysis of emerging experimental work on LW obtained through physical modelling studies. We put recent experimental work in context with global LW management challenges. In particular, we set our work in context with the present environmental and engineering issues that confront catchment and natural resource managers in Switzerland and New Zealand. We show how improved physical models incorporating LW transport, accumulation and scouring processes are needed to contribute to more reliable hazard and risk assessment and improved river management in LW-prone systems.","Friedrich, Heide;Ravazzolo, Diego;Ruiz-Villanueva, Virginia;Schalko, Isabella;Spreitzer, Gabriel;Tunnicliffe, Jon;Weitbrecht, Volker",Journal,Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,2022-01-01,MIT School of Engineering;ETH Zürich;The University of Auckland,

Scaffolds for the manufacture of cultured meat,"The cultured meat market has been growing at an accelerated space since the first creation of cultured meat burger back in 2013. Substantial efforts have been made to reduce costs by eliminating serum in growth media and improving process efficiency by employing bioreactors. In parallel, efforts are also being made on scaffolding innovations to offer better cells proliferation, differentiation and tissue development. So far, scaffolds used in cultured meat research are predominantly collagen and gelatin, which are animal-derived. To align with cell-based meat vision i.e. environment conservation and animal welfare, plant-derived biomaterials for scaffolding are being intensively explored. This paper reviews and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of scaffold materials and potential scaffolding related to scale-up solution for the production of cultured meat.","Seah, Jasmine Si Han;Singh, Satnam;Tan, Lay Poh;Choudhury, Deepak",Journal,Critical Reviews in Biotechnology,2022-01-01,"School of Materials Science and Engineering;A-Star, Bioprocessing Technology Institute",alternative proteins ;  cell-based meat ;  cellular agriculture ;  cultivated meat ;  Cultured meat ;  lab-grown meat ;  scaffolds ;  sustainability ;  tissue engineering

Smart roads: A state of the art of highways innovations in the Smart Age,"The years we are experiencing are often identified as those of the Age of Smart Technologies. Smart is now a very popular term, with the meaning of clever, intelligent, sharp, quick on the uptake. Its extensive meaning can be grasped if we consider it as an acronym for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology to indicate the essential features of the innovative technologies that characterize today's society in its daily life. Thus, the advent of the Smart Age, which is therefore the era of smart technologies, has heavily characterized and modified many aspects of today's society compared to the past. In this panorama, some arising questions regard transport infrastructure systems and, first of all, road transport. This research proposes a focus on one main issue: how roads fit into this smart revolution? Actually, the paper aims to offer an overview of the smart approach in road engineering by proposing a broad discussion about the current state of innovation in the smart roads field, i.e. the roads of the Smart Age. After defining the key functions of a smart road, the paper reviews some innovative technologies that make these items effective. These are studied in depth both with regard to motorway-type infrastructures and urban roads and intersections, with attention to the various technological aspects and to the benefits perceivable by management, users and the community. The paper, therefore, offers a bird's eye view of this extremely dynamic sector with innovative technologies for a new intelligent and connected mobility, and discusses some of their criticalities and strengths allowing for optimization and development of new transport functions and services, improving energy efficiency and promoting social, economic and environmental sustainability.","Pompigna, Andrea;Mauro, Raffaele",Journal,"Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal",2022-01-01,Università di Trento,Autonomous vehicles ;  Connected ;  Intelligent transport systems ;  Smart highway ;  Smart road
Conceptual Design of the Pedestrian Bridge,"As the pedestrian bridge is in a period of rapid development, many issues such as design defects, lagging construction techniques and uncoordinated environmental boundaries have been exposed in the process of construction and maintenance. This article studies the conceptual design of the pedestrian bridge from the viewpoint of holistic engineering construction. By sorting out the developing context of existing pedestrian bridges at home and abroad, it analyzes the existing problems of pedestrian bridges and tracks their root causes. On this basis, combined with excellent international examples of pedestrian bridges, the developing trend of pedestrian bridges is summarized and fundamental design considerations for contemporary pedestrian bridges are proposed centering on the design concept, structural modeling and environmental landscape innovation. Based on design considerations for pedestrian bridges and the application of cutting-edge technologies such as new bridge materials, construction processes and innovative structures, conceptual design strategies for pedestrian bridges are approached by integrated assembling, digitizing, intelligentizing and humanizing design. The article also explores the feasibility of interdisciplinary and cross-cultural inspiration in the application of pedestrian bridge structures. This study attempts to develop a framework for integrating analytic process strategies, and the research content of this article can provide some reference for pedestrian bridge design.","Lu, Pengzhen;Zhou, Yutao;Lu, Qun;Wang, Jiahao;Shi, Qingtian;Li, Dengguo",Journal,Structural Engineering International,2022-01-01,Zhejiang Sci-Tech University;Zhejiang University of Technology,assembly ;  conceptual design ;  intelligentization ;  landscape innovation ;  pedestrian bridge
"Different roles, different demands. A competency-based professional roles model for early career engineers, validated in industry and higher education","This study contributes to the current research in career and professional identity development in that it developed a validated competency-based framework to enhance professional and self-awareness of future engineers. Through a mixed-method design, key competencies were identified for three professional roles for early career engineers. Ninety-six engineers and HR experts from different fields were involved. This resulted in three portraits of early career engineers in practice (engineers in a role focusing on radical innovation, on process optimisation and/or on customised solutions) and what it requires to be successful in these roles. For example, perseverance and creativity were deemed essential for engineers in an innovative role, whereas positive critical attitude and stress resistance were indicated essential for engineers focusing on optimisation. The competency profiles with an aspiration to career perspectives can be a valuable instrument in creating more diversity in engineering. Implications for education, industry, and future research are discussed.","Craps, Sofie;Pinxten, Maarten;Knipprath, Heidi;Langie, Greet",Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2022-01-01,KU Leuven;VDAB Public Employment Service of Flanders,Competence ;  engineering profession ;  mixed methods research ;  professional skills
Anthropogenic risk creation: understanding and addressing the challenges via a conceptual model,"Humans create many risks, ranging from those that are relatively negligible and easily managed to those that are far less wieldy and pose a threat to the existence of humanity, the lives of numerous other species and/or the functionality of local and global ecosystems. The literature on the process of anthropogenic risk creation is limited and piecemeal, and there has been far greater emphasis on using reactive approaches to deal with anthropogenic risks (e.g. risk management) rather than on employing proactive approaches to avert further risk creation (e.g. responsible innovation). An obvious starting point for averting or reducing future anthropogenic risk creation is to understand better the generic features of the risk creation process and to identify points at which the creation process might be better controlled or averted. To this end, this paper presents a simplified conceptual Model of Anthropogenic Risk Creation (MARC) that provides a broad descriptive overview of the sequential stages that appear to have been evident in several historic and contemporary instances of anthropogenic risk creation. By explicating the stages in the risk creation process, MARC highlights the key points at which more attention could be given (e.g. by innovators, policymaker, regulators) to implementing or encouraging greater risk prevention or limitation. Moreover, MARC can help to stimulate critical debate about the extent to which humanity inadvertently creates adverse conditions, such as those that inhibit human prosperity and sustainability, and the extent to which anthropogenic risk creation is adequately understood, researched and managed. This paper also critically reflects upon related issues, such as risk creation as a learning process and the relative merits of initiatives to promote greater responsibility in research and innovation. Important areas for future research on the anthropogenic risk creation process are discussed.","Dawson, Ian G.J.;Hanoch, Yaniv",Journal,Journal of Risk Research,2022-01-01,University of Southampton,Anthropogenic risk creation ;  innovation ;  invention ;  responsibility ;  risk management
The innovation level of engineering students’ team projects in hybrid and MOOC environments,"The study goal was to assess the innovation level of engineering students’ team projects and to examine the relationships between project innovation and team heterogeneity in two online environments. Applying a two-stage mixed methods research design, the qualitative and quantitative data were obtained by interviews with experts in engineering education followed by a multilayered analysis of students’ projects. The study included 190 engineering students who studied the same course, half via a hybrid approach and half via a massive open online course (MOOC). Findings identified innovation type, product necessity, STEM interdisciplinary, and market readiness, as central constructs for assessing the innovation level of students’ projects. The Hybrid group received higher scores for innovation type, as they created projects with a potential for radical innovation. Project innovation was positively correlated with team heterogeneity in academic discipline and academic level; heterogeneity in native language was identified as a hindering factor.","Barak, Miri;Usher, Maya",Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2022-01-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Hybrid course ;  innovation ;  MOOC ;  online learning ;  team heterogeneity
Investigating Creative Processes and Pedagogy in the UK: Fashion Thinking,"This article proposes that a new generation of designers is needed within the UK fashion industry with a combined skill-set of designer-led innovation, a critical approach to new technology and an understanding of new engineering, digital and scientific paradigms. The training of a new type of fashion student/researcher/designer is focused necessarily towards one who is able to work in a transdicsiplinary structure, and who also has a deep academic understanding of the field, able to question and hold to account emerging new industrial models. The machinery and techniques commonly used, practiced and taught within the UK fashion industry and academia have not significantly changed in the past 100 years. However, recent manufacturing innovation and other technological advances including Additive Manufacture, nanotechnology, bio-engineering, electronics enhanced fabrics and digital design processes are enabling the fashion industry to reinvent itself at an international level. Led by a newly developing confidence in practice-based and practice-led research methods for fashion, this collection of technologies and capabilities could fundamentally change the future of the UK fashion design industry, therefore radical change is needed in the training of fashion designers in UK design schools.","Postlethwaite, Susan",Journal,Fashion Practice,2022-01-01,,fashion thinking ;  Industry 4.0 ;  multidisciplinarity ;  practice-based research ;  practice-led research ;  STEAM + D
Innovation in megaprojects and the role of project complexity,"This article examines innovation in megaprojects and the way in which project complexity plays a role in innovation. Megaprojects are experiencing increasing levels of innovation as a means to deal with complexity and to improve the delivery of megaprojects. So far, the relation between innovation and project complexity is under-explored in the megaproject management literature. Based on a cross-case study of two megaprojects, the paper critically evaluates the dimensions of innovation and the relation with project complexity. It also reveals interactions between innovation dimensions. Project complexity is considered a contingency factor in the influence of innovation on project performance. Policy recommendations include evaluating the adoption of innovation against a reduction of complexity, and improving integration of innovation in the planning of megaprojects.","Cantarelli, Chantal C.",Journal,Production Planning and Control,2022-01-01,Sheffield University Management School,case study ;  complexity ;  Innovation ;  megaproject
A scoping literature review of learning progressions of engineering education at primary and secondary school level,"Background: This scoping literature review was undertaken by the Science and Engineering Education Research and Innovation Hub at The University of Manchester to enhance the understanding of how teachers can be supported to plan for progression in engineering education in primary and secondary schools in England. Purpose & Method: The aim of this literature review is to provide insight into Learning Progressions (LPs) published globally for primary and secondary school level. In setting out the context and parameters for the study the paper identifies and compares definitions for LPs. It synthesises emergent themes from 25 academic papers. Findings: Four main findings were deducted from the data papers. Firstly, UK curricular were not discussed. Secondly, within the dataset near parity between science and engineering-focused papers was revealed. Thirdly, of the data papers reviewed nearly the same number used pre-existing definitions of LPs to those that did not offer any definition or description of LP. Furthermore, around half this number created their own, or used a generalised description of LPs. Finally, the data papers highlighted a lack of common definition for engineering education LPs, unlike science LPs. None of the data papers provided an LP specific to engineering education aligned to the National Curriculum (NC) in England. Conclusions: Four recommendations emerge: i) engineering education should be recognised as a distinct subject within the NC for England; ii) more academic research and curriculum development is required within the field of engineering education LP specifically aligned with the NC in England; iii) industry and education would benefit from further collaboration to ensure that their respective needs and positions are adequately met through schools; iv) teacher professional development and resources need focused auditing and investment.","Bonsall, Amy;Bianchi, Lynne;Hanson, Janet",Journal,Research in Science and Technological Education,2022-01-01,The University of Manchester;University of Winchester,engineering curriculum ;  Engineering learning progression ;  primary school ;  secondary school
Implementing a joint learning method (PBL and EBL) to innovate the development of mechanical engineering technical and non-technical skills,"In engineering education, traditional teaching practices continue to be replaced by inquiry-based learning methods such as problem-based learning, which is now a ubiquitous practice in engineering schools. However, adopting it as the sole learning method curtails the richness of the pedagogical practice. This research proposes a pedagogical innovation by using a joint learning method, example-based learning (EBL) and problem-based learning (PBL), to improve learning outcomes. Using a posttest-only quasi-experimental design, machining laboratory practices in mechanical engineering were designed to use EBL only (control group) in one academic semester and both PBL and EBL (quasi-experimental group) the next academic semester. To account for the difference in cohorts, the difference-in-differences method was used to determine the impact of the addition of PBL. Students provided qualitative data to ascertain their perceptions using the joint method. The addition of the PBL method to the EBL method has a positive but statistically insignificant impact on posttest scores. PBL fosters the acquisition of non-technical skills such as communication, coordination, and teamwork, even when such skills are not taught. The combination of PBL and EBL works in synergy and fosters the development of technical and non-technical skills in engineering educational practice.","Sanchez-Gomez, Carlos A.",Journal,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education,2022-01-01,"Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia",engineering education ;  Example-based learning ;  pedagogical practice ;  problem-based learning
Crossing the valley of death: Five underlying innovation processes,"The aim of this paper is to elucidate the innovation processes of technology development across the Valley of Death. Hitherto, studies of the innovation process for this difficult early phase in technology development have implied a linear progression or have privileged the contribution of intermediaries channelling government-funded support. By making use of process theories, and pursing a novel action research methodology with all innovation actors involved in the Valley of Death transition, then a wider processual perspective is realised. This paper adopts a realist evaluation approach in order to integrate the findings from six different technology development projects. By these means, we suggest that crossing the Valley of Death implies the successful completion of five distinct innovation processes. We construct a conceptual framework constituted of the five innovation processes, and argue there is more than one pathway for crossing the Valley of Death. Finally, we offer practical implications for innovation management at this phase of technology development.","Ellwood, Paul;Williams, Ceri;Egan, John",Journal,Technovation,2022-01-01,University of Liverpool Management School;University of Leeds;Technical Products Ltd,Action research ;  Innovation dynamics ;  Process theory ;  Realist evaluation ;  Valley of death
Risk governance and 'responsible research and innovation' can be mutually supportive,"Risk governance (RG) is concerned with processes and principles to improve the management of risk. When implemented to deal with risks from new technologies, it must also contribute to enhancing innovation, rather than constraining it, in such a way that innovation itself can also contribute to reducing risks. To increase its relevance to some of the challenges that managers face, RG must constantly adapt to the objectives and priorities of organisations, as well as their supporting values. One of these priorities in Europe and elsewhere is that organisations develop research and innovation in a way that is 'responsible'. Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is thus defined by the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme as ‘an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and innovation’. This article addresses the difficulties of implementing RRI principles in the practice and suggests that an analogy can be made between processes in place for RG and processes that could be developed for RRI. It further suggests that RG could be used to support the development of RRI. The practice of RG can offer relevant ways to assess and manage RRI and provide guidance for the development of procedural and normative RRI. Embedding RRI in practice is a challenge that requires considerations at the organisational and individual level. This article concludes by suggesting questions that researchers can consider to ensure that their work is in line with expectations from both effective RG and RRI.","Florin, Marie Valentine",Journal,Journal of Risk Research,2022-01-01,International Risk Governance Council (IRGC),responsible research and innovation ;  Risk governance ;  RRI
