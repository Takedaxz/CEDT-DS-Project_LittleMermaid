Performance evaluation of dual system structure with belt truss,"In structural engineering applications, boundaries of building deflection or interstory drift are important issues. In tall buildings that are more than or equal to 60 floors in the current era, the Belt Truss System is used in the building structure. The function of the Belt Truss is useful to reduce deflection that occurs in buildings by converting the building's moment to the axial column of the exterior column. The Structure of the Belt Truss itself can use reinforced concrete structures and steel structures. Because the Belt Truss structure is an innovation in the world of structural engineering, the earthquake load parameter values do not depend on the applicable Building Standart Codes. Standard Codes of Earthquake Resistant Building require parameters of the Response Modification Coefficient (R), Over Strength Factor (Ωo), and Deflection Amplification Factor (Cd) for determining earthquake loads. Because the parameters in the Belt Truss structure are not listed in the Standard Codes of Earthquake Resistant Building, the earthquake load parameters of the Belt Truss were determined. The method used in this research is literature study using Pushover Analysis according to ATC-40 and FEMA 356.","Utomo, Dwi Prasetyo;Soegiarso, Roesdiman",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2020-12-30,Faculty of Engineering,

An analysis of configurations of relationship quality dimensions to explain sources of behavioral outcomes in globalized manufacturing,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore the role of configurations of relationship quality dimensions for explaining sources of behavioral outcomes in the globalized manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach: A joint analysis of behavioral and objective performance data from globalized manufacturing links perceptual customer metrics that relate to dimensions of relationship quality (i.e. attitudinal loyalty, perceived customer orientation, customers’ perceived innovativeness of the supplier and perceived customer influence on supplier innovation) with behavioral outcomes (i.e. share of wallet (SOW) and customer account profitability). Using data from a global business-to-business (B2B) customer survey together with archival performance data from a multinational mechanical engineering firm, a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is performed. Findings: The fsQCA results suggest that perceptual customer metrics related to innovation can be relevant aspects of relationship quality, in line with Anderson and Mittal’s (2000) satisfaction-repurchase-profitability chain framework and its adaptation to SOW. However, the underlying complexities in the different combinations of attributes in the recipe are such that they are not equifinal in leading to higher SOW or higher profitability. This paper finds indications for non-linearities between perceptual measures investigated and profitability of customer accounts, with particular relevance for the role of perceived customer orientation, perceived product innovativeness of the supplier and attitudinal loyalty. Research limitations/implications: The analysis faces a number of limitations, starting with its reliance on cross-sectional survey data, which does not enable us to account for feedback mechanisms, for example, arising from customer perceptions regarding innovation aspects. The lack of a multidimensional conceptionalization of the perceptual customer constructs may have limited the analysis, considering also recent evidence from retail companies in the furniture sector in Spain, suggesting that the multidimensional conceptualization of relationship value explained satisfaction and loyalty levels to a greater extent than the one-dimensional conceptualization (Ruiz-Martínez et al., 2019). Practical implications: In terms of managerial implication, the results suggest that customers perceive limited value in participating in the focal firm’s innovation value chain funnel, hence customer loyalty cannot be bought using simple incentive strategies. The results with regard to customer account profitability suggest that B2B customers investigated here may distinguish when interacting with their globalized supplier in the innovation funnel: they may see a positive customer value when the innovation is a product, and thus, relation-specific, whereas they may see limited customer value when innovation is considered in more generic terms (customers’ perceived influence on supplier innovation in general). Originality/value: This paper starts from the premise that perceptual customer metrics can matter for supplier performance, as the customer relationship and customer value management research has shown. However, there is limited empirical evidence from globalized manufacturing sectors incorporating perceptual constructs in behavioral outcomes, and limited evidence assessing customer-perceived value in such sectors through alternate approaches to main-effects focused analyzes. We employ qualitative comparative analysis using fuzzy sets (Russo et al., 2019) to address these gaps, focusing on two key behavioral outcomes, namely, customer account profitability and SOW.","Steiner, Bodo;Brandhoff, Moritz",Journal,European Journal of Marketing,2020-12-28,Helsingin Yliopisto;Energie-Control GmbH,B2B customer value ;  Customer catisfaction ;  fsQCA ;  Global business ;  Innovation ;  Loyalty ;  Manufacturing industries ;  Mechanical engineering ;  Perceptual customer constructs ;  Share of wallet
Leveling up SeGaP: An Action Research Approach to Develop an Innovation Prize,"Innovation prize as a popular policy instrument has a wide range of rationales for inducing and motivating science, technology and innovation (STI) efforts within an innovation system. As one of their oldest applications, they can be utilized to stimulate RandD in a given field. Yet other policy objectives such as supporting commercialization, networking and solving strategic challenges have been considered for them. Since serious gaming is gaining a great attention in the transformation era of education, training and healthcare, public support for the research, development and promotion of SGs is of significant importance. Accordingly, SeGaP is an innovation prize for the stimulation of science, technology and innovation (STI) performance in this area. This paper attempts to present the evolution of SeGaP with an action research approach to review the role of this innovation prize in the enhancement of SG ecosystem. The results show that the best application of SeGaP is to legitimize the SGs in the society and create a network among different stakeholders for the growth of this ecosystem. It is also shown that there are major issues regarding the commercialization of SGs which has to be solved by a mix of different policy instruments.","Nasiri, Hamed;Alizadeh, Fariba;Ghazinoori, Soroush",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2nd International Serious Games Symposium, ISGS 2020",2020-12-23,Allameh Tabataba'i University;University of Tehran,Innovation Prize ;  Policy Design ;  Serious Games ;  STI Policy Instruments
Innovation or Introduction? The Impact of Technological Progress Sources on Industrial Green Transformation of Resource-Based Cities in China,"With the increasingly prominent problems of global resource consumption and environmental pollution, industrial green transformation has become one of the requirements of China’s industrial development in the new era. However, there is a lack of research on the impact of technological innovation and technology introduction on the industrial green transformation of resource-based cities. To bridge this gap, this study uses the panel data of 115 resource-based cities in China from 2003 to 2016, and uses the dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation method to study the impact of technological innovation and technology introduction on industrial green transformation of resource-based cities. The results show that technology introduction has a negative effect on the industrial green transformation of resource-based cities, while technological innovation can have a positive effect. Meanwhile, technology introduction has imparted a greater role to technological innovation in promoting this transformation. In addition, the interactive effects between technological innovation and technology introduction have obvious heterogeneity on the industrial green transformation of different types of resource-based cities. Therefore, resource-based cities should continue to increase investment in scientific research, to constantly improve and consolidate their technological innovation ability, optimize foreign investment strategy in technology introduction, and strengthen the digestion and absorption of imported technology, while increasing technological innovation and personnel training.","Xie, Wancheng;Yan, Taihua;Xia, Senmao;Chen, Fengzhang",Journal,Frontiers in Energy Research,2020-12-22,Chongqing University;Coventry University,China ;  industrial green transformation ;  resource-based cities ;  technological innovation ;  technology introduction
Stem Cells and Organoid Technology in Precision Medicine in Inflammation: Are We There Yet?,"Individualised cellular models of disease are a key tool for precision medicine to recapitulate chronic inflammatory processes. Organoid models can be derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or from primary stem cells ex vivo. These models have been emerging over the past decade and have been used to reconstruct the respective organ-specific physiology and pathology, at an unsurpassed depth. In cancer research, patient-derived cancer organoids opened new perspectives in predicting therapy response and provided novel insights into tumour biology. In precision medicine of chronic inflammatory disorders, stem-cell based organoid models are currently being evaluated in pre-clinical pharmacodynamic studies (clinical studies in a dish) and are employed in clinical studies, e.g., by re-transplanting autologous epithelial organoids to re-establish intestinal barrier integrity. A particularly exciting feature of iPSC systems is their ability to provide insights into organ systems and inflammatory disease processes, which cannot be monitored with clinical biopsies, such as immune reactions in neurodegenerative disorders. Refinement of differentiation protocols, and next-generation co-culturing methods, aimed at generating self-organised, complex tissues in vitro, will be the next logical steps. In this mini-review, we critically discuss the current state-of-the-art stem cell and organoid technologies, as well as their future impact, potential and promises in combating immune-mediated chronic diseases.","Tran, Florian;Klein, Christine;Arlt, Alexander;Imm, Simon;Knappe, Evelyn;Simmons, Alison;Rosenstiel, Philip;Seibler, Philip",Journal,Frontiers in Immunology,2020-12-21,University of Oxford;Universität Oldenburg;Universität zu Lübeck;Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel;Nuffield Department of Medicine;Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel,cancer ;  co-culture ;  host-microbe ;  immune-epithelial interactions ;  induced pluripotent stem cells ;  patient derived organoids ;  precision medicine ;  stem cell
The knowledge spillover effects of green technology innovation of low carbon regulation,"The green technology spillover (GTS) is conducive to follower's innovation opportunities but harmful to pioneer's innovation advantages. Based on the knowledge production function and the panel data of cities in China, this paper discusses the effects of GTS on the relationship between the low carbon regulation (LCR) and the green technology innovation (GTI) by using the Spatial Durbin Model. We found that LCR makes a decrease-increase effect of the pioneer's GTI different from an increase-decrease effect of the follower's GTI.","Ding, Youqiang;Xiong, Aihua",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-12-21,Shandong University of Finance and Economics,
Recent advancement in the natural fiber polymer composites: A comprehensive review,"In the recent decade, growth of the natural fiber reinforced polymer (NFRP) composite has made a considerable impact on the polymer composite research and innovation. This rapid growth warranted their properties over low-cost synthetic fiber composites and reduced environmental impacts. As these materials have potential applications in the various engineering sectors, considerable efforts have been made to improve their performance. In recent year's various modifications were introduced in the natural fiber composites which increased their capability. The aim of this review is to highlight the trends in the research and development on NFRP and its performance from the year 2000–2019. This review article covers current research efforts on the NFRP fabrication, its properties such as mechanical strength, tribological, water, and chemical resistance behaviour, thermal effects, biodegradability and machining characteristics along with their trends, challenges and prospects in the field of NFRP.","Vigneshwaran, S.;Sundarakannan, R.;John, K.

Circular business model experimentation: Demystifying assumptions,"Circular business model experiments may help firms transition towards a circular economy. Little is known about how the participants of experimentation – entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, innovation managers – develop and test their assumptions during the experimentation process to achieve more circular outcomes. Using a design-science approach, we investigate this process and develop principles to improve it. This is done during three workshops in different contexts: an innovation festival with 14 early-stage circular startups, a workshop with a health technology incumbent, and a workshop with six growth-oriented startups. We find that analyzing their available means – what they find important and prefer to happen (part of their identity), what they know (their skills and knowledge), and whom they know (their social network) – helps to understand how the participants develop and test their assumptions. We show how the mindset and awareness of the participants impact how much attention they pay to the circularity potential of their envisioned circular business models. Based on these insights, we propose a set of principles to prepare the innovation participants for experimentation, and to increase their ability to reflect on their circularity assumptions. Future research is needed to further grow our understanding of the types of principles that can guide meaningful experimentations towards a circular economy.","Konietzko, Jan;Baldassarre, Brian;Brown, Phil;Bocken, Nancy;Hultink, Erik Jan",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-12-20,The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics;Delft University of Technology,Business model ;  Business model innovation ;  Circular economy ;  Effectuation ;  Experimentation ;  Lean startup ;  Sustainability
Take Gansu Province as an Example to Study the Promotion of Technological Innovation on Agricultural Economy,"During the 13th Five-Year Plan period, under the support of the national agricultural innovation policy of benefiting and strengthening agriculture, the agricultural economy of Gansu Province developed rapidly.The regional advantage industry represented by potato industry has begun to take shape, but it still faces a series of problems such as insufficient development momentum.In the face of the limitation of natural resources and the bottleneck of agricultural technology development, transformation and popularization, all departments should take joint action and based on the fundamentals. Simultaneously, learn from the achievements of developed countries such as Israel, Japan, and the Netherlands, through balancing the application of scientific research achievements, reasonably developing agricultural technology and accelerating patent transformation, then improving the agricultural innovation technology extension system, so as to further play the role of agricultural innovation in promoting agricultural economic development.","Sang, Yinan",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-12-18,Northwest A&F University,:Agricultural technology innovation ;  agricultural economy ;  promoting role
Surface structure-dependent photocatalytic O<inf>2</inf>activation for pollutant removal with bismuth oxyhalides,"The purification of water and air by semiconductor photocatalysis is a rapidly growing area for academic research and industrial innovation, featured with ambient removal of organic or inorganic pollutants by using solar light as the energy source and atmospheric O2 as the green oxidant. Both charge transfer and energy transfer from excited photocatalysts can overcome the spin-forbidden nature of O2. Layered bismuth oxyhalides are a new group of two-dimensional photocatalysts with an appealing geometric and surface structure that allows the dynamic and selective tuning of O2 activation at the surface molecular level. In this Feature Article, we specifically summarize our recent progress in selective O2 activation by engineering surface structures of bismuth oxyhalides. Then, we demonstrate selective photocatalytic O2 activation of bismuth oxyhalides for environmental control, including water decontamination, volatile organic compound oxidation and nitrogen oxide removal, as well as selective catalytic oxidations. Challenges and opportunities regarding the design of photocatalysts with satisfactory performance for potential environmental control applications are also presented.

Research on the Innovation of Artificial Intelligence Training Mode for New Engineering Majors in Higher Vocational Colleges,"The ""new""of the new economy is mainly reflected in two aspects. First, information technology (including cloud computing, big data, Internet of things, artificial intelligence and other technologies) is widely used in social material production and spiritual and cultural fields. The new form of social culture and material production has the characteristics of high efficiency, changeability and cross field. Second, the wide application of new materials and bioengineering technology will greatly change the relationship between man and nature (including the material characteristics of human beings), and make the living state and living space of human beings have essential changes different from those of any previous era. With the prosperity of China's industrial manufacturing industry, the industrial chain of artificial intelligence is developing rapidly. The purpose of AI interface research is to realize human-computer communication. Therefore, scholars must make efforts from both theoretical and practical aspects to solve the functional problems of computer's understanding and translation of words and languages, and self-expression.

Is the patent system the way forward with the CRISPR-Cas 9 technology?,"CRISPR-Cas9 technology is reshaping the way scientists conduct research in genetic engineering. It is predicted to revolutionise not only the fields of medicine, biology, agriculture and industry but, much like all revolutionary technologies of the past, the way humans live. Given the anticipated and already seen benefits of CRISPR-Cas 9 in different areas of human life, this new technology may be defined as a true breakthrough scientific discovery. The article presents several challenges connected with various dimensions of the CRISPR-Cas 9 patent landscape. The central argument is that today the biggest challenge is finding a intermediary way that ensures a balance between providing sufficient openness for the further progress of basic research in CRISPR-Cas 9 such as 'niche' areas of the latest genetic engineering and adequate intellectual property rights to incentivise its commercialisation and application. The article contends the endeavours by academic scientific institutions to arrive at short-term benefits of the new CRISPR-Cas 9 technology do not constitute such an intermediary way, especially when the CRISPR-Cas 9 patent landscape is viewed as part of a series of controversial bioethical discussions that have been underway for over 40 years.","Mali, Franc",Journal,Science and Technology Studies,2020-12-15,Univerza v Ljubljani,Biopatents ;  CRISPR-Cas9 ;  Intellectual property rights ;  Open innovation models ;  Patent litigation

The development of spallation target and fuel handling system for China initiative accelerator driven system,"The China initiative Accelerator Driven subcritical System (CiADS) has already embarked on a plan to be built in south China's Guangdong province for the research purpose of lead–bismuth cooled fast reactor and minor-actinide transmutation technology. In comparison with the other critical reactors, it is difficult to arrange the fuel handling equipment and to make the whole core refueling plan, since there is a proton beam tube in the central of the core and the operating environment is completely opaque. In this context, an innovation design of the spallation target and fuel handling system is proposed in Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMPCAS) based on an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) platform, which can fulfill the loading and refueling procedure without mutual collisions, and provide the real-time roaming experience as in the real world. Detailed information of the handling system have been introduced including the optimized logical structure in consideration of the movement of spallation target for the fuel handling process, the principle of collision detection based on the fast ray-casting technology, the real-time roaming experience with feedback control in refueling procedure, and the reliability assessment and sequential optimization for the above process. The spallation target and fuel handling system can cover all the assemblies in subcritical reactor and provide a powerful tool for the frequently updated engineering design of the CiADS project.","Li, Jin Yang;Gu, Long;Xu, Hu Shan;Zhang, You Peng;Yao, Cun Feng;Sheng, Xin;Yang, Sheng;Fan, Da Jun;Wang, Da Wei",Journal,Annals of Nuclear Energy,2020-12-15,Lanzhou University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences;Fudan University,Fast ray-casting technology ;  Fuel handling ;  Immersive virtual reality ;  Spallation target ;  Subcritical reactor
Model-Based Engineering of Collaborative Embedded Systems: Extensions of the SPES Methodology,"This Open Access book presents the results of the ""Collaborative Embedded Systems"" (CrESt) project, aimed at adapting and complementing the methodology underlying modeling techniques developed to cope with the challenges of the dynamic structures of collaborative embedded systems (CESs) based on the SPES development methodology. In order to manage the high complexity of the individual systems and the dynamically formed interaction structures at runtime, advanced and powerful development methods are required that extend the current state of the art in the development of embedded systems and cyber-physical systems. The methodological contributions of the project support the effective and efficient development of CESs in dynamic and uncertain contexts, with special emphasis on the reliability and variability of individual systems and the creation of networks of such systems at runtime. The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), and the case studies are therefore selected from areas that are highly relevant for Germany's economy (automotive, industrial production, power generation, and robotics). It also supports the digitalization of complex and transformable industrial plants in the context of the German government's ""Industry 4.0"" initiative, and the project results provide a solid foundation for implementing the German government's high-tech strategy ""Innovations for Germany"" in the coming years.","Böhm, Wolfgang;Broy, Manfred;Klein, Cornel;Pohl, Klaus;Rumpe, Bernhard;Schröck, Sebastian",Book,Model-Based Engineering of Collaborative Embedded Systems: Extensions of the SPES Methodology,2020-12-14,Siemens AG;Technische Universität München;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Universität Duisburg-Essen;Robert Bosch (Germany),Automotive Software Engineering ;  Co-Design of Systems ;  Embedded Systems ;  Model-Driven Software Development ;  Open Access ;  Requirements Engineering ;  Simulation ;  Software Engineering ;  SPES Methodology
A Survey of Technology Acceptance Models in the Creative Industry: Exploring Key Limitations,"While the field of technology acceptance is a widely researched area in information systems research, its extension to the creative industry through the eyes of professional content creators is comparatively novel. Additionally, the present literature lacks the exploration of how content creators accept and adopt new technologies in the creative industry. This research paper aims to examine the different technology acceptance models of the last four decades. In addition, the study investigates key limitations pertaining these theories. As it stands significant and precondition for the usage of technology, our study found that among all the surveyed technology acceptance theories, the Innovation and Diffusion Theory is the only model that is designed to empirically analyze technology acceptance on the group level. Furthermore, the study found two different schools of thought that adopted the role of Attitude. Our study recommends the analysis of the UTAUT application in the creative industry. Conclusively, by exploring the key limitations of the current technology acceptance theories, and advancing the present knowledge from a theoretical perspective, this study supports distinctively from prior studies, as a foundation for future studies to develop and validate an extended model of technology acceptance by content creators in the creative industry.","Rahimi, Ramy A.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE",2020-12-14,Chungnam National University,Behavior ;  Content Creator ;  Creative Industry ;  Technology Acceptance Model ;  Technology Use
Usability Testing in Kanban Agile Process for Club Management System,"A Club management system is a centralized management and communications platform for clubs and societies. It is developed as a social innovation which aims to combat the limitations of current systems utilized by clubs, whereby there is no central repository for information, and each club utilizes their own methods for management, member communication, and event organization. A greater attention had been considered to Kanban as an agile software development method in developing such a management system. However, the adoption of this methodology is quite challenging to incorporate user experience and usability in an agile process. Hence, this study utilized the Kanban approach which is an implementation of Lean methodology to manage the software life cycle in developing a university club management system. The user requirements have been identified and documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) along with the use case diagram and entity relationship diagram for the database definition. The software was developed using the Laravel PHP Framework. Functional testing and usability testing have been carried out to validate the user requirement. The result of usability testing shows that the system satisfies five usability factors. This will spark some new insights in the use of its technologies and methods for future research.","Rahmat, Azizah;Hanifiah, Nur Aisyah Mohd",Conference Proceeding,"6th International Conference on Interactive Digital Media, ICIDM 2020",2020-12-14,Universiti Kuala Lumpur,club management system ;  kanban ;  usability
Is a disruptive technology disruptive? The readiness perspective based on TOE,"Most enterprises want to increase their competitiveness through the implementation of disruptive technology, but not all enterprises have achieved their initial expectations after adopting disruptive technologies. One of the most important reasons is that the enterprise itself is not well prepared for a disruptive technology in all aspects, which leads to many problems and risks in the implementation process. As the successful implementation of disruptive technology depends on enterprises' innovativeness. The extant research focuses on its predictive identification, technical characteristics, and application directions. However, there is a lack of research on organizational preparation for implementing disruptive technologies to promote their success. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, this study reviews the literature to explore the readiness of enterprises adopting and implementing disruptive technologies. It extracts the factors that affect technological readiness, organizational readiness and environmental readiness respectively. Affecting an organization's choice of adopting disruptive technologies, these three aspects of readiness ultimately determine their success.","Chang, Nan;Zhang, Yali;Lu, Di;Zheng, Xin;Xue, Jianwu",Conference Proceeding,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,2020-12-14,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Disruptive technology readiness ;  Innovation diffusion theory ;  TOE framework
Knowledge revealing and organizational legitimacy: Comparisons between different types of firms in China,"Knowledge revealing, as a unique form of open innovation, increasingly attracts interests in academia and practice. Yet, its impacts on firms are still under-researched. Based on open innovation research and impression management perspective, this paper examines the relationship between knowledge revealing and organizational legitimacy, and how the relationship varies between different types of firms in the Chinese context. Using the survey data from 217 manufacturing firms in China, we find that knowledge revealing has positive impacts on both political and business legitimacy. These impacts are stronger for new ventures than for established firms. While knowledge revealing has a stronger influence on political legitimacy for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) than for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the effect of knowledge revealing on business legitimacy does not show significant difference between non-SOEs and SOEs. Our study, therefore, uncovers the legitimacy benefit of knowledge revealing in a firm-type-dependent manner.","Xie, Y.;Huang, J.

Exploring AI-driven business models: Conceptualization and expectations in the machinery industry,"Companies collecting and creating valuable insights with artificial intelligence (AI) are able to secure a decisive competitive advantage. Business model innovation serves as a strong competitive differentiator and together with technological progress, new businesses fueled by AI are created every year. The main scientific result of this research is the conceptualization of AI-driven business models and an overview about the target state and potentials of these business models in practice based on a descriptive study. AI-driven business models can be conceptualized as business models that use artificial intelligence technologies to build at least one of the business model components. Compared to data-driven business models, which constitute a subgroup of business models, AI-driven business models are based on a set of techniques, that learn and improve their performance without humans having to explicitly program them. The contribution to practice is made as the proposed potentials of developing these business models can support decision-makers in evaluating the use of AI technologies. Innovating its business model with the help of AI can help to survive in a highly competitive business environment.","Hahn, C.;Traunecker, T.;Niever, M.;Basedow, G.

Launch strategies for upgraded products with consideration of selfcannibalization,"This paper studies optimal pricing and timing of a firm to launch an upgraded product to maximize its revenue, considering self-cannibalization between two generation products. Heterogeneous customers arriving to the market compare utilities resulted from existing and new products and try to maximize their utilities. We model the firm and customers' decision-makings as a two-stage dynamic game and its equilibrium results are derived. Our numerical analysis shows that technology innovation of the new product significantly improves the firm's revenue performance. Technology innovation brings added value to the new product, which allows a higher pricing for the upgraded product. However, it has no impact on the firm's optimal launch time. In addition, depreciation speed of the product has a negative impact on the firm's total revenue. However, it does not affect optimal launch strategies, which include optimal launch price and launch time.","Li, C. N.;Chen, Y.;Luan, H. J.;Wang, L. S.;Sun, L. X.;Wang, T.

Municipal solid waste management in some countries of the world,"The aim of the study is both an analysis of existing basic solutions and innovations in the field of municipal solid waste management and new developments by domestic authors. The main research method was environmental monitoring in the impact zone of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. In the process of monitoring, the properties of the soils of the landfill bases were studied by testing them and further laboratory studies of lithological and mineral compositions, moisture and density, filtration and other characteristics. As a result, the following were established: the dependence of soil water permeability on particle size distribution, lithological, organ mineral compositions and the degree of their heterogeneity; maximum minimum-required thickness of screening soils at the base of MSW landfills in the Middle Urals. The established dependences of the engineering and geological characteristics of soils make it possible to use them as natural impervious screens, which can be successfully applied in other regions under similar conditions. Among the constructive solutions in the field of municipal solid waste management, the developments of domestic scientists, which were tested in the Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod and Sverdlovsk regions, are considered. Some of them relate to environmental protection in the area affected by landfills, while others are aimed at optimizing the operation of such landfills. The optimization technology consists in combining the operation and reconstruction cycles of municipal solid waste landfills within their land allotment. It allows involving previously unused materials into circulation and obtaining insulating material from ""old-year""waste.","Guman, Olga;Krinochkina, Olga;Khomenko, Victor;Wegner-Kozlova, Ekaterina",Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2020-12-14,"Ural Federal University;Ural Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences;Moscow State University of Civil Engineering;Ural State Mining University",

From the Board Room Lessons from Sovaldi: Fueling Innovation While Ensuring Access,"The case of Gilead Science’s hepatitis C therapy Sovaldi is a notable precursor to the larger debate over drug pricing, providing some important lessons, at a time when a new generation of potentially curative therapies are coming to market. In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has pointed the finger at misaligned incentives, problems with payer benefit designs, a distorted rebate model, and hospital mark-ups as the cause of pricing and access issues. In order for progress to be made, the industry must acknowledge that it is the one entity across the supply chain that is responsible for establishing the initial price of a new medicine. Pointing to others without shouldering responsibility is misleading at best and intellectually dishonest at worst. Those that manufacture and commercialize medicines must play a leadership role in developing meaningful solutions to long-standing pricing issues. Pharmaceutical companies must demonstrate and articulate the value medicines deliver to all stakeholders. Taking a value-based approach, being cognizant of affordability issues, and delivering innovative medicines that address significant unmet medical needs is an important first step. Failing to do so, will leave the industry with a tarnished reputation and the likelihood of others implementing blunt instruments that will address these long-standing issues while threatening the life blood of the industry, innovation.","Levine, Daniel S.;Watrous, Marc L.",Journal,Journal of Commercial Biotechnology,2020-12-11,"Genentech, Inc;Bio Report and RARECast podcasts",
High quality heliostats leading to new optimal field layouts coupled with an asymmetric receiver geometry,"The “High Performance Thermosolar Plants based on PV-Hybrid Autonomous Heliostats and Tailored Receivers” project (aka PHOTON project) aims to make substantial progress in cost reduction and performance for concentrating solar tower systems. The project counts with the financing support from Eurostars2 program, part of the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Program for Research and Innovation. Within the project, Tewer Engineering (Spain) is leading a consortium in close collaboration with project partners ACCIONA Industrial (Spain), Aalborg CSP (Denmark) and Protech-MetSolar (Lituania) to design optimized smart autonomous heliostat technology that enables new field-receiver designs and plant optimization strategies. The PHOTON heliostat combines intelligence and mechanical innovations that reduce the solar field construction complexity as well as it greatly simplifies commissioning operations through an automatic self-calibration feature. This paper focuses on one of the key findings of the project, the incidence of the high optical quality on the resulting optimized solar field layout, and its potential utilization for the benefit of the overall plant performance and economics. The simulation results have been compared to reference base cases representative of the State-of-the-Art technology at the project start. At the time of writing, the EPC cost reduction has reached a level of 14.41%, and the combination of the solar field, solar receiver and power block optimization has increased the global efficiency of the solar thermal electric plant 2.96%. An important reduction in LCOE in the range of 13% has been achieved for the best case evaluated.","Carrascosa, Marco Antonio;Blázquez, José Manuel;de la Calle, Severo Natanael;Sørensen, Stephanie Sigvert;Falsig, Jens Jørgen;Gallego, José Fernando;Rodriguez, Elena",Conference Proceeding,AIP Conference Proceedings,2020-12-11,Acciona S.A.;TEWER;Aalborg CSP,Asymmetric design ;  CAPEX ;  Cost optimization ;  CSP ;  Flux map ;  Heliostats ;  Optical quality ;  Optimized field layout ;  Slope error

The impact of energy technology innovations on cleaner energy supply and carbon footprints in Europe: A linear versus nonlinear approach,"Providing more affordable and cleaner energy for all raises complex and significant financial, political, technical, and institutional issues, which must all be addressed to ensure sustainable development. Energy technology innovation has a critical role to play as one of the best pathways to achieve the transition to a global clean energy system. This paper is an endeavor to study the impact of government energy technology research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) budget, which is the primary input of energy technology innovations on cleaner energy supply and carbon footprints (CFP). In this study, a cleaner energy supply is measured as the contribution of renewable energy to total primary energy supply (RE). We assumed that the effect of energy innovation is not uniform but varies according to the descending and ascending movements in a government's energy technology RD&D budget. To this end, we distinguished the impact of the descending and ascending movements in government energy technology RD&D budgets on cleaner energy supply, and CFP in Europe over the period 1985 to 2016. Additionally, we carried out a comparative examination of the effects of energy technology RD&D expenditures on RE and CFP under both linear and nonlinear panel techniques. To increase room for policy implications, we also controlled for the role of economic growth and trade openness and performed several robustness check analyses. We found that the reduction of carbon footprints associated with an increase in public support to energy technology RD&D is more pronounced than the contribution of energy technology innovation to the deployment of renewable energy in Europe. This study provided little evidence in favor of the effectiveness of a government energy technology RD&D budget to substantially boost renewable energy in Europe. Following these results, we suggest that the knowledge of the asymmetric linkage between public energy technology innovation, RE, and CFP is a starting point to achieve win-win solutions that favor clean energy and environmental sustainability.","Altıntaş, Halil;Kassouri, Yacouba",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-12-10,Erciyes Üniversitesi,Carbon footprint ;  Cleaner energy supply ;  Development & demonstration budget ;  Energy technology innovation ;  Government energy research ;  Renewable energy
How can innovation theories be applied to water technology innovation?,"The world faces urgent, multi-faceted problems in terms of water; water supply crises have been identified as one of the top five global risks to society in each of the last seven years according to the World Economic Forum. Existing technologies and policies are not adequate for tackling these problems; innovation is urgently required. However, innovation adoption in the water sector is a slow process compared with other industries; the water sector itself is necessarily conservative, and regulation-bound. It is also fragmented, with the US for example having over 161 thousand public water supply utilities. Only a fraction of research efforts yield a marketable product or device. At the same time, innovation in the water sector is of increasing interest to venture capital investors. This paper addresses a problem which is hampering the meeting of these growing interests and needs; the dynamics of water innovation are under-researched, and there is a lack of clear, agreed terminology. As an example, the phrase “disruptive innovation” has drifted significantly away from its originally-intended academic meaning. The authors critically review two theories of innovation: Disruptive Innovation Theory, and Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). While important, Disruptive Innovation Theory is found to have limited applicability to water – for example, there are limited opportunities for lower-end innovation which competes on price in a regulated market like water, and there is also limited opportunity to be market-creating. Although the question arises: is there a market-creating equivalent of the Ford production line that would unlock solutions to water problems in developing countries? Innovation Diffusion Theory is found to be more applicable to water, with some important caveats. In conclusion, this paper proposes a practical framework, with industry examples, for studying water technology innovation. Such a framework could provide a common shared basis to support further research into this topic, including the question: can the disruptive potential of an innovation be predicted?","O'Callaghan, Paul;Adapa, Lakshmi Manjoosha;Buisman, Cees",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-12-10,Wageningen University & Research;BlueTech Research,Discontinuous innovation ;  Disruptive innovation ;  Innovation diffusion ;  Radical functionality ;  Sustaining innovation ;  Water innovation ;  Water technology
Towards a responsive understanding of sustainable school architecture,"Current international strategies admit the vital importance of education as the development engine for our knowledge-based society, where sustainability is the all-encompassing vision. In this context, a school building project should not begin with a design solution. This study aims to investigate the ways in which architects can better understand sustainable strategies and also how can they translate the real users’ needs into architectural design solutions. Sustainability may be implemented both inside the school’s curricula – knowledge, skills, critical thinking, attitudes, way of life – as well as into the design approach, construction, operations and maintenance of the school building. Not only the school building in itself should be a tridimensional textbook which offers sustainability lessons, subtly, attractively and interactively, but architects can become teachers of sustainability. Education for Sustainable Development has become a long-term strategic objective across the world. The strategy adopted by The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in 2005 aims for integrating sustainability as a central nucleus within the educational curricula by 2040. This research applies a double filter in analysing the architecture of educational facilities: “What qualifies as sustainable?” and “What could educate?”. In other words, the study answers an original filter of analysis, “What is it in the sustainable architecture of a school that has the power to educate its users?” and defines major interconnected elements of a sustainable school building: Site, Transportation / Mobility, Safety & Security, Energy, Lighting, Indoor Air Quality, Acoustics, Water Management, Waste Management, Materials & Resources, Structural Systems, Modularity & Prefabrication, Accessibility / Universal Design, Image / Awareness / Local Footprint, Interior Design & Furniture, Orientation & Signage, Health, Nutrition & Physical Activity, Operations & Maintenance, Building services, BMS, Smart / Intelligent Buildings, Information and Communications Technology, Costs & Financing, New or Rehabilitated, Innovation. An 8-boxes matrix type SWOT Analysis have been applied for each specific component, investigating the situation of existing Romanian schools. The SWOT Analysis details the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats and put forward sustainable and educational strategies. Following this study, architects may benefit from new open paths, landmarks and a research toolkit for generating original design solutions. New designed schools should be able to offer a wide range of dynamic methods of teaching architecture, engineering and environmental sciences. Therefore, Education for Sustainable Development is shaped through sustainable school architecture. If we offer users the opportunity to learn and work in educational spaces which are able to capitalize on the creative potential, in schools strategically placed within the environment and deeply rooted in their context, then children, adolescents and adults can all be proud of schools where they feel valorised, they all will be able to evolve, innovate and develop sustainable behaviours. Applying the filter of sustainability to educational purposes, architects can develop a responsive process of integrated design, based on evidence and looking towards the future.","Mihăescu, Oana",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2020-12-09,Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism,
Barriers to technological innovations of SMEs: how to solve them?,"Purpose: This study aims to analyze the inhibiting factors of small and medium enterprises (SMEs’) technology innovation, supporting institutions for SMEs technology innovation development, SMEs’ technology innovation development model and strategies for developing SMEs in technology innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This is a mixed-method research project conducted through a survey of SMEs in Riau Province, Sumatera Indonesia (primarily in the districts of Siak, Kampar and Pelalawan) from April to July 2019. SMEs that have been operating for at least five years were chosen purposively as samples. Based on the requirement, there are 277 entities used in this study. A focus group discussion (FGD) was also conducted to formulate SME models and development strategies in technological innovation. In addition, in-depth interviews and observations were also carried out on technological innovations undertaken by respondents. Findings: It was found that there are five inhibiting factors of SMEs’ technology innovation: government support, quality of human resources, funding of technological innovation, economic conditions and business partners. The biggest inhibiting factor remains to be the funding of technological innovation. Therefore SMEs provide independent technological innovation costs to develop technological innovations for business sustainability. Supporting institutions for developing SME technology innovation consist of government institutions, private institutions, financial institutions (banks) and nonbank financial institutions. To survive and excel amid competition, SMEs need to pay attention to technological innovation. The business strategy that needs to be done is to improve services to consumers and improve their attitude toward innovation in the implementation and development of SMEs’ businesses. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited to research on the inhibiting factors for SME technology innovation from the aspect of the production sector. This research has not studied various business fields in the trade, service and digital SME sectors. Future studies can reveal factors inhibiting SME technological innovation, except production aspects and various SME business fields. In addition, this study has not analyzed the cost of technological innovation provided by SMEs. Therefore, future studies could also reveal the large costs of technological innovation provided by SMEs. Originality/value: This research investigates barriers hindering the SMEs’ technological innovations in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia as a maritime country. It also formulates strategies to reduce the barriers to SME’s technological innovation and contributes to the development of knowledge of technological innovations in SMEs. Moreover, this paper involves investigating government support from a nonfinancial aspect. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this aspect has not been much discussed by studies on innovation at SMEs till now.","Indrawati, Henny;Caska, H.;Suarman, H.",Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2020-12-09,Universitas Riau,Business model ;  Innovation strategy ;  Innovation types ;  Sustaining innovation

Gender balance in mars exploration: Lessons learned from the mars science laboratory,"There is, recently, a global concern about the gender gap in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas, starting from education role models, student applications, through the academic, industrial and management career progression. Given the high visibility and popularity of all subjects related to space exploration, female participation in this field may be used to change the existing stereotypes and provide role models to the younger generations, thus having a positive influence on education while also demonstrating to other organizations how to promote diversity in the working environment. Previous studies on spacecraft science teams, considering only principal and co-Investigators, PIs and co-investigators (CoIs), respectively, show that the percentage of women in the role of investigators has remained flat at 15.8% since 2000. The NASA Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission is taken here as an example to perform a statistical analysis of the gender profile for the period 2004–2018. The results are compared with: (1) data from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) about gender distribution in STEM postdoctoral profiles and faculty members; (2) the trend of planetary exploration team profiles; (3) research and innovation statistics in Europe; (4) proposals of the EU FP6 funding program; and (5) the percentage of female researchers from the Elsevier status report. This analysis shows that the process of continually holding open calls for Participating Scientists based on individual merit and the application of a flat working structure have allowed gender balance within the MSL team to improve naturally while maximizing individual and team performance. Women represent approximately 30.6% of the team, in agreement with the current percentage of female planetary exploration researchers and senior faculty members in academia. Interestingly, the percentage of female-led articles has been above the MSL women percentage trend. While the percentage of women in planetary science appears to be increasing, their role on the proposing teams is still low. As in other STEM fields, attention should be paid to secure the adequate promotion of younger generations to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 5 of achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls by 2030.","Zorzano, María Paz",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-12-02,CSIC-INTA - Centro de Astrobiología (CAB);University of Aberdeen,Gender balance ;  Mars science laboratory ;  Solar system exploration ;  Sustainable goals

Whether it is Haier, Gree, Huawei, Ankai or Zhigao, what these brand products represent is the current development status and characteristics of China's 'Intelligent manufacturing': innovation drive as the driving force and responsible innovation as the development concept. In the past decade, China's manufacturing industry has gradually shifted from the traditional 'Made in China' to 'Intelligent Manufacturing', which reflects the continuous efforts of China's manufacturing transformation and upgrading, and the actual effect of innovation driven by manufacturing. This paper mainly includes four aspects: Firstly, it introduces the overall situation of the transformation and upgrading of traditional manufacturing to 'Intelligent Manufacturing' and the ethical issues it contains: outlines the background of traditional Chinese manufacturing and discusses the reasons why traditional manufacturing needs transformation and upgrading and its developing direction, analyzes the ethical connotation and problems in the process of transformation and upgrading. Secondly, this paper discusses the innovation-driven demand of 'intelligent manufacturing', discusses the position and role of innovation in China's development concept, expounds the relationship between innovation and China's 'intelligent manufacturing' industry, and analyzes the elements of China's 'intelligent manufacturing' to realize innovation-driven: (1) research and development, (2) talents. Thirdly, it discusses the relationship between 'responsible innovation' as a newly developed concept of international technology development strategy and China's 'intelligent manufacturing': introduces the background, concept, framework and approach of 'responsible innovation' and introduces a China case of engineering development within the framework of Responsible Innovation. Finally, this paper explores the issue of social governance innovation in China's 'intelligent manufacturing', and how the 'intelligent manufacturing' could be regarded as the balance and impetus of innovation, development and sustainability in China.","Yenhsiang, Huang;Ping, Yan",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 7th International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering, ICISCE 2020",2020-12-01,Tsinghua University;Dalian University of Technology,China ;  innovation drive ;  Intelligent Manufacturing ;  Responsible Innovation

Fostering Industry-Academia Collaboration in Software Engineering using Action Research: A Case Study,"Background: Studies involving industry-Academia collaboration (IAC) have been growing in recent years. On the one hand, scientific research is encouraged to solve real problems and, on the other, the sector in search of promoting innovation in its field. However, IAC support is still a challenging activity for Software Engineering (SE). In recent studies, the Action Research (AR) method has shown promising results in IAC projects. However, more research still needs to be done to verify the effects of applying this method. Goal: In this article, we investigate the perceptions of postgraduate students from an academic master's and doctoral program in Computer Engineering at a Brazilian University, about the benefits and challenges faced with the application of the AR method as a strategy to promote IAC. Method: The case study was carried out with three teams of students conducting an AR in three software development companies (two private and one public). Results: As for the degree of satisfaction with the course, results revealed that 86% of the students were satisfied with the course. As for the Perception of learning with the use of AR, 100% of the students agreed that the AR method contributed positively to your learning. Conclusion: Finally, we conclude that conducting IAC projects using the AR method was a satisfactory, even though this task has been extremely challenging for all students. We observed that the reasons for this were, first, the fact that students have little experience with research methods directed to Empirical Software Engineering; second, due to the resistance faced in the industry to apply the AR method.","Barbosa, Aline F.;Neto, Geraldo Torres;Lencastre, Maria;Fagundes, Roberta A.A.;Santos, Wylliams B.",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-12-01,Universidade de Pernambuco,Action Research. ;  Industry-Academia-Collaboration

It will have an ultra-powerful magnetic field of 13 T, in which a powerful plasma current of 11 MA will flow at a pulse discharge of about 10 s. The fusion reaction will be ignited mainly by ohmic heating. On the basis of the inspection of practically all the basic components of the energy and supporting infrastructure of the TRINITI Strong-Field Tokamak (SFT) experimental test facility, including steady-state and pulsed power supply systems, vacuum, cryogenic, and fuel systems, and diagnostic equipment, as well as on the analysis of the technical requirements for the tokamak support systems, the proposals for modernizing the TRINITI SFT experimental test facility for the implementation of the Ignitor Project were developed.","Subbotin, M.

"Are smart service manufacturing providers different in cooperation and innovation flexibility, in innovation performance and business performance from non-smart service manufacturing providers?","To overcome the challenges posed by increasing competition, many traditional manufacturing companies are moving from the mere production of manufacturing goods to the integration of services that are more or less integrated into the product, which is also due to the constant development of the industry. Moreover, many manufacturing companies offer products that use smart technologies. This paper focuses on the importance of smart service provision for cooperation and innovation flexibility, innovation performance and business performance in small and medium manufacturing companies. The paper aims to find out if smart service manufacturing providers are different in cooperation and innovation flexibility and innovation and business performance from non-smart service manufacturing providers. To better understand the issue, research was undertaken in 112 small and medium manufacturing companies of the Czech Republic. The problems of smart service provision were investigated in the first empirical research held among the electric engineering companies (CZ-NACE 26 and CZ-NACE 27) in the Czech Republic. The findings show that smart service manufacturing providers are better in internal cooperation flexibility, innovation flexibility related to product and to accompanying services and in business performance than non-smart service manufacturing providers. Theoretical implication contributes in two specific ways: First, in the presentation of the interconnection of smart services and cooperation flexibility, innovation flexibility, innovation performance and business performance; and second, in the identification of the impact of smart services in manufacturing SMEs and in finding out which areas affect the provision of smart services. The findings can have a positive influence in several areas; therefore, they can be important factors for many manufacturing companies which still need some persuasion to offer smart services.","Kaňovská, Lucie",Journal,Engineering Management in Production and Services,2020-12-01,Brno University of Technology,business performance ;  cooperation flexibility ;  innovation flexibility ;  innovation performance ;  manufacturing companies ;  smart services

Ice and snow are easily obtained and fabricated, produce no pollution, and are visually appealing. Therefore, ice shells play an important role in the ice industry and cold regions. In order to promote the innovation of ice shell structures in China, the integration techniques for the design and construction of large-span ice shells were presented. The key techniques were summarized from four aspects: thermal-mechanical coupling analysis, shape control of inflatable formwork, simulation of praying construction and structural monitoring. The application of key techniques was introduced based on the typical engineering cases conducted in recent years. The research results have broadened the appearance modeling and building scale of ice structures, realized the scientific construction and safety assessment of large-span ice shells, and provided theoretical and practical bases for the formulation of design and construction standards for ice shells.","Wu, Yue;Liu, Xiuming;Luo, Peng;Pronk, Arno",Journal,Jianzhu Jiegou Xuebao/Journal of Building Structures,2020-12-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Harbin Institute of Technology,Construction technology ;  Design theory ;  Engineering practice ;  Ice shell ;  Integration

Assessment of collaborative learning skills acquired through the knowledge integration project,The present research study assesses the collaborative learning capacities acquired with the knowledge integration project and the perception of industrial engineering students towards this methodology at the Technical University of Manabí (Ecuador). This is an applied quantitative exploratory research study that applied an experimental research methodology. The industrial engineering degree is classified in three levels and student perception and collaborative learning capacities are analyzed. The results show improvement in student collaborative learning capacities during the degree study. Individual responsibility is the most developed capacity and there is an overall positive student perception of the process. It is concluded that the knowledge integration project should emphasize the promotion of the least developed collaborative learning capacities.,"Rodríguez-Borges, Ciaddy G.;Bowen-Quiroz, Carlos A.;Pérez-Rodríguez, Jesús A.;Rodríguez-Gámez, María",Journal,Formacion Universitaria,2020-12-01,Universidad Técnica de Manabí,active learning ;  collaborative learning ;  educational innovation ;  industrial engineering ;  perception
Challenges and trends of financial technology (Fintech): A systematic literature review,"Digital transformation creates challenges in all industries and business sectors. The development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of fintech (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry. These initiatives are developing rapidly, driven in part by the sharing economy, regulations, and information technology. However, research in the field of fintech remains in its infancy. Fintech offers several services, such as funding, payment (including electronic wallets), e-aggregators, e-trading, and e-insurance, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. This provides an opportunity to more closely examine fintech’s research challenges and trends. This study aims to (1) determine the state of the art of financial technology research; (2) identify gaps in the financial technology research field; and (3) identify challenges and trends for future research potential. The novel proposal in this study includes theoretical contributions regarding financial technology.

Meaningful Human Control of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems: The CCW-Debate and Its Implications for VSD,"The debate on the development and deployment of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) as an emerging technology is of increasing importance, with discussions stalling and technological development progressing. Monitoring the progress of increasingly autonomous weapons systems in civilian and military use [1] as well as regulating possible autonomous systems early on is demanded by civil society actors, like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), while nation states follow a variety of interests and strategies, showing little room for consensus on central terms and questions [2], [3]. This article therefore sheds light on the work of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) of the UN Convention of Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). The CCW, offering an arena for international cooperation, has dedicated itself to the purpose of finding common ground with respect to an understanding of LAWS, as well as to the necessary degree of human control. From an ethical perspective, the concept of Meaningful Human Control (MHC) supports a human-centric approach. Several IEEE projects, series and publications [4] are dedicated to this prioritization, especially regarding civilian use. As autonomous technology is increasingly at the center of contemporary military innovations, questions of (human) agency and responsibility in warfare have become even more pressing [5]. As stressed by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), the concept of MHC may prove useful in the context of development and use of (semi-) autonomous weaponry [6].","Riebe, Thea;Schmid, Stefka;Reuter, Christian",Journal,IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,2020-12-01,Peasec,
A quasi-qualitative analysis of flipped classroom implementation in an engineering course: from theory to practice,"Students have different learning approaches and acquire knowledge in different ways owing to their varied perceptions and grasping abilities. Treating students equally, following the traditional teacher-cantered approach, may not be effective and calls for innovations in knowledge dissemination. This article takes a student-centric approach to implement a ‘flipped classroom’ model in an engineering course for constructivism (i.e. experience-based learning), and students’ personalized learning. The performance of the flipped classroom approach is compared with the traditional lecturing approach using four lenses: students’ grades, students’ reflection using three surveys at different stages during the semester, teacher’s observation, and peer observation. In most of the existing approaches, analysis of the qualitative survey data is performed manually without computer assistance, and therefore these are criticized for being primeval and instinctive. In this research, a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, is devised to evaluate the qualitative survey responses from the students. It is shown in this research, that the linguistic survey responses can be summarized in an index more meaningfully using a fuzzy logic-based approach. The results further showed that the flipped classroom model helped students to improve their grades and enhance engagements with their teacher and their peers. Increased interaction, during interactive class activities, was instrumental in evolving students’ problem-solving and critical analysis skills towards better learning experiences. Furthermore, students’ survey results, analyzed using the novel fuzzy indexing and a non-parametric statistical test showed that the intervention in the form of flipped classes was effective and found to be statistically significant. The findings of this study may help other academics, endeavoring for experience-based, and students’ personalized learning.","Hussain, Shahid;Jamwal, Prashant K.;Munir, Muhammad T.;Zuyeva, Aigerim",Journal,International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,2020-12-01,Nazarbayev University;University of Canberra;The University of Auckland;ReLive Research,Constructivism ;  Engineering course ;  Flipped classroom ;  Pedagogical model ;  Quasi-qualitative analysis ;  Theory and practice

Mitigating fish mortality in turbines by behavioural manipulation,"Theoretical considerations and observations suggest a strong influence of fish behaviour on resulting damage rates during turbine passage. This opens perspectives for an innovative technique to reduce fish damage by targeted behaviour manipulation, referred to as ""IDA"". Live fish turbine passage experiments have been conducted to clarify the actual influence of fish behaviour. Three competitive test series with uninfluenced fish, with fish under medical narcosis and with fish influenced by an electric-field-based IDA prototype were conducted at a 35 kW Kaplan turbine at the Hydraulic Engineering Lab of Technical University of Munich in Obernach. The results confirm an influence of fish behaviour on damage rates in consistency with modelling considerations. The findings emphasis the relevance of more detailed considerations of fish damage in turbines and suggest further research in this field. In the given setup the IDA related damage rates were significantly reduced to about 55% compared to normal, uninfluenced fish passage. The IDA technique can provide further increased efficiency for larger turbine sizes and can be of special interest for economically compatible, ecological improvements at existing plants.","Geiger, Franz;Cuchet, Mathilde;Peter, Rutschmann",Journal,WasserWirtschaft,2020-12-01,Technische Universität München;Ecohydraulic Consulting Cuchet (ehemals Lehrstuhl für Wasserbau und Wasserwirtschaft der TUM),
"Thermal Proteome Profiling and Meltome Analysis of a Thermophilic Bacterial Strain, Geobacillus thermoleovorans ARTRW1: Toward Industrial Applications","Thermophilic microorganisms that thrive in extreme environments are of great importance because they express heat-resistant enzymes with the potential to serve as biocatalysts in industrial applications. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) is a multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry method for analyses of structural information and melting behavior of thousands of proteins, simultaneously determining the thermal denaturation profiles of each protein. We report, in this study, TPP applied to a thermophilic bacterial proteome, a recently isolated strain of Geobacillus thermoleovorans named as ARTRW1. The proteome was investigated in terms of thermostable enzymes that are relevant to industrial applications. In this study, we present the thermostability profiles of its 868 proteins. The majority of G. Thermoleovorans proteome was observed to melt between 62.5°C and 72°C, with melting point (Tm) mean value of 68.1°C ± 6.6°C. Unfolding characteristics of several enzymes, including amylase, protease, and lipase, were demonstrated which are highly informative in terms of their applicability to specific industrial processes. A significant correlation was observed between protein melting temperature and the structural features such as molecular weight and abundance, whereas correlations were modest or weak in relation to the α-helix structure percentages. Taken together, we demonstrated a system-wide melting profile analysis of a thermal proteome and listed proteins with elevated Tm values that are highly promising for applications in medicine, food engineering, and cosmetics in particular. The extracted Tm values were found similar to those obtained by biophysical methods applied to purified proteins. TPP analysis has significant industrial and biomedical potentials to accelerate thermophilic enzyme research and innovation.","Oztug, Merve;Kilinc, Evren;Akgoz, Muslum;Karaguler, Nevin Gul",Journal,OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology,2020-12-01,Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydınlar Üniversitesi;TÜBİTAK Ulusal Metroloji Enstitüsü;İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi,bioengineering ;  Geobacillus thermoleovorans ARTRW1 ;  mass spectrometry ;  meltome ;  proteomics ;  thermal proteome profiling
Design of product–service systems: Toward an updated discourse,"The engineering rationale, composed of established logic for the design and development of products, has been confronted by a shift to a circular economy. Digitalization (e.g., Industry 4.0) enables transformation, but it also increases relational complexities in scope and number. In Product–Service Systems (PSSs), the combination of manufactured goods and services should be delivered in new business models based on value-adding digital assistance. From a systems science view, such combinations cannot be managed by the same approach as if they were one uniform system; rather, it is an interdependent mix of technical, social, and digital designs. This paper initializes an updated conceptual discourse on PSSs and provides a reflection on the expected challenges in the transformation from linear to circular models. For example, the role of systems thinking to guide early design stages is discussed and the importance of processes for creating shared visions at different systems levels is suggested to be addressed in future research. The intention is to formulate thoughts about radical cognitive changes in order to realize the PSS paradigm.","Lugnet, Johan;Ericson, Åsa;Larsson, Tobias",Journal,Systems,2020-12-01,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola;Luleå University of Technology,Circular economy ;  Digital services ;  Digitalization ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation ;  Product–service systems ;  Socio-technical systems

Smart roads: An overview of what future mobility will look like,"Transport engineering has recently undergone several significant changes and innovations, one of which is the appearance and spread of autonomous vehicles; with this technology becoming more common and ordinary by the day, it is now necessary to implement some systems and contexts to facilitate autonomous vehicle operations. Consequently, a different perspective is now arising when dealing with road infrastructures, aiming to simplify and improve efficiency and maintenance of the existing roads, increase the life cycle of newly built ones, and minimize the economic and financial impact at the same time. Roadway pavements are one of the primary factors affecting vehicle operations; over time, this distinctive aspect has gone through various mechanical and physical changes due to the adoption of new materials or design methods. Consequently, to the spread of autonomous vehicles, scientific research has begun to study and develop systems to make road pavements and platforms not exclusively aimed at bearing loads, but rather at considering them as a means of communication and information exchange, if not even as a source of energy. This new approach introduces the so-called “Smart Roads,” i.e., road infrastructures capable of communicating with vehicles and self-monitoring fundamental perspectives concerning driverless vehicles and the roadway platform life cycle. This paper examines the characteristics of Smart Roads, considering their broad field of application and their potential advantages and drawbacks. This paper also pursues the objective of describing the global vision, the possible future direction of these innovations concerning the automotive and transport industries, and a particular focus on infrastructures and roadways.","Trubia, Salvatore;Severino, Alessandro;Curto, Salvatore;Arena, Fabio;Pau, Giovanni",Journal,Infrastructures,2020-12-01,"Università degli Studi di Enna ""Kore"";Università degli Studi di Catania",Autonomous vehicles ;  Intelligent transportation system ;  Mobility ;  Pavement ;  Smart road
The influence of machine learning-based knowledge management model on enterprise organizational capability innovation and industrial development,"The aims are to explore the construction of the knowledge management model for engineering cost consulting enterprises, and to expand the application of data mining techniques and machine learning methods in constructing knowledge management model. Through a questionnaire survey, the construction of the knowledge management model of construction-related enterprises and engineering cost consulting enterprises is discussed. First, through the analysis and discussion of ontology-based data mining (OBDM) algorithm and association analysis (Apriori) algorithm, a data mining algorithm (ML-AR algorithm) on account of ontology-based multilayer association and machine learning is proposed. The performance of the various algorithms is compared and analyzed. Second, based on the knowledge management level, analysis and statistics are conducted on the levels of knowledge acquisition, sharing, storage, and innovation. Finally, according to the foregoing, the knowledge management model based on engineering cost consulting enterprises is built and analyzed. The results show that the reliability coefficient of this questionnaire is above 0.8, and the average extracted value is above 0.7, verifying excellent reliability and validity. The efficiency of the ML-AR algorithm at both the number of transactions and the support level is better than the other two algorithms, which is expected to be applied to the enterprise knowledge management model. There is a positive correlation between each level of knowledge management; among them, the positive correlation between knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing is the strongest. The enterprise knowledge management model has a positive impact on promoting organizational innovation capability and industrial development. The research work provides a direction for the development of enterprise knowledge management and the improvement of innovation ability.","Zhou, Zhigang;Liu, Yanyan;Yu, Hao;Ren, Lihua",Journal,PLoS ONE,2020-12-01,Shandong University of Science and Technology;Linyi City Lanshan Economic and Information Technology Bureau,

The ironies of autonomy,"Current research on autonomous vehicles tends to focus on making them safer through policies to manage innovation, and integration into existing urban and mobility systems. This article takes social, cultural and philosophical approaches instead, critically appraising how human subjectivity, and human-machine relations, are shifting and changing through the application of big data and algorithmic techniques to the automation of driving. 20th century approaches to safety engineering and automation—be it in an airplane or automobile-have sought to either erase the human because she is error-prone and inefficient; have design compensate for the limits of the human; or at least mould human into machine through an assessment of the complementary competencies of each. The ‘irony of automation’ is an observation of the tensions emerging therein; for example, that the computationally superior and efficient machine actually needs human operators to ensure that it is working effectively; and that the human is inevitably held accountable for errors, even if the machine is more efficient or accurate. With the emergence of the autonomous vehicle (AV) as simultaneously AI/ ‘robot’, and automobile, and distributed, big data infrastructural platform, these beliefs about human and machine are dissolving into what I refer to as the ironies of autonomy. For example, recent AV crashes suggest that human operators cannot intervene in the statistical operations underlying automated decision-making in machine learning, but are expected to. And that while AVs promise ‘freedom’, human time, work, and bodies are threaded into, and surveilled by, data infrastructures, and re-shaped by its information flows. The shift that occurs is that human subjectivity has socio-economic and legal implications and is not about fixed attributes of human and machine fitting into each other. Drawing on Postphenomenological concepts of embodiment and instrumentation, and excerpts from fieldwork, this article argues that the emergence of AVs in society prompts a rethinking of the multiple relationalities that constitute humanity through machines.","Ganesh, Maya Indira",Journal,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,2020-12-01,Leuphana Universität Lüneburg,
Interdisciplinary development of a standardized introduction to gene drives for lay audiences,"Background: While there is wide consensus that the public should be consulted about emerging technology early in development, it is difficult to elicit public opinion about innovations unfamiliar to lay audiences. We sought public input on a program of research on genetic engineering to control mosquito vectors of disease that is led by scientists at the University of California and funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In preparation for this effort, we developed a series of narrated slideshows to prompt responses to the development of gene drive mosquito control strategies among lay people. We describe the development and content of these slideshows and evaluate their ability to elicit discussions among focus group participants. Methods: In developing these materials, we used an iterative process involving input from experts in molecular genetics and vector control. Topics were chosen for their relevance to the goals of the scientists leading the program of research. Significant time was devoted to crafting explanations that would be accessible to uninitiated members of the public but still represent the science accurately. Through qualitative analysis of focus group discussions prompted by the slideshows, we evaluated the success of these slideshows in imparting clear technical information sufficient to inform lay discussion. Results: The collaboration resulted in a series of four narrated slideshows that were used to anchor discussions in online focus groups. Many participants described the slideshows as interesting and informative, while also raising concerns and possible risks that were not directly addressed in the material presented. Open-ended comments from participants suggest that the slideshows inspired critical questions, reflection, and conversation about genetically engineered and gene drive mosquitoes. After the final and most technically complex slideshow, however, some respondents made comments suggestive of overwhelm or confusion. Conclusion: Our narrated slideshows prompted engaged conversations about genetically engineered mosquitoes among members of the public who were generally naïve to this technology. Narrated slideshows may serve as viable and useful tools for future public engagement on other controversial emerging medical and public health technologies.","Schairer, Cynthia E.;Triplett, Cynthia;Buchman, Anna;Akbari, Omar S.;Bloss, Cinnamon S.",Journal,BMC Medical Research Methodology,2020-12-01,"Department of Family Medicine;Qualcomm Institute;Department of Cell and Developmental Biology;University of California, San Diego",Community and stakeholder engagement ;  Gene drives ;  Genetic engineering ;  Public health ;  Science communication ;  Vector control
"The new wealth of nations: How STEM fields generate the prosperity and inequality of individuals, companies, and countries","Fundamental research in physics has long been a prerequisite for computer scientists and engineers to design innovative products, such as laptops and cell phones. Technological innovations and fundamental research are both part of the so-called STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), which are known to substantially contribute to economic growth. However, the questions still remain: how much contribution do these fields make to both wealth accumulation and inequality at different levels of analysis? First, analyzing the lists of world's wealthiest individuals, the Zipf plot analysis demonstrates that STEM billionaires contribute more to wealth inequality than their non-STEM counterparts. Analyzing the companies in the S&P500, we find that STEM firms contribute more to wealth inequality and have larger growth rates on average than the non-STEM firms. Finally, we show that the more STEM graduates in a country, the larger its GDP growth rate. In combination, we demonstrate that STEM is a fractal mechanism that drives wealth accumulation—and the wealth inequality— at different scales of economy—from individual wealth to firm valuation to country GDP.","Podobnik, Boris;Christopher Crawford, G.;Lichtenstein, Benyamin;Lipic, Tomislav;Wild, Dorian;Zhang, Xin;Stanley, H.   Eugene",Journal,"Chaos, Solitons and Fractals",2020-12-01,"Luxembourg School of Business;Faculty of Civil Engineering, University of Rijeka;Zagreb School of Economics and Management;Shanghai Maritime University;University of Massachusetts Boston;Boston University;Institut Ruđer Bošković;Rutgers University-Newark",
Fostering product innovations in software startups through freelancer supported requirement engineering,"This research paper explores the involvement of freelancers in requirement engineering activities to continuously innovating the value propositions and utilizing their expertise in various requirement engineering tasks. This paper reports the case study conducted with the startups that involve freelancers for the requirement engineering activities. The findings are then compared with the literature to explore the freelancer supported requirement engineering domain. Results indicate that the freelancers could help innovate value proposition by providing different perspectives of the global segments and also expertise in executing requirement engineering activities. The freelancers have varying levels of involvement in requirement engineering activities depending on on startup contexts and is highly challenged by various inhibitors. The inhibitors include difficulty to select freelancers optimally, ensuring their long term association for continuous rework arising because of continuous learnings in the market, building trust, mechanism to integrate their perspective, establishing communication, negotiations and strategic pricings. However, there is a need to optimally establish the freelancer involvement from beginning of the startup life cycle with a promise for long term benefits in exchange for their trustworthy and accurate perspectives, which is harder to get by involving crowds of customers due to resource limitations. Further research is required to investigate how freelancers could represent the samples of globally distributed customer segments as input source of information on one side and on another side become startup team representatives to establish direct interactions with global customer segments.","Gupta, Varun;Fernandez-Crehuet, Jose Maria;Hanne, Thomas;Telesko, Rainer",Journal,Results in Engineering,2020-12-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz FHNW,Co-creation ;  Freelancer ;  Open innovation ;  Requirement engineering ;  Software engineering ;  Software startups ;  Value proposition innovation
Mostla for engineering education: part 2 emerging technologies,"Emerging Technologies (ET), consisting of advanced digital devices, tools, and innovations, potentiate the acceleration of changes and the improvements of many educational processes. In this research, the services offered by centers devoted to promoting the use of ET in their communities are discussed and compared. Mostla, a space devoted to exploring and working with the ETs that have the highest potential to create better educational experiences, is included in the analysis. Also, eight emerging technologies that, according to Mostla, are expected to impact education significantly are analyzed, and some examples of their practical uses are presented. Based on the experience, analysis, and review performed, we note that it is necessary to design memorable learning experiences with ETs to accomplish the development of competencies such as critical thinking, research, creativity, and innovative capacity. The acquisition of these competencies allows our future professionals to face the challenges of Industry 4.0 and confront the principal problems of society skilfully. Therefore, the development of educational strategies supported by ET is necessary to stimulate curiosity. This curiosity allows students to acquire knowledge and retain it better. Universities must keep in view that social and educational innovations should be developed collaboratively and supported by emerging technologies. They must challenge students to solve real problems; this is what develops and strengthens their competencies. Finally, universities must open their doors to society in general and offer their ET services to other public or private institutions, making these technologies accessible so that national education can be improved.","Hidrogo, Irving;Zambrano, David;Hernandez-de-Menendez, Marcela;Morales-Menendez, Ruben",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2020-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational innovation ;  Educational technology ;  Emerging technology ;  Higher education
"Smart Electromobility: Interactive ecosystem of research, innovation, engineering, and entrepreneurship","Abstract: The development of large cities and the increased demand for mobility in them has required improvements and changes in the way we transport ourselves. This change has generated new urban mobility environments, some more efficient than others, depending on the country, culture, and society in which it develops.

Sharpening gene editing toolbox in Arabidopsis for plants,"Arabidopsis thaliana is considered as an indispensable model system across various disciplines of modern plant biology. The short life cycle, well developed classical genetics, small genome, and a plethora of distinguishable phenotypic features make it the most preferred plant system for researchers globally. Owing to these advantages, it is highly explored to study plant-pathogen interaction, comparative omics, evolutionary plasticity, epigenetics, and recently being used for development of precision genome editing tools for plants. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein system, discovered as a part of bacterial immune system is widely used as a molecular tool for targeted genome engineering. This tool superseded two well-established genome editing platforms, zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases. Here, we have discussed CRISPR/Cas based gene editing toolbox designed, sharpened and used in A. thaliana. This review focuses on pioneering innovations in CRISPR/Cas technology and subsequent application of these tools in A. thaliana which is leading to wider application of CRISPR toolbox for basic and translational research in other plants.","Arya, Sagar S.;Mahto, Binod K.;Ramkumar, Thakku R.;Lenka, Sangram K.",Journal,Journal of Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology,2020-12-01,The Energy and Resources Institute India;University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences,Arabidopsis thaliana ;  base editing ;  CRISPR-TSKO ;  CRISPR/Cas ;  Genome editing
A comprehensive statistical assessment framework to measure the impact of immersive environments on skills of higher education students: a case study,"Universities are facing the challenge of updating the contents of their current study programs and adopting novel education strategies in order to prepare the next generation of engineers who can adapt to the highly competitive labor market of Industry 4.0. This new industrial era requires skills and competencies in state-of-the-art technologies which are constantly and rapidly evolving. This research presents an alternative approach to the current teaching–learning methodologies, focusing on the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as an educational tool and its contribution towards the upcoming industrial challenges, via what we call interactive education for future engineers (IE). Our IE strategy is supported by interactive simulation using the latest VR technologies, currently being Facebook’s Oculus Rift hardware and software. With this approach, we seek to enhance the “know-how” of our students by training them in the practical skills they will need for the technological innovations of the evolving labor market. Our work has been implemented in engineering courses at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, aligning with the university’s educational model “TEC21” which aims to increase the students’ self-learning capabilities using interactive teaching and hands-on practical work to develop new abilities and competencies in an expanded variety of domains. So far, our results have shown that the use of IE not only improves the way professors teach, but reinforces skills, competencies, enhances creativity and strongly motivates the students in their daily learning.","López Ríos, Olga;Lechuga López, Leopoldo Julian;Lechuga López, Gisela",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2020-12-01,Université Paris Cité;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Assessment ;  Competencies ;  Higher education ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Interactive education ;  Virtual Reality

A failure innovation strategy of acquisition during excess capacity: financial approach based on case study at the state-owned cement holding PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbk,"This research aims to prove that wide gap between theories and practices in terms of acquisition that should be positive to drive performance of the acquirer but the distinctive things happened in Indonesia was not according to the preliminary design planned. The failure acquisition of Semen Indonesia (SMGR) over Holcim Indonesia (SMCB) in 2018 due to what had been done during excessive capacity should be priority to strengthen interns than acting to intervene outside. This study elaborates a case study, mixed-type research, and presents by explanatory design. It comes to find that acquisition during excess capacity is a failure step taken by PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. Many corporate steps are taken to a polish performance of the SMCB-acquiree but so far failing and endangering the whole performance. To compensate and withhold the climb-down due to oversupply, the management engineering of market intervention had been done. Big portions of market’s regions previously belong to SMGR had been handed over to SMCB to help increase its performance. The forced switching to polishing SBI’s performance is hurting all of the holding’s members. SBI enjoys improving market but at the same time endangers the performance of the whole groups of holdings. This research contributes to updating the present development of recent corporate actions of popular merger and acquisition are both previously labeled as the best corporate strategy for decades.","Subiyanto, Effnu",Journal,Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship,2020-12-01,Widya Mandala Surabaya Catholic University,Acquisition ;  Cement market ;  Corporate strategy ;  Excess capacity ;  Failure innovation ;  Financial performance ;  PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbk (SMGR) ;  PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia (SBI) ;  PT Holcim Indonesia Tbk (SMCB)

Cyber-Physical Labs to enhance engineering training and education,"The current market requirements of manufacturing sectors are boosting the development and adoption of digital tools increasingly every day. Training simulation software for automatic systems, process optimization, and system validation are a must-have for all production centers to do faster machine integrations and more rapid prototyping to find advantages over their competitors. The new form of system validation is known as virtual commissioning, which emulates a real industrial environment thanks to computer software, and it provides the user with a safe place to train before dealing with a problem in the real world. This technology represents an opportunity for specialized education where virtual commissioning could be used to equip control and automation laboratories in which students and trainees in automation can test, validate, and debug their control and automation strategies. Thus, the student learns by doing; the technology saves the training center money by not needing costly, industrial machinery to reinforce student understanding. The student’s practice becomes a regular habit. In our global economy, many developing nations whose primary economic activity is production feel these pressures, but their training laboratories are resource-poor and are commonly equipped with improvised homemade systems that do not represent what students will face in the real industrial environment. This article describes the creation process, capabilities, and scope of a set of new virtual commissioning elements within Cyber-Physical Laboratories (CPL). A CPL is a merger of physical laboratories equipped with real industrial controllers and virtual environments to emulate industrial processes which can be used for engineering training in automation, control, and robotics for the purpose of achieving low costs and effective use of laboratories. As in a physical system, in a Cyber-Physical Laboratory, devices are totally connected, all operating in their own spaces, real and virtual, and interacting with each other. This research paper also shows examples of in situ Cyber-Physical Laboratories and their capabilities, scope, usage, and contributions to student training.","Macías García, Manuel E.;Cortés Pérez, Aldo A.;Izaguirre Alegría, Alfredo R.",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2020-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Cyber-Physical Laboratories ;  Educational innovation ;  Engineering training ;  Interactive engineering ;  Virtual commissioning ;  Virtual reality
An artificial intelligence educational strategy for the digital transformation,"This paper presents a strategy of state-of-the-art review of artificial intelligence (AI) in education and a case study about preparing students to have the competencies and skills necessary for the current and future digital transformation to Industry 4.0. The goal is to support institutions of higher education to build curricula that help companies by providing them with qualified human capital to face the challenges of the twenty first century that have brought about the work environment now referred to as Industry 4.0 or the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The strategy consists of a business intelligence summary of AI trends and challenges of interest to academic institutions with an emphasis in intelligent human–computer communication and interactive design and manufacturing for educating engineers for the future enterprise. We also present a case study that builds upon 35 years of experience in offering AI academic programs in the institution, Tecnologico de Monterrey (Tec) to educate future engineers and knowledge workers. The components of our case study comprise graduate and undergraduate courses, research, internships, innovation, internationalization initiatives, and entrepreneurship. In this period, more than 5200 students have been trained at the Ph.D., MSc, and undergraduate levels with intense use of technology in the AI field. Now, the curricula of the university have been overhauled and renewed according to a new educative model known as the Tec21 Educative Model. The course offerings under this model are structured with challenge-based-learning, physical and virtual practice labs, and mixed teaching methodologies to accommodate the digital transformation and demands of Industry 4.0 to educate and prepare the new generation of students. The strategy and case study presented may be useful guides for other higher education institutions implementing AI academic programs to educate students demanded by the companies of the XXI century.","Cantú-Ortiz, Francisco J.;Galeano Sánchez, Nathalíe;Garrido, Leonardo;Terashima-Marin, Hugo;Brena, Ramón F.",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2020-12-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Artificial intelligence ;  Digital transformation ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Interactive engineering in education ;  Tec21 educational model
Use of laboratory scenarios as a strategy to develop smart factories for Industry 4.0,"The intense pressures in the industrial environment and the academic field to adopt technological tools and concepts like product lifecycle management, digital factories, automation, the internet of things, process innovation, and bridges between real and virtual worlds have resulted in necessary new process innovations. All these are encompassed in the term “Industry 4.0.” The evolution of teaching methods toward flipped classrooms, software advancements to support engineering topics, online studies, new skill requirements in Industry, and easy, affordable access to education have pushed universities to find novel ways to meet current conditions and prepare for future challenges. The need to link academic knowledge with Industry led us in our research project to create a methodology for the development and implementation of virtual and hybrid scenarios by using highly integrated, digital manufacturing tools as a teaching platform to explain topics like the automation of programmable logic controllers, robotics, manufacturing, and 3D virtual commissioning. The methodology was implemented successfully in a manufacturing system integration laboratory at Tecnologico de Monterrey by using virtual and hybrid commissioning scenarios as a strategy to develop smart factories.","Hincapié, Mauricio;Valdez, Alberto;Güemes-Castorena, David;Ramírez, Miguel",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2020-12-01,Corporación Universitaria Americana;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Digital factory ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Teaching platform ;  Virtual commissioning
Learning from nature – Biomimicry innovation to support infrastructure sustainability and resilience,"Regenerative development calls for built environment design, construction and operation approaches that do not degrade social and ecological systems but actively regenerate them, with net positive performance outcomes. Within infrastructure, existing industry approaches focus on improving sustainability and resilience through progressive reductions in negative impact. To shift beyond damage reduction towards regenerative performance, it will be necessary to harness new and innovative technologies, design and engineering approaches as they emerge. The field of biomimicry looks to biology and ecology to identify natural models that can inspire design and engineering solutions. Despite increasing biomimicry research, enquiry into infrastructure opportunities for biomimicry has been limited, and the potential for biomimicry to support regenerative performance in infrastructure has not been explored. This paper uses a systematic literature review to identify applications of biomimicry in built environment, with a focus on the potential for infrastructure applications. The paper identifies a need for further investigation into ‘system-level’ biomimicry opportunities; for clearer articulation of sustainability and resilience benefits; and for greater alignment with broader industry and global trends. The paper is relevant for practitioners, academics and government agencies looking to leverage emerging technologies and innovation to achieve project and organisational sustainability, resilience and regenerative performance objectives.","Hayes, Samantha;Desha, Cheryl;Baumeister, Dayna",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2020-12-01,Griffith University;Arizona State University,Biomimicry ;  Infrastructure ;  Innovation ;  Regenerative ;  Resilience ;  Sustainability
Innovations in CAZyme gene diversity and its modification for biorefinery applications,"For sustainable growth, concept of biorefineries as recourse to the “fossil derived” energy source is important. Here, the Carbohydrate Active enZymes (CAZymes) play decisive role in generation of biofuels and related sugar-based products utilizing lignocellulose as a carbon source. Given their industrial significance, extensive studies on the evolution of CAZymes have been carried out. Various bacterial and fungal organisms have been scrutinized for the development of CAZymes, where advance techniques for strain enhancement such as CRISPR and analysis of specific expression systems have been deployed. Specific Omic-based techniques along with protein engineering have been adopted to unearth novel CAZymes and improve applicability of existing enzymes. In-Silico computational research and functional annotation of new CAZymes to synergy experiments are being carried out to devise cocktails of enzymes for use in biorefineries. Thus, with the establishment of these technologies, increased diversity of CAZymes with broad span of functions and applications is seen.","Chettri, Dixita;Verma, Ashwani Kumar;Verma, Anil Kumar",Journal,Biotechnology Reports,2020-12-01,Sikkim University,Biorefineries ;  CAZyme ;  Cell factories ;  Consolidated bioprocessing ;  Omics
Technology innovation system analysis of decarbonisation options in the EU steel industry,"Decarbonisation of the iron and steel (I&S) industry is crucial in the efforts to meet the EU GHG emission reduction objectives in 2030 … 2050. Promoting decarbonisation in this sector will necessarily require the identification, development, and diffusion of breakthrough technologies for I&S production. This paper uses an approach inspired by the Technology Innovation System (TIS) to analyse the development of technology in the EU I&S industry and identify potential avenues of its decarbonisation. We have described key elements of the TIS, analyse the functioning of these elements and their interactions in a more general context of innovation dynamics and policy design; The focus has been put on the role of actors and the identification of the main specific blocking and inducement mechanism in the TIS to better explain its functioning. Risks and uncertainties have also been discussed. We argue that deep decarbonisation in the I&S industry is feasible but its TIS requires firm support, mostly political, to finance intensive R&D and reduce the business risk. To this end, all actors shall support more effectively the invention and implementation of new radical production technologies. The recommendations are mostly addressed to politicians although stressing the importance of collaboration of all actors.","Skoczkowski, Tadeusz;Verdolini, Elena;Bielecki, Sławomir;Kochański, Max;Korczak, Katarzyna;Węglarz, Arkadiusz",Journal,Energy,2020-12-01,"Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, Milan;Politechnika Warszawska",Decarbonisation of industry ;  Iron and steel industry ;  Low-carbon technologies ;  Technology innovative system
Controlling wave propagation in one-dimensional structures through topology optimization,"Research on the control of wave propagation has received continuous attention due to its potentially rewarding applications in the past decades, and numerous methods have been developed for controlling wave propagation in certain materials or structures. Despite previous work has made many innovations in controlling wave propagation, they are limited to the research from a band gap perspective. Herein, this paper presents a gradient-based multi-functional topology optimization for controlling wave propagation in a one-dimensional (1D) structure, which can realize the control of wave propagation from two aspects: band gap and wave propagation speed. To illustrate the method, three case studies are investigated to obtain the following: (1) increasing the band gap width, (2) controlling the wave propagation at target speed, and (3) limiting the propagation of low-frequency waves. By evaluating the results of three case studies, the effectiveness of the proposed topology optimization method is demonstrated. More importantly, the control of wave propagation in the low-frequency range in Case III lends new insight into the vibration isolation structure in engineering applications.","Liu, Wenlong;Yoon, Gil Ho;Yi, Bing;Choi, Hyunggyu;Yang, Yue",Journal,Computers and Structures,2020-12-01,Hanyang University;Central South University,1D structure ;  Band gap ;  Topology optimization ;  Wave propagation ;  Wave propagation speed
Sustainable closed-loop supply chain network for an integrated water supply and wastewater collection system under uncertainty,"Today, an increase in the drought and water shortage all around the world is a challengeable threat for different governments and international committees. Water supply chain aims to manage the water consumption and to control the water shortage. Contrary to most of previous studies focused on the forward directions of the water supply chain, this paper also considers the reverse logistics known as a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC). Hence, an integrated Water Supply and Wastewater Collection System (WSWCS) under uncertainty is proposed. Furthermore, regarding the trend of sustainable development, the environmental dimensions and social benefits of the integrated WSWCS are contributed. To meet the standards of the sustainable development in developing countries, a case study in Iran is applied to a novel multi-objective stochastic optimization model based on triple bottom lines of sustainability. Having already been employed to similar optimization problems, the Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) has been never applied in this research area. Another innovation of this study is to introduce an improved multi-objective SEO to solve this complicated model. Eventually, with regards to an extensive comparison contributing to the Pareto-based metrics and different sensitivities, some managerial implications are concluded as the main findings.","Fathollahi-Fard, Amir Mohammad;Ahmadi, Abbas;Al-e-Hashem, S.

Food colloids binary and ternary nanocomplexes: Innovations and discoveries,"Designing nanoparticles that are suitable for fortification of bioactive compounds in foods has always been a challenging task among colloidal scientists and nanotechnologists. To achieve this goal, there are several research objectives in general, including but not limited to: (1) preparation of nanoparticles from edible biomaterials without using organic solvents and toxic chemicals to ensure food-grade status; (2) improving colloidal stability of these nanoparticles under various harsh conditions including food processing (heating, high pressure, drying, etc.) and gastrointestinal environment (low pH, bile salt and digestive enzymes); (3) studying interactions between bioactive compounds and nanoparticles for optimal encapsulation; (4) understanding biological fate of these nanoparticles upon oral administration. Although a variety of nanoparticles may be fabricated from individual biomaterial, such as protein, polysaccharide and lipid, complex or hybrid nanoparticles made with two or more biomaterials have received increasing attention in recent 5-10 years due to many advantageous structural features and physicochemical properties. The major focus of my research group, i.e., the Nanotechnology and Biodelivery Laboratory at the University of Connecticut (CT, USA), is to apply materials science and engineering principles to understand physical and chemical interactions among various natural biomaterials at the nanoscale and design novel nanocarriers for delivery of various bioactive compounds in functional foods. In this Biointerface Perspective, I will first introduce the fundamental principles on the preparation of nanoparticles made from food colloids, and then I will share in detail the critical reflection on my research journey into the development of innovative colloidal binary and ternary nanocomplexes.","Luo, Yangchao",Journal,Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces,2020-12-01,University of Connecticut,Biopolymer coating ;  Colloidal stability ;  Encapsulation ;  Oral delivery ;  Protein-polysaccharide nanocomplexes ;  Solid lipid nanoparticles
How to design and construct an innovative frugal product? An empirical examination of a frugal new product development process,"A plethora of research has examined the concept of frugal innovation from an ex-post perspective, by analyzing the finished product and its distinctive features, business models and ecosystems, as well as their impact. While this approach has led to valuable insights and has been important to further develop the research field, it provides little information on how to develop frugal innovations. This paper addresses this issue and contributes with an empirical ex-ante examination. This is done by analyzing the design and construction of a frugal technical equipment for Brazilian waste pickers. This newly developed cart was examined to assess its frugality and to derive success factors of the process. Frugality was achieved by decreased product costs of 60%, increased income of the waste pickers by 20% and improved social acceptance of the new equipment. Besides delivering a step-by-step manual on how frugal innovations can be developed, the study contrasted frugal New Product Development (fNPD) with conventional NPD, reconfirmed critical success factors of fNPD from prior research and extends these findings by three aspects: To consider both need identification and need integration in fNPD; To work with tools that allow the frugal reconfiguration of systems on a deep functional level to uncouple fNPD from traditional product notions, and to check cultural impact and societal desirability when organizing the innovation activities. The paper offers theoretical contributions to the research field of frugal innovation by enhancing its understanding as a process and its critical success factors for fNPD.","Brem, Alexander;Wimschneider, Christine;de Aguiar Dutra, Ana Regina;Vieira Cubas, Anelise Leal;Ribeiro, Rodney Duarte",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-12-01,Syddansk Universitet;Universität Stuttgart;Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Brazil ;  Design process ;  Ergonomics ;  Frugal engineering ;  Frugal innovation ;  Product development ;  Waste picker
Can direct environmental regulation promote green technology innovation in heavily polluting industries? Evidence from Chinese listed companies,"Faced with the dual constraints of resources and the environment, green technology innovation has become an important measure to solve the development challenges of heavily polluting industries. From the perspective of institutional regulation theory, this paper studies the impact of direct environmental regulation on green technology innovation in Chinese listed companies of heavily polluting industries by using the Panel Poisson fixed effect model. Besides, the heterogeneity of ownership and industry is discussed. The results indicate that direct environmental regulations exert a strong and significant incentive effect on green technology innovations in heavily polluting industries. Regarding the heterogeneity of enterprise ownership, direct environmental regulations were found to be more significant to the green technology innovations of state-owned listed companies in such industries. Considering industry heterogeneity, compared with labor-resource intensive industries, direct environmental regulation can effectively encourage green technology innovations in technology-capital intensive industries. This study provides a policy basis for promoting environmental governance and green technology innovation in China's heavily polluting industries.","Cai, Xiang;Zhu, Bangzhu;Zhang, Haijing;Li, Liang;Xie, Meiying",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2020-12-01,Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology;Guilin University of Electronic Technology,Direct environmental regulation ;  Enterprise ownership heterogeneity ;  Green technology innovation ;  Heavily polluting industry ;  Industry factor density heterogeneity ;  Marginal effect
Exploring the domain of open innovation: Bibliometric and content analyses,"Open innovation (OI) has received considerable attention since its introduction and has positive and negative characteristics. To offer an overview for future research, this article produces a comprehensive review by combining bibliometric analysis and content analysis. A total of 4463 journal articles and 3061 conference papers on OI were extracted from Web of Science (WOS). The synthesized networks were constructed and visualized through CiteSpace software to aid analytical studies. After the descriptive bibliometric analysis of all publications, a content analysis of 213 articles was carried out to develop the conceptual framework of OI. The results reveal that OI still confined itself to limited disciplines and innovation-centric journals but is beginning to put more effort into becoming a more open ecosystem by influencing other disciplines. We also find some gaps in the extant research and provide some research directions in the OI field: empirical studies in various contexts could enrich the external validity of OI, other theoretical perspectives could provide novel views, and OI is on its way to becoming mature but has a long way to go.","Gao, Hui;Ding, Xiu Hao;Wu, Suming",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-12-01,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Bibliometric analysis ;  CiteSpace ;  Content analysis ;  Open innovation (OI) ;  Visualization
"Knowledge, routines, and cognitive effects in nonmarket selection environments: An examination of the regulatory review of innovations","Research summary: Evolutionary models of technological evolution highlight the cognitive underpinning of routines that shape organizational adaptation. However, research thus far has overlooked the possibility that cognitive effects might also shape selection. This study redresses this imbalance by examining nonmarket selection, focusing for that purpose on the regulatory review of innovations. It proposes that the more knowledge about different technologies is available to regulatory agencies, the more evaluation incongruities they face when evaluating a focal innovation, which increases the time for its regulatory review. It also proposes that this effect is attenuated when regulatory agencies are more frequently confronted with innovations drawing on new technologies. By elucidating cognitive effects that shape nonmarket selection, this study has theoretical implications for research on technological evolution and organizational learning. Managerial summary: This study highlights influences on the regulatory review of innovations, an important hurdle that firms in many industries must clear before launching innovations into the market. The regulatory review of an innovation is largely thought to be facilitated by knowledge about that innovation and the technology on which it builds. But, this view overlooks that knowledge about other technologies that exist in the same domain of an innovation can create evaluation incongruities that hamper its regulatory review, extending its regulatory review time. This effect is attenuated when regulatory agencies are more frequently confronted with new technologies, which makes them more aware of distinctions that different technologies entail, thus reducing incongruities in the review of subsequent innovations.","Polidoro, Francisco",Journal,Strategic Management Journal,2020-12-01,McCombs School of Business,evaluation routines ;  nonmarket selection ;  organizational cognition ;  organizational learning ;  technological evolution
A systematic approach to assess the environmental impact of emerging technologies: A case study for the GHG footprint of CIGS solar photovoltaic laminate,"Estimating the environmental impact of emerging technologies at different stages of development is uncertain but necessary to guide investment, research, and development. Here, we propose a systematic procedure to assess the future impacts of emerging technologies. In the technology development stage (technology readiness level < 9), the recommended experience mechanisms to take into account are (a) process changes, (b) size scaling effects, and (c) process synergies. These developments can be based on previous experience with similar technologies or quantified through regression or engineering dimension calculations. In the industrial development phase, (d) industrial learning, based on experience curves or roadmaps, and (e) external developments should be included. External developments, such as changes in the electricity mix can be included with information from integrated assessment models. We show the applicability of our approach with the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint evaluation for the production of copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) photovoltaic laminate. We found that the GHG footprint per kilowatt peak of produced CIGS laminate is expected to decrease by 83% going from pilot to mature industrial scale production with the largest decrease being due to expected process changes. The feasibility of applying our approach in practice would greatly benefit from the development of a database containing information on size scaling and experience rates for a wide variety of materials, products, and technologies.","van der Hulst, Mitchell K.;Huijbregts, Mark A.J.;van Loon, Niels;Theelen, Mirjam;Kootstra, Lucinda;Bergesen, Joseph D.;Hauck, Mara",Journal,Journal of Industrial Ecology,2020-12-01,"University of California, Santa Barbara;Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek- TNO;Radboud Universiteit",environmental experience curve ;  ex ante ;  industrial ecology ;  life cycle assessment (LCA) ;  prospective ;  technological innovation
Unpacking liabilities of newness and smallness in innovative start-ups: Investigating the differences in innovation performance between new and older small firms,"New ventures face both liabilities of newness and smallness, which may inhibit their innovation efforts and output. However, existing research has not clearly distinguished between the two liabilities, leaving it unclear how certain determinants differentially affect innovation performance in start-ups relative to older established small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, in this study we investigate the impact of R&D investments, external knowledge sourcing and public R&D subsidies on innovation effectiveness in new versus older small firms. Employing panel data from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey (CIS), we show that R&D investments have a lower contribution to the innovation performance of new ventures, compared to older small firms. In contrast, we find that external knowledge sourcing makes a higher contribution to the innovation performance of new compared to older small firms, but only in high-tech settings. However, we find no support for a differentiating effect of R&D subsidies in new versus established small firms. Effectively, our results highlight the limited effects of internal R&D investments and R&D policy instruments to promote the growth of innovative start-ups, while highlighting potential benefits of their openness to external sources of innovation. As such, these results have important implications for research, practices and policies that relate to innovation in new ventures and SMEs, while casting doubts on the effectiveness of some of the common strategy and policy instruments to stimulate performance in small innovative start-ups.","Gimenez-Fernandez, Elena M.;Sandulli, Francesco D.;Bogers, Marcel",Journal,Research Policy,2020-12-01,Institute for Business Innovation;Københavns Universitet;Universidad Complutense de Madrid,Entrepreneurship ;  External Knowledge Sourcing ;  Open innovation ;  Public policy ;  R&D resources ;  Smes ;  Spillovers

Toward new methods for optimization study in automotive industry including recent reduction techniques,"In the last years, the automotive engineering industry has been deeply influenced by the use of «machine learning» techniques for new design and innovation purposes. However, some specific engineering aspects like numerical optimization study still require the development of suitable high-performance machine learning approaches involving parametrized Finite Elements (FE) structural dynamics simulation data. Weight reduction on a car body is a crucial matter that improves the environmental impact and the cost of the product. The actual optimization process at Renault SA uses numerical Design of Experiments (DOE) to find the right thicknesses and materials for each part of the vehicle that guarantees a reduced weight while keeping a good behavior of the car body, identified by criteria or sensors on the body (maximum displacements, upper bounds of instantaneous acceleration …). The usual DOE methodology generally uses between 3 and 10 times the numbers of parameters of the study (which means, for a 30-parameters study, at least 90 simulations, with typically 10 h per run on a 140-core computer). During the last 2 years, Renault’s teams strived to develop a disruptive methodology to conduct optimization study. By ‘disruptive’, we mean to find a methodology that cuts the cost of computational effort by several orders of magnitude. It is acknowledged that standard DoEs need a number of simulations which is at least proportional to the dimension of the parameter space, leading generally to hundreds of fine simulations for real applications. Comparatively, a disruptive method should require about 10 fine evaluations only. This can be achieved by means of a combination of massive data knowledge extraction of FE crash simulation results and the help of parallel high-performance computing (HPC). For instance, in the recent study presented by Assou et al. (A car crash reduced order model with random forest. In: 4th International workshop on reduced basis, POD and PGD Model Reduction Techniques—MORTech 2017. 2017), it took 10 runs to find a solution of a 34-parameter problem that fulfils the specifications. In order to improve this method, we must extract more knowledge from the simulation results (correlations, spatio-temporal features, explanatory variables) and process them in order to find efficient ways to describe the car crash dynamics and link criteria/quantities of interest with some explanatory variables. One of the improvements made in the last months is the use of the so-called Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM, [Barrault et al.]) to identify the few time instants and spatial nodes of the FE-mesh (referred to as magic points) that “explain” the behavior of the body during the crash, within a dimensionality reduction approach. The EIM method replaces a former K-Means algorithm (Davies et al. in IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell, 1(2):224–227, 1979) which was processed online, for each ROM. Instead, the computation of EIM method is done offline, once for all, for each simulation. This new method allows us to compute a ROM quite faster, and to reduce the number of features that we use for the regression step (~ 100). The nonlinear regression step is achieved by a standard Random Forest (RF, [Breiman. Mach Learn 45:5–32, 2001]) algorithm. Another improvement of the method is the characterization of numerical features describing the shape of the body, at a nodal scale. The characteristics of orientation of the elements surrounding a mesh node must be taken into account to describe the behavior of the node during the crash. The actual method integrates some numerical features, computed from the orientation of the elements around each node, to explain the node behavior. The paper is organized as follows: The introduction states the scientific and industrial context of the research. Then, the ReCUR Method is detailed, and the recent improvements are highlighted. Results are presented and discussed before having some concluding remarks on this piece of work.","Gstalter, Etienne;Assou, Sonia;Tourbier, Yves;De Vuyst, Florian",Journal,Advanced Modeling and Simulation in Engineering Sciences,2020-12-01,LMAC – Laboratoire de Mathématiques Appliquées de Compiègne;Renault,Car crash simulation ;  CUR factorization ;  Empirical interpolation method (EIM) ;  Feature extraction ;  Nonintrusive data-driven model ;  Optimization ;  Random forest ;  Reduced-order modeling (ROM) ;  Regression ;  Shape (thickness)

Conceptualization of entrepreneurial university and pattern design of third generation university,"Background and aims: University of Entrepreneurship has an approach based on the relationship between industry and academia and is of great importance in Iran, which has a high number of educated and unemployed people. The growing population of the country, the demographic composition of the youth, the inability of the productive sectors to attract labor, the need to create job opportunities and factors such as these are the reasons why major policymakers are looking for solutions to solve this problem. Entrepreneurship is not an issue, because it plays an important role in the economic development of countries. The University of Entrepreneurship is a university where scientific entrepreneurship can create a force for economic growth and compete in global markets. The importance of moving towards the universities of the third millennium, according to the Ministry of Health, is considered as a contextual package for the development and innovation in medical sciences education based on the country's higher education program. A variety of disciplines such as counseling, education, research and development, technology transfer, ownership or participation in growth centers and scientific parks are trained, which means that it is an accepted responsibility for development. There are districts in these universities. In fact, entrepreneurial universities are organizationally managed in a way that they have the flexibility to meet socioeconomic needs and strategies to pay attention to environmental opportunities. In these universities, entrepreneurship has become part of the university's main strategy and the result is the development of entrepreneurial culture in the university. The aim of this study is to express the importance of the University of Entrepreneurship and to design the model of the third generation university in the Islamic Azad University of Medical Sciences in Iran. Methods: The present research is a fundamental research performed by mixed (qualitative-quantitative) research method. From a chronological point of view, this research is in the category of cross-sectional research. The study area is the Islamic Azad University of Iran. The statistical population of this study includes university experts in the field of entrepreneurship. Experts were selected based on in two characteristics of education and work experience. In this study, experts must have a PhD in Entrepreneurship with at least ten years of experience in education, counseling, and policy-making entrepreneurship-related fields, as well as scientific published papers. On this basis, 10 qualified people have participated in this study. First, thematic analysis was used to analyze specialized interviews. Then, using the fuzzy Delphi method, the identified factors are validated. MaxQDA software has been used to perform the content analysis. Fuzzy Delphi method calculations have been performed in Matlab software and structural-interpretive modeling has been performed in MicMac software. Data collection tools are interviews related to the qualitative part of research and standard Delphi questionnaire and structural-interpretive modeling. In the qualitative section, after conducting interviews with experts, the interview texts were coded in maxqda software and a number of indicators were extracted. Then, by compiling a fuzzy Delphi questionnaire and providing it to experts, the obtained indicators were validated and screened. In the prohibitions, using the ISM questionnaire, the main categories of research were leveled and effective and influential indicators were identified and the final research model was presented. Results: Based on the analysis of the interviews, the attraction of financial resources, innovation, technological entrepreneurship management and the entrepreneurial approach of professors were identified as the main categories of the third generation university. Based on the results of fuzzy Delphi method, 33 indicators were selected to measure the categories and these factors were obtained using interpretive-structural modeling technique, analysis and finally communication and sequence of indicators. According to the ranking done, the final model of the university of The third generation was designed at Islamic Azad University of Medical Sciences. Based on this model, entrepreneurial organizational culture is at the center of the model. This element is in dynamic interaction with attracting financial resources, innovation, technological entrepreneurship management and entrepreneurial approach of university professors. It should be noted that the quality of knowledge and the texture and content of the courses have a direct impact on the entrepreneurial approach of university professors. On the other hand, policies are effective in attracting university funding. Creating a science and technology park is an effective step in the development and enhancement of innovation, and ultimately a flexible organizational structure is essential for managing technological entrepreneurship. To achieve these ultimate goals, this model should emphasize on the general level of students' entrepreneurial skills and activities, students' theoretical skills, professors' entrepreneurial knowledge, culture of accepting new ideas and plans, realization of knowledge-based development and commercialization of science, and establishment of student companies. Indicators of the general level of skills and entrepreneurial activities of students, professors' entrepreneurial knowledge, the culture of accepting ideas and new plans, and the realization of knowledge-based development have high influence and low dependence. These variables are identified as independent variables. The two indicators of students' theoretical skills and lack of resistance to change and bureaucracy have high penetration power and dependency, and are considered to be the linked variables. The characteristics of a flexible organizational culture, the re-engineering of structures, the existence of an entrepreneurial incentive reward system, and the holding of training courses have little influence and dependence. These autonomous variables have little effect on the system. Other variables are highly dependent and have little penetrating power, so they are dependent variables. Also, the variables of structure movement towards science and technology park include satisfaction and growth of businesses, interactions of companies located in science and technology park, following new projects and registering them, innovation and creativity and culture in providing services and independence. The financial nature of the university and its self-government are the first level variables and as the most influential research variables. The variables of resistance to change and bureaucracy, the entrepreneurial experience of professors, the culture of supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, and the entrepreneurial approach of university presidents are the second level variables. The variables of absorption of the contributions of independent financial institutions, flexible organizational culture, reengineering of structures, pragmatic culture, and application of theories of the blue ocean are the third level variables. Variables for attracting government grants, adapting people's abilities to the assigned tasks, facilitating rules and regulations in order to protect entrepreneurship, selecting operational managers, creative and innovative, participatory and team nature of courses, holding training courses and course topics based on current needs and society The title of level four variable has been identified. Variables include support for student innovation, adaptation of students' ability to community needs, development of entrepreneurship and job creation by professors, the existence of an entrepreneurial incentive reward system, and entrepreneurial management strategies at the fifth level. Finally, the general level variables of students' entrepreneurial skills, students' theoretical skills, professors' entrepreneurial knowledge, culture of accepting ideas and new plans, realization of knowledge-based development and commercialization of science and establishment of knowledge-based companies are the most basic elements of model. Conclusion: Based on the achievements of this research, a flexible organizational structure is needed to implement the third generation university model. There should also be policy-making and academic policies to attract funding. Finally, while planning to improve the quality of people's knowledge, the texture and content of the courses, the creation of a science and technology park can be on the agenda.","Toshmali, Gholamreza;Alimohammadzadeh, Khalil;Maher, Ali;Hosseini, Seyed Mojtaba;Bahadori, Mohammadkarim",Journal,Iran Occupational Health,2020-11-28,"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences;Islamic Azad University, North Tehran Branch;Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences",Entrepreneurship ;  Student Employment ;  Third Generation University

Main factors assessing R&D labor intensity in high-tech enterprises,"The article deals with the development of methods and factors that determine the R&D labor intensity in high-tech enterprises. When assessing the labor intensity of R&D, a number of problems arise related to the distinctive characteristics of scientific work: originality, novelty and creative component. Such properties do not allow a comprehensive assessment of the complexity of research work without a detailed analysis of each stage of scientific work. The problem of rationing the costs of research labor at high-tech enterprises is expressed in the fact that labor includes both creative elements of activity and repetitive stages. However, the ratio between these components depends on the nature of research and development. The implementation of R&D is characterized by a high level of innovation, which makes it extremely difficult to identify the factors that are used to calculate data for building an optimization model.","Gosteva, O.

Innovation and technology transfer: A framework for clustering intermediation roles,"Intermediation has become a key role in the complex realm of technology transfer projects. In innovation and technology transfer literature the number of mentions on intermediaries and their involvement in the process have expanded, which has triggered a surge in specific literature on the intermediation roles. Several authors have not only proposed new intermediation roles but also complemented and clarified previous ones. In this research, a review of the literature is made, focused on the role and involvement of intermediaries in innovation and technology transfer, covering more than thirty years and referring to four major databases. Following the analysis and discussion of the findings, the results are synthetized in a conceptual framework proposal, clustering thirteen key intermediation roles. Each of these role clusters describes a set of responsibilities, functions and main intermediation activities. Findings show that when it comes to intermediation roles, literature is yet too fragmented and scattered, with little to no connections between the proposed roles. The main contribution of this paper is to contribute to and to provide a comprehensive overview of otherwise scattered and disperse knowledge about the intermediation role.","Soares, Joao;Romero, Fernando;Lopes Nunes, Manuel",Conference Proceeding,"2020 IEEE International Conference on Technology Management, Operations and Decisions, ICTMOD 2020",2020-11-24,Universidade do Minho,Innovation Intermediaries ;  Innovation Systems ;  Intermediation roles ;  Literature Review ;  Technology Transfer
Research on Function and Morphology of Future Power System with High Renewable Energy Penetration and its Evolution Driving Force,"Future power system has unique characteristics different from the former and present ones. In order to support main technical features of future power system especially for high renewable energy penetration, function and morphology of future power system are proposed. Considering the significant influence of technology development and value formation, the evolution driving force of future power system is proposed from the aspects of both technology innovation and value reconstruction. The evolution principle of power system is also presented. In Section I, change of outer surrounding of power system is investigated and requirement for future power system is discussed. In Section II, influence of technology innovation on future power system is presented. The key power transmission and distribution technology can be divided into four categories including traditional long-distance transmission technology, new type of substitutive long-distance transmission technology, transmission auxiliary technology suitable for large-scale renewable energy integration, power distribution and utility technology supporting distributed generation and micro-grid connection. For each category, technical feature and present situation are investigated. The developing trend is forecasted. Then influence on future power system is proposed. In Section III, concept and theoretical scheme of value reconstruction are presented. The input variable of scheme is defined as dispersed resources with potential value, while the output variable is defined as innovation benefit and competitive advantage of enterprise. By using three key steps including value identification, value creation and value implementation, the goal of value reconstruction is achieved. The goal of value reconstruction of future power system is proposed from four viewpoints. The first one is value reconstruction from providing traditional energy service to integrated energy service. The second one is value reconstruction from providing domestic energy service to global energy service. The third one is value reconstruction from focusing on single energy industry to cross-industry. The fourth one is value reconstruction from definition as a traditional enterprise to latest type of platform enterprise. Value reconstruction of future power system will drastically affect the function and morphology of future power system, including to promote the upgrade of domestic power system, to expedite global energy interconnection, to stimulate multi-network convergence, and to accelerate enterprise strategic transformation, which is also related to the value implementation step(the third step) in the presented value reconstruction scheme. In Section IV, function and morphology of future power system is proposed. Then, morphology of future Asian power grid is forecasted. An analytic hierarchy process model for the decision making of interconnection mode is established. The mathematical solution of the analytic hierarchy model shows the DC grid mode is the most probable mode for the interconnection of the Asian power grid in the future. Furthermore, evolution principle is presented. It is found that evolution of future power system is affected by the level of technology innovation as well as the process of value reconstruction, in which the former one is the external power, and the latter one is the internal pressure. Considering the usage efficiency and life cycle of stock assets, evolution of future power system should not be drastic, but there should be great continuity and coherence among each stage. In Section V, the theoretical and specified analysis results are concluded.","Zhao, Shanshan;Zhou, Qinyong;Yang, Jingqi;Huang, Dan;Ma, Shicong",Conference Proceeding,iSPEC 2020 - Proceedings: IEEE Sustainable Power and Energy Conference: Energy Transition and Energy Internet,2020-11-23,China Electric Power Research Institute,function ;  future power system ;  high penetration ;  morphology ;  renewable energy

Drones in manufacturing: exploring opportunities for research and practice,"Purpose: Although the industrial application of drones is increasing quickly, there is a scarcity of applications in manufacturing. The purpose of this paper is to explore current and potential applications of drones in manufacturing, examine the opportunities and challenges involved and propose a research agenda. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports the result of an extensive qualitative investigation into an emerging phenomenon. The authors build on the literature on advanced manufacturing technologies. Data collected through in-depth interviews with 66 drone experts from 56 drone vendors and related services are analyzed using an inductive research design. Findings: Drones represent a promising AMT that is expected to be used in several applications in manufacturing in the next few years. This paper proposes a typology of drone applications in manufacturing, explains opportunities and challenges involved and develops a research agenda. The typology categorizes four types of applications based on the drones’ capabilities to “see,” “sense,” “move” and “transform.” Research limitations/implications: The proposed research agenda offers a guide for future research on drones in manufacturing. There are many research opportunities in the domains of industrial engineering, technology development and behavioral operations. Practical implications: Guidance on current and promising potentials of drones in manufacturing is provided to practitioners. Particularly interesting applications are those that help manufacturers “see” and “sense” data in their factories. Applications that “move” or “transform” objects are scarcer, and they make sense only in special cases in very large manufacturing facilities. Originality/value: The application of drones in manufacturing is in its infancy, but is foreseen to grow rapidly over the next decade. This paper presents the first academically rigorous analysis of potential applications of drones in manufacturing. An original and theory-informed typology for drone applications is a timely contribution to the nascent literature. The research agenda presented assists the establishment of a new stream of literature on drones in manufacturing.","Maghazei, Omid;Netland, Torbjørn",Journal,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2020-11-23,ETH Zürich,Advanced manufacturing technology ;  Manufacturing operations ;  Technological innovation

Titanium for Orthopedic Applications: An Overview of Surface Modification to Improve Biocompatibility and Prevent Bacterial Biofilm Formation,"Titanium and its alloys have emerged as excellent candidates for use as orthopedic biomaterials. Nevertheless, there are often complications arising after implantation of orthopedic devices, most notably prosthetic joint infection and aseptic loosening. To ensure that implanted devices remain functional in situ, innovation in surface modification has attracted much attention in the effort to develop orthopedic materials with optimal characteristics at the biomaterial-tissue interface. This review will draw together metallurgy, surface engineering, biofilm microbiology, and biomaterial science. It will serve to appreciate why titanium and its alloys are frequently used orthopedic biomaterials and address some of the challenges facing these biomaterials currently, including the significant problem of device-associated infection. Finally, the authors shall consolidate and evaluate surface modification techniques employed to overcome some of these issues by offering a unique perspective as to the direction in which research is headed from a broad, interdisciplinary point of view.","Quinn, James;McFadden, Ryan;Chan, Chi Wai;Carson, Louise",Journal,iScience,2020-11-20,Queen's University Belfast,Biomaterials ;  Microbiofilms ;  Orthopedics ;  Surface Science
French experience: International mobility of researchers in light of implementing the governmental tasks to increase efficiency of innovative sectors of economy,"The term ""innovation""was first used at the beginning of the 20th century by renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter meaning the changes aimed at implementing and using new types of consumer goods, new methods of production and vehicles, markets and forms of organization in industry. However, it is in recent years that the innovative sectors of economy have become noticeable in the national space of various countries on the political and economic map of the world. According to consultancies, the leading positions in the sector of innovation are held by digital companies. The slogan of one of them (Apple) - Think Different - is a most accurate reflection of the general logic of the intellectual and, ultimately, economic increment within innovative companies. The G8 and G20 countries increasingly often invest huge amounts in national projects aimed at supporting the relevant spheres of innovation. For instance, in Russia over 1 billion rubles was invested in innovative projects by governmental funds in 2019. The race for breakthrough science-and-research technologies creates a global competitive background for presenting the best innovative products to the global science-and-research community. At the same time, it should be recognized that the innovative sectors of national economies, due to the peculiarities of the organization and activities thereof, objectively cannot take an isolated position in relation to international cooperation in general and international mobility of researchers in particular. This article gives a critical analysis of the institution of international mobility of researchers looking at the example of the French Republic, a traditional leader in the field of science, research, technology and innovation.","Zakharova, M.

Towards sustainable design: Integrating data from operation of buildings in design practices,"In recent years, the Danish Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry has shown increased interest in sustainability in contributing to the achievement of the UN 17 sustainable development goals. Sustainable design is, however, hampered by lack of information and weak data integration especially in the early design stages of building projects. In order to overcome these challenges, research has proposed transferring information from operation to the design of new buildings. By conducting a case study analysis in a Danish architecture firm, this research aims to explore the form of collaboration between architects and building client, and how this collaboration can support or inhibit the calculations of life cycle costing as an essential part of sustainable design practices. The data, for this exploratory research, are gathered through direct observations, surveys and semi-structured interviews. Structured analysis is used as the theoretical methodology to map the flow of data in a paradigmatic building project of the case company and recognize existing forms of knowledge transfer and areas of improvement. The results indicate that there are significant potentials of collaboration, however, several actions should be taken from both sides in order to enable information and data exchange. By improving the collaboration with building clients, architects will gain access to information from operation of buildings, which can be effectively used in architecture design improving the sustainability of buildings and contributing to SDG-9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.","Saridaki, Maria;Haugbølle, Kim",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-11-20,Aalborg University;Vandkunsten Architects,
"Sustainable cities and communities through GFRP secant-pile seawall innovation, sustainability, fortification and hurricane storm surge protection","In this ever changing technologically evolving world, in order to create a more sustainable built environment, it is essential to adhere to established core elements and improve or re-invent them for all of humanity, and from a Civil Engineering perspective this includes enhancing and better designing our current and future Infrastructure. A Global Education is essential to promote new, advanced materials, that are not yet mainstream, so we concur that the path towards Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), achieving relevant Targets 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.6 and 11.7, is indeed only possible, if other relevant SDG's are also met. This research effort is not only discussing Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), but also addressing Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9), through the use of GFRP Resilient Infrastructure project that were recently (2019) installed, in Florida, U.S.A., to start long-term, environmentally friendly, LCA/LCC long-term saving, protection of the Shorelines from Hurricanes and Sea Level Rise [Relevant SDG Targets 9.1 and 9.4 will also be discussed]. Climate Action [Relevant SDG Targets 13.1 and 13.3] and Quality Education [relevant SDG Targets 4.3, 4.4 and 4.7] which are instrumental to the success of this project are considered. Part of the discussions will address the distinctions in Sustainability, i.e. Stability, Resilience, Durability and Robustness among others. In order to illustrate the interaction of the SDG's, a Secant-Pile/Bulkhead Shore-Protection project that is buried within a dune-system and is in harmony with the surrounding coastal environment was chosen. Constructability issues will be discussed and illustrated, and data measurements provided to showcase the efficiency of this system, resulting in GFRP assembly time savings of 32% to 52%, lightweight installations and ease of constructability. An indication will be provided how the construction sector (i.e. sustainable built environment) can contribute towards Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11) of the future, along with the challenges that are associated with new materials and methods that yet have to find a broader foothold.","Steputat, C.

The impact of synergy effect between government subsidies and slack resources on green technology innovation,"Green technology innovation is the principal approach to cleaner production and achieving sustainable development. This paper focuses on the impact of the synergy effect between external government subsidies and internal slack on green technology innovation, as well as the moderating role of ownership concentration in this process. Using China's data of the high-tech enterprises listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2011 to 2016, the hypotheses are tested based on the fixed effect model of negative binomial distribution. The results suggest that: a) the synergy of government subsidies and unabsorbed slack effectively improves the enterprises’ green technical innovation, while the synergy of government subsidies and absorbed slack negatively affect the enterprises’ green technical innovation; and b) ownership concentration positively moderates the relation between green technology innovation and the synergy of government subsidies and unabsorbed slack with a inverted U-shaped curve, while there is no significance in their absorbed slack counterparts. Moreover, the baseline conclusions are applicable to non-state-owned enterprises, while they differ in state-owned enterprises regarding the property heterogeneity: the synergistic effect between government subsidies and absorbed slack has no significance on the green technology innovation of these state-owned enterprises; and the ownership concentration positively moderates the relation between green technology innovation and the synergy of government subsidies and unabsorbed slack with a U-shaped curve. Thus, an integrated framework of public supported resources, internal resources and the ownership concentration is built to optimize the allocation of external and internal resources for enterprises to develop green new technologies and ultimately promote the sustainability of the environment.","Wu, Haoqiang;Hu, Sumin",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-11-20,Wuhan University of Technology,Absorbed slack ;  Enterprise green technology innovation ;  Government subsidies ;  Ownership concentration ;  Unabsorbed slack
On the role of explainable machine learning for secure smart vehicles,"The concept of mobility is experiencing a serious transformation due to the Mobility-as-a-Service paradigm. Accordingly, vehicles, usually referred to as smart, are seeing their architecture revamped to integrate connection to the outside environment (V2X) and autonomous driving. A significant part of these innovations is enabled by machine learning. However, deploying such systems raises some concerns. First, the complexity of the algorithms often prevents understanding what these models learn, which is relevant in the safety-critical context of mobility. Second, several studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of machine learning-based algorithms to adversarial attacks. For these reasons, research on the explainability of machine learning is raising. In this paper, we then explore the role of interpretable machine learning in the ecosystem of smart vehicles, with the goal of figuring out if and in what terms explanations help to design secure vehicles. We provide an overview of the potential uses of explainable machine learning, along with recent work in the literature that has started to investigate the topic, including from the perspectives of human-agent systems and cyber-physical systems. Our analysis highlights both benefits and criticalities in employing explanations.","Scalas, Michele;Giacinto, Giorgio",Conference Proceeding,"2020 AEIT International Conference of Electrical and Electronic Technologies for Automotive, AEIT AUTOMOTIVE 2020",2020-11-18,Università degli Studi di Cagliari,Automotive ;  Autonomous Driving ;  Connected Cars ;  Cybersecurity ;  Explainability ;  Machine learning ;  Mobility ;  Smart Vehicles
Engineering Graduates at a South African University and their Prospective Employers - Expectations and Reality,"Since the dawn of democracy in South Africa in 1994, numerous changes have occurred at tertiary institutions to enable greater access for people of all backgrounds and increased graduate throughput to fulfil the needs of the labor market for engineers. Widespread changes in the size and composition of successive undergraduate engineering cohorts have occurred. Simultaneously, the needs of industry have undergone significant changes due to the information age, globalization, the rapid increase in technological advances and access. This study attempted to assess the alignment between the expectations of engineering graduates, the expectations of engineering employers and reality. A mixed methods research was developed. The study firstly surveyed engineering graduates at a South African University using a questionnaire developed for quantitative analysis. Convenience sampling and a positivist approach were used. Graduates' needs, study approaches, employment and workplace expectations were determined, analyzed and interpreted through the lens of two frameworks, namely Biggs' study motives and strategies and Bloom's taxonomy. Secondly, the study conducted semi-structured interviews with all engineering discipline academic leaders at the University, within an interpretivist paradigm using deductive thematic semantic analysis. Academic leaders were used as a proxy for industry opinion and questioned on a number of themes including graduate and employer expectations, positive or negative trends, graduate training programs, further training and postgraduate study, exit-level outcomes (ELOs) and graduate attributes, the reality of misalignment and what the University can do to limit it. Responses were collated and compared quantitatively and qualitatively where appropriate. A number of issues and mis-alignments were identified together with their causes. Mis-alignment was identified in salary, growth and guidance expectations, confidence, software and niche proficiencies and innovation expectations. Key causes included language barriers, lack of engineering hobbyist backgrounds, workload and study strategies, assessment changes and personal responsibility. Findings were discussed within the theoretical frameworks mentioned above and summarized in light of the objectives of this study. Recommendations for the University in mitigating many of the issues and mis-alignment were provided, along with recommendations for any possible future research in this area.","Osman, Khalid;Gerwel Proches, Cecile Naomi",Conference Proceeding,"2020 IFEES World Engineering Education Forum - Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF-GEDC 2020",2020-11-16,University of KwaZulu-Natal,employers ;  Engineering education ;  graduates ;  South Africa
Supporting departmental innovation in eLearning during COVID-19 through eLearning champions,"While the adoption of blended or online learning has been spreading across the world, it is not always implemented in a way that transforms teaching and learning. More often than not, technology is used to support traditional ways of teaching and learning. At our institution we have adopted a blended learning definition, that rather focusing on tools and technologies, highlights the importance of pedagogical considerations. Following Gilly Salmon's Carpe Diem design process we encourage lecturers to carefully think about learning design, emphasizing learner needs and disciplinary and institutional context. This study follows six lecturers in the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, who are known as so-called 'eLearning champions'. eLearning champions are ""individuals who emerge to take creative ideas (which they may or may not have generated) and bring them to life. They make decisive contributions to the innovation process by actively and enthusiastically promoting the innovation, building support, overcoming resistance, and ensuring that the innovation is implemented""[1]. We are interested in the role these eLearning champions played when supporting their departments before and after COVID-19 with moving teaching and learning online. At the beginning, novice lecturers saw online teaching as simply transferring their face to face teaching strategies online. How to design for interactive online content, student engagement and appropriate online assessment was an unfamiliar territory. The findings are in it's initial stage however many themes emerged here like role of e-learning champion and their contribution towards peer learning. It also speaks about the complexity involved and support from the institution, etc. The paper will conclude with recommendations about future research.","Patnaik, Sweta;Gachago, Daniela",Conference Proceeding,"2020 IFEES World Engineering Education Forum - Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF-GEDC 2020",2020-11-16,Cape Peninsula University of Technology,academic staff development ;  eLearning champions ;  online teaching ;  pandemic
Student Industrial Secondments in East Africa: Improving Employability in Engineering,"Relative shortage of engineering practitioners in Sub-Saharan Africa has been a big concern for many studies on industrial and technological development. However, the region that suffers from this shortage simultaneously has a significant number of existing engineering graduates who find it difficult to land employment in engineering fields. While that situation reflects inability to have enough human capital in industrial processes, two scenarios partly explain the situation: a relative deficit (real or perceived) in the competency of local engineering graduates in ever-advancing areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and/or scarcity in opportunities to hone and demonstrate competency of local engineering graduates in the labour market. Consequently, local engineering graduates have inadequate hands-on experience needed in industries as well as for establishing start-up engineering firms/businesses. To address this situation, it was postulated that promoting engineering student industrial secondment (SIS) programs can be a suitable approach to strengthening the linkages between engineering study, practice and employability. Since completing academic engineering majors is apparently not enough by itself to bridge the skill gap and prepare most engineers to enter their countries' engineering practice fields, and the currently existing student placements seem to have some serious flaws, the present study was launched with the aim of exploring best practices, for evidence-based policy learning in establishing and running robust engineering SIS programs coordinated between universities and industries - and perhaps with support from the public sector - to serve both industries and students. Using innovation systems and systems thinking as conceptual and theoretical framework approaches, the study included surveying in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda in addition action research by piloting four SIS placements in Tanzania and Rwanda; the main objective being to observe closely, try potential modules, and learn and synthesize effective experiences of SIS program from developing countries.","Mutambala, Musambya;Sheikheldin, Gussai;Diyamett, Bitrina;Nyichomba, Bavo",Conference Proceeding,"2020 IFEES World Engineering Education Forum - Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF-GEDC 2020",2020-11-16,University of Dar es Salaam;STIPRO;Technology and Innovation Policy Research Organization (STIPRO),East Africa ;  employability ;  engineering education ;  student industrial secondments
Skills Obsolescence and Education Global Risks in the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"The thrust of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the pressure of industry stakeholders require employers to develop and implement new workforce strategies. In the engineering field, current requirements must address the additional challenges related to planned obsolescence in technology. This phenomenon has represented in recent years a triggering risk for other labor obsolescences, with devastating effects for many companies and educational institutions that were unprepared for these cataclysmic changes. The current panorama is frantic and especially damaging for educational institutions in Latin America, to the point that the worst facet of technology obsolescence, known as systematic, causes a kind of ""mirror""obsolescence in academic programs in engineering institutions. The objectives of this Work-in-Progress study are to: (i) identify problems related to technological change skewed by skills in the technology sector labor markets and (ii) assess different initiatives that educational institutions in engineering have addressed, including Higher Education and Continuing Education. This document also briefly presents a statement of the implications for educational practice with focus on actions, possible frameworks of teaching and learning techniques, and a summary of the research preliminary results and findings.","Caratozzolo, Patricia;Sirkis, Gabriela;Piloto, Clara;Correa, Marc",Conference Proceeding,"2020 IFEES World Engineering Education Forum - Global Engineering Deans Council, WEEF-GEDC 2020",2020-11-16,"Universitat Ramon Llull, ESADE;Universidad del CEMA;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Tecnológico de Monterrey",education 4.0 ;  educational innovation ;  higher education ;  job obsolescence ;  lifelong learning
Students' acceptance towards kit-build concept map authoring tool in supporting learning of english reading comprehension,"In facing the new pandemic situation, students and educators had to switch their learning activities into online learning and quickly adapt the educational technologies to support distance learning. Sophisticating innovations in educational technologies are highly required to overcome change. Delivering digital content and activities in a distance learning environment has potential advantages in improving the students' engagement in learning. Concept mapping is known to support students' learning process and help them learn better. A concept mapping authoring tool built to support learning with the Kit-Build concept map framework has been developed to incorporate computer technologies into digital concept mapping activities. This research investigates to what extent the students' technology adoption towards the Kit-Build concept map authoring tool as a digital concept mapping tool supports the students to learn English reading comprehension. This research incorporates the Technology Acceptance Model to evaluate students' acceptance towards the tool and uses three external variables, i.e., compatibility, habit, and enjoyment for the TAM model. Most of the result presented in this research is consistent with the original TAM study. Furthermore, compatibility and enjoyment are also identified to significantly affect the students' adoption of the Kit-Build concept map authoring tool.","Pinandito, Aryo;Wulandari, Chandrawati Putri;Prasetya, Didik Dwi;Hirashima, Tsukasa;Hayashi, Yusuke;Az-Zahra, Hanifah Muslimah",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-11-16,Universitas Negeri Malang;Brawijaya University;Universitas Airlangga;Hiroshima University,concept map ;  evaluation ;  kit-build ;  learning tool ;  technology acceptance
Automation in the Life Science Research Laboratory,"Protocols in the academic life science laboratory are heavily reliant on the manual manipulation of tools, reagents and instruments by a host of research staff and students. In contrast to industrial and clinical laboratory environments, the usage of automation to augment or replace manual tasks is limited. Causes of this ‘automation gap’ are unique to academic research, with rigid short-term funding structures, high levels of protocol variability and a benevolent culture of investment in people over equipment. Automation, however, can bestow multiple benefits through improvements in reproducibility, researcher efficiency, clinical translation, and safety. Less immediately obvious are the accompanying limitations, including obsolescence and an inhibitory effect on the freedom to innovate. Growing the range of automation options suitable for research laboratories will require more flexible, modular and cheaper designs. Academic and commercial developers of automation will increasingly need to design with an environmental awareness and an understanding that large high-tech robotic solutions may not be appropriate for laboratories with constrained financial and spatial resources. To fully exploit the potential of laboratory automation, future generations of scientists will require both engineering and biology skills. Automation in the research laboratory is likely to be an increasingly critical component of future research programs and will continue the trend of combining engineering and science expertise together to answer novel research questions.","Holland, Ian;Davies, Jamie A.",Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2020-11-13,Edinburgh Medical School,automation design ;  environmental design ;  innovation inhibition ;  laboratory automation ;  life science research ;  reproducibility ;  research efficiency

Formation process of paste HDN slurry in gravel stratum,"At present, due to the complex geological conditions and long-distance drive, scheduled and unscheduled cutter head intervention maintenance during shield tunneling has become a major innovation in shield engineering in China Therefore, paste HDN has been successfully applied to cutter head intervention under pressure, but corresponding research work on its film-forming mechanism and process is lacking. Film-forming experiments and theoretical analysis of the paste indicated that the film-forming process of the paste during gravel-stratum formation can be divided into two stages: Seepage blocking of the forming pore diameter and forming of a mud cake on the excavation surface. The seepage process was completed almost instantaneously, and the forming process of a 5-10 cm mud cake required 1-2 days. In addition, a mud diffusion model was established for investigating the mud infiltration process. The results of the aforementioned experiments were applied to the cutter head intervention of Guangzhou Metro and Lanzhou Metro, and this application ensured the efficient and safe completion of the intervention task.","Shuyi, Luo;Weiran, Huang;Jinsheng, Mi",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-11-11,Guangzhou Mass Transit Engineering Consultant Co.

Preservation of Cultural Identity through Speech Components in the Southern Coastal Java Environment,"This research discusses the form of defence of the southern coastal community which is frequently considered strange by most of the Indonesian archipelago community. The analysis began with discussing the linguistic phenomena of the local community, identifying and corroborating the findings as initial capital to determine the analysis method. The findings can be useful for making corrections or structuring social and cultural policies towards indigenous/local wisdom and preserving cultural identity. The research was oriented to the speech lexicon of the Southern coastal communities of Central Java. This research used descriptive qualitative and contextual approaches. The analysis used to describe the speech component was dialect geography and collaborated with an anthropological-linguistic approach to find innovative forms and factors that maintained local identity. As the southern coastal chain of Central Java, bordering with West Java, the nuances of cultural acculturation as a form of cultural pluralism are very visible. Cultural acculturation results in the emergence of language enclaves. The language enclave is formed because the speech community has a speech code that is different from the mother tongue and the nearest language. Language enclaves formed on the southern coast of Central Java occur at the level of internal innovation. Internal innovations in the southern coast language enclave occur in the form of allophones and allomorphs that can be traced based on the articulation process. Social heritage as a form of language preservation in the language enclave of the southern coast of Central Java is formed by the characteristics of simplicity and social intelligence of the people.","Tiani, Riris",Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2020-11-10,Universitas Diponegoro,Coastal environment ;  Language enclave ;  Preservation
Towards transferring lean software startup practices in software engineering education,"In the modern economy, software drives innovation and economic growth.

Why Design Majors Enjoy a Better Competence in Interdisciplinary Integration than Majors in Other Disciplines?,"In recent years, it is common to combine interdisciplinary education with the capstone curriculum of a host of disciplines to cultivate students' competence in interdisciplinary integration. However, few related research reports on its effectiveness have been carried out. Therefore, this thesis, based on the previous studies on interdisciplinary education, invites total 143 senior students from Department of Design, Department of Materials Engineering, and Department of Electrical Engineering in an University from Taiwan as volunteer participants, and conducts a study by using ""Core Competence in Interdisciplinary Integration Scale""to measure and compare the participants' interdisciplinary skills. The results have demonstrated that the thematic capstone courses integrated with interdisciplinary education implies positive impacts on students' acquisition of core competence in interdisciplinary integration. Meanwhile, the study result shows that, compared with students from Department of Materials Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, those from Department of Design present better performance in terms of their core competence in interdisciplinary integration, including the capacity of communication, reflection, and practice. As further research goes, this thesis will prove that the reason lies in the fact that Department of Design highlights the importance of core competence in interdisciplinary integration and the implementation of the interdisciplinary thematic integrated courses offered from the junior grade to the senior year. Finally, this research will demonstrate on this basis that interdisciplinary education should be a continuous process with exact stages for university education. Its implementation will boast better outcomes if it is carried out from the junior grade and different goals and connotations are required in different stages. With such a conclusion, this thesis provides a reference for the cultivation model of interdisciplinary integration ability and innovation ability in university, so as to prepare contemporary university students for global challenges and opportunities.","Xu, Cong;Wu, Chih Fu;Lu, Wen Qian;Wang, Kai Yi",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-11-06,Tatung University,Capstone Course ;  Comparison of Cultivation Models ;  Core Competencies ;  Interdisciplinary Integration Competence

Covid-19 Care - A mobile application to help connect volunteers and vulnerable people in the community during the covid-19 lockdown,"Whenever the world is faced with a devastating outbreak of events, technology innovations have proven to be a go to solution that expedite the recovery process. We propose a mobile application rapidly developed as a contender to the TechForce19 innovation challenge, a backing of the NHSX offering $\pounds$ 500, 000 to innovators to develop digital solutions for supporting vulnerable in the community during the coronavirus outbreak. Our solution would allow people who are in self isolation to ask for help and enable a fast, secure support by the community within 15 miles radius. The solution would allow volunteers to recognise the precise need in the community and how they can support. Within two weeks, we built a state-of-the-art support application that is deployable, but with security caveats that required local authority support and resources to ensure the vulnerable are not exploited through the app.","Phung, Khoa;Odongo, Silas;Ogunshile, Emmanuel",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 8th Edition of the International Conference in Software Engineering Research and Innovation, CONISOFT 2020",2020-11-01,University of the West of England;Mind Garden Technology Ltd,Coronavirus ;  Covid-19 ;  Help ;  Infectious ;  Innovations ;  Need ;  Remote-social support ;  Self-isolation ;  Technologies ;  Transformation

Opportunities and challenges in metal forming for lightweighting: Review and future work,"The purposes of this review are to summarize the historical progress in the last 60 years of lightweight metal forming, to analyze the state-of-the-art, and to identify future directions in the context of Cyber-physically enabled circular economy. In honoring the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Manufacturing Engineering Division of ASME, this review paper first provides the impact of the metal forming sector on the economy and historical perspectives of metal forming research work published by the ASME Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, followed by the motivations and trends in lightweighting. To achieve lightweighting, one needs to systematically consider: (1) materials and material characterization; (2) innovative forming processes; and (3) simulation tools for integrated part design and process design. A new approach for process innovation, i.e., the Performance- Constraints-Mechanism-Innovation (PCMI) framework, is proposed to systematically seek new processes. Finally, trends and challenges for the further development in circular economy are presented for future exploration.","Cao, Jian;Banu, Mihaela",Journal,"Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, Transactions of the ASME",2020-11-01,"Robert R.

Vasculogenesis from human dental pulp stem cells grown in matrigel with fully defined serum-free culture media,"The generation of vasculature is one of the most important challenges in tissue engineering and regeneration. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) are some of the most promising stem cell types to induce vasculogenesis and angiogenesis as they not only secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but can also differentiate in vitro into both endotheliocytes and pericytes in serum-free culture media. Moreover, hDPSCs can generate complete blood vessels containing both endothelial and mural layers in vivo, upon transplantation into the adult brain. However, many of the serum free media employed for the growth of hDPSCs contain supplements of an undisclosed composition. This generates uncertainty as to which of its precise components are necessary and which are dispensable for the vascular differentiation of hDPSCs, and also hinders the transfer of basic research findings to clinical cell therapy. In this work, we designed and tested new endothelial differentiation media with a fully defined composition using standard basal culture media supplemented with a mixture of B27, heparin and growth factors, including VEGF-A165 at different concentrations. We also optimized an in vitro Matrigel assay to characterize both the ability of hDPSCs to differentiate to vascular cells and their capacity to generate vascular tubules in 3D cultures. The description of a fully defined serum-free culture medium for the induction of vasculogenesis using human adult stem cells highlights its potential as a relevant innovation for tissue engineering applications. In conclusion, we achieved efficient vasculogenesis starting from hDPSCs using serum-free culture media with a fully defined composition, which is applicable for human cell therapy purposes.","Luzuriaga, Jon;Irurzun, Jon;Irastorza, Igor;Unda, Fernando;Ibarretxe, Gaskon;Pineda, Jose R.",Journal,Biomedicines,2020-11-01,Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience;Universidad del Pais Vasco,DPSCs ;  Endothelial cells ;  Matrigel ;  Neovasculogenesis ;  Stem cells ;  Vasculature
Green cloud software engineering for big data processing,"Internet of Things (IoT) coupled with big data analytics is emerging as the core of smart and sustainable systems which bolsters economic, environmental and social sustainability. Cloud-based data centers provide high performance computing power to analyze voluminous IoT data to provide invaluable insights to support decision making. However, multifarious servers in data centers appear to be the black hole of superfluous energy consumption that contributes to 23% of the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) industry. IoT-related energy research focuses on low-power sensors and enhanced machine-to-machine communication performance. To date, cloud-based data centers still face energy-related challenges which are detrimental to the environment. Virtual machine (VM) consolidation is a well-known approach to affect energy-efficient cloud infrastructures. Although several research works demonstrate positive results for VM consolidation in simulated environments, there is a gap for investigations on real, physical cloud infrastructure for big data workloads. This research work addresses the gap of conducting real physical cloud infrastructure-based experiments. The primary goal of setting up a real physical cloud infrastructure is for the evaluation of dynamic VM consolidation approaches which include integrated algorithms from existing relevant research. An open source VM consolidation framework, Openstack NEAT is adopted and experiments are conducted on a Multi-node Openstack Cloud with Apache Spark as the big data platform. Open sourced Openstack has been deployed because it enables rapid innovation, and boosts scalability as well as resource utilization. Additionally, this research work investigates the performance based on service level agreement (SLA) metrics and energy usage of compute hosts. Relevant results concerning the best performing combination of algorithms are presented and discussed.","Ganesan, Madhubala;Kor, Ah Lian;Pattinson, Colin;Rondeau, Eric",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-11-01,Université de Lorraine;Leeds Beckett University,Big data analytics ;  Cloud data centers ;  Energy consumption ;  IoT ;  VM consolidation
Protease-Resistant Growth Factor Formulations for the Healing of Chronic Wounds,"Objective: Chronic wounds are long-term nonhealing wounds that are refractory to treatment. These wounds can present elevated protease levels, leading to rapid degradation of native and exogenously added growth factors. This work focused on developing a protease-resistant growth factor formulation for treatment of chronic wounds presented with high protease activity. Approach: This study developed protease-resistant growth factor formulations comprising elastin-like peptides (ELPs) fused with a known protease inhibitor peptide or growth factor. The ELP component of the fusion proteins allows assembly of heterogeneous nanoparticles (NPs) putting the inhibitor in close proximity to the growth factor to be protected. Results: We show successful preservation of growth factor activity in high human neutrophil elastase (HNE) environment and in human chronic wound fluid derived from patients. We further show that these NPs result in enhanced collagen remodeling and resolution of inflammation in a full thickness wound supplemented with HNE in genetically diabetic mice. Innovation: Development of heterogeneous NPs that put the protease inhibitor in close proximity of the growth factor. Moreover, the modular nature of the NPs allows for protection of multiple growth factors by the same inhibitor without changing the amino acid sequence of the growth factor. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the developed NPs hold tremendous promise in chronic wound healing therapy and may further help the translation of growth factor therapies to clinic. The customizable template for the NP design allows for multifaceted use across several fields in research and medicine.","Boeringer, Tabitha;Gould, Lisa J.;Koria, Piyush",Journal,Advances in Wound Care,2020-11-01,"University of South Florida, Tampa;South Shore Hospital Center for Wound Healing",chronic wound ;  drug delivery ;  growth factors ;  nanomedicine ;  protease ;  protein engineering
International Perspective on UHPC in Bridge Engineering,"Ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) offers significant potential to address a variety of needs in bridge design, construction, and performance enhancement. Bridge owners have shown willingness to embrace novel solutions that could address specific challenges related to the cost, speed of construction, durability, and service life of their projects. There are hundreds of bridges worldwide that, largely in the past decade, have utilized UHPC. These applications range from minor field-cast closures to precast segments for long-span bridges to kilometer-long bridge deck overlays on a signature structure. The objective of this paper is to promote the application of this class of cementitious material in bridge engineering by presenting the progress that has been made in different regions of the world in the past two decades. Today, UHPC is being widely used in Malaysia to design and construct many bridges of different types and spans as they build out their roadway network. In South Korea, the unique characteristics of UHPC are being utilized to advance the state-of-the-art in long-span bridges. The French were early adopters and pioneers in building a strong foundation for using UHPC in a variety of bridge applications. In Switzerland, UHPC is employed to address major bridge rehabilitation needs. The United States bridge sector has embraced UHPC for a variety of field-cast connections. Current research and development efforts are promoting the use of UHPC in major rehabilitation projects and construction of primary bridge components. The adoption of UHPC solutions into the bridge sector is progressing rapidly because of the unique opportunities provided by the strength and durability of the material. It is expected that additional innovations and refinements of solutions will occur as knowledge of the material proliferates.","Graybeal, Benjamin;Brühwiler, Eugen;Kim, Byung Suk;Toutlemonde, François;Voo, Yen Lei;Zaghi, Arash",Journal,Journal of Bridge Engineering,2020-11-01,Université Gustave Eiffel;Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology (KICT);UNSW Sydney;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;University of Connecticut;Federal Highway Administration - Virginia Division;Dura Technology Sdn.

Deep learning in the construction industry: A review of present status and future innovations,"The construction industry is known to be overwhelmed with resource planning, risk management and logistic challenges which often result in design defects, project delivery delays, cost overruns and contractual disputes. These challenges have instigated research in the application of advanced machine learning algorithms such as deep learning to help with diagnostic and prescriptive analysis of causes and preventive measures. However, the publicity created by tech firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon about Artificial Intelligence and applications to unstructured data is not the end of the field. There abound many applications of deep learning, particularly within the construction sector in areas such as site planning and management, health and safety and construction cost prediction, which are yet to be explored. The overall aim of this article was to review existing studies that have applied deep learning to prevalent construction challenges like structural health monitoring, construction site safety, building occupancy modelling and energy demand prediction. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no extensive survey of the applications of deep learning techniques within the construction industry. This review would inspire future research into how best to apply image processing, computer vision, natural language processing techniques of deep learning to numerous challenges in the industry. Limitations of deep learning such as the black box challenge, ethics and GDPR, cybersecurity and cost, that can be expected by construction researchers and practitioners when adopting some of these techniques were also discussed.","Akinosho, Taofeek D.;Oyedele, Lukumon O.;Bilal, Muhammad;Ajayi, Anuoluwapo O.;Delgado, Manuel Davila;Akinade, Olugbenga O.;Ahmed, Ashraf A.",Journal,Journal of Building Engineering,2020-11-01,Bristol Business School;Brunel University London,Autoencoders ;  Construction industry ;  Convolutional neural networks ;  Deep learning ;  Generative adversarial networks
Impacts of government subsidies and environmental regulations on green process innovation: A nonlinear approach,"With China's tremendous economic development following its reform and opening-up, the problem of environmental deterioration has become increasingly serious. To achieve a win-win situation between economic growth and environmental protection, enterprises are being encouraged to carry out green technology innovation, but due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in it, the government is providing research and development (R&D) subsidies while at the same time implementing environmental regulations. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) [5] divides green technology innovation into green product innovation and green process innovation, this study focuses on the latter in order to better study its relationship with environmental regulations and government subsidies. We select panel data of 30 provinces and cities in China from 2009 to 2017 (excluding Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, because of a lack of data) and use the system GMM and threshold-effect model for empirical analysis. The results show that environmental regulations have a U-shape non-linear effect on green process innovation, while government subsidies have a positive role in promoting green process innovation, or the so-called leverage effect. Based on government subsidies, the impact of environmental regulations on green process innovation has a threshold effect, and therefore regulations and subsidies should be increased. In addition, the level of economic development has a U-shape effect of inhibition and then promotion on green process innovation. Overall, the China government should continue to develop its economy, but must not neglect the impact of environmental regulations on technological innovation at the expense of environmental damage.","Liu, Jingjing;Zhao, Min;Wang, Yanbo",Journal,Technology in Society,2020-11-01,Anhui University of Finance and Economics;Hohai University,Environmental regulation ;  Government subsidies ;  Green process innovation ;  Threshold effect
Evaluating Medical Devices Remotely: Current Methods and Potential Innovations,"Objective: We present examples of laboratory and remote studies, with a focus on studies appropriate for medical device design and evaluation. From this review and description of extant options for remote testing, we provide methods and tools to achieve research goals remotely. Background: The FDA mandates human factors evaluation of medical devices. Studies show similarities and differences in results collected in laboratories compared to data collected remotely in non-laboratory settings. Remote studies show promise, though many of these are behavioral studies related to cognitive or experimental psychology. Remote usability studies are rare but increasing, as technologies allow for synchronous and asynchronous data collection. Method: We reviewed methods of remote evaluation of medical devices, from testing labels and instruction to usability testing and simulated use. Each method was coded for the attributes (e.g., supported media) that need consideration in usability studies. Results: We present examples of how published usability studies of medical devices could be moved to remote data collection. We also present novel systems for creating such tests, such as the use of 3D printed or virtual prototypes. Finally, we advise on targeted participant recruitment. Conclusion: Remote testing will bring opportunities and challenges to the field of medical device testing. Current methods are adequate for most purposes, excepting the validation of Class III devices. Application: The tools we provide enable the remote evaluation of medical devices. Evaluations have specific research goals, and our framework of attributes helps to select or combine tools for valid testing of medical devices.","McLaughlin, Anne Collins;DeLucia, Patricia R.;Drews, Frank A.;Vaughn-Cooke, Monifa;Kumar, Anil;Nesbitt, Robert R.;Cluff, Kevin",Journal,Human Factors,2020-11-01,"AbbVie;The University of Utah;University of Maryland, College Park;San Jose State University;Rice University;NC State University;BioWork Engineering, LLC","analysis and evaluation ;  design strategies, tools ;  medical devices and technologies ;  qualitative methods ;  remote usability testing and evaluation"
"Latest Advances for the Sleeping Beauty Transposon System: 23 Years of Insomnia but Prettier than Ever: Refinement and Recent Innovations of the Sleeping Beauty Transposon System Enabling Novel, Nonviral Genetic Engineering Applications","The Sleeping Beauty transposon system is a nonviral DNA transfer tool capable of efficiently mediating transposition-based, stable integration of DNA sequences of choice into eukaryotic genomes. Continuous refinements of the system, including the emergence of hyperactive transposase mutants and novel approaches in vectorology, greatly improve upon transposition efficiency rivaling viral-vector-based methods for stable gene insertion. Current developments, such as reversible transgenesis and proof-of-concept RNA-guided transposition, further expand on possible applications in the future. In addition, innate advantages such as lack of preferential integration into genes reduce insertional mutagenesis-related safety concerns while comparably low manufacturing costs enable widespread implementation. Accordingly, the system is recognized as a powerful and versatile tool for genetic engineering and is playing a central role in an ever-expanding number of gene and cell therapy clinical trials with the potential to become a key technology to meet the growing demand for advanced therapy medicinal products.","Amberger, Maximilian;Ivics, Zoltán",Journal,BioEssays,2020-11-01,Paul-Ehrlich-Institut,clinical trial ;  gene therapy ;  genome engineering ;  nonviral ;  Sleeping Beauty transposon ;  transgenesis ;  transposition

An analysis of the impacts of telecommunications technology and innovation on economic growth,"Recently, the idea of ICTs being ‘mainstreamed’ in sustainable economic development has been adopted by many countries. For any country, sustainable economic growth is essential for a steadfast and well-balanced development of the entire country. One of the important factors supporting sustainable economic growth is the telecommunications technology and innovation, considering their role and functions as a modern-day indispensable infrastructure. It provides an opportunity for economic development compatible with the safeguard of the environment. Therefore, this study examines whether and to what extent telecommunications technology and innovation have helped improve the economic growth of developed and developing countries. We also aim to investigate the non-linear or kink effect in the relationship between the variables of telecommunications technology and innovation and economic growth. This study analyzes the impacts of telecommunications technology and innovation on economic growth at two different levels. First, we investigate the impact on individual countries which are distinct from one another regarding the level of economic development and the physical structure. Besides, the relationship between telecommunications development and the economic growth of a country may not be linear in the structure which necessitates our use of the kink regression model to capture and explain it. Second, this relationship is later investigated at the group level of countries. We divide the countries into two groups, developing and developed, based on the level of economic development and telecommunications technology. Empirically, we find that (Adak, 2015): there exists the kink effect on the relationship between telecommunications development and the economic growth in both developed and developing countries (Agnew & Romeo, 1981), the impacts of some related variables differ in magnitude depending on their levels and kink points, and (Alshubiri et al., 2019) the telecommunications technology and innovation give a relatively more massive impact on the economic growth of developing countries compared to developed countries.","Maneejuk, Paravee;Yamaka, Woraphon",Journal,Telecommunications Policy,2020-11-01,Chiang Mai University,Developing and developed countries ;  Economic growth ;  Kink regression ;  Telecommunications technology and innovation

"Structural Innovations in Printed, Flexible, and Stretchable Electronics","Research in stretchable, printed electronics combines multidisciplinary, state-of-the-art developments in material science and structural engineering. In addition to major advances based on developing novel materials and fabrication processes, synergistic structural innovations are of equal importance for enabling stretchability in printed devices and should not be overlooked. Planar printing techniques are preferred, compared to microfabrication or 3D printing processes, owing to their low cost, high throughput, and compatibility with a wide range of materials. Various printing strategies for controlling the substrate, bonding, distribution of strain, and buckling can be used to fabricate a variety of devices featuring wrinkled, textile-embedded, serpentine, island-bridge, or 2D-transformed 3D and 4D structures. Such structural innovations allow the use of ordinary printable materials for creating highly stretchable devices with minimal compromise in device performance and mechanical resiliency. This article provides an overview of the structures used in printed devices and summarizes their corresponding fabrication strategies and distinct features. The challenges of advancing the structural designs in printed devices and the prospects of transforming stretchable structures toward smart, responsive devices are also discussed. Future efforts will greatly expand the possibilities of using planar printing processes for fabricating complex structures with new functionalities.","Yin, Lu;Lv, Jian;Wang, Joseph",Journal,Advanced Materials Technologies,2020-11-01,Department of NanoEngineering,fabrication strategy ;  printed electronics ;  smart structures ;  stretchable devices ;  structural innovation
"Surveyed impact of intellectual property training in STEM education on innovation, research, and development","This paper analyzes the findings of an international survey questionnaire to which responses were received from over 500 members from different technical societies of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The survey is primarily intended to uncover members' perceptions of patent filing and research-driven innovation. Our thesis statement is twofold. First, the introduction of basic intellectual property (IP) courses to university Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics curricula would teach students valuable basics of IP and associated issues, technology protection; and possibly stimulate novel/innovative R&D outcomes. Second, studying relevant active/lapsed/expired patent documents could provide stimulating input for ongoing academic research. After analyzing the survey results we conclude that IP coursework could be a catalyst for students and researchers to explore patent opportunities related to their specific interests. The resulting knowledge would further enable researchers to prepare more compelling funding applications. In our experience, IEEE conference publications are often closely aligned with inventions to solve pressing technical problems. Conference papers typically comprise of cutting-edge research/industry findings, with a short time between paper submission and presentation. Furthermore, conference organizers choose themes representing the forefront of technologies that often lead to inventions. These could fuel patent developments, but academic research environments often provide little if any incentives for academic researchers to prepare and file patent applications. Indeed, the attainment of high impact journal publications remains the primary metric by which research activity is judged and future academic tenure achieved.","O'Sullivan, S.;Friebe, Michael;Tonti, W.

Scientific research and innovation on TBC systems evolves rapidly and diversely over the years. Hence, an understanding of the research and innovation pathways on TBC systems is extremely important for the future development of aerospace engines. This study examines research publications and patents on TBC during 1980–2019. While USA led the TBC publication output from 1980 to 2010, China takes the lead after 2011 and India too is emerging noticeably on TBC research.

Is there a ripple effect in environmental regulation in China? – Evidence from the local-neighborhood green technology innovation perspective,"Environmental regulation and green technology progress are important means to solve the negative externalities of the environmental pollution. Despite the widespread concern on the impact of environmental regulation on green technology progress, the existing literatures focus on the relationship between them mainly in the local parts of the same regions, lack of further convincing investigation from local-neighborhood perspective. Based on the spatial panel Durbin model, this paper examines the ripple effect of environmental regulation in different adjacencies by using the data of the provincial level in China, and further investigates the formation mechanism of ripple effect in local-neighborhood environmental regulation combined with the characteristic facts in regional industrial investment structure transformation. The results show that environmental regulation has a ripple effect, namely, environmental regulation can not only affect the green technology progress in the local regions but also change the innovation of green technology in the neighboring regions. Both of them show a U-shaped change characteristic. When subdividing industrial neighborhood from the economic neighborhood, the ripple effect of environmental regulation in geographical neighboring or industrial neighboring regions is significant, but this ripple effect in the pure economic neighboring regions is not significant. The ripple effect of geographic neighboring environmental regulation in neighboring overlapping areas is significantly strengthened. Given two regions with close industries distance, the closer the geographical distance is, the more ripple effect of environmental regulation will present. Environmental regulation will restrain the green technology innovation of neighboring regions by increasing investment in polluting industries in the neighboring regions, but the income growth effect of industrial transfer will not enhance the green innovation capacity in the neighboring regions and will deteriorate permanently.","Dong, Zhiqing;He, Yongda;Wang, Hui;Wang, Linhui",Journal,Ecological Indicators,2020-11-01,Shanxi University of Finance and EcoNomics;East China Normal University,Economic neighborhood ;  Environmental regulation ;  Geographical neighborhood ;  Green technology innovation ;  Industrial neighborhood ;  Ripple effect
Uncovering the knowledge flows and intellectual structures of research in Technological Forecasting and Social Change: A journey through history,"Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TF&SC) celebrates its fiftieth anniversary this year. The anniversary represents an appropriate time for an introspective analysis of the journal's history and impact. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of TF&SC in terms of how often TF&SC is cited by other journals (citation outflow), how often other journals are cited by TF&SC (citation inflow), citations by Web of Science and SCImago disciplinary categories, most-cited articles in TF&SC, co-citation of journals, and co-occurrence of author keywords. Analysis is conducted by using the Web of Science (WOS) database and Visualization of Similarities (VOS) viewer software. The incoming versus outgoing citation patterns identified here suggest an asymmetry in the knowledge flows of TF&SC. Papers published in TF&SC have increasingly cited knowledge from journals in Technology and Innovation Management (TIM), Engineering, and Decision Sciences, but the journal impacts a different set of disciplinary categories such as Energy, Environmental Sciences, and Social Sciences. From 1969–2018, Innovation, Foresight and Forecasting feature as the most popular keywords. Focus on topics such as Patents/Patent Analysis, Climate Change, Sustainability, and Energy seems to have intensified in the last decade. Findings suggest that focus on two countries of interest, India and China, is emerging in research published in TF&SC. Different regions of the world can be expected to place differential emphasis on various topics based on their socioeconomic-technological environments. The journal needs to be receptive to this diversity of perspectives from a growing community of scholars worldwide.","Sarin, Shikhar;Haon, Christophe;Belkhouja, Mustapha;Mas-Tur, Alicia;Roig-Tierno, Norat;Sego, Trina;Porter, Alan;Merigó, José M.;Carley, Stephen",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2020-11-01,ESIC Business & Marketing School;Grenoble Ecole de Management;University of Technology Sydney;Georgia Institute of Technology;Université Savoie Mont Blanc;Universidad de Chile;Search Technology Inc;Universitat de València;Boise State University,Bibliometrics ;  Citation analysis ;  VOS Viewer ;  Web of Science
The benefits of interdisciplinary scenario-building for hybrid radio applications,"In this paper, we make the case for building interdisciplinary scenarios, integrating technological, business and user perspective during the fuzzy front-end of innovation. We start from a living lab framework, underpinning the iterative process to integrate insights from all three perspectives within research projects. Then, we explain how the approach was applied within the HRADIO project1. This EU funded project focuses on the development of hybrid radio applications. We demonstrate how the process of building interdisciplinary scenarios and the involvement of multiple perspectives to evaluate these scenarios, has enabled both strategic decision making (1) and improved the technical development process within the HRADIO project (2). The first focuses on the (lack of) interest in certain scenarios from a business, technology and/or user perspective, to explain: (a) how these thresholds can be overcome and (b) what the consequences are for the project. The latter explains how we moved from interdisciplinary scenarios to a first Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that could be tested in the first pilot phase, to prototypes to be tested in the second pilot phase. To validate the importance of the scenarios, we also explain how the scenarios are integrated into the exploitation timeline. Finally, and importantly, we address how the process of multidisciplinary scenario building and evaluation can be improved.","Jennes, Iris;Friedrich, Markus;Van der Bank, Jaco;Van den Broeck, Wendy;Ebert, André;Boonen, Michelle",Journal,Telematics and Informatics,2020-11-01,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München;Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Hybrid radio ;  Interdisciplinary scenarios ;  Living lab ;  Requirements engineering ;  Software architecture ;  Software engineering
Recovery potential of biopolymer (B-P) formulation from Solanum tuberosum (waste) starch for enhancing recovery from oil reservoirs,"Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)is a researching area targeted at mobilizing reservoir trapped oil. Several applications of EOR technology provides an added possibility to squeeze out more oil from the reservoir, perhaps about 20%. However, need for innovation in production at a cost effective method and environmentally friendly is required. Polymer flooding is one of the best EOR methods, and is primarily employed to increase oil recovery by sweep improvement. The aim of this research work is primarily the designing of a specific biopolymer product with emphasis on polymer in-situ rheology and polymer flow performance examined in Enhanced oil recovery. This research involves the injection of potato peel (Solanum tuberosum) derived bio-polymer solution at different concentrations by performing simultaneous experiments at ambient conditions using a reservoir permeability testing equipment (RPT). In this novel polymer formulation, Solanum tuberosum (waste) Starch (most abundant, naturally occurring biodegradable polymers) was hydrolyzed chemically. Experimental results show that viscosity of B-P solution increases at every increment of polymer quantity reducing the mobility ratio. Several runs of flooding experiments were achieved the Reservoir permeability tester (RPT). The incremental oil recoveries vary 52%, 60%, to 74% of original oil in place (OOIP) subject to the polymer concentration.","Olabode, Oluwasanmi;Ojo, Temiloluwa;Oguntade, Tomiwa;Oduwole, Doyin",Journal,Energy Reports,2020-11-01,Covenant University,Biopolymer ;  Oil recovery ;  Polymer flooding
Alternative sources and metabolic engineering of Taxol: Advances and future perspectives,"Paclitaxel is one of the strong plant-derived anti-cancer drugs that was first isolated from the Pacific yew. Despite many paclitaxel's clinical successes, the limited accessibility of paclitaxel for clinical trials is recognized as the most important challenge. Thus, researchers are continuously trying to find the innovative ways to meet the community's need for this medicine. In the first step, the alternative sources for Taxol supply were recognized, such as Taxus genus, other plant genera, and endophytic fungi. In the next step, the biosynthetic pathways of Taxol or related metabolites were manipulated in the original organisms, or introduced to heterologous systems and then were manipulated in them. Here, a range of metabolic manipulating approaches have been successfully developed to redirect the metabolic flux toward Taxol, including promoter engineering, enzyme engineering, overexpressing the bottleneck enzymes, over- or down-regulation of transcription factors, activation of the cryptic genes, removing/minimizing the flux for competing pathways, tunable regulation of the metabolic pathway, and increasing the supplies of precursors. In this review, we discuss research progress on the alternative Taxol sources and its metabolic manipulating, and we suggest recent challenges and future perspectives.","Sabzehzari, Mohammad;Zeinali, Masoumeh;Naghavi, Mohammad Reza",Journal,Biotechnology Advances,2020-11-01,University of Tehran;University of Mohaghegh Ardabili,Anticancer drug ;  Metabolic manipulation ;  Paclitaxel ;  Taxol
Three approaches for supporting faculty technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) creation through instructional consultation,"Despite the widespread availability of network and technology infrastructure at higher education institutions, the pedagogical innovation envisioned from technology-enhanced learning is still not prevalent. Faculty need to develop expertise for designing and implementing technology-enhanced learning strategies that is termed as technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). This study uses action research to examine how one-to-one instructional consultation for technology-enhanced learning functions as an avenue for supporting faculty's TPACK creation. Through content analysis of the consulting notes from 18 consultation sessions, the study found that faculty can be supported to create TPACK through the consultation approaches of technology modelling, pedagogical realignment and deepening practice. These three approaches can be used during instructional consultation for faculty with varying objectives and experiences with technology-enhanced learning. The implications for faculty professional development in technology-enhanced learning are discussed. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic: Studies of teacher professional development programmes show that TPACK creation can be fostered through technology modelling and the use of TPACK Activity Types, lesson design prompts and design rubrics. Studies of unfacilitated peer-based design teams show that teachers create TPACK by deepening their understanding of PCK and TPACK through their design conversations. Higher education studies outside of teacher education show that individual technology mentoring and consultation encourages faculty technology adoption. What this paper adds: Academic developers can use three approaches to faciltiate TPACK creation during individual consultation with faculty. These approaches are termed as technology modelling, pedagogical realignment and deepening practice. Technology modelling is suitable for faculty without extensive experience in technology-enhanced learning. By modelling technology tools and lesson exemplars, faculty develop baseline vocabulary of technological knowledge (TK) and technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) for TPACK creation. Pedagogical realignment is suitable for faculty with some experience of technology-enhanced learning for didactic teaching. Developing their understanding of student-centered pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) provides them with pedagogical guidelines to create student-centred TPACK. Deepening practice is suitable for faculty who are already implementing models of technology-enhanced learning. Engaging them in reflective discussions helps them to develop TK, TPK, PCK, technological content knowledge (TCK), pedagogical knowledge (PK) and TPACK to improve different aspects in their current model of practice. Implications for practice and/or policy: Faculty can be at different implementation stages of technology-enhanced learning and a one-size-fits-all approach does not adequately address their development needs. Higher education technology mentoring programmes focus on technology adoption. Different kinds of faculty development strategies are needed to support faculty towards and beyond technology integration.","Koh, Joyce Hwee Ling",Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2020-11-01,University of Otago,
Banking on Blockchain: An Evaluation of Innovation Decision Making,"Blockchain technology has received significant attention following the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008. In particular, the financial services industry has sought to capitalize on the underlying technology, known as distributed ledger technology, to generate new products, services, and innovative business models. In this article, through an in-depth investigation of the technology innovation evaluation process, we utilize a grounded theory approach to study 12 financial service organizations. This article is unique in that it explores the technology evaluation process concurrently as decision makers reacted to the potential uses, as opposed to a retrospective view after a technology innovation had been adopted. Evidence suggests that, organizations applied a specific process to determine the value of blockchain that consisted of understand, organize, and test, which collectively helped create the proof-of-value model. Surprisingly, we find that financial service organizations tend to view blockchain innovation as a lower priority due to the lack of a clear path to value. Additionally, financial service organizations consistently leverage industry consortiums to link to external knowledge and help with the decision-making process. Our findings have direct implications to both innovation researchers as well as practitioners seeking to evaluate blockchain technology.","Dozier, Priya D.;Montgomery, Troy A.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2020-11-01,Terry College of Business;University of South Florida St. Petersburg,Blockchain ;  decision making ;  distributed ledger technology (DLT) ;  financial services ;  innovation management ;  product development

The Dimensions of Food Insecurity in Sierra Leone: Cues for Technology Innovation,"The broad issues of access, stability, availability, and utilization of food are deeply affected by individuals' socioeconomic decisions at the household level. This article synthesizes 100 interviews with rural and urban residents, farmers, and food vendors in rural central Sierra Leone to provide a detailed picture of their food security situation at a household level. These interviews provide specific information about daily meal contents and preparation, differences between urban and rural settings, and popular dishes. Additional insights include market interaction, barriers to participation, food purchasing behaviors, and seasonal variations. Respondents also explained their primary sources of nutrition education and their perceptions surrounding this knowledge. The authors synthesize these insights into discussions on four dimensions of food security: Access; stability; availability; and utilization. Based on these findings, the authors present several potential leverage points for technology innovation. The first focuses on transportation and infrastructure along with shortening of supply chains and increased market access. The second is a concentration of national and community efforts on practical nutrition education and specific food preparation alternatives. Finally, the authors suggest that more efficient, appropriate cultivation technologies such as low-cost greenhouses could help Sierra Leone address challenges across all four dimensions of food security.","Volz, Jennifer;Canagarajah, Phoebe;Mehta, Khanjan",Conference Proceeding,"2020 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference, GHTC 2020",2020-10-29,Lehigh University,agricultural technology ;  food value chains ;  micronutrients
Conception of Twisting Satellite Dispatching System (TSDS),"In the current industrial world, companies are under great pressure from their customers who demand good quality products and services at the lowest possible costs. To do this, it has become a prerequisite to ensure good care of the production assets in order to grant the greatest equipment availability at the best performance while respecting the budget allocated. Due to the lack of flexibility and automation of equipment, enterprises are confronted with using excess quantity of raw materials to recover the losses during the production processes and this becomes a great burden to the companies because they are obliged to fix the price at a high level. Or nowadays, the automotive market is full of great competitiveness and the act of elevating the product price represents a main root cause of the loss of customers and market share to a company. It is in this regard we use the engineering skills and tools to provide an improvement of two machines used by automotive wiring firms to help them overcome the mentioned difficulties. The work presented here, has been carried out in the enterprise COFICAB KENITRA in 2018 to improve the production processes in the metal department whose activities are focused on metal part of the wires manufactured in this company especially in Twisting zone. Before launching the manufacturing, the enterprise makes budget of the quantity of raw materials to be used while twisting copper strands, but due to the lack of flexibility of the current Twisting machine, the mechanical tension applied to each copper strand during the process is not the same, there is a great variability of the characteristics of the products. Moreover, there is a wastage of raw materials due to the friction of copper strands along some pieces composing the systems. So, it is in this connection, the enterprise undergoes variations between the raw materials used and that should be used and then, the cost of cable manufacturing increases. Finally, to recover this cost rising, the product price is highly fixed, which is a risk and a threat on the development of this company. The purpose of this research was to develop and conceive a twisting system able to minimize the variability of the mechanical tension applied to the copper strands by at least 80% and to minimize the friction of those strands and some system pieces by 100%. To accomplish a such mission, we adopted a very effective method to improve the industrial problems, it's about the DMAIC (Define, M: measure, A: analyze, I: improve and C: control). After implementing the first part of the solution, we were able to attend zero friction of the strands along pebbles and the tension variability has been reduced by 70% in the whole production process. The new system we conceived was named 'Satellite Dispatching System' because the motion of cable strands crossing it resembled to the one of a satellite, and finally the project has been called 'conception of Twisting Satellite Dispatching System (TSDS)' for automotive cables manufacturing. In the first step, we made preliminary studies of the research using mathematical tools to provide a model of what was our proposition and then we made its design and simulation using CATIA V5. After implementing our solution, the whole system became 70% more stable, precise, flexible, automatic and its productivity was increased by 6.2%. This paper is a summary of practical guide to the innovation and development of the industrial world machines especially ARH630 and D632, built by NIEHOFF and are highly used in wiring companies.","Nsekuye, Jean Bosco;Elouadi, Abdelmajid;Gretete, Driss;Sghiar, Omar",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 5th International Conference on Logistics Operations Management, GOL 2020",2020-10-28,Ecole Nationale des Sciences Appliquées de Kénitra;Organization: COFICAB Kénitra,Circuit breaker ;  Contactor ;  Continuous improvement ;  Dis-connector ;  Mass ;  Mechanical tension ;  PLC ;  Strands distributor ;  Strands guider ;  Transformer

“Oil is the new data⇝: energy technology innovation in digital oil fields,"Digital oil fields (DOFs) are built on data produced from energy technology innovation during the application of new technologies to oil resource development. In this study, this conversion is examined through the paradigm switch to “oil is the new data”. An analysis of related patents shows that DOF technology is developing through convergence and close links with other industries, specifically the equipment, parts, and material industries. Additionally, it is conjectured that the strategic preemption of standards will emerge as an important policy issue because a standard must be established for the interoperability of the elemental technologies of DOFs. Furthermore, with the expansion of DOF-related technologies, device-related technologies have also been developed. Of these device-related technologies, sensor technology specifically provides new possibilities for the development of DOFs. The significance of this study is that it explains the evolution of DOFs over the course of 10 years, which is illustrative of technological innovation in the field of energy-related development and data collection.","Choi, Hae Ok;Park, Hwanll",Journal,Energies,2020-10-23,Sejong National Research Complex,Digital oil field ;  Energy policy ;  Oil exploration and production ;  Oil upstream ;  Technology innovation
Prospect of Spin-Orbitronic Devices and Their Applications,"Science, engineering, and medicine ultimately demand fast information processing with ultra-low power consumption. The recently developed spin-orbit torque (SOT)-induced magnetization switching paradigm has been fueling opportunities for spin-orbitronic devices, i.e., enabling SOT memory and logic devices at sub-nano second and sub-picojoule regimes. Importantly, spin-orbitronic devices are intrinsic of nonvolatility, anti-radiation, unlimited endurance, excellent stability, and CMOS compatibility, toward emerging applications, e.g., processing in-memory, neuromorphic computing, probabilistic computing, and 3D magnetic random access memory. Nevertheless, the cutting-edge SOT-based devices and application remain at a premature stage owing to the lack of scalable methodology on the field-free SOT switching. Moreover, spin-orbitronics poises as an interdisciplinary field to be driven by goals of both fundamental discoveries and application innovations, to open fascinating new paths for basic research and new line of technologies. In this perspective, the specific challenges and opportunities are summarized to exert momentum on both research and eventual applications of spin-orbitronic devices.","Cao, Yi;Xing, Guozhong;Lin, Huai;Zhang, Nan;Zheng, Houzhi;Wang, Kaiyou",Journal,iScience,2020-10-23,Institute of Semiconductors Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences;Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences,Applied Physics ;  Devices ;  Electronic Materials ;  Magnetic Property
Dynamic characteristics of low-concentration oxygen-containing gas explosion and prevention and control key technologies,"Low-concentration oxygen-containing gas (volume fration is less than 30%) has the risk of combustion and explosion and cannot be directly transported and utilized, which not only causes the waste of resources, but also seriously pollutes the environment.

Improving scheduling Function for IEEE802.15.4e Time Slotted Channel Hopping for Wireless Sensor Networks,"The model of modern technology called the Internet of Things (IoT), is a global network of machines and devices that are able to work and interact with one another. The Internet of Things is known as the innovation of things to come and is increasing wide concentration and enthusiasm for a wide scope of fields and studies. The idea of IPv6 over Low Energy Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) was considered to research and study the combination of programmable organization innovations and Low Energy Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. Open-source programming just as equipment stages are utilized with the testing base executed to build the organization's versatility later on. The proposed engineering gives start to finish availability by means of a 6LoWPAN passage to include IPv6 has and power-restricted gadgets the same number of remote sensor networks utilize the IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard that keeps up low force utilization and Internet capacities. Time allotment Channel Hopping (TSCH) is in actualicty a component or alteration of the Medium Access Control Protocol characterized by the IEEE 802.15.4 norm. Besides, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has incorporated with IPv6 by putting a TSCH in IEEE 802.15.4 (6TiSCH) to get explicit properties on remote sensor organizations. TSCH can exploit the booked time span to accomplish low-power activity with frequency jumping to decrease outer impedance and multi-way blurring. In spite of the fact that the TSCH standard gives a period and frequency division jumping system. In this research, we propose an improved version of TSCH in which the higher quality, lower noise channel is taken in the data transmission, and the technique of measuring clock drift between adjacent nodes, thus reducing the effective drift rate rather than resynchronizing. This greatly improves the reliability of the channel pattern for interference from wireless sensor networks.","Al-Lami, Mohammed Imad Oleiwi;Ilyas, Muhammad",Conference Proceeding,"4th International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies, ISMSIT 2020 - Proceedings",2020-10-22,Altinbas Universitesi,Channel Hopping ;  IEEE 802.15.4 ;  IoT ;  IPV6 ;  TSCH

Towards Designing an Experience-based Course around Innovation Bootcamps - A Cohort Study,"Context: This full research paper presents an experience-based course designed around a semester-long external Innovation Bootcamp activity. Objective: We sought to evaluate the impact of Innovation Bootcamp on students' learning and startup formation. To this end, we measured how the Innovation Bootcamp affected students' perceived challenges related to technical, soft project management skills and the startup formation mindset. Method: We conducted a cohort study comprising questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups with both students and stakeholders participating in the Innovation Bootcamp. In total, 44 students participated in the questionnaires run before and after the Innovation Bootcamps during both academic years. Moreover, we conducted four individual interviews (student cohort 1), four focus group interviews (student cohort 2), and six individual interviews with different stakeholders participating in the Innovation Bootcamp during both years. Results: We find that perceptions of challenges regarding soft and project management skills drop, while perceptions regarding technical skills challenges do not vary during the course. Students exhibit increased motivation to engage in startup formation following close collaboration with external stakeholders only after developing their first minimum viable product.

An open source engineering practice assistant training system based on virtual reality,"The Engineering training course takes the responsibility of cultivating students' innovation, team cooperation and practical operation ability. Now there are two ways to improve the innovation training performance in the engineering practical course. The most popular way is to carry on a project-based curriculum which has the practical training as one section of the course. Another way is to create new practice teaching methods. Our research is a combination of the project curriculum and the innovative training methods. It is focused on the Virtual reality (VR) for the engineering practice teaching. First of all, the project-based course named Comprehensive innovation training was offered for the junior or senior students. VR methods applied for the practice course was one of the projects in the course. Instructors built the initial model from the real practice situation into the virtual environment by the software Unreal Engine (UE) 4, and guided students the basic operation of the software. Then the students in the class would design the motion of the equipment based on the reality rules, finish the operating system with the VR device, and debug the program for the final application. Thirdly, this project was applied as an assistant practice method for the sophomores in their practice training class, and the students would give feedbacks to the system. Finally, when those sophomore students become juniors and seniors, they could involve in the project-based course, and contribute to the VR training project. Now the project is carried on, and the model of drilling machine and lathe machine are established in the virtual environment. The engineering practice assistant training system based on VR has already applied for the junior students, and some of feedbacks have been received. There is 81 percent of the students shown interest in the new method. As the platform depends on the open source software, and the whole project is sustainable and the system will be abundant in the next few years.","Sun, Zhibo;Zhang, Dan;Luo, Xueling;Cao, Qinghua;Li, Zhilong",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,Beihang University,Engineering Practice ;  Open Source ;  Teaching Assistant Platform ;  Virtual Reality
Building a Community for Educational Transformation in Higher Education,"This Innovation to Practice, Work-In-Progress Paper discusses efforts toward building a community for educational transformation in Higher Education led by the department of Open Learning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). MIT has a long history of implementing hands-on, science-based, problem-focused engineering education by working on authentic real-life problems. Within this context, sustainability has been and remains at the core of the MIT curriculum. In addition, Open Learning has a core mission to support educational transformation within the institution as well as around the world. In order for these goals to be fully achieved, institutional partnerships and global input are critical.In 2017 Open Learning, with support from Community Jameel, founded the Abdul Latif Jameel World Education Lab (J-WEL), a consortium of global members. Through J-WEL, MIT works with member organizations to promote excellence and transformation in education at MIT and worldwide. This paper focuses on the work taking place through one of three J-WEL subgroups, a collaborative focusing on higher education that is primarily composed of universities. By design, the J-WEL higher education collaborative members actively engage throughout the year via both online and in-person mechanisms.There are currently 20 higher education members who are working on 20 different goals regarding education transformation. Our future work includes building research partnerships between members through an innovation in education grant program, and assessing the outcomes of the collaboration facilitated by the consortium.","Reynolds-Cuellar, Julia;Stump, Glenda S.;Bagiati, Aikaterini",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,authentic challenges ;  community building ;  educational transformation ;  learning community
Going beyond traditional approaches on industrial engineering education,"This Research-to-Practice full paper refers to academic perspectives on educational innovation for industrial engineering education. Two common views prevail in educational innovation that turn into different results. One view refers to the use of pedagogical approaches to improve in-classroom students' learning. This is an operational perspective about teaching activities, instructional facilitation and the use of academic resources. The second view refers to educational value creation for students, educational partners, society and to improve the academic positioning of universities. However, both views complement each other and can articulate a holistic approach on educational innovation. To proceed in this direction, this work unfolds in three parts. First, a literature review illustrates the differences between the two complementary views. Second, a conceptual framework is provided to connect the two perspectives and guide further educational innovation efforts. Third, a descriptive and exploratory application case is offered to exemplify the framework at the MIT Supply Chain and Logistics Excellence (SCALE) Latin America Network for industrial engineering education. This work contributes to educational practice with a tool to reflect upon innovation efforts, identify instances and align initiatives with intended educational purposes.","Salinas-Navarro, David Ernesto;Mejia-Argueta, Christopher;Da Silva-Ovando, Agatha Clarice;Garay-Rondero, Claudia Lizette",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,Universidad Privada Boliviana;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Educational Innovation ;  Higher Education ;  Industrial Engineering ;  Logistics and Supply Chain Management
Skip the clicker: A narrative inquiry of a professor's 'Teaching Toolbox' for large class sizes,"This full research paper uses narrative inquiry to examine the emergent 'Teaching Toolbox' of a faculty member in an electrical and computer engineering department amid the backdrop of increasing class sizes. Four years ago, this ECE department received an NSF RED grant (Revolutionizing Engineering Departments) to enact large-scale curricular and culture change in the department over five years. The work under the grant has uncovered faculty-driven pedagogies that had formerly been at the periphery of the values held by the department - but did not receive much attention prior to the award. We use narrative inquiry to investigate the experiences of one electrical and computer engineering professor through a single case study. Our case study comprises multiple reflexive interviews contextualized within the history of the department through institutional documents and department meeting notes. This work is focused on the emergent pedagogical innovations one professor has enacted to [at least] maintain, [at most] improve, class engagement and participation as class sizes have increased. These pedagogical innovations reveal the multiple ways in which a professor has adapted their teaching practice to the institutional and departmental changes brought on in the past decade.","Nazhandali, Leyla;Ozkan, Desen S.;Reeping, David P.;Baum, Liesl;McNair, Lisa D.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Electrical and Computer Engineering;Engineering Education,electrical and computer engineering education ;  large class sizes ;  narrative inquiry
Special Session: Pathways into Engineering Education Research,"Our project explores a holistic approach to understand the identity transformation of traditional engineering faculty to engage with engineering education research. This work is part of a larger project that seeks to understand best practices of mentor-mentee relationships between engineering education researchers and engineering faculty entering the EER field. The overall project is a mixed methods study with Cognitive Apprentice Model (CAM) as the guiding framework [1]. In an effort to increase the community of engineering education researchers conducting engineering education research and to support research in the professional formation of engineers (PFE), the NSF has awarded Research Initiation in Engineering Formation (RIEF) grants to engineering faculty with little or no experience conducting social science research. The RIEF grants support a two-year collaborative research project where the engineering faculty member is mentored by one or more engineering education researchers. Since 2016, the PFE: RIEF program has supported over 35 projects across over 40 institutions. Engineering faculty are the primary educators of future engineers but are often not trained in engineering education research or approaches to implement research based instructional strategies (RBIS) despite the potential benefit to student development and outcomes. Therefore it is important to understand how engineering faculty are trained in engineering education research by engineering education researchers to promote synergistic activities between these two communities. Engineering faculty may not identify as engineering education researchers and failure in implementation or achieving less than the desired student outcomes can also hinder faculty motivation to adopt instructional innovation [2]. Overcoming these barriers and successfully training engineering faculty as engineering education researchers will expand and diversify engineering education research community. As more engineering faculty join the engineering education community they will bring new perspectives and ideas, and will promote collaboration between engineering education researchers and engineering practitioners.

"Innovators, Learners, and Surveyors: Clustering Students in an Innovation-Based Learning Course","This full research paper aims to better understand how students create and innovate. As technology and the world around us rapidly evolve, engineers must rise to meet the needs of a future that we might not be able to even imagine yet. In order to prepare engineering students to meet future needs, it is imperative that they are given opportunities to grow in their technical abilities, but also their creativity and critical thinking. However, these skills can be difficult to teach and assess because they can manifest differently in all students. Therefore, this work aims to better understand how students approach open-ended problems, specifically in an upper level engineering course. In order to keep track of their progress and demonstrate their learning, all students uploaded self-created learning objectives and corresponding deliverables to an online platform. Clustering algorithms were then applied to the data and four clusters emerged: Innovators, Learners, Surveyors, and Surface Level. These clusters were then defined in the context of the Cynefin Framework, Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning, and Webb's Depth of Knowledge. By observing which students fell into each of the clusters, how they moved amongst the clusters, and key words associated with each cluster, we were able to better understand how students approach the process of innovation.","Singelmann, Lauren;Alvarez, Enrique;Swartz, Ellen;Pearson, Mary;Striker, Ryan;Ewert, Dan",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,NDSU College of Engineering,clustering ;  experiential learning ;  innovation
A Comprehensive Experiment to Enhance Multidisciplinary Engineering Ability via UAVs Visual Navigation,"This Research to Practice WIP presents a UAVs visual navigation based comprehensive experiment to enhance multidisciplinary engineering ability in Aerospace engineering education. In traditional courses, aerospace-related disciplines are independently distributed in different courses, and there is rarely a hands-on platform which includes signal processing, control theory, and artificial intelligence into Aerospace engineering. Facing this problem, this paper designs a multidisciplinary comprehensive experiment, aiming to provide a hand-on platform and flexible project-based program to students of aerospace engineering professions. First of all, in order to let the students understand actual aerospace problems, a multidisciplinary simulation platform containing UAVs and remote objects scenarios is constructed for them to explore in the experiments. Second, the content of the experiment is designed into three stages including data acquisition and processing, conceptual design and simulation, in-flight validation, during which the multidisciplinary engineering ability runs through the whole process of the activities. Finally, Project Oriented Design Based Learning is also introduced here to combine engineering design education with innovation and creativity. Through the project demonstration and presentation at the end of the experiment, the multidisciplinary engineering ability of each student can be effectively evaluated. The UVN comprehensive experiment enables students to work on real-world aerospace engineering problems through a hardware-software integration framework, which may greatly stimulate their curiosity and interest in autonomously learning. It also provides students unprecedented opportunities to immerse themselves in projects that cross disciplinary boundaries, improve their professional ability and enhance their exploration competence in aerospace areas.","Li, Lu;Luo, Xiaoyan;Wan, Han;Wu, Chengxi;Zheng, Yu;Zhou, Fugen",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,Beihang University,Aerospace Engineering ;  Comprehensive Experiment ;  Multidisciplinary Engineering Ability ;  UAVs Visual Navigation
Introducing Autonomy in an Embedded Systems Course Project,"This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents the redesign of a course project to promote student professional formation in engineering in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Iowa State University. This is part of a larger effort to redesign core courses in the sophomore and junior years through a collaborative instructional model and pedagogical approaches that promote professional formation. A required sophomore course on embedded computer systems has been assessed and revised over multiple semesters. The redesign of the project was initiated with the purpose of promoting student professional formation, interest, autonomy and innovation, and it was undertaken using a collaborative process. This paper describes the course, final project, redesign process, assessment, results and future work. Several conclusions from the research may be useful to other educators. A small change to the course project yielded positive effects in interest and autonomy and may influence longer term effects of the project. There was evidence of difference in engagement with the project. The difference observed was not only due to option selected by students but why students selected the option.","Rover, Diane T.;Fila, Nicholas D.;Jones, Phillip H.;Mina, Mani",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,College of Engineering;Iowa State University,embedded systems ;  engineering design projects ;  innovation ;  student autonomy
Engaging Pre-Service Teachers in Front-End Design: Developing Technology for a Social Studies Classroom,"This research full paper presents front-end design activity with social studies pre-service teachers to inform the design of data visualization technology tools. Data visualizations are powerful tools that social studies teachers use to explore the narratives they want their students to learn. They can serve as evidence for historical arguments and prompts that start students on a path of inquiry. The ability to analyze, interpret, evaluate, and use data and data visualizations - known as data literacy - has become an increasingly important component of K-12 social studies education in recent years.While there are many technological innovations that have been developed to support engineering education in K-12 classrooms, adoption of these tools has been low. Our hypothesis is that adoption may improve if teachers are involved in the front-end design process of technology intended for use in their classrooms. This work describes the results of two Participatory Design (PD) sessions about data visualization with pre-service social studies teachers.In our design sessions, thirty-two pre-service teachers evaluated programming and non-programming data visualization experiences, and then told us what they would like in future data visualization tools. The Minimal Manual was used as a guide in the design of the activity sheets to scaffold use of the tools. After each PD session, we used conjecture mapping to process and analyze the data.Although there were minor design differences in the two PD sessions, the pre-service teachers' evaluations were surprisingly different from one another. These results suggest that PD sessions might be highly idiosyncratic, and we cannot reliably generalize from just a single PD session. We found that secondary focused pre-service teachers tended to be more interested in the data visualization tools than elementary focused pre-service teachers. Further sessions and analysis are necessary to make more reliable conclusions about the characteristics pre-service social studies teachers would like to see in a pedagogical tool they would consider adopting in their classroom. Our work informs other researchers who are considering PD for developing K-12 education interventions.","Naimipour, Bahare;Guzdial, Mark;Shreiner, Tamara",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Grand Valley State University",conjecture map ;  data literacy ;  K-12 ;  participatory design ;  programming technology tools ;  teacher adoption
Perspectives on the use of Serious-Storytelling for Creative Thinking Awareness in Engineering,"This Research-to-Practice Full Paper discusses the use of the Serious-Storytelling approach for enhancing soft skills that are decisive for the development of new job opportunities for young engineers. Multifarious international organizations, in their recent reports, emphasize the need to include new cognitive tools for developing the soft skills that Gen Z engineers need due, on the one hand, to the strong consolidation of social media, which shows an unexpected difference in the way recent graduates view the world and define themselves; and on the other hand, to the exponential development of the technology that was made accessible to them. Serious-Storytelling cognitive tools were adapted for the design of critical reading and critical writing co-curricular activities and were included as active learning experiences in different engineering programs. The research was conducted based upon a 4-group Solomon methodology with a quantitative design. To assess creative thinking competencies, different evaluation instruments were used for PreTests and PostTest, including several fluency and originality tests, as well as storytelling articulateness ability tests and modified VALUE rubrics of the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU).The obtained results showed that the designed Serious-Storytelling approach promoted a better understanding of scientific concepts in engineering subjects, a higher capability to develop rising demand skill sets and a stronger creative thinking competence awareness.","Caratozzolo, Patricia;Alvarez-Delgado, Alvaro;Hosseini, Samira",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Vicerrectoria de Investigacion y Transferencia de Tecnologia,Creative thinking ;  Educational Innovation ;  Higher Education ;  Serious-Storytelling ;  Soft skills in engineering
Exploring the effect of standards-based grading on student learning,"This is a Research to Practice Full Paper. Standards-based grading (SBG) is an assessment framework that rewards students for demonstrating mastery of course learning objectives. It also calls for feedback on formative assessments that allow students to target their deficiencies in a course area without being entangled with other confounding factors commonly found in summative assessments like test-taking aptitude or even class attendance. SBG is closely related to mastery learning and stands in contrast to traditional points-based grading methods that average a student's performance over time (and topics), and some research suggests that SBG-based courses, when ideally implemented, can lead to increased standardized test scores and enhanced retention of course learning objectives over time.In this work, we describe our experience attempting to implement SBG in a sophomore-level Continuous-Time Signals and Systems course offered by an Electrical Engineering Department. For our implementation, the data show that student learning of course topics is comparable between the experimental SBG section (N = 33) and a control traditional points-based grading section (N = 34) as measured by performance on a Continuous-Time Systems and Signals Concept Inventory pretest and posttest. Additionally, student opinion of the SBG class was mixed as reported in end-of-term evaluations; in these evaluations, students judged the SBG course to be less educationally effective than the traditional section.In this paper, we present the full results of this experiment and explore reasons why our SBG implementation did not achieve the improved student outcomes found in other research. Through this work, we hope to help other educators avoid common pitfalls and mistakes that can hamper implementations of this promising classroom innovation.","McKell, K.

STEM initatives in K-12 public education: A review of innovative practices in the US state of Oklahoma,"This innovative practice paper presents initiatives in the US state of Oklahoma that seek to link STEM education in K-12 public schools to post-secondary programs. In recent years, government agencies in Oklahoma have spearheaded numerous collaborative partnerships among secondary schools, career and technical institutions, and community-based organizations. The primary goal of these partnerships has been to provide coordinated education and training for students in STEM in ways that can increase the numbers of students graduating post-secondary institutions with advanced degrees and certifications in computing and engineering fields. This presentation examines innovative programs in Oklahoma that have unfolded through collaborative partnerships in recent years by exploring new curricular designs, experiential learning initiatives, capacity-building investments, and organizational restructuring that have undergirded school, university, and community partnerships in STEM education in Oklahoma. These programs not only attempt to provide high-quality learning experiences but also aim to support student transitions to post-secondary institutions. This presentation considers preliminary research on the academic, social, and economic outcomes for these programmatic innovations and considers what lessons can be drawn from these initiatives.","Ballard, Keith",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2020-10-21,The University of Oklahoma,computing and engineering education ;  pre-engineering models ;  STEM
Inserting Co and P into MoS<inf>2</inf>photocathodes: enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic performance by activating edges and basal planes with sulfur vacancies,"The production of hydrogen using solar energy via a photoelectrochemical system is an effective technique for meeting present clean energy needs. Owing to the small bandgap and highly negative conduction band edge (-0.46 V) of Si, it is considered a promising photocathode material for solar hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, because of sluggish HER kinetics on the Si surface, bare Si electrodes have a high overpotential. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted wide interest as a promising alternative to Pt-based catalysts for producing hydrogen. Nevertheless, it suffers from sluggish kinetics for driving the process of HER because of its inert basal plane. Herein, HER performance was enhanced by doping a metal (cobalt) and a nonmetal (phosphorus) into MoS2. Doping MoS2 (CoPO-MoS2) on Si photocathodes with cobalt and phosphorous provides a current density of about 21.6 mA cm-2 at 0 V (vs. RHE) and a reduced Tafel value of 54.3 mV dec-1. The doped catalyst shows good stability up to 3 h with retention of about 85%. The flat surface of the Si photocathode has been chemically etched into pyramidal structures (SiMP) to reduce the loss due to reflection and enhance the catalytically active surface. Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure reveal that Co and P strongly coordinated with the MoS2 materials. Furthermore, the catalytic performance was enhanced by the defect sites on MoS2, thereby stimulating more S vacancies on the basal planes and S-edge sites. Defect engineering will hopefully provide a new research direction for the innovation and development of more active sites of CoPO-MoS2.

Building high-performing and integrated project teams,"Purpose: Effective inter-organisational relationships are key to engendering innovation and ensuring the successful delivery of infrastructure projects. Relationship-based contracts are thus widely used to stimulate best-for-project ideals and attenuate the otherwise adversarial relationship that often exists between clients and contractors. This study examines the effectiveness and limitations of a project facilitation model as coaching tool for developing conducive inter-organisational relationships for construction project delivery. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a case-study approach using evidence from triangulated data sources of focus group workshops, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Findings: (1) The facilitation model enabled an environment for psychological safety to be developed, which engendered a platform for effective cooperation for problem-solving and achieving quasi best-for-project ideals. (2) The model provides the mechanism to develop team behaviours that support enhanced performance and create an environment less adversarial and more collaborative than traditional contracting. Originality/value: The novelty of this research is that relationship-based principles have been utilised as part of a traditional design-bid-build contract with lump-sum payment arrangements.","Ahiaga-Dagbui, Dominic D.;Tokede, Olubukola;Morrison, John;Chirnside, Anthony",Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2020-10-21,Frontline Coach Pty Ltd;Deakin University;Infrastructure Delivery,Coaching ;  Project facilitation ;  Project success ;  Psychological safety ;  Social capital theory ;  Team performance ;  Trust
A Systematic Mapping Study on Software Testing for Systems-of-Systems,"Context: Smart Cities and other Systems-of-Systems (SoS) have attracted attention due to their potential for innovation in the services provided to the society. SoS are composed of several independent systems and often support critical domains. As such, failures can cause serious damage or even financial losses that can be avoided by performing quality assurance (QA). Among QA techniques, software testing is an essential activity that checks software behaviors against a subset of parameters. However, testing SoS can be even more complex since several other factors further elevate the complexity of the test, such as interoperability links and multiple independent systems. Goal: Our goal in this paper is to analyze the current state of research on software testing for SoS domain. Method: A protocol was formulated and executed according to the guidelines for performing systematic literature mappings in Software Engineering. Results: This study identified the tools, approaches, methods and processes that the literature has addressed to test SoS. Conclusions: Software Testing for SoS still faces several problems and presents many questions to be answered, particularly in the definition of processes and metrics.","Lopes, Vinicius Carvalho;Norberto, Marcus;Douglas Winston, R.

Recent advances on self-healing of bituminous materials by the action of encapsulated rejuvenators,"Self-healing of bituminous materials represents nowadays a promising approach to increasing the lifespan of asphalt pavements. During the last decade, different techniques have been used by researchers to promote the self-healing capability of bituminous materials: crack-healing by externally triggered heating using magnetic field technologies, such as induction heating and microwave radiation, and, more recently, the use of embedded encapsulated rejuvenators to activate crack-healing through the recovery of the original properties of bitumen. During recent years, researchers have mainly focused their efforts on promoting the autonomic healing of bituminous materials by the action of encapsulated rejuvenating agents. This article presents an extensive and critical literature review of the processes of ageing, recovering and self-healing of bituminous materials, focusing on the use of rejuvenating agents to extend the life of pavements. Therefore, the different types and techniques to encapsulate rejuvenators, their evolution over the years, and their main applications in bituminous materials were analysed from a multiscale approach. Finally, based on the current trends in materials engineering, this article proposes advances and innovations to improve the future research in the field of encapsulated rejuvenators to promote asphalt self-healing, from a more sustainable point of view.","Gonzalez-Torre, Irene;Norambuena-Contreras, José",Journal,Construction and Building Materials,2020-10-20,Universidad del Bio Bio,Asphalt self-healing ;  Bituminous materials ;  Crack-healing capability ;  Encapsulated rejuvenators
TERRE project: Interplay between unsaturated soil mechanics and low-carbon geotechnical engineering,"The geotechnical construction industry is a major component of the overall construction sector and is strategically important in infrastructure development (transportation, flood and landslide protection, building foundations, waste disposal). Although industry and research in the overall construction sector have been investing significantly in recent years to produce innovative low-carbon technologies, little innovation has been created in geotechnical construction industry, which is lagging behind other construction industry sectors. This paper discusses the interplay between low-carbon geotechnical engineering and unsaturated soil mechanics based on the research carried out within the project TERRE (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks funded by the European Commission, 2015-2019,H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015-675762).","Tarantino, Alessandro;El Mountassir, Grainne;Wheeler, Simon;Gallipoli, Domenico;Russo, Giacomo;Augarde, Charles;Urciuoli, Gianfranco;Pirone, Marianna;Stokes, Alexia;Van De Kuilen, Jan Willem;Gard, Wolfgang;Fourcaud, Thierry;Romero, Enrique;Priegue, Angel;Smith, Colin C.;Larrey-Lassalle, Pyrène;Becker, Patrick;Ferrari, Alessio;Dainese, Roberta;Salifu, Emmanuel;Beber, Raniero;Scarfone, Riccardo;Cuccurullo, Alessia;Coudert, Elodie;Dias, Sofia;Mmuguda-Viswanath, Sravan;Rossi, Lorenzo M.W.;Kamath, Abhijith;Fraccica, Alessandro;Karagianni, Pavlina;González Castejón, Javier;Ouakka, Slimane;Zannin, Jacopo;Speranza, Gianluca",Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2020-10-16,"NOBATEK/INEF4, France;LimitState Ltd;Botanique & Modélisation de l'Architecture des Plantes et des Végétations;Université de Montpellier;Centre Internacional de Mètodes Numèrics en Enginyeria(CIMNE);École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour;Università degli Studi di Genova;University of Strathclyde;Durham University;Università degli Studi di Palermo;Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II;Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya;Delft University of Technology;The University of Sheffield;Universita di Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale;University of Glasgow;Kempfert Geotechnik GmbH",
Insights collaboration space: A team collaboration app for the design of data-driven services,"Next to technical expertise, the ability to effectively communicate and collaborate with a large number of different stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds has always been one of the vital skills of good software architects. So far, software architects have had to mainly interact with domain experts, UX designers, managers, testers, operators, and developers, with developers being one of the most important stakeholder groups for them. In the future, we believe, there will be a new group of stakeholders equally important to developers: data scientists. So the ability to effectively communicate and collaborate with data scientists will become a paramount skill of software architects. Data-driven services will be a large driver for innovation and new business models in the upcoming years. However, the design of those services in a quality that is acceptable to users will require much closer collaboration of the different disciplines than in traditional software engineering projects. In terms of software engineering, it is crucial to facilitate this challenging cross-disciplinary collaboration in the best possible way. As a result of a research cooperation between John Deere and Fraunhofer IESE, we contribute the ICSpace app, an insights collaboration space for cross-disciplinary teams jointly working on the design of data-driven services.","Braun, Susanne;Trapp, Marcus;Nass, Claudia;Gerbershagen, Matthias;Schweitzer, Stefan;Falcão, Rodrigo;Naab, Matthias;Schweitzer, Markus;Kreutzer, Torsten;Wire, Nikolaus",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2020 - Companion Proceedings",2020-10-16,Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering IESE;John Deere,Collaboration ;  Cross-functional teams ;  Data-driven services

Towards Precision Vaccines: Lessons From the Second International Precision Vaccines Conference,"Other than clean drinking water, vaccines have been the most effective public health intervention in human history, yet their full potential is still untapped. To date, vaccine development has been largely limited to empirical approaches focused on infectious diseases and has targeted entire populations, potentially disregarding distinct immunity in vulnerable populations such as infants, elders, and the immunocompromised. Over the past few decades innovations in genetic engineering, adjuvant discovery, formulation science, and systems biology have fueled rapid advances in vaccine research poised to consider demographic factors (e.g., age, sex, genetics, and epigenetics) in vaccine discovery and development. Current efforts are focused on leveraging novel approaches to vaccine discovery and development to optimize vaccinal antigen and, as needed, adjuvant systems to enhance vaccine immunogenicity while maintaining safety. These approaches are ushering in an era of precision vaccinology aimed at tailoring immunization for vulnerable populations with distinct immunity. To foster collaboration among leading vaccinologists, government, policy makers, industry partners, and funders from around the world, the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital hosted the 2nd International Precision Vaccines Conference (IPVC) at Harvard Medical School on the 17th–18th October 2019. The conference convened experts in vaccinology, including vaccine formulation and adjuvantation, immunology, cell signaling, systems biology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, as well as vaccines for non-infectious indications such as cancer and opioid use disorder. Herein we review highlights from the 2nd IPVC and discuss key concepts in the field of precision vaccines.","Soni, Dheeraj;Van Haren, Simon D.;Idoko, Olubukola T.;Evans, Jay T.;Diray-Arce, Joann;Dowling, David J.;Levy, Ofer",Journal,Frontiers in Immunology,2020-10-15,London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine;Boston Children's Hospital;University of Montana;Harvard Medical School;Broad Institute,adjuvants ;  formulations ;  International Precision Vaccines Conference ;  non-infectious diseases ;  precision vaccines ;  systems biology ;  vaccinologists ;  vulnerable populations

"The Pransky interview: Dr. Hugh Herr – Professor, MIT Media Lab; Director, Biomechatronics Group and Co-director, MIT Center for Extreme Bionics; Founder, BionX Medical Technologies Inc.","Purpose: The following paper is a “Q&A interview” conducted by Joanne Pransky of Industrial Robot Journal as a method to impart the combined technological, business and personal experience of a prominent, robotic industry PhD-turned successful innovator and entrepreneur regarding the commercialization and challenges of bringing his technological inventions to market. This paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Considered one of the top biomechatronics researchers in the world, Dr Hugh Herr heads the MIT Biomechatronics Research Group and Center for Extreme Bionics. His research programs seek to advance technologies that promise to accelerate the merging of body and machine, including device architectures that resemble the body’s musculoskeletal design, actuator technologies that behave like muscle and control methodologies that exploit principles of biological movement. Herr’s methods encompass a diverse set of scientific and technological disciplines that are advancing an emerging field of engineering science that applies principles of biomechanics and neural control to guide the designs of human rehabilitation and augmentative devices. Findings: As a teenager, Herr was a highly competitive mountain climber until he had to have both legs amputated below the knees after suffering severe frostbite during a 1982 mountain expedition at the age of 17. As a result of this experience, he directed his efforts and talent to try to improve the mobility of people with disabilities. He graduated in physics in 1990 from the Millersville University (Pennsylvania). He subsequently earned a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1993 and a PhD in Biophysics at Harvard University in 1998. He then was a postdoctoral fellow in medical devices at MIT. He was Assistant Professor at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Harvard Medical School. Since 2000, he has been heading the MIT Biomechatronics Group within the Media Lab and has been Co-directing the Lab’s Center for Extreme Bionics since 2014. To bring his inventions to market, Herr founded a spin-off company out of MIT under the name iWalk in 2007, which was relaunched as BionX Medical Technologies Inc. in 2015, and acquired by Ottobock in 2017. Originality/value: Herr is a world leader and inventor in the field of bionics and biomechanics whose research accomplishments have already made a significant impact on physically challenged people. Herr has produced several groundbreaking products, starting with a computer-controlled artificial knee in 2003, called the Rheo Knee™ System and commercialized by Össur Inc. He also designed his own bionic lower legs, the world’s first powered ankle-foot prosthesis to emulate the action of a biological leg and, for the first time, provides amputees with a natural gait. The Empower ankle system is now marketed by Ottobock. He is presently working on NeuroEmbodied Design methodology to restore proprioception to amputees. Herr has received major accolades including the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Leadership Award (2005), the Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment (2007) and R&D Magazine’s 14th Innovator of the Year Award (2014) and a No Barriers Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2013 No Barriers Summit. His innovations were listed twice among TIME magazine’s Top Ten Inventions (2004; 2007) and which called him “Leader of the Bionic Age” in 2011. His life story has been told in the book Second Ascent: The Story of Hugh Herr (1991) and in the film Ascent: The Story of Hugh Herr, made in 2002 by National Geographic.

Exploring Factors Surrounding Students’ Entrepreneurial Intentions in Medical Informatics: The Theory of Planning Behavior Perspective,"The implementation of entrepreneurship and innovation within the health informatics scientific community is comparatively sluggish when compared to other disciplines such as computer science and engineering. The purpose of this paper is to explore the cognitive processes involved in developing intentions to endorse entrepreneurial behaviors via discovering entrepreneurial awareness as a significant influence on an individual’s intentions to identify and adventure market opportunities. In this conceptual paper, insights from Ajzen’s Theory of Planning Behavior (TPB) coupled with self-efficacy beliefs are utilized to develop hypotheses from our research questions. TPB has often been applied to entrepreneurial studies, but for the voluminous body of research devoted to intentions, little has delved into the cognitive processes whereby people develop intentions to entrepreneurial behaviors. Thus, our extended framework can better understand the factors behind entrepreneurial intentions. This research uses a survey tool as a structured questionnaire to explore students’ perceptions of entrepreneurial behavior. The source of the questionnaire is to survey many students from different types of universities in Taiwan. This method allowed respondents to clarify and pose questions. Of the 154 web questionnaires distributed till end of June, 120 were returned, constituting a response rate of 77.9% and Common Method Variance (CMV) had checked. Our results suggest that measuring self-efficacy beliefs in tandem with attitudes toward entrepreneurship provides a better analytical model based on the TPB. The R-Square is 41.2% for full model. Moreover, the results help understand entrepreneurial intentions specifically applied to the medical informatics (MI) field which has been under researched. Finally, this study also can guide educators in their efforts to reinforce entrepreneurial behaviors in entrepreneurship education, for example, awareness creation or attractiveness.","Wu, Wen Hsiung;Wei, Chun Wang;Yu, Min Chun;Kao, Hao Yun",Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,2020-10-06,National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology;Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital;Kaohsiung Medical University,entrepreneurial education ;  entrepreneurship ;  intention ;  medical informatics ;  theory of planning behavior
What Do Patents Tell Us about the Implementation of Green and Sustainable Chemistry?,"The pursuit of greener, more sustainable chemistry has increased over the past 20 years, and there are now multiple journals, books, conferences, and workshops produced every year. With all this activity, it is important to step back and assess the extent to which green and sustainable chemistry research is being translated to commercial applications. There have been several studies of the patent literature in the past that have addressed the question of if green chemistry is affecting government policy and which areas of innovation are being advanced from a green and sustainable chemistry perspective. None of these studies have addressed the details of the chemistry or the areas of societal concern that have prompted green and sustainable chemistry research in academia. This study has attempted to answer the question of if green and sustainable chemistry is being translated into patentable innovations, in which areas, and to what extent.","Constable, David J.C.",Journal,ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,2020-10-05,American Chemical Society,Green ;  Green chemistry ;  Patent ;  Patents ;  Sustainable ;  Sustainable chemistry

invisaWear: evolving the entrepreneurial mind-set,"Theoretical basis: Why do some individuals become entrepreneurs while others do not? This fundamental question has vexed entrepreneurship scholars for some time, giving rise to various schools of thought. Traditional economic motivation theories, for example, suggest that entrepreneurial opportunities arise from changes in either supply (Shane, 2000) or demand (Dew et al., 2004) and emphasize personal economic gain as a motivator for pursuing entrepreneurship. Both neoclassical equilibrium and psychological theories take a person-centric perspective whereby stable, enduring differences among people’s characteristics, determines who becomes an entrepreneur. Opportunity recognition may be enhanced through perspective taking (i.e. putting oneself in the shoes of another person) (Prandelli et al., 2016). Research methodology: The founders of the company provided us with access to the inner workings of the company, their mentors and advisors and themselves. This study used archival research and interviews when preparing this case. Interviews allow for the development of uncensored, real-life insights into the entrepreneur’s business experience. The authors first conducted a 90-min interview with Rajia and Ray at DifferenceMaker® Central on the UMass Lowell campus. DifferenceMaker® provided us with pictures and timelines from when Rajia and Ray participated in the various DifferenceMaker® activities and competitions. A follow-on 90-min interview was conducted with the founders four months later at the UMass Lowell Innovation Hub to delve deeper into their transition from engineers to entrepreneurs. Case overview/synopsis: In the summer of 2016, the future of invisaWear suddenly became uncertain. Rajia Abdelaziz and Ray Hamilton had conceived an idea for smart jewelry that they felt solved a real problem. But it was one thing to have a great idea and quite another to turn that idea into a real business. As engineering students, they were accustomed to solving problems, but if they truly wanted to make an impact, they had to learn to solve problems as entrepreneurs. With the help of DifferenceMaker® and their mentors, they developed an entrepreneurial mind-set and decided to build invisaWear into a company. Complexity academic level: This case is suitable for an undergraduate course in business or entrepreneurship. This case is intended to illustrate to both business and non-business students how individuals with different backgrounds can become entrepreneurs. Presented as a real-life example of how engineering students can make the transition to an entrepreneurial mind-set, the case can also be used to hone in on select topics including opportunity recognition, problem-solving, ideation and the business model canvas.","Santos, Roberto S.;Sun, Sunny Li;Luo, Xiaoyi",Journal,CASE Journal,2020-10-02,University of Massachusetts Lowell;Lanzhou University,Entrepreneurial mind-set ;  Entrepreneurial opportunities ;  New venture creation

Preventing patent risks in artificial intelligence industry for sustainable development: A multi-level network analysis,"In recent years, assessing patent risks has attracted fast-growing attention from both researchers and practitioners in studies of technological innovation. Following the existing literature on risks and intellectual property (IP) risks, we define patent risks as the lack of understanding of the distribution of patents that lead to losing a key patent, increased research and development costs, and, potentially, infringement litigation. This paper aims to propose an explorative approach to investigating patent risks in the target technology field by integrating social network analysis and patent analysis. Compared to previous research, this study makes an important contribution toward identifying patent risks in the overall technological field by employing a patent-based multi-level network model that has not appeared in existing methodologies of patent risks. In order to verify the effectiveness of this approach, we take artificial intelligence (AI) as an example. Data collected from the Derwent Innovation Index (DII) database were used to build the patent-based multi-level network on patent risks from market, technology, and assignee perspectives. The results indicate that the lack of international collaborations among assignees and industry–university–research collaboration may lead to patent collaboration risks. Regarding patent market risks, the lack of overseas patent applications, especially the lack of distribution in the main competitive markets, is a key factor. As for patent technology risks, most of the leading assignees lack awareness of the distribution in the following technological fields: industrial electric equipment, engineering instrumentation, and automotive electrics. In summary, assignees from the U.S. with first mover advantages are still powerful leaders in the AI technology field. Although China is catching up very rapidly in the total number of AI patents, the apparent patent risks under the perspectives of collaboration, market, and technology will obviously hamper the catch-up efforts of China’s AI industry. We conclude that, in practice, the proposed patent-based multi-level network model not only plays an important role in helping stakeholders in the AI technological field to prevent patent risks, find new technology opportunities, and obtain sustainable development, but also has significance for guiding the industrial development of various emerging technology fields.","Yang, Xi;Yu, Xiang",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-10-02,Huazhong University of Science and Technology;Zhongnan University of Economics and Law,Artificial intelligence ;  Multi-level network ;  Patent analysis ;  Patent risk ;  Social network analysis ;  Sustainable development
Factors influencing private hospitals’ participation in the innovation of biomedical engineering industry: A perspective of evolutionary game theory,"The innovation of the biomedical engineering (BME) industry is inseparable from its cooperation with medical institutions. China has considerable medical institutions. Although private hospitals account for more than half of Chinese medical institutions, they rarely participate in biomedical engineering industry innovation. This paper analyzed the collaborative relationship among biomedical engineering enterprises, universities, research institutes, public hospitals and private hospitals through evolutionary game theory and discussed the influence of different factors on the collaborative innovation among them. A tripartite evolutionary game model is established which regards private hospitals as a stakeholder. The results show that (1) the good credit of private hospitals has a positive effect on their participation in collaborative innovation; (2) it is helpful for BME collaborative innovation to enhance the collaborative innovation ability of partners; (3) the novelty of innovation projects has an impact on BME collaborative innovation. The specific impacts depend on the revenue, cost and risk allocation ratio of innovation partners; (4) the higher the practicability of innovation projects, the more conducive to collaborative innovation.","Liu, Weiwei;Yang, Jianing;Bi, Kexin",Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2020-10-02,Queen's University Belfast;Harbin University of Science and Technology;Harbin Engineering University,Biomedical engineering ;  Collaborative innovation ;  Evolutionary game theory ;  Private hospitals

"Successful clean energy technology transitions in emerging economies: Learning from India, China, and Brazil","Technological innovation and widespread deployment of clean-energy technologies in emerging economies are critical for a global clean energy transition. Success or failure in this endeavour will have long-term energy and carbon consequences. A fundamental question exists about whether, and how, emerging economies can accelerate clean-energy transitions, given the unprecedented scales of their impending socio-economic and infrastructure transitions, and often-underdeveloped technological innovation capabilities and supporting finances. We reflect on this question by undertaking a retrospective analysis of past and recent large-scale rapid clean-energy technology transitions in the three largest emerging economies-of light emitting diodes in India, solar photovoltaics in China, and sugarcane ethanol fuel in Brazil-each of which grew out of an unexpected set of initial technological conditions and resulted in dramatic changes to the global technological landscape. In examining how each country overcame its conventional technological lag, we discuss synthetic lessons for accelerated clean-energy transitions in emerging economy contexts: the essential role of PSEs in leveraging economies of scale; complementarities between domestic policies and global value chains; and the continued importance of domestic R&D and academia-industry linkages. We argue that forging clean-energy pathways requires a holistic systems approach, with a shift from isolated policy approaches to a portfolio of coordinated innovation policies where demand, research and development, and manufacturing are all strategically developed.","Khosla, Radhika;Kamat, Ajinkya Shrish;Narayanamurti, Venkatesh",Journal,Progress in Energy,2020-10-01,Harvard John A.

On BRT spread around the world: Analysis of some particular cities,"The goal of civil engineering has always been the research and implementation of methods, technologies, and infrastructures to improve the community’s quality of life. One of the branches of civil engineering that has the strongest effect on progress is transport. The quality of transport has a profound economic and social impact on our communities regarding trade (freight transport) and city livability (public transport systems). However, innovation is not the only way to improve the features above-mentioned, especially public transport, considering that it is usually beneficial to enhance and repurpose vehicles with appropriate adjustments to offer more efficient services. Other perspectives that influence public transport systems are the costs and times of design and construction, maintenance, operating costs, and environmental impact, especially concerning CO2 emissions. Considering these issues, among the various types of existing public transport systems, those of the so-called Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) offer worthwhile results. The BRT system is a type of public road transport operated by bus on reserved lanes, and it is significantly profitable, especially from an economic point of view, in areas where there are existing bus routes. Nonetheless, for the construction of works minimization, it is closely linked to other features that improve its usefulness, depending on the vehicles’ quality such as capacity, but above all, the propulsion or driving autonomy that would guarantee high efficiency. This paper introduces an analysis of some BRT systems operating worldwide, presenting the background, general technical features, and the correlation with autonomous vehicles.","Trubia, Salvatore;Severino, Alessandro;Curto, Salvatore;Arena, Fabio;Pau, Giovanni",Journal,Infrastructures,2020-10-01,"Università degli Studi di Enna ""Kore"";Università degli Studi di Catania",Autonomous vehicles ;  BRT ;  Mass transit ;  Public transport ;  Smart city

"TEMPO and TRAJECTORY of the BUILT LANDSCAPE on TA'U ISLAND, MANU'A GROUP, American Samoa: INTEGRATING EXTENSIVE RADIOCARBON DATING with JOINT POSTERIOR MODELING","Stone and earthen architecture is nearly ubiquitous in the archaeological record of Pacific islands. The construction of this architecture is tied to a range of socio-political processes, and the temporal patterning of these features is useful for understanding the rate at which populations grew, innovation occurred, and social inequality emerged. Unfortunately, this temporal patterning is poorly understood for many areas of the region, including the Samoan archipelago. Here, we describe a project directed toward establishing a robust chronology for the construction of these earthen and stone terraces and linear mounds on Ta'u Island. Using recent methodological improvements, we highlight the tempo at which different architectural types were constructed on the island and the implications for understanding demographic expansion and changing land tenure practices in the last 1500 years. This research suggests the construction of architecture was largely confined to the 2nd millennium AD with a small number of terraces plausibly built in the 1st millennium AD. This temporal patterning suggests that a reconfiguration of settlement patterns occurred within West Polynesia as people there moved into other regions of Oceania.","Quintus, Seth;Huebert, Jennifer;Day, Stephanie;Lincoln, Noa;Yoo, Kyungsoo;Lee, Tiffany;Filimoehala, Darby;Autufuga, Dolly",Journal,Radiocarbon,2020-10-01,North Dakota State University;University of Minnesota Twin Cities;International Archaeological Research Institute Incorporated;University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa;Sunrise Archaeology,Bayesian modeling ;  landscape engineering ;  Oceania ;  settlement change
On the integration of early health technology assessment in the innovation process: Reflections from five stakeholders,"Early health technology assessment (HTA), which includes all methods used to inform industry and other stakeholders about the potential value of new medical products in development, including methods to quantify and manage uncertainty, has seen many applications in recent years. However, it is still unclear how such early value assessments can be integrated into the technology innovation process. This commentary contributes to the discussion on the purposes early HTA can serve. Similarities and differences in the perspectives of five stakeholders (i.e., the hospital, the patient, the assessor, the medical device industry, and the policy maker) on the purpose, value, and potential challenges of early HTA are described. All five stakeholders agreed that integrating early HTA in the innovation process has the possibility to shape and refine an innovation, and inform research and development decisions. The early assessment, using a variety of methodologies, can provide insights that are relevant for all stakeholders but several challenges, for example, feasibility and responsibility, need to be addressed before early HTA can become standard practice. For early evaluations to be successful, all relevant stakeholders including patients need to be involved. Also, nimble, flexible assessment methods are needed that fit the dynamics of medical technology. Best practices should be shared to optimize both the innovation process and the methods to perform an early value assessment.","Tummers, Marcia;Kværner, Kari;Sampietro-Colom, Laura;Siebert, Markus;Krahn, Murray;Melien, Oyvind;Hamerlijnck, Dominique;Abrishami, Payam;Grutters, Janneke",Journal,International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care,2020-10-01,Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management;Oslo Universitetssykehus;Hospital Clínic de Barcelona;University Health Network;Folkehelseinstituttet;Handelshøyskolen BI;Radboud University Medical Center;Abbott;EUPATI;National Health Care Institute (ZIN);Dutch Lung Foundation,Early assessment ;  health technology assessment ;  innovation in healthcare ;  methodology
Robotized Additive Manufacturing of Funicular Architectural Geometries Based on Building Materials,"Additive manufacturing (AM) technology has been identified as one of the major digital innovations that has revolutionized not only the field of the industry but also the construction. From a research side, AM is a multidisciplinary domain, combining between materials science, mechatronics engineering, and architectural design. The AM concept needs to consider the geometry and the shape of printed objects regarding material properties and robot kinematics which are adaptable to the object size. In this article, we present an integrated design and control of an omnidirectional mobile manipulator robot (MMR), capable of extruding concrete and clay materials, to print complex and funicular architectural geometries. The studied robot allows printing building pieces with different shapes and sizes by additive deposit which can later be assembled on-site. The main issue concerns the control of continuous material deposit, with specified accuracy and respecting the desired shape. This problem involves to solve, in real time, the nonlinear kinematic model of a ten-degrees-of-freedom heterogeneous robot. The kinematic model and the control of utilized MMR are discussed, and an optimization method based on quadratic programming is used for handling the robot redundancy. Finally, we present the experimental results to illustrate the efficiency of AM on the developed concept.","Lakhal, Othman;Chettibi, Taha;Belarouci, Abdelkader;Dherbomez, Gerald;Merzouki, Rochdi",Journal,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2020-10-01,Université de Lille,Additive manufacturing (AM) ;  kinematics model ;  mobile manipulator robot ;  quality control ;  redundancy
The correlation between undergraduate student diversity and the representation of women of color faculty in engineering,"Background: Despite the critical role of faculty diversity in the persistence and academic experiences of undergraduate students as well as in the development of engineering innovations, women of color (WoC) faculty are still underrepresented in engineering programs across the United States. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study identifies whether the demographic composition of undergraduate engineering students is correlated with the representation of WoC faculty. It also highlights the institutional- and departmental-level factors that contribute to the race–gender diversification of the engineering professoriate. Design/Method: Informed by organizational demography as the theoretical framework, the methods include linear and logit regression analyses. Data come from the American Society for Engineering Education, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, and the American Community Survey, and include engineering departmental-level observations across 345 institutions over 12 years. Results: Engineering departments that award more bachelor's degrees to women African American/Black undergraduate students are more likely to employ relatively more African American/Black women faculty. This positive relationship is also found among Asian Americans and Hispanics/Latinas. Conclusions: Research findings demonstrate the relationship between engineering undergraduate composition, as well as other departmental- and institutional-level factors, and the prevalence of WoC faculty. The findings highlight important areas for stakeholders and academic administrators to consider when developing strategies and programs to diversify the composition of engineering faculty.","Main, Joyce B.;Tan, Li;Cox, Monica F.;McGee, Ebony O.;Katz, Andrew",Journal,Journal of Engineering Education,2020-10-01,College of Engineering;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Vanderbilt University's Peabody College;Purdue University,diversity ;  faculty ;  undergraduate ;  women
Innovation Portfolio Management for Small-medium Enterprises,"For small and medium sized enterprises, portfolio management can be a difficult exercise; especially when the available paths forwards are shrouded in mystery. To overcome this, they are required to research and decide upon the path to follow, but this can be difficult when the information to gather is unclear, leading to ad-hoc processes and inconsistency. The motivation for this project originated from a small and medium sized enterprise experiencing this problem of unknown critical information and a technological portfolio with significant potential. With no procedure or method in place, they conducted the research in an ad-hoc way resulting in uncertainty and low repeatability of decisions. To tackle this problem, innovation structuring frameworks were synthesised with appropriate risks and context to pose a new structure for information capture. The resulting structure was tested within the small and medium sized enterprise to investigate the repeatability of the information capture and the subsequent ranking. The proposed structure was also analysed by — process experts for its wider applicability. For the small and medium sized enterprise, this led to a consistent and repeatable method that delivered increased confidence about selecting a path forwards for its portfolio. In addition, it was found to be applicable to external organisations increasing the model’s worth and applicability. The implications of this work have led to a change in the operational procedure of the small and medium sized enterprise to utilise the defined process for researching new ideas for their portfolio which can lead to repeatable and trustworthy decisions. This also has applicability to other similar companies and could lead them through a repeatable process as presented here.","Pashley, Daniel;Tryfonas, Theo;Crossley, Andy;Setchell, Chris;Karatzas, Stylianos",Journal,Journal of Systems Science and Systems Engineering,2020-10-01,University of Patras;University of Bristol;Imetrum Ltd.,decision support ;  directed research ;  Portfolio management ;  small-medium enterprise
Smartphone application using a visual programming language to compute drying/solar drying characteristics of agricultural products,"Drying is an important process for food security. A software application on a smartphone can be used to prevent mistakes while carrying out the calculations for drying investigation and research using several mathematical equations. The objective of this research was to develop a software program on cellphones depending on some of the important mathematical equations which are used to conduct some of the drying/solar drying characteristics to assist researchers and engineers who work in the food engineering field for sustainable development. This innovative software application can be installed on mobiles in Android and iOS systems to save effort and time. Mathematical models were developed to compute drying/solar drying calculations. These mathematical models were integrated into the flowchart to develop a software program using visual programming language in the operating system and create the user interface. The collected data from references were used to compare the results from the normal way of calculations with results from the developed software. The results were agreed for both normal calculations and the software. This application software can calculate the moisture content of product, drying ratio, quantity of removed moisture from the fresh products, required heat to evaporate moisture from fresh product, and efficiency of the solar collector.","Amer, Baher M.A.;Chouikhi, Houssam",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-10-01,Faculty of Agriculture;Ecole Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Sfax;King Faisal University,Drying ;  Smartphone ;  Software application ;  Visual programming language

Innovation in engineering education for sustainable development-introduction to a special issue,"Sustainability plays a key role in engineering education. Engineering students must learn to think long-term and understand that, in order to achieve a better world, they must situate their future professional activities within the framework of sustainable solutions. To this end, future engineers must be aware of the complexities of the social environment in which they are developing their work, and of the need to harmonize short-term improvements with sustainable development based on the long term. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in engineering is essential for the training of agents of change and transformation that can promote policies, strategies, and methods that enable a more sustainable future to be built. This Special Issue gathers six original research papers in the field of ESD in engineering, ranging from general issues such as formulating key issues required for any course in EDS, to the experience of introducing sustainability into very specific subjects. Therefore, this Special Issue is of particular value for both academic researchers and lecturers interested in introducing sustainability into their own teaching subjects.","Sánchez-Carracedo, Fermín;López, David",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-10-01,Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Deep transformation ;  Education for sustainable development ;  Engineering education ;  Social responsibility ;  Sustainability assessment
Freelancers in the software development process: A systematic mapping study,"[Context] Freelancers could catalyze the software development process by providing their niche skills to generate high quality outputs. They could help companies (including startups) to foster innovations by suggesting creative ideas and providing their expertise in implementing them (for instance, designing solutions, coding solutions etc.). Freelancers could effectively and efficiently work as a virtual member of the software development team. The company must make informed decisions about which task to allot to the freelancer, which freelancer to select, pricing the task, and evaluating the submitted work. On the other hand, the freelancer should make an informed decision about evaluating the monetary value of the task to be charged, trusting the requester, analyzing the skills requirement of the task (finding matches between skill requirement and skills processed), selecting the best task, and maintaining the highest level of reputation. However, the literature does not provide freelancers and the companies the guidelines that support their decision making. However, if freelancers are selected carefully for the most suitable task, the companies will benefit a lot in terms of improved software development metrics. [Objectives] The objective of this paper is to provide the research community the research trends in freelancer-supported software development. This helps to understand that which software development areas have higher concentrations of research efforts, which area has the support of empirical evidence to support management decision makings, and which area requires the research attention. [Method] The systematic study is conducted by planning the mapping protocol, executing the protocol, and reporting the findings using various visualization tools like bar charts and pie charts. The search process was planned to be executed using set of inclusion and exclusion conditions on four bibliographic databases (IEEExplore, Springerlink, Sciencedirect, and ACM digital library). The relevant papers are selected by applying inclusion and exclusion conditions. The google citations of the relevant papers are subject to the inclusion and exclusion conditions again to include the more relevant papers. Finally, the systematic schema was created and populated after analyzing the studies abstracts. [Results] The results indicate the following (a) The research focus is on generic software development (78%) rather on individual life cycle activities. (b) The number of empirical studies is limited (25%). (c) A number of studies proposing solutions and evaluating on live cases in industrial settings are missing from the literature. This is in comparison to the validation approaches (72%) i.e., solutions tested in laboratory settings. (d) At present, the literature has limited ability to provide the software companies (including startups) with the guidelines (in the form of opinions and experience reports) for involving freelancers in the software development process. (e) The reported challenges include Collaboration and Coordination (33%), Developer Recommendation (or selection) (19%), Team Formulation (14%), Task Recommendation (allocation) (14%), Task Decomposition (11%), Privacy and Security (Confidentiality) (11%), Budget Estimation (8%), Recognition (8%), Trust Issues (8%), Market Dynamism (6%), Intellectual Property Issues (6%), Participation of Crowd Worker (6%), and Capacity Utilization (3%). These challenges are highly interactive, and each challenge impacts all other challenges. (e) Recent focus of the researchers (total 7 studies in 2019) is on generic software development handling the collaboration and coordination (3 studies out of 7), Developer recommendation (2 studies out of 7), and task recommendation (2 studies out of 7). [Conclusion] The freelancer-driven software engineering research area has got the attraction of the researchers, but it will take a long time to gain maturity. This puts an urgent call for more empirical studies and evaluation-based solution research that could help companies (including startups) to foster innovations. Further, the research focus should be well distributed among the various development phases to address the unique challenges associated with individual activities. The accurate management of the freelancer in the software development could help companies and startups to foster innovations and remain competitive in the marketplace.","Gupta, Varun;Fernandez-Crehuet, Jose Maria;Hanne, Thomas",Journal,Processes,2020-10-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz FHNW,Crowdsourcing ;  Freelancers ;  Innovation ;  Software development ;  Systematic mapping study
"Preparing society for automated vehicles: Perceptions of the importance and urgency of emerging issues of governance, regulations, and wider impacts","This study explores the overall picture of how people perceive the importance level and urgency level regarding issues associated with automated vehicles, by sorting out ten issues, developing a questionnaire with 66 measurement items, and investigating how Artificial Intelligence (AI) experts and Computer Science (CS)/Electrical Engineering (EE) majors assessed these issues. The findings suggest that AI experts in Taiwan believed that the top five issues for preparing a society for autonomous vehicles (AVs) should include (1) data privacy and cybersecurity, (2) regulation considerations, (3) infrastructure, (4) governance, and (5) public acceptance. On the other hand, for their student counterparts, the results (1) demonstrate a somewhat different order from the third to the fifth place, (2) show an attention-focused profile on the issue of cybersecurity and data privacy, and (3) indicate that gender and a few wider-impact variables (technology innovation, infrastructure) are significant predictors for the assessment on the importance level of AVs, while some wider-impact variables (technology innovation, governance, economic benefits, infrastructure), which are positively associated, as well as concerns variables (cybersecurity and data privacy, regulations), which are negatively associated, could be predictors for the urgency level of AVs. Suggestions for future research and policymakers are provided.","Chen, Su Yen;Kuo, Hsin Yu;Lee, Chiachun",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-10-01,National Tsing Hua University,Automated vehicles ;  Governance ;  Perceptions ;  Regulation ;  Social impact
Developing STEM Identity and Talent in Underrepresented Students: Lessons Learned From Four Gifted Black Males in a Magnet School Program,"There is well-documented research and data that echo the concern for the future of United States’ ability to globally compete in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) innovation and to fulfill the shortage in talent that exists within this field of study. This concern compels us to seek more impactful and long-term solutions to the issues surrounding motivation and retention of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines. It is imperative that we increase our capability to effectively identify, recruit, and retain underrepresented students within the STEM pipeline. Focusing on identity development as the first of these critical capacities, a case study was conducted to determine if any central characteristics exist that shape the STEM self-concept and identity of four gifted, Black male students who were recent graduates from a predominantly Black, Title 1 high school within a southern, rural region of America. Two 90-min, audio-recorded interviews were conducted with a follow-up focus group discussion a year later. Their experiences were told in retrospect, narrated using their perspectives as they related to their “life” and “STEM” stories. The data revealed STEM identity development very much connected to race, cultural values, and contextual STEM environment. Exploring the dynamics of development surrounding motivation, this article highlights their STEM success to better understand how their STEM talent was developed. Their stories, common themes, and implications for educators are discussed followed by a call for further research.","Collins, Kristina Henry;Jones Roberson, Javetta",Journal,Gifted Child Today,2020-10-01,Texas State University;Birdville Independent School District,gifted Black males ;  gifted education ;  parenting gifted children ;  social/emotional needs ;  STEM ;  talent development ;  underrepresentation ;  underserved populations
"A study of factors impacting elementary mathematics preservice teachers: Improving mindfulness, anxiety, self-efficacy, and mindset","Innovation is more imperative now than ever before given the upcoming shortage in prepared teachers and the need to produce students with a strong knowledge of mathematics. A sense of urgency is impacting teacher education/preparation programs as instructional practices need to discover how to arm teachers to increase the number of students to be not only college-ready but also desiring to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics majors. As such, the purpose of this study, was to determine how the four variables (mindfulness, mathematics anxiety, self-efficacy, and mindset) are interconnected within preservice elementary teachers (PSETs), and how we as teacher educators can better address these variables within our own PSETs. Each semester included three seminars with similar overall foci including the four variables. Participants in this study were recruited from Elementary Education students at an east south central regional university enrolled in a mathematics methods course. Thirty-seven participants were divided into control (N = 20) and treatment (N = 17). In this article, we present both qualitative and quantitative results from our mixed-methods study that considered these questions. With the results of this study revealing an inter-connectedness among the four variables, this research further informs the teacher educator community.","Tassell, Janet;Gerstenschlager, Natasha E.;Syzmanski, Toni;Denning, Savannah",Journal,School Science and Mathematics,2020-10-01,Western Kentucky University;Special Education Division,math/math education ;  teacher education ;  teachers and teaching
Quality as driver for sustainable construction-Holistic quality model and assessment,"Facing rising building demands due to a fast-growing world population and significant environmental challenges at the same time, the building sector urgently requires innovation. The Cluster of Excellence Integrative Computational Design and Construction for Architecture at the University of Stuttgart tackles these challenges through a Co-Design approach for integrating computational design and engineering and robotic construction. Within this research framework, a Holistic Quality Model is developed to ensure the technical, environmental, and social quality of Co-Design processes and products. Up to now, quality models that consider and integrate all these three aspects throughout the life cycle of buildings are still missing. The article outlines the concept of holistic quality assessment based on a Holistic Quality Model for sustainable construction. A key mechanism for sustainable quality assessment in the Holistic Quality Model is the definition of control and decision points in the construction process where critical decisions are made that will affect the quality of the building throughout its entire life-cycle. Firstly, subject-specific quality concepts are defined and their interrelations are conceptualized. Subsequently, these interrelations and their effects on the overall Co-Design construction processes and products are explained using the example of the semi-robotic production of concrete slabs. Examples for control and decision points are given as well. The outline presented here serves as a basis for further advancing and concretizing the Holistic Quality Model and its applications in Co-Design for a functioning, liveable, and sustainable high-quality construction and building culture.","Zhang, Li;Balangé, Laura;Braun, Kathrin;Di Bari, Roberta;Horn, Rafael;Hos, Deniz;Kropp, Cordula;Leistner, Philip;Schwieger, Volker",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-10-01,Universität Stuttgart,Co-design ;  Computational construction ;  Computational design ;  Control points ;  Decision points ;  Predictive quality assessment ;  Quality characteristics ;  Quality parameters

Drawing on the past to shape the future of synthetic yeast research,"Some years inspire more hindsight reflection and future-gazing than others. This is even more so in 2020 with its evocation of perfect vision and the landmark ring to it. However, no futurist can reliably predict what the world will look like the next time that a year’s first two digits will match the second two digits—a numerical pattern that only occurs once in a century. As we leap into a new decade, amid uncertainties triggered by unforeseen global events—such as the outbreak of a worldwide pandemic, the accompanying economic hardship, and intensifying geopolitical tensions—it is important to note the blistering pace of 21st century technological developments indicate that while hindsight might be 20/20, foresight is 50/50. The history of science shows us that imaginative ideas, research excellence, and collaborative innovation can, for example, significantly contribute to the economic, cultural, social, and environmental recovery of a post-COVID-19 world. This article reflects on a history of yeast research to indicate the potential that arises from advances in science, and how this can contribute to the ongoing recovery and development of human society. Future breakthroughs in synthetic genomics are likely to unlock new avenues of impactful discoveries and solutions to some of the world’s greatest challenges.","Dixon, Thomas A.;Pretorius, Isak S.",Journal,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2020-10-01,Macquarie University,Biodesign ;  Biodiversity ;  Biofoundry ;  Consilience ;  Engineering biology ;  Fermentation ;  Scientific method ;  Synthetic genomics ;  Timeline ;  Yeast
"Electrochemical Insights, Developing Strategies, and Perspectives toward Advanced Potassium–Sulfur Batteries","The boosting demand for high-capacity energy storage systems requires innovative battery technologies with low-cost and sustainability. The advancement of potassium–sulfur (K–S) batteries have been triggered recently due to abundant resource and cost effectiveness. However, the functional performance of K–S batteries is fundamentally restricted by the vague understanding of K–S electrochemistry and the imperfect cell components or architectures, facing the issues of low cathode conductivity, intermediate shuttle loss, poor anode stability, electrode volume fluctuation, etc. Inspired by considerable research efforts on rechargeable metal–sulfur batteries, the holistic K–S system can be stabilized and promoted through various strategies on rational physical regulation and chemical engineering. In this review, first an attempt is made to address the electrochemical kinetic concept of K–S system on the basis of the emerging studies. Then, the classification of performance-improving strategies is thoroughly discussed in terms of specific battery component and prospective outlooks in materials optimization, structure innovations, as well as relevant electrochemistry are provided. Finally, the critical perspectives and challenges are discussed to demonstrate the forward-looking developmental directions of K–S batteries. This review not only endeavors to provide a deep understanding of the electrochemistry mechanism and rational designs for high-energy K–S batteries, but also encourages more efforts in their large-scale practical realization.","Yuan, Xiaomin;Zhu, Bo;Feng, Jinkui;Wang, Chengguo;Cai, Xun;Qiao, Kun;Qin, Rongman",Journal,Small,2020-10-01,"Shandong University, Weihai;Shandong University",developing strategies ;  electrochemical performance ;  electrochemistry ;  energy density ;  potassium–sulfur batteries

Towards a theory of transformative social innovation: A relational framework and 12 propositions,"This paper responds to the need in innovation research for conceptual clarity and solid theory on social innovation (SI). The paper conceptualizes SI as changing social relations, involving new ways of doing, knowing, framing and organizing, and theorizes transformative social innovation (TSI) as the process of SI challenging, altering, or replacing dominant institutions in a specific social-material context. Three advances towards TSI theory are proposed. First, we reflect epistemologically on the challenges of theory-building, and propose an appropriate research design and methodology. Middle-range theory is developed through iteration between theoretical insights and comparative empirical study of 20 transnational SI networks and about 100 associated initiatives. Second, we synthesize various innovation theories and social theories into a relational framework that articulates the distributed agency and institutional hybridization involved. Third, we formulate twelve propositions on the emergence of SI initiatives, on the development of SI ecosystems, on institutionalization processes, and on the historical shaping of SI. The paper ends with a critical assessment of the advances made, also identifying further challenges for TSI theory and practice.","Pel, Bonno;Haxeltine, Alex;Avelino, Flor;Dumitru, Adina;Kemp, René;Bauler, Tom;Kunze, Iris;Dorland, Jens;Wittmayer, Julia;Jørgensen, Michael Søgaard",Journal,Research Policy,2020-10-01,BOKU University;Universidade da Coruña;Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam;Aalborg University;Universiteit Maastricht;Université Libre de Bruxelles;University of East Anglia,Empowerment ;  Innovation process ;  Institutional change ;  Relational theory ;  Social innovation ;  Transformative change
"Vision zero: Developing proactive leading indicators for safety, health and wellbeing at work","The importance of leading occupational safety and health (OSH) indicators in complementing lagging indicators is an emerging topic for the promotion of a prevention culture in organizations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development process of a set of proactive leading indicators for safety, health and wellbeing (SHW) at work, which was carried out as part of the International Social Security Association's (ISSA) Vision Zero strategy. Principles of integrated knowledge transfer and exchange between research, policy and practice were followed in both the conception and development phases, and a mixed methods approach was applied across four stages consisting of: a literature review and input from industry; a quantitative evaluation through an online survey; a qualitative evaluation through feedback from organizational representatives and key stakeholders; and a consensus building workshop with the ISSA Steering Committee. A set of fourteen indicators was developed to complement the ISSA Vision Zero strategy, two in relation to each of its seven golden rules for promoting SHW at work. The indicators deal with integrating each aspect of SHW in e.g. visible and competent leadership, procurement, pre-work briefings, evaluating risk management and targeted programmes, learning from unplanned events, innovation and change, work organization, onboarding and refresher training. Results can be presented qualitatively and quantitatively as e.g. ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses, on a Likert or continuum (five–point) scale, or with frequencies and percentages. The indicators are designed for use by both small and large organizations across all sectors, and can be used for benchmarking and as key performance indicators. They are not only intended to better direct and control SHW processes, but also to support the development of a prevention culture. Recommendations are provided on how the indicators can be refined and improved through future research.","Zwetsloot, Gerard;Leka, Stavroula;Kines, Pete;Jain, Aditya",Journal,Safety Science,2020-10-01,Cork University Business School (CUBS);University of Nottingham Medical School;University of Nottingham;Det Nationale Forskningscenter for Arbejdsmiljø;Gerard Zwetsloot Research & Consultancy,Benchmarking ;  International Social Security Association ;  Key performance indicator ;  Knowledge transfer and exchange ;  Prevention culture ;  Research to practice
The Future of Skull Base Surgery: A View Through Tinted Glasses,"In the present report, we have broadly outlined the potential advances in the field of skull base surgery, which might occur within the next 20 years based on the many areas of current research in biology and technology. Many of these advances will also be broadly applicable to other areas of neurosurgery. We have grounded our predictions for future developments in an exploration of what patients and surgeons most desire as outcomes for care. We next examined the recent developments in the field and outlined several promising areas of future improvement in skull base surgery, per se, as well as identifying the new hospital support systems needed to accommodate these changes. These include, but are not limited to, advances in imaging, Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, 3-dimensional printing and rapid prototyping, master–slave and semiautonomous robots, artificial intelligence applications in all areas of medicine, telemedicine, and green technologies in hospitals. In addition, we have reviewed the therapeutic approaches using nanotechnology, genetic engineering, antitumor antibodies, and stem cell technologies to repair damage caused by traumatic injuries, tumors, and iatrogenic injuries to the brain and cranial nerves. Additionally, we have discussed the training requirements for future skull base surgeons and stressed the need for adaptability and change. However, the essential requirements for skull base surgeons will remain unchanged, including knowledge, attention to detail, technical skill, innovation, judgment, and compassion.

How doctoral students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics manipulate genre","Genre analysis is a powerful pedagogy to foster doctoral students' awareness of academic writing conventions and variation. Nonetheless, concerns remain about the risks of promoting rhetorical ‘painting by numbers’, with writers glumly surrendering agency and authorial voice. Recent reappraisals of genre pedagogy encourage fostering genre manipulation, innovation, and play. We examine whether genre pedagogy can indeed promote conscious manipulation and even playfulness of academic genres, or at least an enhanced sense of control over conventions. Data from interviews with 30 doctoral students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) collected over a two-year period were analyzed to extract comments pertaining to deliberate authorial choices, unconventionalities in writing or writing processes, and positive shifts in writing perceptions. The findings reveal students' appreciation of genre awareness and a sense of control from knowledge of genre conventions, affording them agency in their writing. Crucially, students do not appear to surrender to standardization, but are instead agentive and metacognitive in their approach to writing, using their genre knowledge to compose, manipulate, and critique their genres.","Negretti, Raffaella;McGrath, Lisa",Journal,English for Specific Purposes,2020-10-01,Sheffield Hallam University;Chalmers University of Technology,Academic writing ;  Genre knowledge ;  Genre manipulation ;  Genre pedagogy ;  Metacognition ;  Writing for research
A Journey from Bulk MOSFET to 3 nm and Beyond,"To overcome scaling issues such as controlling gate leakage, drain induced barrier lowering, higher subthreshold conduction, polysilicon gate depletion, and other short channel effects various engineering proposed. The gate dielectric, metal work function, and device structural engineering enabled the semiconductor industry to make a transition from the conventional planar MOSFET towards a revolutionary 3D tri-gate structure called FinFET. FinFET is one of the fundamental invention in the semiconductor industry, which replaced the planar CMOS technology around 22 nm technology. By following Moore’s law, it accelerated the scaling to 7 nm, but at 5 nm, in the same way, GAAFET replaced FinFET due to technological hurdles. Nanosheet, which is one type of GAAFET are in the recent trend. But researchers are trying to explore the possibilities to continue the miniaturization beyond 3 nm by combining the effect of non-silicon channel material such as Ge, InGaAs, or 2D materials with nanosheet, which will improve the functionality of the device while going down in the technology node. In this survey, an attempt has been made for the structure present till 7 nm process. Also, a few new proposals in research to take the scaling up to 3 nm and beyond are included. The future innovations may put an intercept on the slowing down of Moore’s law, and bring the miniaturization back in the track.","Samal, Asharani;Tripathi, Suman Lata;Mohapatra, Sushanta Kumar",Journal,Transactions on Electrical and Electronic Materials,2020-10-01,"Lovely Professional University;Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar",Bulk MOSFET ;  CFET ;  DG-MOSFET ;  FinFET ;  GAAFET ;  High-k ;  High-k metal gate ;  NCFET ;  Nonsilicon channel materials ;  Scaling ;  Scaling challenges ;  SOI device ;  TFET ;  Vertical FET

The water-energy-food nexus research in the Brazilian context: What are we missing?,"The water-energy-food nexus has gained particular momentum in the fields of sustainable development and resource security in the last years. However, some scholars critically question the nexus by arguing that research is strongly shaped by western knowledge with a bias towards natural scientific, engineering and economic perspectives; whereas there is a lack of attention on local socio-political aspects and little contribution from social sciences. This paper provides a critical analysis of studies focused on the nexus in the Brazilian context or by Brazilian institutions. The main objectives are to assess whether research on the nexus in the Brazilian context shares common features with the international research; to identify the main nexus topics in this geographic context; and to examine if socio-economic challenges are considered, specifically regarding urbanization and poverty. Through a quantitative and qualitative analysis, the results show that Brazilian institutions lead research on the nexus in the Brazilian context, however the contribution from the social sciences remains marginal. Furthermore, quantitative methods are predominantly used over qualitative and hybrid methods. The research largely focuses on connections between water and energy in the hydropower and biofuels sectors, and it is based on discourses of efficiency, optimization, modelling and technological innovation. In addition, scholars have so far failed to address other important issues for sustainable development in Brazil and the Global South.","Dalla Fontana, Michele;Moreira, Fabiano de Araújo;Di Giulio, Gabriela Marques;Malheiros, Tadeu Fabrício",Journal,Environmental Science and Policy,2020-10-01,Universidade de São Paulo,Brazil ;  Research ;  Socio-Economic challenges ;  Socio-political aspects ;  Sustainable development ;  Water-energy-food nexus
Self-locking mechanism of foldable grid structures and capability evaluation of their structural units,"Self-locking foldable grid structures (FGSs) can be converted from a mechanical state to a structural state without the need to impose additional geometric constraints. However, the lack of a systematic understanding of the self-locking mechanism and the absence of a simple method to assess the self-locking capability have hindered further innovations and applications of such structures. In this paper, the geometric incompatibility function of structural units (SUs) was proposed by analyzing the mechanism motion of the two types of scissor-like elements (SLEs), thereby clarifying the self-locking mechanism of FGSs. Then, based on this function, the approximate expression for evaluating the self-locking capability of SUs was derived using the work-energy principle. This evaluation shows that the expression is concise in form and has a good application feasibility in the preliminary design phase. Furthermore, the results obtained by the expression show that the parameters t (thickness) and h (distance between the lower central node and the plane) have a critical influence on the self-locking performance compared to parameter L (side length), and the method of adjusting the h value can be preferentially adopted to control the self-locking capability of the entire structure. The research methods and results of this paper can provide a reference for structural designs and engineering applications of self-locking FGSs.","Zhao, Zhanwei;Yu, Lei;Hu, Weibing",Journal,Structures,2020-10-01,Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology,Bistable structure ;  Capability evaluation ;  Deployable structure ;  Folding process ;  Self-locking mechanism
The Role of Information Technology Innovation in Combating Corruption in SMEs in Developing Countries: A Critical Literature Review,"The purpose of this article is to examine the literature on the impact of information technology innovations in combatting corruption in small and medium enterprises in developing countries. This article employed a systematic literature review from a multidisciplinary style to provide research precision and reliability. Corruption affects the performance of the business by stifling their entrepreneurial and innovative initiatives. Small businesses should encourage more ethical conduct by motivating employees to report corruption in their workplaces. However, the finding of this article shows that many employees fear to report corruption due to weak whistleblowing protection policies. In addition, using information technology in whistleblowing, although effective, the results indicate that their usage is limited due to fear of the unknown. The success of anticorruption interventions strategies depends on their relevance to local environmental, cultural, and technical experience. The government should enhance public awareness of the protection of whistleblowers by developing a multiagency framework for streamlining digital whistleblowing channels in public and private enterprises. Policymakers in engineering management should bridge the gap between anticorruption laws enforcement and practical implementation to eradicate corruption. This article contributes to the understanding of whistleblowing as a strategy to fight corruption and its effect on the innovation of small and medium enterprises.","Chege, Samwel Mac Haria;Wang, Daoping",Journal,IEEE Engineering Management Review,2020-10-01,"School of Economics and Management, USTB",Combating corruption ;  firm performance: developing countries ;  technology innovation ;  whistleblowers: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
Determining the factors driving China's industrial energy intensity: Evidence from technological innovation sources and structural change,"The question of how to reduce energy intensity has been a hot issue of social concern. However, there is lack of detailed information from the perspective of technological innovation sources and structural change for policy consideration. To better understand the influence of different technological innovation sources and structural change on industrial energy intensity, this paper applies both linear and non-linear methods of empirical analysis. The conventional linear regression analysis suggests that indigenous research and development (R&D) exerts the most control on energy intensity reduction. Technology acquisitions, both domestically and internationally, have a significant impact on industrial energy intensity. Increases in the proportion of state-owned enterprises within industry and the expansion of the industrial sectors both have a negative effect on energy intensity reduction, but improving the entry level of foreign enterprises can reduce energy intensity. Further, a dynamic panel threshold model indicates that effects of different technological innovation sources and structural change on industrial energy intensity are nonlinear. These findings indicate that increasing R&D inputs and promoting coordinated development between different R&D activities, in addition to adjusting ownership structure, are of great significance for controlling industrial energy intensity.","Luan, Bingjiang;Huang, Junbing;Zou, Hong;Huang, Cheng",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2020-10-01,"Guosen Securities Co., Ltd.;Southwestern University of Finance and Economics",Dynamic panel threshold model ;  Energy intensity ;  Structural change ;  Technological progress
Lift planning and optimization in construction: A thirty-year review,"Various lift planning and optimization (LPO) researches have been conducted; nevertheless, the body of knowledge is fragmented. This study aims to develop a systematic framework of LPO and predict its research trends, through a critical literature review, theoretical analysis, and model development. In total 108 journal papers from 1990 to 2019 are identified and analyzed based on the proposed taxonomy of LPO issues and methods. Results reveal an increasing trend of LPO for integrated issues using mixed methods. Owing to the evolving construction innovation like modular construction and thus the more challenging crane-lift problems, the use of innovative modeling methods (e.g. virtual reality simulation and intelligent algorithms) has increased. The complicated LPO issues should be integrated and addressed with appropriate modeling methods. The proposed framework contributes to systematic understanding on LPO and the suggested topics will drive future research to new heights in addressing the complexity and dynamics of LPO.","Zhang, Zhiqian;Pan, Wei",Journal,Automation in Construction,2020-10-01,The University of Hong Kong,Construction crane ;  Construction planning ;  Lift planning and optimization ;  Modular construction ;  Productivity
Quality 4.0—the challenging future of quality engineering,"Quality is a crucial dimension of products and processes. It is considered a competitive advantage for companies and organizations in the global market. Quality models and practices went through several evolutionary steps during modern history—from inspection to control, to quality assurance, to quality management and quality by design. These quality models follow the evolutions and revolutions in industry. It seems however, that in the last few years the quality discipline went into stagnation—very few innovative models for quality are being proposed and quality professionals in companies and organization have apparently lost their leadership positions. Also, the research for new and innovative quality models is scarce. The fourth industrial revolution is an opportunity for the quality movement to become a leading force. This poses significant challenges to the quality profession by emphasizing the need to adapt to technology innovations, to modern data analytics and to the entrepreneurships ecosystem that characterize an era of the fourth industrial revolution. In this paper, we present a framework for a quality discipline supporting the fourth industrial revolution. We propose to call it Quality 4.0. The paper also offers future directions for quality and reliability engineering that leverage opportunities derived from the fourth industrial revolution. Specifically, we discuss: (1) Quality as a data driven discipline, (2) the application of modeling and simulation for evidence-based quality engineering, (3) health monitoring and prognostics for quality, (4) integrated quality management, (5) maturity levels with respect to the fourth industrial revolution, (6) integrating innovation with quality and managing for innovation, (7) Quality 4.0 and data science, (8) integrating reliability engineering with quality engineering, and finally, (9) information quality. We are aware that these directions are still not a comprehensive picture of Quality 4.0. We claim however, that they constitute a substantial basis to update the body of knowledge and practices of the quality profession.","Zonnenshain, Avigdor;Kenett, Ron S.",Journal,Quality Engineering,2020-10-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,data driven ;  evidence based ;  fourth industrial revolution ;  health monitoring ;  information quality ;  integrated quality management ;  maturity assessment ;  modeling and simulation
Trend of Information Technology Discipline Based on Mining the Keywords of Knowledge Graph,"The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) is the leading supporter of research funding in Switzerland and is primarily responsible for promoting the development of Swiss scientific and technological innovations. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the research status and research trends of the innovations according to SNSF data, which could inspire forward thinking of Chinese researchers and managers. We collected the data of research projects from the SNSF database in 1999-2018. In this study, the evolution of keywords in the information technology discipline is analyzed and it is found that information technology evolved from software development research, such as distributed systems to artificial intelligence research like machine learning and deep learning and hierarchical structure distribution maps, to visualize information technology and mathematical keyword distribution. It is worth noting that cryptography and algorithms are the most obvious cross-disciplinary research content in information technology and mathematics. The results show that research content of cross-disciplinary research is relatively better. Then, by interpreting the intersection of information technology and mathematics by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence analysis of keyword distribution in different time periods, the cross-research experience of these two disciplines is found that after rapid development, it entered a more stable and mature state.","Li, Li Xia;Ren, Zhuo Ming;Zhang, Zi Ke",Journal,Dianzi Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,2020-09-30,Hangzhou Normal University,Evolvement analysis ;  Information technology ;  Research hotspot ;  Swiss national science foundation

Creativity and Cognition in Extreme Environments: The Space Arts as a Case Study,"Humans, like all organisms, have evolved to survive in specific environments, while some elect or are forced to live and work in extreme environments. Understanding cognition as it relates to environmental conditions, we use 4E cognition as a framework to explore creativity in extreme environments. Our paper examines space arts as a case study through the history, present practices, and future possible arts in the context of humans beyond the Kármán boundary of the Earth’s atmosphere. We develop a proposed taxonomy of space arts, based on prior taxonomies, and provide specific exemplars of space art developed by artists in space or for use by astronauts in space. Using examples of space art since the birth of the space age, we discuss (1) how human survival in extreme environments requires investment in the space arts, driven by consideration of various biopsychosocial factors and (2) how new scientific and engineering discoveries; such as the detection of air current patterns with paper airplanes in zero gravity, could be consequences or examples of creative thinking driven by artists in the various types of space art. We conclude by discussing possible benefits of space art, future research applications, and advocate that all space actors, government or private, involve artists in all projects beyond the Kármán Boundary of the Earth’s atmosphere.","Hays, Kathryn;Kubli, Cris;Malina, Roger",Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,2020-09-29,University of North Texas;The University of Texas at Dallas,4E cognition ;  astronautical art ;  astronomical art ;  creativity ;  extreme environments ;  social innovation ;  space art
Using Gene Editing Approaches to Fine-Tune the Immune System,"Genome editing technologies not only provide unprecedented opportunities to study basic cellular system functionality but also improve the outcomes of several clinical applications. In this review, we analyze various gene editing techniques used to fine-tune immune systems from a basic research and clinical perspective. We discuss recent advances in the development of programmable nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas-associated nucleases. We also discuss the use of programmable nucleases and their derivative reagents such as base editing tools to engineer immune cells via gene disruption, insertion, and rewriting of T cells and other immune components, such natural killers (NKs) and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In addition, with regard to chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), we describe how different gene editing tools enable healthy donor cells to be used in CAR T therapy instead of autologous cells without risking graft-versus-host disease or rejection, leading to reduced adoptive cell therapy costs and instant treatment availability for patients. We pay particular attention to the delivery of therapeutic transgenes, such as CARs, to endogenous loci which prevents collateral damage and increases therapeutic effectiveness. Finally, we review creative innovations, including immune system repurposing, that facilitate safe and efficient genome surgery within the framework of clinical cancer immunotherapies.","Pavlovic, Kristina;Tristán-Manzano, María;Maldonado-Pérez, Noelia;Cortijo-Gutierrez, Marina;Sánchez-Hernández, Sabina;Justicia-Lirio, Pedro;Carmona, M.

Ecosystem mapping technology to understand innovation challenges in MSME Sector: An analysis of the handicraft sector in Sri Lanka,"This paper discusses an application of ecosystem mapping technology to visualize the innovation ecosystem in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector. Ideally, actors in the MSME sector should function as a system, exchanging knowledge, information and other resources, to uplift innovation and create economic value to a country or a region. Visualizing this system enables to understand the deficiencies in the exchange of resources among actors; the deficiencies, which makes innovation and growth challenging to MSMEs. Based on this idea, the study presented in this paper focuses on the handicrafts sector in Sri Lanka and attempt to map its ecosystem based on the manually collected publicly available data on social media. The subsequent analysis of the support ecosystem map reveals a major deficit in the exchange of information technology resources, which hinders the digital innovation and transformation of the MSMEs in the handicrafts sector. The paper further discusses the implications and future research directions.","Rajapakse, Chathura",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering, SCSE 2020",2020-09-24,University of Kelaniya,Digital innovation ;  Ecosystem mapping ;  Handicrafts sector ;  Innovation ecosystem ;  Network visualization
Bayesian networks and Support Vector Classifier in damage risk assessment of RC prefabricated building structures in mining areas,"The development of methods for capturing and collecting information with regard to the issues of Structural Health Monitoring and Building Maintenance Management allows for more accurate description of multifactorial processes in the whole life cycle of building structures. This includes the problem of damage risk assessment, which is a complex issue, consisting of a number of factors resulting from the applied structural, technological and material solutions, quality of maintenance or variability of originally assumed operating conditions. Additionally, this problem is getting significantly more complicated when it is necessary to take into account external influences from changing environmental impacts. This is the case with existing building developments located in areas subjected to damaging effects of underground mining in the form of continuous ground deformation and mining tremors. In the long run, the external environmental effects resulting from the decommissioning of the mines should also be taken into account. These are qualitatively similar to continuous deformations of the terrain, but as a rule, they significantly cover much larger area which was not considered to be affected by negative mining impacts during mining operations. From the social and economic points of view, not only the prediction of the extent and intensity of damage, but also the diagnosis of its causes are important. The Bayesian inference framework offers a possibility of creating a universal model for assessing the risk of damage to existing building structures. However, in the case of complex processes, this structure is not known and its search is a basic methodological problem. In the conducted research presented in this article, the Bayesian network structure was extracted using selected score-based learning methods. Currently, the adopted approach is the subject of intensive research, especially in the field of medical science, biology and genetics. Therefore, implementation of such methodology is an innovation in the interdisciplinary field of civil engineering and mining. However, due to the fact that this methodology is still being developed, it needs to be verified. For this purpose, the SVC (Support Vector Classifier) method was used. The effectiveness of the adopted methodology was finally confirmed. This was done by comparing the results obtained for the selected Bayesian network and Support Vector Machine classifier. This formed the basis for formulating conclusions on the applied methodology and on the influence of specific factors on the modelled damage risk process in the group of existing RC prefabricated buildings structures.","Rusek, Janusz;Tajdus, Krzysztof;Firek, Karol;Jedrzejczyk, Adrian",Conference Proceeding,"2020 5th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies, SpliTech 2020",2020-09-23,AGH University of Krakow;Strata Mechanics Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences,Bayesian network ;  damage ;  mining impacts ;  RC structures ;  risk ;  structure learning ;  Support Vector Machine

Performance analysis of augmented reality based on vuforia using 3d marker detection,"In the field of education, especially engineering, there is evidence of skills gaps. According to a survey in the UK covers 2017-2024, the demand for electricity projected to increase. In fact, at the same time, 23.7% of electricity workers are predicted to experience retirement. Therefore, skills gaps need to be minimized through the development of effective and credible learning media. One of the innovations in developing instructional media is applying augmented reality. However, augmented reality performance needs testing to find out the factors that influence the success of object detection to provide maximum results when implemented in learning media. Several existing studies analyze the performance of augmented reality based on the NyARToolkit library, template matching, and the Metaio Mobile SDK. In this research, the performance of 3D object detection performed on augmented reality based on the Vuforia. The research scenarios based on the results of the analysis of the Vuforia working principle. The study conducted with three angles of shooting and several variations of light intensity and distance of the object. The research also conducted by covering part of the object's surface. The results showed that the Vuforia was able to detect objects well in several scenarios that applied with a success rate of 87.5%. The success rate of object detection strongly influenced by the surface area of the detected object and the intensity of the light space.","Sendari, Siti;Firmansah, Adim;Aripriharta, ",Conference Proceeding,"4th International Conference on Vocational Education and Training, ICOVET 2020",2020-09-19,Universitas Negeri Malang,augmented ;  object ;  performance ;  reality ;  Vuforia
The Six Sigma framework improves the awareness and management of supply-chain risk,"Purpose: Modern supply chains are at risk as a result of increasing disturbance. The use of Lean and Six Sigma’'s values, methods and tools can be one option to analyze, prevent and mitigate risks. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a combined Lean Six Sigma philosophy can support the awareness and management of supply-chain risk. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology followed in the study is based on a literature review and multiple case study, performed by means of qualitative methods of data collection, such as observations on-site, face-to-face interviews and document analysis. Case selection includes the results of research conducted in seven large Swedish companies. Findings: It has been indicated that Lean and Six Sigma values, methods and tools can be very effective in companies’ efforts to control the supply-chain risks and that they improve the companies’ ability to handle variability and risk management. Lean Six Sigma supports a risk-management culture in the focal companies, but they must involve customers and companies in the supply chain if they wish to create a risk-management culture in the entire supply chain. In order to do this, they can use the Six Sigma training structure, but they need to include more risk tools and methods developed for the supply chain management. It has also been indicated in the literature that if more people involve in 6S projects, the financial results will be better, and the innovation of processes will increase. Research limitations/implications: These include suggestions for how the companies can use the Six sigma training structure to collaborate in the supply chain. Practical implications: This study gives practical suggestions for how the companies in supply chain can collaborate and use the Six Sigma training structure for creating a more holistic view of supply chain, which also decrease risks in supply chain. Originality/value: This study indicates that Lean Six Sigma supports risk awareness and management in the focal companies of the supply chains, which improves companies’ ability to handle variability and risk management. It has also been demonstrated that the companies should use the Six Sigma framework, especially training, as a foundation, and they should create common projects for better collaboration in the supply chain, which will decrease the risks in the entire supply chain.","Andersson, Roy;Pardillo-Baez, Yinef",Journal,TQM Journal,2020-09-18,Jönköping University,Collaboration ;  Lean Six Sigma ;  Quality ;  Risk management ;  Supply chain

Intelligent content driving of engineering model system in modeling platform,"Engineering modeling software systems have been developed during a long integration process from separated partial solutions to current modeling software platforms (MSPs). MSP is expected to provide all necessary model creation and application capabilities during integrated innovation and the life cycle of commercial and industrial products (CIP). Recently, advanced CIP is operated by component systems organized within an increasingly autonomous cyber physical system (CPS). CIP is represented by the engineering model system (EMS). EMS is driven by active contexts between the outside world and EMS, between component models of EMS, and between objects in a component model. EMS reacts to any new contribution using all formerly represented contexts. Consistent structure of contexts gives autonomous operation capability for EMS. Active contexts between the outside world and EMS make EMS sensitive to outside world changes. In the other direction, EMS can generate advice for the outside world using high level and well-organized active knowledge as context. Contributing to research in key issues around EMS and the relevant software technology, this paper introduces results in requirements against MSP capabilities to represent intelligent driving content (IDC) in EMS. A novel organized structure of IDC and continuous engineering (CE) aspects of IDC development are explained and discussed placing the main emphasis on situation awareness. Finally, a new concept is introduced in which purposeful EMS acts as the only media in communication of researchers. Specially configured MSP facilitates participation from industrial, institutional, and academic organizations. The research proceeds at the Laboratory of Intelligent Engineering Systems (IESL) in the organization of the Óbuda University.","Horváth, László",Book Series,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,2020-09-15,Obuda University,Continuous engineering ;  Engineering model system ;  Intelligent driving content ;  Modeling software platform
A model for evaluating the vital factors affecting cloud computing adoption: Analysis of the services sector,"Purpose: Nowadays, the rapid growth of information technology strategies such as cloud computing is very noticeable in organizations. The advantages of the cloud environment are unavoidable because of an increase in innovation, flexibility and economy. Therefore, the critical topic is considering the factors affecting the adoption of cloud computing. This study aims to understand the factors of the adoption of cloud computing and its benefit in companies. Design/methodology/approach: A research framework with four hypotheses has been developed based on the results of previous studies. Structural equation modeling has been used for data analysis. Findings: The proposed model is verified by the results. In addition, the results have shown that cloud computing adoption is affected by four variables as follows, including human factor (with sub-indicator personal innovativeness and knowledge), organizational factor (with sub-indicator size, adequacy of resources and top management support), technical factor (with sub-indicator compatibility and security) and environmental factor (with sub-indicator regulatory environment, competitive pressure and trading partner). Research limitations/implications: There are crucial implications in the findings: they have an essential contribution to the research community, administrators and Information and Communications Technology providers with respect to framing improved tactics for the adoption of cloud computing. The proposed model can enhance the perception of service providers about why some services sectors accept cloud computing amenities, whereas apparently the same ones having the same market situations do not. In addition, the above providers should enhance their interaction with the services sectors contributed to the cloud computing experience to make a well-organized setting for the adoption of cloud computing, and eliminate any ambiguity about this sort of technology. Moreover, the sample has been limited to Iran respondents. Practical implications: The research studies about the usage of cloud computing have shown its effects on organizations today. Also, the different impacts of cloud computing on other contexts and organizations are in the center of attention. By carefully considering and managing cloud computing adoption logics, organizations could get significant advantages. Originality/value: Cloud computing’s technical and operational issues have been central in most of the previous studies. Some surveys have referred to the adoption of cloud computing by the organizations in terms of human characteristics or the contextual factor. Therefore, there should be a model and outline to assess the effect of aforesaid factors on cloud computing adoption.","Jianwen, Cheng;Wakil, Karzan",Journal,Kybernetes,2020-09-14,Sulaimani Polytechnic University;Hunan City University,Adoption ;  Cloud computing ;  Environmental factor ;  Human factor ;  Organizational factor ;  Technical factor

Supply chain resilience: an adaptive cycle approach,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework for extending an understanding of resilience in complex adaptive system (CAS) such as supply chains using the adaptive cycle framework. The adaptive cycle framework may help explain change and the long term dynamics and resilience in supply chain networks. Adaptive cycles assume that dynamic systems such as supply chain networks go through stages of growth, development, collapse and reorientation. Adaptive cycles suggest that the resilience of a complex adaptive system such as supply chains are not fixed but expand and contract over time and resilience requires such systems to navigate each of the cycles’ four stages successfully. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the adaptive cycle framework to explain supply chain resilience (SCRES). It explores the phases of the adaptive cycle, its pathologies and key properties and links these to competences and behaviors that are important for system and SCRES. The study develops a conceptual framework linking adaptive cycles to SCRES. The goal is to extend dynamic theories of SCRES by borrowing from the adaptive cycle framework. We review the literature on the adaptive cycle framework, its properties and link these to SCRES. Findings: The key insight is that the adaptive cycle concept can broaden our understanding of SCRES beyond focal scales, including cross-scale resilience. As a framework, the adaptive cycle can explain the mechanisms that support or prevent resilience in supply chains. Adaptive cycles may also give us new insights into the sort of competences required to avoid stagnation, promote system renewal as resilience expands and contracts over time. Research limitations/implications: The adaptive cycle may move our discussion of resilience beyond engineering and ecological resilience to include evolutionary resilience. While the first two presently dominates our theorizing on SCRES, evolutionary resilience may be more insightful than both are. Adaptive cycles capture the idea of change, adaptation and transformation and allow us to explore cross-scale resilience. Practical implications: Knowing how to prepare for and overcoming key pathologies associated with each stage of the adaptive cycle can broaden our repertoire of strategies for managing SCRES across time. Human agency is important for preventing systems from crossing critical thresholds into imminent collapse. More importantly, disruptions may present an opportunity for innovation and renewal for building more resilience supply chains. Originality/value: This research is one of the few studies that have applied the adaptive cycle concept to SCRES and extends our understanding of the dynamic structure of SCRES.","Adobor, Henry",Journal,International Journal of Logistics Management,2020-09-03,Quinnipiac University,Adaptive cycles ;  Complex adaptive systems ;  Pathologies ;  Supply chain management ;  Supply chain resilience

Introducing Constraints to Improve New Product Development Performance,"Overview: Cross-functional integration is vital to help new product development initiatives succeed. We conducted a qualitative study of the new product development process for electrified cars with a focus on the interface between design and manufacturing. We considered engineering, business, and sociological perspectives to address cross-functional integration from different viewpoints and identified shortcomings of existing theory. We developed a new method to introduce constraints to facilitate cross-functional integration. The constraints introduced serve as stimuli for designers to consider their cross-functional counterparts’ requirements during the design process. Introducing constraints positively impacts cross-functional integration and creativity. Practitioners can use constraints with intention to steer their design processes in a purposeful direction.","Bix, Susanne;Witt, Peter",Journal,Research Technology Management,2020-09-02,Bergische Universität Wuppertal;School of Management in Vallendar,Case study research ;  Constraints in innovation ;  Cross-functional integration ;  Integrated new product development
Boundary-spanning for managing digital innovation in the AEC sector,"Managing projects in Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) undergoes a digital transformation as novel technologies emerge. Digital technologies, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), push this transformation. Innovation happens in firms and project-based organisations where agents shape how digital technologies are adopted and implemented. This study offers insights into agents of digital innovation, by conducting engaged scholarship within the case study of one large international multi-disciplinary consultancy. The study first builds upon qualitative data collected by interviewing digital agents. Additional data, for triangulation and research validation, were collected from an internal online platform. The analysis revealed a disconnect between digital agents’ technical background, skills and their managerial routines. These individuals crossed professional, hierarchical and organisational boundaries, showed multi-membership and held fluid identities. This has implications for the interfaces between organisational behaviour and projects. The study concludes with suggestions for AEC organisations to reap the benefits of digitalisation.","Azzouz, Ammar;Papadonikolaki, E.",Journal,Architectural Engineering and Design Management,2020-09-02,The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment;University of Bath,boundary spanner ;  boundary theory ;  Digital technologies ;  innovation ;  project manager

"A Connected Autonomous Vehicle Testbed: Capabilities, Experimental Processes and Lessons Learned","VENTURER was one of the first three UK government funded research and innovation projects on Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and was conducted predominantly in the South West region of the country. A series of increasingly complex scenarios conducted in an urban setting were used to: (i) evaluate the technology created as a part of the project; (ii) systematically assess participant responses to CAVs and; (iii) inform the development of potential insurance models and legal frameworks. Developing this understanding contributed key steps towards facilitating the deployment of CAVs on UK roads. This paper aims to describe the VENTURER Project trials, their objectives and detail some of the key technologies used. Importantly we aim to introduce some informative challenges that were overcame and the subsequent project and technological lessons learned in a hope to help others plan and execute future CAV research. The project successfully integrated several technologies crucial to CAV development. These included, a Decision Making System using behaviour trees to make high level decisions; A pilot-control system to smoothly and comfortably turn plans into throttle and steering actuation; Sensing and perception systems to make sense of raw sensor data; Inter-CAV Wireless communication capable of demonstrating vehicle-to-vehicle communication of potential hazards. The closely coupled technology integration, testing and participant-focused trial schedule led to a greatly improved understanding of the engineering and societal barriers that CAV development faces. From a behavioural standpoint the importance of reliability and repeatability far outweighs a need for novel trajectories, while the sensor-to-perception capabilities are critical, the process of verification and validation is extremely time consuming. Additionally, the added capabilities that can be leveraged from inter-CAV communications shows the potential for improved road safety that could result. Importantly, to effectively conduct human factors experiments in the CAV sector under consistent and repeatable conditions, one needs to define a scripted and stable set of scenarios that uses reliable equipment and a controllable environmental setting. This requirement can often be at odds with making significant technology developments, and if both are part of a project’s goals then they may need to be separated from each other.","Kent, Thomas;Pipe, Anthony;Richards, Arthur;Hutchinson, Jim;Schuster, Wolfgang",Journal,Automation,2020-09-01,Bristol Robotics Laboratory;Atkins Global;University of Bristol;Fusion Processing Ltd,automation ;  autonomous systems ;  autonomous vehicles ;  future mobility ;  sensors ;  simulation
NLP-based Enhancement of Information Security in ITO-A Diffusion of Innovation Theory perspective,"Information technology outsourcing (ITO) has grown significantly in recent decades and is now over a USD trillion-dollar industry. Service provider organisations are striving to improve the efficiencies of their service deliveries. Natural language processing (NLP) provides an opportunity to bring efficiencies through automation in understanding and processing information. Since information security risk management (ISRM) in ITO is a growing concern of both, client and service provider organisations, they are adopting to improve ISRM in ITO using NLP. This paper explores those ISRM improvement scenarios. It also investigates the information security risks (ISRs) that result from the use of NLP in ITO and proposes strategies to manage those ISRs. To gain insights into the problem, a qualitative research approach is followed using the case study method. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted from participants in three organisations in the ICT industry, engaged in an ITO relationship. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to investigate the use of NLP for enhancing ISRM in ITO.","Bhatti, Baber Majid;Mubarak, Sameera;Nagalingam, Sev",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering Workshops, ASEW 2020",2020-09-01,University of South Australia,Information Security Risk (ISR) ;  Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) ;  Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) ;  Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Research and application of bridge construction innovation technology in water conservation areas,"Traditional building materials account for a large proportion in the process of bridge construction, which will cause serious environmental pollution and waste of natural resources. The application of modern wood structure used for the bridge construction in water conservation areas, not only benefit for the environmental protection, but has the advantages of high stability, short construction period and low costs. Based on the successful cases of applications, this study conducted a more in-depth theoretical analysis of modern wood construction technologies. The measured and design values for the arch axis of a bridge were calculated, which confirms that the applicability of modern wood structure has important economic and ecological benefits. In addition, the mechanical properties of wooden bridge under the design load are analyzed based on load tests of a wooden pedestrian overpass. The results showed that the heavy wood structure bridge has good application prospects in engineering environment.","Wang, Shuijiang",Journal,Fresenius Environmental Bulletin,2020-09-01,Sichuan College of Architectural Technology,Ecological benefits ;  Engineering environment ;  Environmental pollution ;  Modern wood structure ;  Natural resource ;  Theoretical analysis
Automation of the leonardo da vinci machines,"Leonardo da Vinci inventions and projects represent an intriguing starting point to remark the concept that innovation must be considered as a continuous route towards evolution in history. Some of the particular ideas and innovations presented by Leonardo da Vinci led us to formulate a link with automatic control. Selected models of the Leonardo da Vinci machines are presented in this paper, taking strictly into account the original mechanical schemes and working principles, but introducing modern low-cost control equipment, emphasizing the role of automatic control and that of electronic control devices, such as microcontrollers, sensors, and communication devices, to completely automate the Leonardo da Vinci machines. The approach outlined in the paper can be applied not only to other Leonardo machines but also to other mechanical equipment not necessarily designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Moreover, it is useful to remark that the approach followed in this paper can be very important also to introduce students, leading by example, to concepts typical of automation and for assisting in learning, keeping in mind the practical applications of advanced automation principles. The main research task of this paper is proving the efficacy of modern digital control techniques and teleoperation in strongly classical mechanical Leonardo machines, remarking that the projects of Leonardo are prompt to be efficiently controlled. This task could not be explored by Leonardo himself due to the lack of control technology. Moreover, the paper is addressed also to stimulate the young generations of engineers in joining classical mechanics with advanced technology. Therefore, the paper is also devoted to give focus on the fact that the Leonardo machines encompass all the key aspects of modern system engineering.","Bucolo, Maide;Buscarino, Arturo;Famoso, Carlo;Fortuna, Luigi;Gagliano, Salvina",Journal,Machines,2020-09-01,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche;Università degli Studi di Catania,Control education ;  Educational engineering ;  Intelligent devices ;  Machines ;  Microcontrollers
"Heat and mass transfer in the food, energy, and water nexus - A review","Engineering innovations - including those in heat and mass transfer - are needed to provide food, water, and power to a growing population (i.e., projected to be 9.8×109 by 2050) with limited resources. The interweaving of these resources is embodied in the food, energy, and water (FEW) nexus. This review paper focuses on heat and mass transfer applications which involve at least two aspects of the FEW nexus. Energy and water topics include energy extraction of natural gas hydrates and shale gas; power production (e.g., nuclear and solar); power plant cooling (e.g., wet, dry, and hybrid cooling); water desalination and purification; and building energy/water use, including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration technology. Subsequently, this review considers agricultural thermal fluids applications, such as the food and water nexus (e.g., evapotranspiration and evaporation) and the FEW nexus (e.g., greenhouses and food storage, including granaries and freezing/drying). As part of this review, over 100 review papers on thermal and fluid topics relevant to the FEW nexus were tabulated and over 350 research journal articles were discussed. Each section discusses previous research and highlights future opportunities regarding heat and mass transfer research. Several crosscutting themes emerged from the literature and represent future directions for thermal fluids research: the need for fundamental, thermal fluids knowledge; scaling up from the laboratory to large-scale, integrated systems; increasing economic viability; and increasing efficiency when utilizing resources, especially using waste products.","Derby, Melanie M.;Adams, Allison N.;Chakraborty, Partha P.;Haque, Mohammad Rejaul;Huber, Ryan A.;Morrow, Jordan A.;Riley, Gennifer A.;Ross, Molly;Stallbaumer, Emily M.;Betz, Amy R.;Bindra, Hitesh",Journal,Journal of Heat Transfer,2020-09-01,Carl R.

The strategic transformation of human resource management mode in ocean engineering university,"Ocean power is the direction of China's future development, which is inseparable from the scientific development of marine higher education. Therefore, the University of Ocean Engineering in China must strengthen the construction of disciplines and specialties, which will improve the quality of marine higher education. Subject construction can not be separated from teachers, which requires colleges and universities to gradually transform their own human resource management model. Therefore, ocean engineering colleges and universities should build their own human resource management model based on discipline construction, which will gradually strengthen the integration system process of disciplines. By breaking down the barriers, the University of ocean engineering can strengthen the cooperation between industry, University, research and application, which will realize the collaborative innovation among disciplines. This paper constructs the strategic framework and supporting system of human resource management. Finally, this paper puts forward some transformation suggestions.","Yuan, Yitian",Journal,Journal of Coastal Research,2020-09-01,Ginkgo College of Hospitality Management,Human resource management mode ;  Ocean engineering university ;  Strategic transformation
Patent portfolio in nuclear technologies and development policies: Lessons for sustainability,"National Nuclear Institutions (NNIs) from Latin America are currently facing multidimensional challenges related to their sustainability in national and international context. These institutions need to increase their relevance and visibility by converting science, technology and innovation (STI) into practical guidelines. However, as countries worldwide have been experiencing austerity measures, government funding for education and research and development (R&D) has declined more strongly, especially in the region. In addition, the lack of focused performance in building capabilities and competencies for the advancement of the nuclear sector, as well as in taking its competitive advantage to other domains of knowledge and industries to create new business opportunities, makes it imperative to adapt strategies to the external environment: Latin American NNIs should align with development policies to generate sustainable R&D and foster innovation. The National Commission for Nuclear Energy (CNEN) of Brazil is a public NNI in the Latin America region looking forward to a new approach to direct its results more effectively towards innovation. The present article refers to a study on the management of technology aiming at identifying in which degree CNEN's R&D activities can create value and are aligned with STI, sustainability and development priorities. The methodology relies on the assessment of CNEN's portfolio of patented technologies filed at the Brazil Patent Office, based on the International Patent Classification (IPC) and technology reclassification adopted by ISI-OST-INPI, a qualitative analysis between the technology cluster result and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and patent value indicators that focus on the nature, technological scope and patent portfolio effect of these technologies. The results point out the strengths and weaknesses of CNEN's patent portfolio and innovation strategies. Important technology clusters can be depicted and may help improve linkages with national industry for sustainability: environmental technologies for waste treatment and biodegradable products; nuclear technologies for industrial processes and instrumentation; and nanotechnologies for materials processing and electrical engineering with applications in medicine, health and fuel cells. On the other hand, a great effort must be undertaken to introduce these clusters as key enabling technologies into the Brazilian economy by leveraging businesses not only to technology-intensive industries, but also to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The relevance of this article converges with the need and importance of CNEN's participation in the national system of innovation with technology transfer mechanisms to meet the needs of Brazilian society and the global market.","Archila, Daniela Lima Cerqueira;Campos, Tereza Raquel Taulois",Conference Proceeding,"Towards the Digital World and Industry X.0 - Proceedings of the 29th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2020",2020-09-01,National Commission of Nuclear Energy / Research and Development Directorate,Innovation ;  National Nuclear Institutions (NNIs) ;  Nuclear technology ;  Patents ;  Sustainable development
Management of technology in a post-digital world,"We are transitioning from a digital to a post-digital world. This post-digital world is more concerned with people and being human than with being digital. The closeness of humans and technology creates 'life-worlds' where rapid shifts in taste and preferences are derived from technologies supporting work and living. A time-factor and ability for technology to morph dynamically is thus added to the understanding of the market/product/technology/knowledge space. This implies technology should be sensitive to, reshape and re-assemble to adapt to instantaneous need shifts. We must have a new view of how we design and manufacture and use products and services relying on digital technology. This transition from a digital to a post-digital world will challenge our understanding of Management of Technology (MoT). In this conceptual paper, we explore some of the shifts in MoT that will be required to address the post-digital age. The current worldview of MoT is based on a definition agreed upon when MoT was a fledgling discipline in the late 1980s. It states, in essence, that MoT combines the disciplines of science, engineering and management to plan, develop and implement technology to reach the strategic and operational objectives of the enterprise. With the post-digital world that has emerged from the application of technology, this definition may fall short and should include humanities and social sciences as a disciplinary base, together with new thinking on where planning, development and implementation of technology is done. This does not exclusively take place in the technology-based enterprise anymore, but often at point of use. The impact of consumer innovation and personal fabrication on technology adoption has been studied and the resulting changes required in business models and adoption behaviour were highlighted. This begs the question whether the technology enterprise should mainly do MoT to address its strategic and operational objectives. A manufacturing enterprise, for example, in the post-digital world, may see a total shift in its offering from finished products to raw materials and algorithms for point-of-use manufacturing. The conceptual model proposed in this paper borrows from the ancient geometry of pyramids and indicates the necessity to broaden the definition of MoT in a post-digital world. It describes the multifaceted world of MoT and indicates transitions required to expand the thinking in MoT to be aligned with the rapidly changing role of technology, and especially the close integration of technology and humans to the extent that boundaries are blurred. The work is highly philosophical and links to previous models developed by the author. It provides a landscape for scholars and practitioners of MoT to better relate the discipline to the post-digital world. It is industry independent and universal in terms of applying MoT to different technologies, processes, products, services and markets over time. User preference drives one of the determinants of the post-digital world, namely that of customisation. The post-digital world is not an outcome of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In fact, it is the new behaviour of humans around technology that necessitated the revolution. MoT models should thus be at the core of demand-driven change and assist in creating 'life-worlds' where humans and technology exist in synergy. Two major changes in MoT are proposed; that of its definition to align with the post-digital world and how it is applied with a time factor to account for fast change.","Botha, Anthon P.",Conference Proceeding,"Towards the Digital World and Industry X.0 - Proceedings of the 29th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2020",2020-09-01,University of Pretoria;TechnoScene (Pty) Ltd,Conceptual model ;  Management of technology ;  MoT definition ;  Post-digital world

Industry or Academia: Where Are the Innovators?,"Where are the innovators? The answer to this question is complex; as an immediate response, one might answer, ""It depends!""To begin with, it is appropriate to define two words that frequently cross each other in such discussions? innovation and research.

"Building the integrated observational network of ""Transparent Ocean""","We live in an exciting era for ocean science, particularly when compared to three decades ago when the ocean was vastly underexplored. Progress can only be made through discovery, observation, understanding of the ocean from the surface to the deep sea, from global to local processes, and from physics, biogeochemistry to ecology. Ocean observation is the basis of oceanic scientific research and is a key to global competition in marine science and technology. Breakthroughs depend on innovation in marine observation and exploration technology. Based on the current frontier issues of ocean science, we report ways to build a three-dimensional observation network of ""Transparent Ocean"". The network will effectively promote China's construction of an international collaborative innovation network for marine science. The three-dimensional observation network ""Transparent Ocean"" focuses on building an intelligent mobile platform and integrates satellites, fixed platforms, vessel network, and submarine observation systems to make the oceans truly transparent. This network includes four sub-programs. (1) An Ocean Star Cluster Program, which resolves ocean variability at sub-meso and sub-week scales with a centimeter-level accuracy, to partially reveal the marine life system and ecosystem with a 10-m vertical interval in the euphotic layer, moving a significant step forward towards a ""Transparent Ocean"" down to the vicinity of thermocline both dynamically and bio-optically. (2) An Air-Sea Interface Program, which aims to build an observational network that integrates fixed and mobile platforms to achieve a three-dimensional view of key elements/variables of the air-sea interface. (3) A Starry Deep Sea Program, which builds a deep sea observation system with deep Argo, deep gliders, deep-sea autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), intelligent buoys, and other facilities. The system will provide support for information procurement through deep sea navigation and positioning technology. (4) An Undersea Perspective Program, which integrates seabed observation network, communication, navigation and positioning, with intelligent charging technologies to build an intelligent exploration network from water to the seabed. In addition, there is a Deep Blue Brain Project, which will build a marine internet of things with the goal to enhance the ability of intelligent services from data to customers. To date, breakthroughs have been made in research and development of cutting-edge marine technologies, providing new means for ocean observation and exploration. With respect to the ocean observation network, China has built a pilot mooring network with over one hundred sub-surface moorings and almost ten surface buoys in the western Pacific, South China Sea and the Indian Ocean over the past decade. In the next decade, it is essential to integrate observations, process studies and prediction/projection, so as to meet multiple demands of end users.","Wu, Lixin;Chen, Zhaohui;Lin, Xiaopei;Liu, Yongzheng",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2020-09-01,Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology;Ocean University of China,Marine observation and exploration technology ;  Three-dimensional observation network ;  Transparent Ocean ;  Transparent state

Recent progress in processing functionally graded polymer foams,"Polymer foams are an important class of engineering material that are finding diverse applications, including as structural parts in automotive industry, insulation in construction, core materials for sandwich composites, and cushioning in mattresses. The vast majority of these manufactured foams are homogeneous with respect to porosity and structural properties. In contrast, while cellular materials are also ubiquitous in nature, nature mostly fabricates heterogeneous foams, e.g., cellulosic plant stems like bamboo, or a human femur bone. Foams with such engineered porosity distribution (graded density structure) have useful property gradients and are referred to as functionally graded foams. Functionally graded polymer foams are one of the key emerging innovations in polymer foam technology. They allow enhancement in properties such as energy absorption, more efficient use of material, and better design for specific applications, such as helmets and tissue restorative scaffolds. Here, following an overview of key processing parameters for polymer foams, we explore recent developments in processing functionally graded polymer foams and their emerging structures and properties. Processes can be as simple as utilizing different surface materials from which the foam forms, to as complex as using microfluidics. We also highlight principal challenges that need addressing in future research, the key one being development of viable generic processes that allow (complete) control and tailoring of porosity distribution on an application-by-application basis.","Suethao, Supitta;Shah, Darshil U.;Smitthipong, Wirasak",Journal,Materials,2020-09-01,University of Cambridge;Kasetsart University;National Research Council of Thailand;Thailand Science Research and Innovation,Cellular materials ;  Functionally graded structure ;  Microstructure ;  Porous polymers ;  Property gradient

"Prospects of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products–Based Therapies in Regenerative Dentistry: Current Status, Comparison with Global Trends in Medicine, and Future Perspectives","Introduction: Regenerative medicine offers innovative approaches to restore damaged tissues on the basis of tissue engineering (TE). Although research on advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) has been very active in recent years, the number of licensed products remains surprisingly low and restricted to the treatment of severe, incurable diseases. Methods: This paper provides a critical review of current literature on the regulatory, clinical, and commercial status of ATMP-based therapies in the EU and worldwide and the hurdles to overcome for their broader application in Regenerative Dentistry. Results: Competent authorities have focused on developing regulatory pathways to address unmet patient needs. Oncology represents the dominating field, followed by cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurodegenerative, immunologic, and inherited diseases. Yet, the status remains in early development, and scientific, regulatory, and cost-effectiveness issues impose considerable hurdles toward marketing authorization, technology adoption, and patient accessibility. In this context, although regenerative dentistry has achieved breakthrough innovations in TE of several dental/oral tissues in preclinical models, it has hardly harnessed research progress to integrate innovative regenerative treatments into clinical practice. Conclusion: Global demographic changes, which demonstrate a steady increase of the aging population, highlight the societal need for the application of ATMP-based therapies in the treatment of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Although oral diseases, as an integral part of NCDs, are not life-threatening and largely preventable, they sustain high prevalence, with severe burden on economy and quality of life. In this perspective, the urgent request to ultimately translate draining research in dental TE conducted during the last decades into innovative treatments brought safely and cost-effectively into society at large still holds the stage. This review provides an overview of the regulatory, clinical, and commercial status of ATMP-based therapies in the European Union and worldwide and the hurdles to overcome for their broader application in regenerative dentistry.","Bakopoulou, Athina",Journal,Journal of Endodontics,2020-09-01,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,Advanced therapy medicinal products ;  implementation science ;  regenerative dentistry ;  regulatory framework ;  tissue engineering ;  translational research
Exploring cultivation path of building information modelling in China: An analysis from the perspective of an innovation ecosystem,"Ecosystem theory provides a new perspective for studying the development of the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry in the age of information and communication technology (ICT). As an extremely ICT innovation, building information modelling (BIM) not only brings technical benefits to the AEC industry, but changes the innovation paradigm of the AEC industry towards an innovation ecosystem, which improve productivity and sustainability throughout the project life cycle. This article contributes to innovation ecosystem theory by exploring the structure of the BIM ecosystem and deriving its cultivation path. Then, as the leading city in China for developing BIM technologies, Shanghai was selected as the case study to elaborate on the cultivation path of the BIM ecosystem. The results indicate that three layers identified in the structure contribute to the understanding of the boundaries, units, and analytical focus of the BIM ecosystem, with the BIM platform being the core layer. This topology structure, with the BIM platform as the hub, promotes interdependency and symbiosis among participants in the cultivation of the BIM ecosystem, supporting the birth, expansion, maturity, re-innovation (or extinction), and sustainable development of the BIM ecosystem. This research complements and extends literature on the BIM ecosystem, and provides implications as to the construction, cultivation, and sustainability of BIM ecosystems for emerging economy firms.","Yang, Yingnan;Zhang, Yidan;Xie, Hongming",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-09-01,College of Civil Engineering and Architecture Zhejiang University;Guangzhou University;The University of Hong Kong,Architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry ;  Building information modelling (BIM) ;  Cultivation ;  Ecosystem ;  Sustainability
"Systematic review on inclusive education, sustainability in engineering: An analysis with mixed methods and data mining techniques","In the last few years, research in the field of sustainability has experienced a significant increase in interest between sustainability and other areas (inclusive education, active methodologies, and society). Moreover, the use of mixed research methods (quantitative and qualitative) along with the application of data mining techniques, enables the analysis of information and the connection between the different studies. The objectives of this paper were: (1) To establish the results of the research related to the concepts of sustainability, inclusive education, and disability. (2) To study the key concepts that are detected in the articles selected with respect to the concepts of sustainability, inclusive education, disability, and their relations. In order to do so, two studies were carried out (quantitative and qualitative). In the first study, K-means and heat map clustering techniques were applied. In the second study, the technique of text mining was applied. One hundred and thirty-three scientific papers were studied, of which 54 fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Three clusters were found in the first study; cluster 1 included the categories: inclusive society, educational innovation, and active methodologies. Cluster 2 included active methodologies and society and economy and cluster 3 included inclusive society and society and economy. In the second study, the highest Krippendorff's Alpha coefficient were found in articles that linked sustainability with social transformation stemming from a change in education by means of the use of active teaching methods and technological resources. The research moves towards the development of competencies in sustainability at all stages of the educational system, and in all areas of knowledge.","Sáiz-Manzanares, María Consuelo;Gutiérrez-González, Sara;Rodríguez, Ángel;Cuenca-Romero, Lourdes Alameda;Calderón, Verónica;Queiruga-Dios, Miguel Ángel",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-09-01,Universidad de Burgos,Data mining techniques ;  Disability ;  Inclusive education ;  Mixed methods ;  Sustainability
Bibliometric and social network analysis of civil engineering sustainability research from 2015 to 2019,"With the development of civil engineering sustainability, the scope of corresponding research covers a broader range.

Requirements engineering in software startups: A systematic mapping study,"Startups have high failure rates due to their inability to attain a sufficient product/market fit, i.e., delivering a solution that best matches the user needs in the market. Requirement engineering is the activity that could help startup teams identify the value proposition that provides high value to the users and continuously innovate it. The objective of the study is to analyse the state of art of the requirement engineering research in the context of startups, as available in the literature. The analysis of the research area highlights the research trends to achieve two things i.e., (a) predict how much support the startups can get from the literature for enhancing their success rates and (b) identify the research gaps to motivate researchers to conduct future research that could be adoptable in startup contexts. Systematic mapping is conducted on studies extracted from the four bibliographic databases (IEEExplore, ACM, Springerlink and ScienceDirect) and studies extracted by using a forward snowballing approach. Individual studies are coded to yield the classification scheme. Formulated schemes and those already available in literature, were populated with information extracted from the abstracts of the studies. The research is mostly focused on generic requirement engineering and product validation activities. The research is conducted mostly as evaluations (empirical studies) with the outcome of providing theory to the research community. Major underlying motivation of the research is to attain the product/market fit. However, research studies focusing on requirement documentation, prioritization and elicitation are losing focus from 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The literature lacks the studies that reports research solutions which are validated in laboratory settings or in real contexts, experience reports, opinion papers and philosophical papers. The positive side of the finding is that the number of requirement engineering research studies in a startup context have increased in the past five years. At this instant, unfortunately the literature has limited ability to support startups by providing solutions (for instance, research solutions, evidence to support decision makings, best practices, experiences etc.) that are adoptable in their real context. Uniform focus of the researchers across all sub-activities of requirement engineering is required with effort distributed across different research types that supports startups, not only by providing validated solutions but experience reports, opinions, new conceptual frameworks and empirical evidence that can aid their decision making.","Gupta, Varun;Fernandez-Crehuet, Jose Maria;Hanne, Thomas;Telesko, Rainer",Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2020-09-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz FHNW,Requirement engineering ;  Software startups ;  Systematic mapping study ;  Value proposition innovation
Application of the safe-by-design concept in crop breeding innovation,"The present paper proposes the application of the safe-by-design concept to crop breeding innovation with the aim to accommodate safety considerations for new agricultural food and feed products. Safe-by-design can be implemented in all stages of the innovation cycle of agricultural products, from the early stages of research and development towards the post-market stage. Our proposed application of safe-by-design can be part of “responsible research and innovation” concepts, because they share features such as risk prevention strategies and a participatory approach. Early awareness of potential safety issues can guide the development of agricultural products towards safe options, both at the process and product level, and thus may help to reduce extensive pre-market assessment studies that might otherwise be needed further downstream for regulatory product approval. Here, it is discussed how the proposed safe-by-design approach can be introduced into the development of safe food crops using emerging technologies, such as gene editing and synthetic biology, and how this may help to safeguard the safety of our food and feed supply in the light of the ongoing global innovations in agricultural crop breeding.","van der Berg, Jan Pieter;Kleter, Gijs A.;Battaglia, Evy;Bouwman, Lianne M.S.;Kok, Esther J.",Journal,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2020-09-01,Wageningen University & Research,Crop breeding innovations ;  Food ;  Risk assessment ;  Safe-by-design ;  Synthetic biology
"The who, what, how of software engineering research: a socio-technical framework","Software engineering is a socio-technical endeavor, and while many of our contributions focus on technical aspects, human stakeholders such as software developers are directly affected by and can benefit from our research and tool innovations. In this paper, we question how much of our research addresses human and social issues, and explore how much we study human and social aspects in our research designs. To answer these questions, we developed a socio-technical research framework to capture the main beneficiary of a research study (the who), the main type of research contribution produced (the what), and the research strategies used in the study (how we methodologically approach delivering relevant results given the who and what of our studies). We used this Who-What-How framework to analyze 151 papers from two well-cited publishing venues—the main technical track at the International Conference on Software Engineering, and the Empirical Software Engineering Journal by Springer—to assess how much this published research explicitly considers human aspects. We find that although a majority of these papers claim the contained research should benefit human stakeholders, most focus predominantly on technical contributions. Although our analysis is scoped to two venues, our results suggest a need for more diversification and triangulation of research strategies. In particular, there is a need for strategies that aim at a deeper understanding of human and social aspects of software development practice to balance the design and evaluation of technical innovations. We recommend that the framework should be used in the design of future studies in order to steer software engineering research towards explicitly including human and social concerns in their designs, and to improve the relevance of our research for human stakeholders.","Storey, Margaret Anne;Ernst, Neil A.;Williams, Courtney;Kalliamvakou, Eirini",Journal,Empirical Software Engineering,2020-09-01,University of Victoria,Empirical methods ;  Human studies ;  Meta-research ;  Software engineering ;  Survey
Proposed Requirements for Cardiovascular Imaging-Related Machine Learning Evaluation (PRIME): A Checklist: Reviewed by the American College of Cardiology Healthcare Innovation Council,"Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used within cardiology, particularly in the domain of cardiovascular imaging. Due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of ML algorithms, inconsistencies in the model performance and interpretation may occur. Several review articles have been recently published that introduce the fundamental principles and clinical application of ML for cardiologists. This paper builds on these introductory principles and outlines a more comprehensive list of crucial responsibilities that need to be completed when developing ML models. This paper aims to serve as a scientific foundation to aid investigators, data scientists, authors, editors, and reviewers involved in machine learning research with the intent of uniform reporting of ML investigations. An independent multidisciplinary panel of ML experts, clinicians, and statisticians worked together to review the theoretical rationale underlying 7 sets of requirements that may reduce algorithmic errors and biases. Finally, the paper summarizes a list of reporting items as an itemized checklist that highlights steps for ensuring correct application of ML models and the consistent reporting of model specifications and results. It is expected that the rapid pace of research and development and the increased availability of real-world evidence may require periodic updates to the checklist.","Sengupta, Partho P.;Shrestha, Sirish;Berthon, Béatrice;Messas, Emmanuel;Donal, Erwan;Tison, Geoffrey H.;Min, James K.;D'hooge, Jan;Voigt, Jens Uwe;Dudley, Joel;Verjans, Johan W.;Shameer, Khader;Johnson, Kipp;Lovstakken, Lasse;Tabassian, Mahdi;Piccirilli, Marco;Pernot, Mathieu;Yanamala, Naveena;Duchateau, Nicolas;Kagiyama, Nobuyuki;Bernard, Olivier;Slomka, Piotr;Deo, Rahul;Arnaout, Rima",Journal,JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging,2020-09-01,Université Paris Cité;Departement Cardiovasculaire Wetenschappen;CREATIS (Centre de Recherche en Acquisition et Traitement de l'Image pour la Santé);UCSF School of Medicine;KU Leuven– University Hospital Leuven;École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes;KU Leuven;West Virginia University;Cedars-Sinai Medical Center;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai;The University of Adelaide;Cleerly Inc,artificial intelligence ;  cardiovascular imaging ;  checklist ;  digital health ;  machine learning ;  reporting guidelines ;  reproducible research
Risk of COVID-19 among front-line health-care workers and the general community: a prospective cohort study,"Background: Data for front-line health-care workers and risk of COVID-19 are limited. We sought to assess risk of COVID-19 among front-line health-care workers compared with the general community and the effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) on risk. Methods: We did a prospective, observational cohort study in the UK and the USA of the general community, including front-line health-care workers, using self-reported data from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application (app) from March 24 (UK) and March 29 (USA) to April 23, 2020. Participants were voluntary users of the app and at first use provided information on demographic factors (including age, sex, race or ethnic background, height and weight, and occupation) and medical history, and subsequently reported any COVID-19 symptoms. We used Cox proportional hazards modelling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of our primary outcome, which was a positive COVID-19 test. The COVID Symptom Study app is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04331509. Findings: Among 2 035 395 community individuals and 99 795 front-line health-care workers, we recorded 5545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34 435 272 person-days. Compared with the general community, front-line health-care workers were at increased risk for reporting a positive COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 11·61, 95% CI 10·93–12·33). To account for differences in testing frequency between front-line health-care workers and the general community and possible selection bias, an inverse probability-weighted model was used to adjust for the likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 3·40, 95% CI 3·37–3·43). Secondary and post-hoc analyses suggested adequacy of PPE, clinical setting, and ethnic background were also important factors. Interpretation: In the UK and the USA, risk of reporting a positive test for COVID-19 was increased among front-line health-care workers. Health-care systems should ensure adequate availability of PPE and develop additional strategies to protect health-care workers from COVID-19, particularly those from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic backgrounds. Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed.

Surface Engineering of Cardiovascular Devices for Improved Hemocompatibility and Rapid Endothelialization,"Cardiovascular devices have been widely applied in the clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, poor hemocompatibility and slow endothelialization on their surface still exist. Numerous surface engineering strategies have mainly sought to modify the device surface through physical, chemical, and biological approaches to improve surface hemocompatibility and endothelialization. The alteration of physical characteristics and pattern topographies brings some hopeful outcomes and plays a notable role in this respect. The chemical and biological approaches can provide potential signs of success in the endothelialization of vascular device surfaces. They usually involve therapeutic drugs, specific peptides, adhesive proteins, antibodies, growth factors and nitric oxide (NO) donors. The gene engineering can enhance the proliferation, growth, and migration of vascular cells, thus boosting the endothelialization. In this review, the surface engineering strategies are highlighted and summarized to improve hemocompatibility and rapid endothelialization on the cardiovascular devices. The potential outlook is also briefly discussed to help guide endothelialization strategies and inspire further innovations. It is hoped that this review can assist with the surface engineering of cardiovascular devices and promote future advancements in this emerging research field.","Zhao, Jing;Feng, Yakai",Journal,Advanced Healthcare Materials,2020-09-01,Tianjin University;Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering,cardiovascular devices ;  endothelialization ;  gene engineering ;  hemocompatibility ;  surface modification
"Foundations for Soft, Smart Matter by Active Mechanical Metamaterials","Emerging interest to synthesize active, engineered matter suggests a future where smart material systems and structures operate autonomously around people, serving diverse roles in engineering, medical, and scientific applications. Similar to biological organisms, a realization of active, engineered matter necessitates functionality culminating from a combination of sensory and control mechanisms in a versatile material frame. Recently, metamaterial platforms with integrated sensing and control have been exploited, so that outstanding non-natural material behaviors are empowered by synergistic microstructures and controlled by smart materials and systems. This emerging body of science around active mechanical metamaterials offers a first glimpse at future foundations for autonomous engineered systems referred to here as soft, smart matter. Using natural inspirations, synergy across disciplines, and exploiting multiple length scales as well as multiple physics, researchers are devising compelling exemplars of actively controlled metamaterials, inspiring concepts for autonomous engineered matter. While scientific breakthroughs multiply in these fields, future technical challenges remain to be overcome to fulfill the vision of soft, smart matter. This Review surveys the intrinsically multidisciplinary body of science targeted to realize soft, smart matter via innovations in active mechanical metamaterials and proposes ongoing research targets that may deliver the promise of autonomous, engineered matter to full fruition.","Pishvar, Maya;Harne, Ryan L.",Journal,Advanced Science,2020-09-01,College of Engineering,active mechanical metamaterials ;  flexible electronics ;  smart materials ;  soft matter ;  soft robotics
Not in the job description: The commercial activities of academic scientists and engineers,"Scholarly work seeking to understand academics’ commercial activities often draws on abstract notions of the academic reward system and the representative scientist. Few scholars have examined whether and how scientists’ motives to engage in commercial activities differ across fields. Similarly, efforts to understand academics’ choices have focused on three self-interested motives—recognition, challenge, and money—ignoring the potential role of the desire to have an impact on others. Using panel data for a national sample of over 2,000 academics employed at U.S. institutions, we examine how the four motives are related to commercial activity measured by patenting. We find that all four motives are correlated with patenting, but these relationships differ systematically between the life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering. These field differences are consistent with differences across fields in the rewards from commercial activities as well as in the degree of overlap between traditional and commercializable research, which affects the opportunity costs of time spent away from “traditional” academic work. We discuss potential implications for policy makers, administrators, and managers as well as for future research on the scientific enterprise.","Cohen, Wesley M.;Sauermann, Henry;Stephan, Paula",Journal,Management Science,2020-09-01,ESMT Berlin;Fuqua School of Business;National Bureau of Economic Research;Georgia State University,Academia-industry interface ;  Academic entrepreneurship ;  Economics of science ;  Innovation ;  Motivation and incentives ;  Research ;  Technology commercialization
Educational experiences with Generation Z,"The development of the “knowledge society” implies social transformation in which citizens need not only knowledge but also new skills and competencies, some unpredictable, to face new situations. Students of Generation Z are authentic digital natives who are a hyper cognitive generation with different student profiles than before. They are creating pressures for change, and there is a growing competition of universities for global human talent and demand for qualified graduates to do jobs that do not yet exist. Even the very development of technology, which is available to many, has motivated world-class universities to develop innovative programs and new ideas to accelerate and improve the teaching and learning process for knowledge and competencies. One of the most important actions to achieve this is the investment in technological resources to offer new ways of teaching and learning. Technology adds value to the teaching and learning experience, which students exploit widely to improve or accelerate the academic process, but technology can certainly also promote or develop additional skills and competencies. In this research, we present a review of educational technology with examples of current applications performed by different educational institutions. Also, students of Generation Z relationship and preferences regarding educational technologies are presented. Besides, emerging technologies that are being exploited by this Generation Z of students in Higher Education Institutions are identified and analyzed. This research presents the experiences of several successful and innovative cases regarding teaching students of Generation Z.","Hernandez-de-Menendez, Marcela;Escobar Díaz, Carlos A.;Morales-Menendez, Ruben",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2020-09-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey;General Motors,Educational innovation ;  Emerging technologies ;  Generation Z ;  Teaching/learning experiences
Engineering education for smart 4.0 technology: a review,"Industry 4.0 (I4), defined as the integration of information and communication technology with industrial advances to develop digital factories, will transform production processes by making them more efficient, green, and flexible. Manufacturers must overcome barriers to implement this approach; one of them is the lack of qualified talent to manage I4 systems. This paper is a review of the state-of-art of I4. The goal of this research is to describe the technologies that are enablers of I4, analyze the human talent needed and the qualifications (competencies/skills) required to manage I4 systems, describe the courses and practices that leading universities in engineering and technology are teaching for developing the I4 workforce, and provide a look to the future by presenting trends related to education in I4. Autonomous robots, simulation, horizontal and vertical integration, the Industrial Internet of Things, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, cybersecurity, the cloud, and Big Data and analytics are technologies considered pillars of the I4 approach. Nowadays, there are universities already offering programs related to I4. These range from those aimed at presenting the concepts of I4 to those in which students learn how to handle related technologies in real work in global enterprises. I4 is still evolving, and we present only a glimpse of what is required based on its current state. Continuous review of the I4 environment is necessary to determine opportunely the path that it will follow and, in consequence, the needs that will emerge in areas such as curricula content, competency requirements, and technologies.","Hernandez-de-Menendez, Marcela;Escobar Díaz, Carlos A.;Morales-Menendez, Ruben",Journal,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2020-09-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey;General Motors,Educational innovation ;  Engineering education ;  Higher education ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Smart 4.0 industry ;  Smart manufacturing
"Orbital debris ontology, terminology, and knowledge modeling","The looming threat orbital debris poses to assets in orbit demands solutions. As the orbital population grows, so does the risk of collision, as well as the volume of associated data. It is, however, an opportunity for interdisciplinary innovation and cooperation. This paper focuses on the data management and knowledge modeling aspect of developing solutions for a sustainable and safe orbital space environment. An in-progress work to develop an orbital debris reference ontology [Rovetto, 2015] is summarized in order to discuss knowledge modeling for orbital debris. The formal analysis of this effort can contribute to standards development, as well as terminological and policy challenges. Leveraging the growing volumes of orbital debris and space situational awareness (SSA) data will create a more complete picture of the orbital space environment. Part of the solution will be: consistent and correct data interpretation, sharing orbital debris and SSA data in one form or another, terminology development & harmonization, and knowledge or domain modeling. To facilitate this, [Rovetto, 2015] proposed ontology development for the orbital debris and broader space domain. This paper summarizes concepts from that paper, and subsequently developed concepts [2-9]. See also https://purl.org/space-ontology and https://purl.org/space-ontology/odo. Ontology engineering is an interdisciplinary area of research related to knowledge representation and reasoning in artificial intelligence, model-based systems engineering, semantic technologies and the so-called semantic web. An ontology is effectively a computable and semantically rich terminology that presents a knowledge or domain model for a topic area. Expressions of knowledge, beliefs, or assertions are stored using formally defined terms. This knowledge base is reasoned over to yield answers to database queries, among other things. Ontologies have been developed in knowledge-based projects across various disciplines, and used for such things as search engines, chatbots, and enterprise knowledge graphs. Ontologies aim to support: interoperability, automated reasoning, data sharing and integration, data search and retrieval, and communicating the meaning of data. The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO) [1], and related ontologies [Rovetto & Kelso 2016] [Rovetto 2016, 2017], were proposed to help achieve this. ODO, for instance, is intended as a domain ontology that can be used across federated databases, offering an explicitly specified set of concepts describing the orbital debris domain. Its meaning-rich taxonomy will provide a sharable semantics for orbital debris data to, in part, consistently communicate the meaning of data to both humans and machines, and tag data elements in space object catalogs to help afford automated reasoning tasks, decision support, knowledge discovery, and information integration. ODO and the SSA ontology (SSAO) [2] is part of the overall Orbital Space Ontology concept, which is conceived as a unifying domain reference ontology. It aims to provide a knowledge representation structure of orbital space, a common semantic model, and develop a sharable terminology. Collectively this will provide common meaning for datasets, a high-level taxonomy or classification for orbital space objects, and a means to characterize space objects. Ongoing efforts have included using visualizations, R, JSON-LD, and contemporary semantic technologies. Potential applications include web-based platforms, web apps, visualizations, modeling and simulations. Community input and participation may yield a more widely understood domain model as well as facilitate terminological standards. For example, conceptual, terminological, and ontological analysis can make helpful contributions to such efforts as the Space Debris Mitigation Requirements by developing more precise, consistent and coherent terms and definitions. Other projects can also use ODO (and its related ontologies) as a common knowledge model, metadata set, taxonomy or vocabulary. Readers interested in supporting development are encouraged to make contact.","Rovetto, Robert J.;Kelso, T.

A new car concept developed with stylistic design engineering (SDE),"In this work, a structured design method, the Stylistic Design Engineering (SDE), is applied for the construction of a new minivan car, in particular a new city car, which we will call FIAT 600 Omega. The SDE, or Stylistic Design Engineering, is a structured engineering method for carrying out automotive design projects. The SDE method consists of six different phases: (1) Analysis of stylistic trends; (2) Sketches; (3) 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings; (4) 3D CAD models; (5) Rendering; (6) Solid stylistic model (also called style maquette). This project deals with the external redesign of the Fiat 600 multiple, a small minivan which was very successful in the 1950s and 1960s. SDE is a methodology consisting of various technologies and design methodologies that will be further explained in detail, such as the Pininfarina method, the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method, Benchmarking (BM), and Top Flop Analysis (TPA). The work was organized according to the different phases. Initially, the Fiat style was studied, in particular the style of the FIAT 600 MULTI PURPOUSE VEHICLE (MPV). This step is essential to better understand the characteristics of the brand and also the main characteristics carried out over the decades. Then we moved on to the freehand sketching phase, based on what we learned in the previous phase of the study. When a satisfactory shape was found for the new car, by analyzing and discarding the different proposals of the various types of style, we proceeded to the evaluation of the proportions and dimensions through two-dimensional drawings and finally we obtained the three-dimensional shape of the new car thanks to 3D CAD software and rendering software. Many advantages in the industrial world SDE takes together with its development. In fact, until the early 2000s, car design and styling was considered quite a craft activity, not a technical or scientific one, mostly based on the great capability of famous car designers and masters, just like Giugiaro, Zagato, Bertone, Pininfarina, Stephenson, Bangle, etc. Then, thanks to the industrial activity of Eng. Lorenzo Ramacciotti, former CEO of Pininfarina Spa and Mechanical Engineer, and also thanks to the academic studies developed at ALMA MATER STUDIORUM University of Bologna, SDE became the object of attention, because it is able to systematize the car design process and reduce costs. With SDE, a good design research or an industrial product development team can complete a car design project, also without the presence of a mentor. Car Design Process finally becomes with SDE a scientific method; Car Design becomes with SDE an industrial method. Industrial needs are nice products made in a short time; SDE is structured to attend these issues. Industrial challenges follow innovation, in shape and functionality; SDE is able to recognize innovation. Industrial benefits can be reached with SDE, ensuring beautiful aesthetic projects are realized systematically and with low costs.","Donnici, Giampiero;Frizziero, Leonardo;Liverani, Alfredo;Buscaroli, Giulio;Raimondo, Luna;Saponaro, Eleonora;Venditti, Giorgia",Journal,Inventions,2020-09-01,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,Benchmarking ;  Car design ;  Citycar ;  Design engineering ;  QFD ;  Stylistic design engineering (SDE) ;  Topflop analysis

"Community water governance for urban water security in the Global South: Status, lessons, and prospects","As public and private water policies fail to address urban water insecurity in the Global South, community-based water governance (CWG) has emerged as an alternative. However, systematic understanding of the current state, performance, and future opportunities of urban CWG remains lacking. We critically review literature (75 case studies from 1990 to 2019) on urban CWG in the Global South, focusing on the current scope and status of knowledge; importance, challenges, innovations, and opportunities; and prospects for scaling up CWG to enhance water security in urban areas. Institutional arrangements, scope and complexity, capacity, and outcomes of CWG varied widely. Most case studies showed improvements in water quantity, supply reliability, pricing, community empowerment, employment, reduced nonrevenue water, and financial viability. Community partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, private-sector agents, public utilities, and donors; technological innovations; and community autonomy were important for financial sustainability, asset security, and service improvements. Many CWG interventions however remained fragmented, limited in geographic scope, and were undermined by poor funding, weak infrastructure and capacity, political interference, overburdening of poor communities, and collective-action challenges surrounding elite capture, marginalization, and unequal benefit sharing. We argue that these challenges notwithstanding, CWG interventions offer more benefits than failures and remain critical alternatives for urban water security in the Global South. New research is needed to understand the impact of CWG under diverse settings, the role of incentives and financing mechanisms, and how persistent collective-action challenges including gendered participation and marginalization undermine CWG.

How technology can impact customer-facing train crew experiences,"Customer-facing train crew members have to follow strict procedures to guarantee that trains are safe and run on time. They are also responsible for revenue protection and customer care. Human factors and ergonomics research are instrumental to understand the safety-critical aspects and improve work. We bring user experience research and personas to describe how train crew perceive their routines and how new technology may impact them. We conducted 7 hours of interviews and 30 hours of shadowing observations with the train crew (N = 22) to provide an understanding of who are they and to define their experiences. We present the crew’s current routines and created two personas to represent them. One is slightly reluctant to adopt the proposed technology, whereas the other is more accepting. Results indicate how such technology may affect crew work ergonomics and experiences, and suggest which valuable aspects should be maintained, for example the positive interactions with passengers.

Influence of artificial intelligence on technological innovation: Evidence from the panel data of china's manufacturing sectors,"This paper analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on technological innovation through logic reasoning and empirical modeling. Based on the industrial robot data provided by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) and the panel data of China's 14 manufacturing sectors from 2008 to 2017, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of AI on technological innovation. Our analysis shows that the mechanism of how AI affects technological innovation is that the former promotes technological innovation through accelerating knowledge creation and technology spillover, improving learning and absorptive capacities, while increasing R&D and talent investment. Our empirical results indicate that under the condition of controlling intensity of R&D investment, FDI, ownership structure, technical imitation, AI significantly promotes technological innovation. And the impact of AI on technological innovation experiences sector heterogeneity: AI has more significant impact on the technological innovation of low-tech sectors. The higher the level of AI, the greater its impact on technological innovation. Based on our established conclusions, we provide corresponding suggestions and recommendations for managerial decision-making.","Liu, Jun;Chang, Huihong;Forrest, Jeffrey Yi Lin;Yang, Baohua",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2020-09-01,Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology;Slippery Rock University;Jiangsu Normal University,artificial intelligence ;  sector heterogeneity ;  technological innovation

The Effects of Federal Research and Development Subsidies on Firm Commercialization Behavior,This paper assesses the longer term (up to 14 years) causal impact of federal research and development (R&D) subsidies on firms’ commercialization behavior. The data are for small firms which applied to the 1998-2000 Advanced Technology Program (ATP) competitions. A variant of the research design pioneered by Heckman (1979) allows for selection bias to be controlled for. Commercialization behavior is operationalized as the number of new product announcements related to the technology a firm mentions in its ATP proposal(s). The major finding is that receiving an ATP award has a positive and significant causal impact on a firm's commercialization behavior.,"Smith, Daniel",Journal,Research Policy,2020-09-01,The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill;NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE,"Commercialization ;  Innovation ;  R&D ;  Subsidy JEL Codes: O3, H2"
Teaching across disciplines: a case study of a project-based short course to teach holistic coastal adaptation design,"Climate change has led to the need for innovation in resilient infrastructure and the social policies which will support those. This requires greater interdisciplinary interactions and knowledge building among emerging professionals. This paper presents a case study of a pilot short course intended to immerse graduate students in the design of resilient infrastructure using place-based and interdisciplinary active team learning. This course helps graduate students bridge the gap between research and practice on the social science and engineering of resilient infrastructure for coastal adaptation. The intellectual framework for the course (the Adaptive Gradients Framework) provides a holistic evaluation of adaptation design proposals and was used to recognize the complexity of social, ecological and engineering aspects and varied social benefits. The course provides a model to move outside rigid boundaries of institutions and disciplines to begin to build, in both students and instructors, the ability to work more effectively on complex social-ecological-engineering problems. Finally, this paper presents a summary of lessons learned from this pilot short course.","Judge, Pamela K.;Buxton, Jane A.;Sheahan, Thomas C.;Phetteplace, Eleanor R.;Kriebel, David L.;Hamin Infield, Elisabeth M.",Journal,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,2020-09-01,US Naval Academy;Northeastern University;Roger Williams University;University of Massachusetts Amherst;The University of Rhode Island;GNCB Consulting Engineers,Coastal protection ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Place-based learning ;  Project-based learning ;  Sustainability ;  Team-based learning
Current landscape in motoneuron regeneration and reconstruction for motor cranial nerve injuries,"The intricate anatomy and physiology of cranial nerves have inspired clinicians and scientists to study their roles in the nervous system. Damage to motor cranial nerves may result from a variety of organic or iatrogenic insults and causes devastating functional impairment and disfigurement. Surgical innovations directed towards restoring function to injured motor cranial nerves and their associated organs have evolved to include nerve repair, grafting, substitution, and muscle transposition. In parallel with this progress, research on tissue-engineered constructs, development of bioelectrical interfaces, and modulation of the regenerative milieu through cellular, immunomodulatory, or neurotrophic mechanisms has proliferated to enhance the available repertoire of clinically applicable reconstructive options. Despite these advances, patients continue to suffer from functional limitations relating to inadequate cranial nerve regeneration, aberrant reinnervation, or incomplete recovery of neuromuscular function. These shortfalls have profound quality of life ramifications and provide an impetus to further elucidate mechanisms underlying cranial nerve denervation and to improve repair. In this review, we summarize the literature on reconstruction and regeneration of motor cranial nerves following various injury patterns. We focus on seven cranial nerves with predominantly efferent functions and highlight shared patterns of injuries and clinical manifestations. We also present an overview of the existing reconstructive approaches, from facial reanimation, laryngeal reinnervation, to variations of interposition nerve grafts for reconstruction. We discuss ongoing endeavors to promote nerve regeneration and to suppress aberrant reinnervation and the development of synkinesis. Insights from these studies will shed light on recent progress and new horizons in understanding the biomechanics of peripheral nerve neurobiology, with emphasis on promising strategies for optimizing neural regeneration and identifying future directions in the field of motor cranial neuron research.","Xie, Yanjun;Schneider, Kevin J.;Ali, Syed A.;Hogikyan, Norman D.;Feldman, Eva L.;Brenner, Michael J.",Journal,Neural Regeneration Research,2020-09-01,University of Michigan Medical School,axon degeneration ;  cranial neuropathy ;  facial nerve ;  facial paralysis ;  motoneuron ;  nerve regeneration ;  peripheral nerve ;  recurrent laryngeal nerve ;  synkinesis ;  vocal fold paralysis
Responsible Innovation and Climate Engineering. A Step Back to Technology Assessment,"Much in Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is part of a participatory turn within the Technology Assessment (TA) and Science and Technology Studies (STS) community. This has an influence also on the evaluation of Climate Engineering (CE) options, as it will be shown by reference to the SPICE project. The SPICE example and the call for democratisation of science and innovation raise some interesting concerns for the normative evaluation of CE options that will be addressed in the paper. It is by far not clear, or so it will be argued, how much of the innovation process of CE technologies should be put in the hands of social actors and the wider public. This is due not only to special features about CE technologies but also to some more principle concerns against some features of participatory RRI approaches. Still, this does by no way mean that ethical and societal issues in the context of CE technologies should be ignored. Rather, the paper will argue that one can take a step back to expert TA linked to the evolution of approaches of ethical impact analysis in this area. This does not only lead to reconsider the emphasis on participation and democratisation of research and innovation, but also opens up for an alternative evaluative framework for CE technologies developed in the last part of the paper.","Stelzer, Harald",Journal,Philosophy of Management,2020-09-01,Universität Graz,Climate engineering ;  Ethical impact analysis ;  Geoengineering ;  Participation ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Technology assessement
Defining STEM within a school district: a co-constructed and evolving process,"Taking a sociocultural approach, the goal of this qualitative study was to examine the process of implementing a science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) initiative. The study examined how the construct of STEM was individually appropriated and collectively constructed within a rural school district during its launch year. Within this theoretical framework, the authors argue that such a change must be viewed as a contextual, active, co-constructed, and evolving process. Data from practitioner journals, participant interviews, and researcher field notes were characterized by how practitioners referred to and discussed the idea of “STEM.” The perspectives of teachers, administrators, and a STEM coach were examined to determine how practitioners appropriated the notion of “STEM,” how this varied by practitioner group, and how individual appropriations of “STEM” merged and evolved as a co-constructed understanding of “STEM.” Practitioners appropriated this STEM initiative in distinct ways, specific to their context, while at the same time working toward a district-wide understanding of “STEM.” During the course of this year, the district’s ownership of this initiative was reflected in the emergence of a new label for “STEM,” which they renamed “TEAMS.” This new label reified the context-specific conceptualization of a STEM initiative. The results highlight the importance of acknowledging the active role that practitioners play as co-designers of innovations and the value that should be placed on this active role to support long-term sustainability. The study provides a deeper understanding of the process of implementing STEM that might have implications for implementing similar STEM initiatives elsewhere.","Siegel, Debbie;Giamellaro, Michael",Journal,Cultural Studies of Science Education,2020-09-01,Institute for Learning Innovation,Educational change ;  Professional development ;  Research–practice partnership ;  Sociocultural ;  STEM education
Silicon Ethoxide as reversible surfactant in reversible drilling mud and the mud's effect on permeability,"Decades of innovation, research and improvements have left drilling fluid vastly different from a mixture of water and clay but are now referred to as non-Newtonian fluids. For optimum well performance for new wells, drillers are to make a choice between drilling with pseudo oil based mud to achieve stability in difficult trajectories and risk permeability impairment; or drill with water based drilling fluid and risk possible drilling instability. Reversible emulsion based muds which can be converted using an acid-base chemical switch from water-in-oil (W/O) to oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion have been suggested as solution in literature. The effect of this acid-base chemical-switch reaction with drilling equipment and personnel prompted this study. Silicon Ethoxide was identified and applied in this study because it has the properties of a reversible surfactant and can be used to formulate a reversible mud that will not react with the drilling equipment nor the formation. Different measurements of Silicon Ethoxide were used, ranging from 5 ml to 45 ml, but we achieved reversibility from 30 ml. Three different base oils (EDC-99, Palm Kernel Oil and Polytriethanolamine) were also used. With the reversed emulsion mud systems, reduction in permeability within the range of 16–19 mD which is minimal was recorded. Thus, this mud system can be used close to the reservoir during drilling operation without encountering significant permeability impairment.","Okoro, Emeka Emmanuel;Dosunmu, Adewale;Iyuke, Sunny",Journal,Journal of King Saud University - Engineering Sciences,2020-09-01,"Covenant University;University of Port Harcourt;University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg",Formation damage ;  Permeability impairment ;  Reversible emulsion based mud ;  Silicon Ethoxide

"Review, rethink and prospect of China's modern coal chemical industry development in recent 25 years","The development of modern coal chemical industry is an important part of the national energy development strategy. It is a necessary measure to give full play to the comparative resource advantages of coal energy and ensure the national energy security. It is also a practical means to alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand of oil and natural gas. The development of China'™s modern coal chemical industry began at the end of the 20th century and ran through five 'Five-Year Plans' from the Ninth Five Year Plan to the 13 th Five Year Plan, and had made remarkable achievements.Modern coal chemical industry is different from traditional coal chemical industry, including direct coal liquefaction, coal gasification, Fischer Tropsch synthesis, large-scale coal to methanol, methanol to olefin, methanol to aromatics, coal to glycol, coal to natural gas and others. This paper reviewd the development process of China'™s modern coal chemical industry in recent 25 years, analyzed the characteristics of scientific and technological innovation and industrial development carried out under the guidance of national policies and macro-control during each 'Five-Year Plan', and introduced the historical context from laboratory research, engineering development, industrialization demonstration to industrialization development and further upgrading and improvement. This paper summarized the development status and the fruitful achievements in the rapid development of modern coal chemical industry in the past 25 years, including the major breakthroughs in the core technology, special catalyst and key equipments of coal chemical industry.The core technologies and key equipments in the industrial routes of direct coal liquefaction, coal gasification, synthesis gas Fischer Tropsch synthesis, methanol to olefin, coal to glycol and others have been achieved significant breakthroughs, the technical level in general has ranked the top in the world. The direct coal liquefaction, methanol to olefin, coal to glycol and others have reached the world leader.The five typical industrial demonstration projects of modern coal chemical industry with special significance were described.

Designing a model developed to assess the capabilities of technological innovation in Iranian construction of power plant equipment industries,"Purpose: In this research, we investigate the capability level of technological construction for power plant equipment industries in Iran based on the development of a domestic model. In which we identify the strengths and weaknesses of technological capabilities and work to improve them. Design/methodology/approach: In this research, we investigate the capability level of technological construction for power plant equipment industries in Iran based on the development of a domestic model. In this study, more than 80 industry experts have filled the questionnaire that was designed based on the AHP method to measure the technological level of the industry. The result has shown the overall technology level about 63.26%. Based on this investigation, the technical capability in this industry is in the “C” class. However, the strategic, R&D and innovation capabilities of the industry have ranked the highest in the dimensions of technological capabilities. Findings: Because overall level of technological innovation capabilities in the industry is 63.50%, construction of power plant equipment industries in Iran is among the industries that are on the way to being strategic or class C industries. Industries in class C (strategic class) have proper insight into the way of promoting their technological capabilities. They are highly ability in project implementation and a strategic view of capability-building. Owing to a transparent priority attitude, these industries are able to formulate strategies and increase their internal capabilities in management and technical areas. Although industries in class C are able to react to new environment-orientated technological regulations quickly and effectively, they need a new policy for increasing innovation in leadership sections, and they need better access to capital and service goods. Class C industries take advantage of strategic awareness focused on the latest technologies required for mid and long term, and they need the support of other industries and institutions for development of technology among small- and medium-scale and other less-developed industries. These industries transcend technological boundaries in most areas and are able to turn into class D (innovative and creative) industries gradually. To this end, considering the ranking, strategic and R&D capabilities, as well as learning and innovation capabilities, rank the highest among other aspects of technological innovation capabilities for industries. Thus, the improvement projects of industries should be of a higher priority and implemented quickly. Originality/value: This article can be used as a model developed for technology-based companies in the field of power plant and energy supply in developing countries.","Khamseh, Abbas;Marei, Parisa",Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2020-08-26,"Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch;Islamic Azad University, Karaj Branch",Innovation ;  Technological innovation capabilities ;  Technology ;  Technology assessment
"Shining light on CO<inf>2</inf>: From materials discovery to photocatalyst, photoreactor and process engineering","Heterogeneous catalysis, a process in which the reaction of gaseous or liquid chemical reagents is facilitated at the surface of a solid material, is responsible for the majority of industrial-scale chemical and fuel production reactions. The energy required to drive these reactions has historically been derived from the combustion of non-renewable fossil fuels and carries an unavoidably large carbon footprint. More recently, the development of environmentally responsible and sustainable chemical industries is increasingly motivated by greenhouse gas-induced climate change, thus creating demand for eco-friendly heterogeneous catalytic processes. This includes innovative approaches enabled by renewable forms of energy, such as the electrification of chemical and petrochemical processes, utilization of CO2 as a feedstock and the incorporation of light into catalytic reactions. Herein we review the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy using CO2, and describe how the photophysical and photochemical properties of nanostructured metal oxide photocatalysts have been engineered to efficiently incorporate light into heterogeneous gas–solid CO2 hydrogenation reactions. Realizing high photonic and energy efficiencies in these systems has demanded innovation in not only photocatalyst engineering, but also photoreactor and process engineering. Rather than exclusively providing an in-depth discussion of the chemistry and science within each individual study, this Tutorial Review highlights the multidisciplinary character of photocatalysis studies by covering the four essential components of a typical research work in this field (materials engineering, theoretical modelling, reactor engineering and process development) via case studies of the archetypal indium oxide catalyst materials. Through advances in these four components, progress has been made towards the ultimate goal of industrializing the production of CO2-derived chemicals and fuels.","Dong, Yuchan;Duchesne, Paul;Mohan, Abhinav;Ghuman, Kulbir Kaur;Kant, Paul;Hurtado, Lourdes;Ulmer, Ulrich;Loh, Joel Y.Y.;Tountas, Athanasios A.;Wang, Lu;Ali, Feysal M.;Xia, Meikun;Dittmeyer, Roland;Ozin, Geoffrey A.",Journal,Chemical Society Reviews,2020-08-21,"The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen;Karlsruher Institut für Technologie, Campus Nord;University of Toronto;Centre Énergie Matériaux Télécommunications",

The cognitive and the action-oriented elements of competence along the innovation process–evidence from R&D teams in the medical equipment sector,"Organizations are constantly searching for ways to enhance their innovative capacity and to sustain their competitive advantage. Much of the literature focuses on knowledge as the key driver for this pursuit. Unlike other studies, we define experience and knowledge as two basic elements of competence by borrowing from the experiential and cognitive learning theories and contrast their impact on the innovativeness of R&D teams. Building on the competence based perspective, we posit that the differences in competence inputs explain variations in team innovation performance along the innovation process. To test our assumptions, we analyzed the aggregated knowledge and experience levels for different technology competences of 868 employees in 49 R&D teams in a large contract-engineering corporation in the medical equipment sector. The findings reveal that technology experience is particularly fruitful within innovation implementation and is a driver for successful market introduction. The research contributes to the understanding when competence elements are especially important.","Anzengruber, Johanna;Goetz, Martin A.",Journal,International Journal of Human Resource Management,2020-08-21,"University of Fribourg;University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, School of Medical Engineering and Applied Social Sciences",Competence ;  experience ;  innovation ;  innovation process ;  R&D
Structure and Topography Modifications of Treated AISI 316LN Stainless Steel Surfaces after Friction in Dry Sliding Contact by Case Hardening Process,"Austenitic stainless is having corrosion resistance property, but certain mechanical applications require improved resistance to wear, inferior cavitation, susceptibility to sensitization. These steels have numerous favourable circumstances for great cryogenic - properties, anti-corrosion, and bio-compatibility. So these steels have a broad application in low temperature innovation, saltwater applications, nourishment industry, bio-medicine, petro-chemical handling, and so forth when alloyed with nitrogen, austenitic treated steels has a progressively steady austenite structure, better mechanical properties and better wear opposition, which has animated extraordinary enthusiasm for this exploration work. Many surface hardening techniques are available, the best surface modification technique is chosen for improved service performance. Surface engineering is a technique to alter the surface of a material by mechanical or microchemical method without affecting the material properties. The alterations are done on the surfaces subjected to the liquid nitriding process to produce a hardened surface. Chosen for this research workbased on their wide application, the wear behaviour of AISI 316LN stainless steels was investigated. Of the various surface hardening techniques available, nitriding is chosen, so that these nitrogen gets penetrated into the material, in which hard iron chromium nitrides are formed at the surface level. AISI 316LN specimens were subjected to salt bath nitriding process. The specimens were nitrided to 60 minutes, 120 minutes and 180 minutes respectively. The specimens were undergone with wear tests by standardized tribiological wear machine and finally the metallographic studies were made.","Mamatha Gandhi, M.;Bain, Animesh;Rohith, P.;Srilatha, R.;Subbiah, Ram",Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2020-08-19,Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering & Technology,
Research and application of knowledge graph in teaching: Take the database course as an example,"With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence and deep learning, education informatization has entered the 2.0 era with artificial intelligence as the main feature. As an important part of artificial intelligence technology, knowledge graph provides possibilities for smart education and promotes the innovation and development of smart education. At this stage, the core concepts and knowledge systems of some computer science disciplines need further clarification and improvement. Using a large amount of course-related information to construct an educational knowledge graph, processing and analyzing the knowledge points in the course, extracting the knowledge entities and effectively integrating them, can greatly help to clarify the knowledge system of the subject. The improvement of the teaching quality of this subject is of great significance. Therefore, this paper selects the construction of educational knowledge graph as research content, and uses database courses as examples of graph construction for research. The BIO tagging method is used to construct the database subject dataset, at the same time, it builds knowledge card based on educational knowledge graph to achieve database teaching wisdom, systematic teaching content, integration of knowledge fragments and improve the quality of learning.","Qin, Yuehua;Cao, Han;Xue, Leyi",Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2020-08-17,Shaanxi Normal University,
Investigation of shear strength of interface between roadbase and geosynthetics using large-scale single-stage and multi-stage direct shear test,"The application of geosynthetics in the road pavement industry as a reinforcement has increased dramatically in recent years. Geosynthetic inclusions can significantly: (i) increase the bearing capacity of the pavement, (ii) prolong the road service life, (iii) reduce maintenance costs, iv) diminish unfavourable large vertical and lateral pavement deformations; and (v) prevent reflective cracking and reduce crack propagation. Although considerable research has been carried out on the interfaces between soils and geosynthetics through large-scale direct shear testing, there is a lack of research in the interfaces between roadbase materials and geosynthetics in pavement engineering. The main innovation of this paper is to investigate the shear strength behaviour of the interfaces existing in a geosynthetic-reinforced pavement. One interface is existing between roadbase and geosynthetic reinforcement for base reinforcement; another one is existing between roadbase and subgrade with geosynthetic reinforcement for subgrade stabilisation. Therefore, a series of laboratory, large-scale direct shear tests was carried out on roadbase materials with and without the inclusion of geosynthetics, under applied normal stresses of 25, 50, 75 or 100 kPa, representing the magnitude of the overburden pressure in the pavement. In addition, theoretical interpretations are developed to back up the experimental results, and to quantify the contribution of different shear strength components mobilised along the interface between roadbase materials and geogrids. Finally, the applicability of multi-stage, large-scale direct shear box testing is assessed by comparing the results obtained with those from conventional single-stage tests obtained in the present experimental study.","Xu, Youwei;Williams, David J.;Serati, Mehdi",Journal,Road Materials and Pavement Design,2020-08-17,The University of Queensland;UWE Global Pty Ltd,geosynthetics ;  interface behaviour ;  large-scale direct shear test ;  multi-stage ;  roadbase material ;  single-stage

Innovative Molecular Design Strategies in Materials Science following the Aurophilicity Concept,"The past decade has seen a diverse range of breakthrough inventions that are derived from gold complexes, including the application of aurophilic interactions in the preparation of stimuli-responsive materials. Examples of these gold-based materials include aurophilicity-induced metallogelators, mechanochromic, thermochromic, vapochromic, and solvatochromic luminescent compounds, as well as sensory materials for the detection of metal ions. Sophisticated properties of gold complexes with Au···Au contacts have been explored at the edge of several disciplines including chemistry, crystallography, molecular engineering and advanced materials. As science paves its way to innovation, cross-disciplinary research moves from being a luxury to becoming a necessity. Development of the concept of aurophilicity and its use in designing novel materials is a true example of innovation on a multidisciplinary platform. As miniaturization continues to influence the next generation of technological advancement, using the properties of molecules as chemical tools to enable such developments becomes extremely important. In this Review, recent examples of gold complexes which exhibit a response to external stimuli have been collected and some of their potential applications discussed for selected cases.","Mirzadeh, Nedaossadat;Privér, Steven H.;Blake, Alexander J.;Schmidbaur, Hubert;Bhargava, Suresh K.",Journal,Chemical Reviews,2020-08-12,Technische Universität München;University of Nottingham;RMIT University,
Developing a pedagogical photoreal virtual environment to teach civil engineering,"Purpose: It is possible for civil engineering (CE) students to graduate from a degree programme without gaining experience on a construction site. The implementation of virtual field trips using virtual reality (VR) in CE education is a development that can address this phenomenon and help facilitate the consolidation of abstract theories into tangible competences. This project aims to solve a fundamental CE education problem: once a structure has been completed, it is often impossible to see how it was built; hence, how can you demonstrate the construction process to a student? Design/methodology/approach: This research used the opportunity of a new campus library development to record its construction sequence. This was achieved by visiting the site eight times to take panoramic stereoscopic photos of the construction process. By its nature, using VR as a didactic tool facilitates experiential learning, but this project also incorporates discovery learning and situated cognition to develop students’ understanding of the construction process. Findings: The use of VR in education is becoming increasingly common, but the explicit pedagogy used in these environments is rarely obvious or stated. This project draws upon current VR education discussions and explores the development of a VR environment with a pedagogical context. Originality/value: The development of the VR resource draws upon the pedagogical frameworks of discovery learning (Bruner, 1961) and situated cognition (Lave and Wenger, 1991). A further unique aspect of this research is the use of stereoscopic cameras to capture the library’s construction over time.","Walker, James;Towey, Dave;Pike, Matthew;Kapogiannis, Georgios;Elamin, Ahmed;Wei, Ran",Journal,Interactive Technology and Smart Education,2020-08-12,University of Nottingham Ningbo China,Civil engineering education ;  Discovery learning ;  Education innovation ;  Pedagogical frameworks ;  Situated cognition ;  Virtual field trip ;  Virtual reality

Fostering innovation through collaborative action research on the creation of shared instructional products by university science instructors,"The purpose of this study is to profile four university science instructors who utilized action research as a means of learning how to develop and integrate a novel curriculum innovation–engineering design–in their science courses. Data included curriculum maps, lesson plans, notes from group meetings, and instructor reflections. Data analysis included document review and content analysis. Findings from this study suggest that action research effectively enabled the instructors to 1) establish shared ownership of the project goal–to improve preservice teachers’ learning of science through engineering design; 2) continuously test, revise, and recalibrate their shared instructional products; and 3) leverage multiple sources of innovation. Knowledge generated and used by the instructors represented different kinds of knowledge and distributed expertise resulting in products that were more useful and of higher quality than products created by individuals working alone. Consequently, this resulted in increased use of the products and increased instructor commitment to improve them over time. By simultaneously engaging in research and consequently taking specific action to inform their practice, science instructors in this study successfully created shared instructional products that both guided and enhanced their classroom teaching.","Capobianco, Brenda M.;Eichinger, David;Rebello, Sanjay;Ryu, Minjung;Radloff, Jeff",Journal,Educational Action Research,2020-08-07,College of Science;Purdue University,Collaborative action research ;  engineering education ;  professional development ;  science education ;  university teacher

Rice Thresher Machines in Handling System Alley Blow Rice in Post-Harvest,"The problem faced by Indonesia in 2017-2018 is the lack of food production which resulted in Indonesia having to import rice from neighboring countries. The low food productivity, especially rice, is due to the large number of shifts from paddy fields to oil palm and others. To boost interest and productivity in the field of rice farming, it is necessary to have innovation and special attention from all parties towards rice farming. In this service activity, the service team innovated the rice thresher machine. This innovation is in the form of adding aisles on the threshing machine. The function of this blowing tunnel is to streamline the threshing process that is able to effectively separate filled and empty rice. The method used in this service is survey and demonstration. The survey method is used to see farmers' problems in real terms. While the demonstration method is used to introduce technology and innovation to farmers in the process of threshing rice. Problems faced by farmers in the threshing process are a burden both in terms of cost and labor. To overcome this problem, the dedication team made a thresher machine that would be used by the target population in the Sungai Duo area of Sitiung District, Dharmasraya Regency. This activity was enthusiastically welcomed by farmers, especially farmer groups in the Sungai Duo area. Innovation in the threshing process is new and badly needed.

"Half a century of amyloids: Past, present and future","Amyloid diseases are global epidemics with profound health, social and economic implications and yet remain without a cure. This dire situation calls for research into the origin and pathological manifestations of amyloidosis to stimulate continued development of new therapeutics. In basic science and engineering, the cross-ß architecture has been a constant thread underlying the structural characteristics of pathological and functional amyloids, and realizing that amyloid structures can be both pathological and functional in nature has fuelled innovations in artificial amyloids, whose use today ranges from water purification to 3D printing. At the conclusion of a half century since Eanes and Glenner's seminal study of amyloids in humans, this review commemorates the occasion by documenting the major milestones in amyloid research to date, from the perspectives of structural biology, biophysics, medicine, microbiology, engineering and nanotechnology.

Digital twinning of the built environment-an interdisciplinary topic for innovation in didactics,"The concept of a Digital Twin (DT) takes an increasingly important role in the construction industry and related research fields. It is a concept associated with Industry 4.0; however, the scientific literature does not provide a unique and clear definition of this concept. This paper aims to analyse the definitions of the digital twin to clarify this concept in the related fields of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). Moreover, this work proposes and employs the concept of a Digital Twin as an objective for a project-based learning approach in a didactical setting. As an interdisciplinary approach, this work demonstrates the potential impact on the traditional didactical frameworks in the educational domain of construction and its value as an opportunity to introduce interdisciplinary expertise to all students in these fields.

A paler shade of green: implications of green product deletion on supply chains,"Product management activities by operations, marketing, and finance functions have typically focused on the innovation, acquisition, growth, and management of product lines and products. The same is true when considering product management for green products. The latter stages of critical strategic decisions related to product deletion or discontinuation have received less emphasis. In this conceptual paper, the focus is on green product deletion implications for supply chain management and operations. Organisations may view green product deletion as evolving from a deep green to a paler shade of green in their product offerings. A proposed strategic framework pays particular attention to the implications of the green product deletion decision for supply chain processes and operational competencies. In this situation, lessened organisational greenness needs to be weighed against other organisational and operational competencies. The strategic and inter-organisational relationships associated with this decision help set the stage for future research on this critical, yet neglected, organisational and operational supply chain issue.","Zhu, Qingyun;Shah, Purvi;Sarkis, Joseph",Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2020-08-02,The Business School;The University of Alabama in Huntsville,green marketing ;  Product deletion ;  supply chain competencies ;  supply chain management ;  supply chain processes ;  sustainability
Alternative Reality Game (ARG) as an evaluative strategy in chemistry education,"Chemistry teaching has been undergoing attempts at re-engineering. In this sense, several strategies are emerging or being adapted to make it more effective for student learning, by strengthening critical thinking, communication and collaboration skills, in addition to technological literacy. This article points to changes and innovations, as we discuss the use of an Alternative Reality Game (ARG) as an evaluative strategy in the teaching of chemistry. This type of game consists of an interactive narrative set in the real world. The research presented is of a qualitative nature and was carried out with 35 students (n = 35) from an initial training course in science teaching. The data were systematically analyzed and categorized. The results show that the ARG positively influenced collaboration between peers and increased the students' ability to solve challenges by covering different levels of representation of chemical knowledge. The study shows evidence that ARG can be used as a learning assessment strategy of a formative, diagnostic and self-assessment nature. Finally, we present an evaluative model using the ARG that can be applied at different levels of learning in chemistry.","Das Graças Cleophas, Maria;Cavalcanti, Eduardo Luiz Dias;De Souza, Francislê Neri;Leão, Marcelo Brito Carneiro",Journal,Investigacoes em Ensino de Ciencias,2020-08-01,Universidade Federal da Integração Latino-Americana;Universidade de Brasília;Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco;Centro Universitário Adventista de São Paulo - UNASP,Alternative Reality Game (ARG) ;  Chemistry education ;  Evaluative model ;  Learning assessment
STEM Leadership and Training for Trailblazing Students in an Immersive Research Environment,"Educating the workforce of tomorrow is an increasingly critical challenge for areas such as data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These core skills may revolutionize progress in areas such as health care and precision medicine, autonomous systems and robotics, and neuroscience. Skills in data science and artificial intelligence are in high demand in industrial research and development, but we do not believe that traditional recruiting and training models in industry (e.g., internships, continuing education) are serving the needs of the diverse populations of students who will be required to revolutionize these fields. Our program, the Cohort-based Integrated Research Community for Undergraduate Innovation and Trailblazing (CIRCUIT), targets trailblazing, high-Achieving students who face barriers in achieving their goals and becoming leaders in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence research. Traditional recruitment practices often miss these ambitious and talented students from nontraditional backgrounds, and these students are at a higher risk of not persisting in research careers. In the CIRCUIT program we recruit holistically, selecting students on the basis of their commitment, potential, and need. We designed a training and support model for our internship. This model consists of a compressed data science and machine learning curriculum, a series of professional development training workshops, and a team-based robotics challenge. These activities develop the skills these trailblazing students will need to contribute to the dynamic, team-based engineering teams of the future.","Villafane-Delgado, Marisel;Johnson, Erik C.;Hughes, Marisa;Cervantes, Martha;Gray-Roncal, William",Conference Proceeding,"2020 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2020",2020-08-01,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,artificial intelligence ;  cohort-based research ;  internship ;  robotics ;  trailblazing
On the Pragmatics of Requirements Engineering Practices in a Startup Ecosystem,"Software startups play an important role to foster innovation, economic growth, and job creation in a region. Startups are likely to increase their odds of thriving if they are embedded in a startup ecosystem. Actors of an ecosystem cocreate value, share resources, and support the prosperous evolution of peers. In recent years, software startups have been the focus of intensive research by the software engineering community. In this paper, we conducted a tertiary study to synthesise literature in the field of requirements engineering in startups. We concluded that there are limited empirical studies reporting an in-depth contextual analysis on how software startups perform requirements engineering. In parallel, we conducted a case study of startups based at Digital Port ecosystem. Our empirical results confirm what has been presented by literature that startups adopt requirements practices in a flexible and informal manner. In fact, as novel empirical evidence, we observed that even as startups evolve by acquiring the first paying customers and growing the customer base, requirements practices remain very pragmatic. Our results also reveal how actors of the studied ecosystem interact to support the co-evolution of startups.","Alves, Carina;Cunha, Joao;Araujo, Joao",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering,2020-08-01,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa,Case Study ;  Requirements Practices ;  Startup Ecosystem

"Responsible science, engineering and education for water resource recovery and circularity","Water resource recovery is central to the circular economy framework. It underlies the transition of environmental engineering from pollution prevention to responsible innovation for sustainable systems engineering. In order to speed this transition, resource recovery and circularity need integration into new higher education curricula to train the next generation of young professionals. However, training of new concepts requires the development of new course materials and books, while integrating substantial illustrations and problems on circularity and resource recovery in new editions of existing textbooks in environmental science and engineering. Moreover, university-utility-industry partnerships are important mechanisms to bridge theoretical fundamentals to concepts for engineering practice, and to promote knowledge exchange and technology adoption between practitioners and academics. Interactive platforms should be designed to facilitate the integration and development of resource recovery and circularity concepts from science and practice into education. Consensus was built on this perspective article from interaction with the members of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors in a workshop that we organized at the AEESP Research and Education Conference 2017. Overall, this paper gives actionable roadmaps to (i) apprehend how new science and technological findings need to get integrated to sustain resource recovery and circularity in practice, along with the fact that (ii) skills sets can be engineered with relatively minor changes to existing lecture material that will have maximal impact on the scope of the thought material. It lays out (iii) how partnership with engineering practitioners can make a lecture more vivid by giving students reasoning for why the learned material is important, and (iv) how a platform for an integrated science, education, and practice can deliver them with concrete tools for practical implementation for benefits at community level.

Application of Simulated Annealing Neural Network in Performance Evaluation of Science and Technology Innovation Community,"With the ""The Belt and Road"" strategy deeply rooted in people's hearts, it is an inevitable choice for China and countries (or regions) along the ""The Belt and Road"" strategy to build a science and technology innovation community. In this study, the high-tech industries of major provinces and cities in China are taken as the research object, and the collaborative innovation process and mechanism of each innovation subject are taken as the research purpose. By introducing the collaborative innovation concept of the innovation community, we construct the innovation performance evaluation index system to optimize the model of the innovation community performance evaluation via using neural networks. The neural network is one of the most widely used algorithms among deep learning algorithms, and this paper mainly analyzes the characteristics of Back Propagation (BP) neural network in the performance evaluation, which has strong local optimization but slow convergence speed. We build a BP neural network based on the genetic algorithm, and this neural network makes the performance evaluation model has the characteristics of strong global optimization and fast convergence speed. However, at the same time, it also has the risk of early convergence and lacks the ability of the global search. On this basis, we propose an improved genetic BP neural network based on simulated annealing in this paper. The improved simulated annealing algorithm not only can reduce error but also has a stronger local convergence and a faster evolution speed, which can obtain a satisfying global optimal solution. When we apply the improved simulated annealing genetic BP neural network in the performance evaluation of the science and technology innovation community, the simulation results show that this algorithm can be a reliable performance evaluation method and easier to obtain the optimal solution than other algorithms. Besides, the feasibility of the evaluation system and method is verified.","Lou, Shunjie;Xin, Junjie;Zhu, Jiahui;Wang, Xuejie",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 32nd Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2020",2020-08-01,Hangzhou City University,Neural Network ;  Performance Evaluation ;  Science and Technology Innovation Community ;  Simulated Annealing

Electrospinning Nanofiber-Reinforced Aerogels for the Treatment of Bone Defects,"Objective: Application of aerogels in bone tissue engineering is an emerging field, while the reports of electrospinning nanofiber-reinforced aerogels are limited. This research aimed at fabricating the nanofiber-reinforced aerogels and evaluating their physiochemical and biological properties. Approach: The chitosan (CS) aerogels incorporated with cellulose acetate (CA) and poly (É-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers were fabricated via ball milling and freeze-drying techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), compressive experiment, and in vitro experiment were conducted to assess their physiochemical properties and biological behavior. Results: The SEM examination showed that satisfying morphology was attained in the CA/PCL/CS aerogels with incorporation of CA/PCL nanofibers and CS solution. The results of FT-IR and XPS indicated the perfect incorporation of CA, PCL, and CS. A compressive experiment confirmed that the CA/PCL/CS aerogels enhanced the compressive modulus of the pure CS aerogel. For in vitro experiment, the CA/PCL/CS composite scaffolds were proven to possess better cytocompatibility compared with the pure CS. Also, cells on the CA/PCL/CS showed well-extended morphology and could infiltrate into a porous scaffold. Furthermore, confocal experiment revealed that the CA/PCL/CS could also promote the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Innovation: This study fabricated the nanofiber-reinforced aerogels mainly to optimize the cell/material interaction of the pure CS scaffold. Conclusion: The CA/PCL nanofibers not only improved the mechanical property of the CS aerogel to some extent but also facilitated cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. Thus, it could be considered a promising candidate for bone tissue engineering.","Zhang, Yishan;Yin, Chengcheng;Cheng, Yuet;Huang, Xiangyu;Liu, Kai;Cheng, Gu;Li, Zubing",Journal,Advances in Wound Care,2020-08-01,School of Stomatology Wuhan University;Lishui University,aerogel ;  bone tissue engineering ;  electrospinning ;  nanofibers
CRISPR/Cas9 Editing: Sparking Discussion on Safety in Light of the Need for New Therapeutics,"Recent advances in genome sequencing have greatly improved our ability to understand and identify the causes of genetic diseases. However, there remains an urgent need for innovative, safe, and effective treatments for these diseases. CRISPR-based genome editing systems have become important and powerful tools in the laboratory, and efforts are underway to translate these into patient therapies. Therapeutic base editing is one form of genome engineering that has gained much interest because of its simplicity, specificity, and effectiveness. Base editors are a fusion of a partially deactivated Cas9 enzyme with nickase function, together with a base-modifying enzyme. They are capable of precisely targeting and repairing a pathogenic mutation to restore the normal function of a gene, ideally without disturbing the rest of the genome. In the past year, research has identified new safety concerns of base editors and sparked new innovations to improve their safety. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent advances in the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic base editors and prime editing.","Carlaw, Tiffany M.;Zhang, Lin Hua;Ross, Colin J.D.",Journal,Human Gene Therapy,2020-08-01,The University of British Columbia;Faculty of Medicine,CRISPR/Cas9 base editing ;  gene therapy ;  prime editing ;  safety
Technopreneurial intentions among Bulgarian STEM students: The role of university,"Entrepreneurship, innovation and technology are essential to the economic development of societies. Universities are increasingly involved in creating an internal favourable environment supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. In our work, we aimed to study the role of university for the development of technopreneurial intentions in a sample of Bulgarian STEM (STEM refers to any subjects that fall under the disciplines of science, technology, engineering or mathematics.) students exhibiting entrepreneurial intentions. The empirical findings of the study are in line with previous empirical evidence about the role of university support for entrepreneurial intentions among students; results also show that students in universities with better research in their scientific field of study are more likely to exhibit technopreneurial intention. Determinants of entrepreneurial intentions identified in the literature such as entrepreneurial role models, perceived support from social networks, willingness to take risks and gender may not be relevant specifically for technopreneurial intentions. The results of the study have important practical implications.","Yordanova, Desislava;Filipe, José António;Coelho, Manuel Pacheco",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-08-01,ISEG Lisbon School of Economics and Management;Iscte – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa;Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski,Ecosystem ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Technopreneurial intentions
The sustainable development goals (SDGs) as a basis for innovation skills for engineers in the industry 4.0 context,"Teaching methods for calculation and project development, focusing on theoretical principles and the reproduction of validated procedures, has been the traditional focus of engineering education. Innovation has been present in universities, mainly in the creation of processes and technologies for the development of products, services, or companies, based on entrepreneurship. Training in innovation has been limited to interested students, and not encouraged for all students, despite how relevant it is for current and future global development. According to the literature research and the opinion of the experts, this research identifies the characteristics of innovation that engineering students should acquire, in response to the challenges of engineering in the 21st century, considering as a basis the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in the context of the increasingly demanding requirements of industry 4.0. The identification of the relevant aspects in innovation were categorized according to the expertise and academic performance of the authors. In addition to this, the investigation of the representative elements of Industry 4.0, and the incorporation of Sustainable Development Goals, establish the basis of this study to guide the development of innovation skills in the process of engineering student education. Furthermore, in order to integrate innovation skills, elements of Industry 4.0 and aspects of Sustainable Development Goals, the concept of competence is introduced, with a conceptual structure that considers knowledge, attitude and performance context, thus this research provides a conceptual framework for those interested in constructing innovation skills in engineering, oriented towards the development of an innovation culture and mentality, as part of the expected professional performance.","Rivera, Felipe Muñoz La;Hermosilla, Pamela;Delgadillo, Jean;Echeverría, Dayan",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-08-01,Centre Internacional de Mètodes Numèrics en Enginyeria(CIMNE);Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso;Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Engineering education ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Innovation skills ;  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)
"New forms of social learning in mediterranean higher engineering education: Change lab for gender equality transformation, methodology, design principles","Educating students to understand the dynamics of complex systems and acting with responsibility and equality in their professional/private life is pivotal. Implementing social changes in higher engineering education institutions is a challenge. This work is grounded empirically in the tailored practices of the gender equality Change Lab embedded in the network of Mediterranean engineering schools, which is a collective organizational integrity. We used action research and practical learning in our methodology. Design principles are provided, and methodological setup is included. We advocate that in order to mainstream gender equality, develop structures, and overcome some of the known limitations, we need to have conceptual clarity, well-targeted interventions, reflexivity, and empirical evidence. Moving from separate bureaucratic centrally-managed higher education institutions to interconnected networks that can organize self-assembling collaboration in the formof labs, with mutually beneficial partnerships contemplating social innovations, can challenge the melting of the traditional boundaries towards inclusive education. This can be done amidst university reforms conducive to such a transformation.

Developing an Entrepreneurial Mindset among Engineering Students: Encouraging Entrepreneurship into Engineering Education,"It is unquestionable the role of entrepreneurship as a driver of innovation and economic development. The world is dynamically changing and intensively interconnected carrying new challenges and opportunities to the new generation of engineers working in a world where innovation will continue to evolve very quickly. This paper addresses the need to train engineering students to be entrepreneurial engineers considering the global challenges and the role that higher education institutions should play in developing an entrepreneurial mindset among engineering students. The paper presents and discusses the results of a survey carried out in a Portuguese engineering school with the goal of investigate students' entrepreneurial mindsets. The main objective is to understand the extent by which entrepreneurship is addressed in students' engineering programs as well as students' perceptions of their entrepreneurial related skills and the reasons that would lead the students to start or not start a business as well as their perception of the ability to immediately start a business. The results of the study are critically analysed in light of the challenges and opportunities facing future engineers. The work, although limited to a specific context is a valuable starting point for additional research and for the implementation of faculty strategies to improve entrepreneurship education.","Maria Joao, Isabel;Miguel Silva, João",Journal,Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,2020-08-01,Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa;Instituto Superior Técnico,engineering education ;  Entrepreneurship ;  students entrepreneurial mindset
Evolving Absorptive Capacity: The Mediating Role of Systematic Knowledge Management,"Absorptive capacity is mediated through knowledge management capacity on innovation output and performance in technology-oriented firms. While prior research work has focused on the direct effect of absorptive capacity on innovation, in this paper, our model posits that absorptive capacity is more efficient in promoting firms' innovation provided that it is supported by systematic knowledge management practices. We tested this model that included all four components of absorptive capacity using a sample of 127 manufacturing and technology firms in Croatia. Structural equation modeling procedures were used to test hypotheses. Our findings confirm the significance of the relationship between absorptive capacity and knowledge management within firms. Furthermore, we found that firms with higher acquisition and transformation dimensions of absorptive capacity can enhance and replenish their knowledge management practices, which in return result in higher innovation output. These findings extend previous research work by explaining the sometimes-contradictory findings concerning knowledge management practices, which firms may adopt to enhance their absorptive capacity.","Dabic, Marina;Vlacic, Ernest;Ramanathan, Usha;Egri, Carolyn P.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2020-08-01,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Economics and Business;Nottingham Business School;Beedie School of Business;NOVAMINA CIT",Absorptive capacity ;  innovation ;  knowledge management ;  SMEs ;  technology-based firms
Innovation and practice of key technologies for the efficient development of the supergiant Anyue Gas Field,"In recent years, the Sichuan Basin has been the most potential hydrocarbon-bearing basin in China thanks to the great exploration and development breakthroughs of deep large integral carbonate gas reservoirs and shale gas in this basin. The Anyue Gas Field located in central Sichuan Basin is not only the largest carbonate gas reservoir, but the most important supergiant gas field discovered in China in recent years. However, it faces a series of major difficulties, e.g., low reservoir porosity, low permeability, low gas well productivity, thin and vertically and laterally disperse gas layer, strong heterogeneity, quite low structural amplitude and complicated gas–water relationship, which bring great challenges to the rapid conversion of natural gas reserves to production. In this regard, technical researches have been carried out continuously. As a result, many key technologies have been innovatively integrated and great breakthroughs have been realized in many aspects. First, fine development technologies for supergiant, ancient and complex carbonate gas reservoirs are developed innovatively, “transparent gas reservoir” is constructed and the technologies for cultivating high-yield wells are established. By virtue of these technologies, all development wells in the gas reservoir of Lower Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation reach the target of high yield and the single-well gas production rate of the gas reservoir of Lower Sinian Dengying Formation is increased significantly, which provides support for the long-term high production and stable production of Anyue Gas Field. Second, good and fast construction technologies for large-scale gas fields are innovatively integrated. Based on this, the safety of gas wells is under control in the whole life cycle, quality engineering is built up efficiently within 3 years, green mining areas are forged and large-scale safe and clean gas fields are built up efficiently. Third, intelligent control technologies for the development of supergiant gas fields are innovatively integrated. By means of these technologies, internet of everything, depth perception and automatic production are realized. The intelligent technologies of new generation are fused, including AR, VR, robot and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A new intelligent management mode for gas field development is set up, and an intelligent gas field is built up. Fourth, optimization technologies for the overall development of supergiant gas fields are innovatively development, so as to improve the development effects of strong-heterogeneity gas reservoirs and ensure the long-term stable production of supergiant water-bearing gas reservoirs. The research results can be used as reference for the efficient development of similar domestic and foreign gas fields.","Xie, Jun",Journal,Natural Gas Industry B,2020-08-01,China National Petroleum Corporation,Anyue Gas Field ;  Central Sichuan Basin ;  Efficient development ;  Intelligent gas field ;  Intelligent management ;  Strong heterogeneity ;  Supergiant carbonate gas reservoir ;  Transparent gas reservoir
Toward Sustainable Environmental Quality: Priority Research Questions for Asia,"Environmental and human health challenges are pronounced in Asia, an exceptionally diverse and complex region where influences of global megatrends are extensive and numerous stresses to environmental quality exist. Identifying priorities necessary to engage grand challenges can be facilitated through horizon scanning exercises, and to this end we identified and examined 23 priority research questions needed to advance toward more sustainable environmental quality in Asia, as part of the Global Horizon Scanning Project. Advances in environmental toxicology, environmental chemistry, biological monitoring, and risk-assessment methodologies are necessary to address the adverse impacts of environmental stressors on ecosystem services and biodiversity, with Asia being home to numerous biodiversity hotspots. Intersections of the food–energy–water nexus are profound in Asia; innovative and aggressive technologies are necessary to provide clean water, ensure food safety, and stimulate energy efficiency, while improving ecological integrity and addressing legacy and emerging threats to public health and the environment, particularly with increased aquaculture production. Asia is the largest chemical-producing continent globally. Accordingly, sustainable and green chemistry and engineering present decided opportunities to stimulate innovation and realize a number of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Engaging the priority research questions identified herein will require transdisciplinary coordination through existing and nontraditional partnerships within and among countries and sectors. Answering these questions will not be easy but is necessary to achieve more sustainable environmental quality in Asia. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:1485–1505. © 2020 The Authors.

Do renewable energy technology innovations promote China's green productivity growth? Fresh evidence from partially linear functional-coefficient models,"Renewable energy technology innovation can benefit the environment by promoting green productivity, as proposed by existing theoretical studies. However, recent uneven developments of both environmental performance and renewable energy technology among regions in China remind us to revisit the above theoretical link. In this paper, we relax the hypothesized homogeneity and linearity in traditional empirical models to investigate the effects of renewable energy technology innovation on China's green productivity. The results of the partially linear functional-coefficient models show that the effect of renewable energy technological innovation on green productivity is significant only when the relative income level of a province passes a critical turning point. Beyond the turning point, such an effect increases with the growth of relative income levels. Finally, we provide provincial specific policy implications based on the estimated nonparametric relationship between renewable energy technology innovation and green productivity.","Yan, Zheming;Zou, Baoling;Du, Kerui;Li, Ke",Journal,Energy Economics,2020-08-01,Southwest University;Xi'an Jiaotong University;Xiamen University;Hunan Normal University,Green productivity ;  Income ;  Partially linear functional-coefficient model ;  Renewable energy technology innovations
"Design Copyright in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Industry: Review of History, Pitfalls, and Lessons Learned","Innovation and technological developments are integral parts of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. While AEC practitioners strive to have unique projects, there is a concern about the unauthorized use or reproduction of their designs. Architectural drawings have been recognized as intellectual property by US copyright law, and if an architect follows the proper procedures for their registration, the designs would have protection against unauthorized use. Copyright infringement can happen either deliberately or unintentionally and typically involves protracted motions by the plaintiff and the defendant. Having a more collaborative process in the design holds the potential for more issues regarding ownership of the intellectual property of the design. Therefore, by moving into the new era of digital-based design, namely, building information modeling (BIM) and cloud-based designs, as more people get involved in the design process, the ownership problem may get more complicated. The goal of this research is to investigate how digital-based design can be protected from unauthorized uses, including what considerations practitioners could take to ensure their intellectual property is protected. Therefore, this paper provides a review of history and the current US copyright law, copyright procedure, and copyright prevention strategies relevant to digital-based design in the AEC industry. Additionally, various case studies are reviewed to scrutinize pitfalls and possible outcomes of conflict. The results of the review found that copyright is a widely neglected issue in the AEC industry. Considerations include the following: contracts need to be updated to identify the ownership of a design, clauses need to be added to specify any potential gray areas, and architects and owners are encouraged to increase their knowledge about possible loopholes and conflicts. Also, new technologies such as blockchain and digital fingerprinting can be added to digital designs to prevent unauthorized use. Because of the complexity of legal contracts and the gray areas of digital-based design, AEC practitioners should perform due diligence and seek out knowledgeable legal counsel to review and approve the contract to avoid conflicts in the future.","Adibfar, Alireza;Costin, Aaron;Issa, Raja R.A.",Journal,Journal of Legal Affairs and Dispute Resolution in Engineering and Construction,2020-08-01,University of Florida,"Architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry ;  Building information modeling (BIM) ;  Copyright ;  Digital-based design ;  Infringement ;  Intellectual property"
Evolutionary design framework for Smart PSS: Service engineering approach,"Digital technology is transforming industry, economy, and society. Under this digitalization trend, a new concept of product and service offerings, Smart PSS has been introduced. While the Smart PSS concept aiming at data-driven innovation attracts more attentions, there are two major challenges in designing Smart PSS. First, available data from digital technologies are actually limited by technical, financial, and social reasons. Second, the context of applying Smart PSS dynamically changes, which makes designed Smart PSS unfit to the target situation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an evolutionary design framework for Smart PSS. Our approach is based on the service engineering research, which has been contributing to the design and development of PSS. The proposed framework consists of three conceptual spaces and three cycles. The main features of the framework were two design cycles; in-system and ex-system design cycle. In-system design cycle is a process of creating and applying human knowledge for making the most use of data collected by digital technologies. Ex-system design cycle is to adapt to dynamic changes in contexts of the applied Smart PSS. We examine how the proposed framework works for designing a Smart PSS, with a case study about the digitalization of a restaurant business.","Watanabe, Kentaro;Okuma, Takashi;Takenaka, Takeshi",Journal,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2020-08-01,National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,Digitalization ;  Evolutionary design framework ;  Service engineering ;  Smart PSS
Innovations in applied decision theory for health and safety,"Objectives There are established methods for occupational epidemiological cohort analysis, such as proportional hazards regression, that are well suited to aetiological research and yield parameter estimates that allow for succinct communication among academics. However, these methods are not necessarily well suited for evaluation of health impacts of policy choices and communication to decision makers. An informed decision about a policy that impacts health and safety requires a valid estimate of the policy's potential impact. Methods We propose methods for data summarisation that may facilitate communication with managers, workers and their advocates. We calculate measures of effect in a framework for competing events, graphically display potential impacts on cause-specific mortality under policy alternatives and contrast these results to estimates obtained using standard Poisson regression methods. Methods are illustrated using a cohort mortality study of 28 546 Ontario uranium miners hired between 1950 and 1996 and followed through 2007. Results A standard regression analysis yields a positive association between cumulative radon progeny exposure and all-cause mortality (log(RR per 100 WLM)=0.09; SE=0.02). The proposed method yields an estimate of the expected gain in life expectancy (approximately 6 months per worker) and reduction of 261 lung cancer deaths under a policy that eliminated occupational radon progeny exposure. Conclusions The proposed method shifts attention from covariate-adjusted risk ratios or rate ratios to estimates of deaths that are avoided or delayed under a potential policy. The approach may help inform decision-making and strengthen the connection of epidemiological approaches to data analysis with developments in decision theory and systems engineering to improve health and safety.","Richardson, David B.;Debono, Nathan L.;Berriault, Colin;Demers, Paul A.",Journal,Occupational and Environmental Medicine,2020-08-01,University of Toronto;UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health;Occupational Cancer Research Centre,cancer ;  epidemiology ;  mortality studies ;  radon
The 7 pillars of TRIZ philosophies,"TRIZ, the theory of inventive problem solving, has known as one of the most effective tools for conceiving engineering designs and solving difficult problems. The importance of TRIZ has been acknowledged in various fields where its applications inspire great results. Most researchers focus on the practical usage of the tools or development of the tools without knowing the fundamental philosophies that support TRIZ. Classical TRIZ has only 4 philosophies as pillars of TRIZ. The aim of this paper is to present an augmented version of TRIZ philosophies, and bridge the gap between the guiding fundamental philosophies and effective practical usage. Further, some important directional research opportunities of TRIZ methodology are suggested for future development.","Sheu, D.

Understanding spatial-temporal evolution of renewable energy technology innovation in China: Evidence from convergence analysis,"This paper constructs a knowledge-stock indicator to explore the trend of renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) levels across China's provinces during 1997–2015. First, the spatial-temporal evolution is analyzed. Second, the convergence characteristics and patterns are identified through the nonlinear time-varying factor model and the relative transition path curves. Third, the drivers of convergence behaviors are examined. The results are as follows: (i) China's RETI experienced a spurt of development. Its spatial pattern has changed significantly, and the average annual growth rate has also shown spatial differences; (ii) China's provincial RETI level was not converged as a whole during the sample period, but exhibited club convergence characteristics. The 30 provinces eventually converged to three clubs with large differences in average RETI level and annual growth rate; (iii) the provinces with a more optimized industrial structure, a greater R&D investment intensity, and a higher environmental regulation intensity tended to converge to the club with a higher innovation level and growth rate.","Bai, Caiquan;Feng, Chen;Du, Kerui;Wang, Yuansheng;Gong, Yuan",Journal,Energy Policy,2020-08-01,Shanghai University of Finance and Economics;Shandong University;Xiamen University;Nankai University;Renmin University of China,Club convergence ;  Nonlinear time-varying factor model ;  Relative transition path ;  Renewable energy technology innovation ;  Spatial-temporal evolution
Empirical analysis of organizational archetypes based on generation and adoption of knowledge and technologies,"The generation and adoption of technologies have been considered key factors in resolving inconsistencies in research on the innovative phenomenon, though few studies have taken this stance. In this paper, we empirically test the validity of this theoretical framework, using the data of 87,911 surveys of firms in 13 European countries from CIS-2012. This information has allowed us to find strong evidence for the existence of four organizational archetypes based on the generation and adoption of technologies, with relevant differences in organizational characteristics and tendency toward radical innovation in products.","Martínez-Román, Juan A.;Gamero, Javier;Tamayo, Juan A.;Delgado-González, Loreto",Journal,Technovation,2020-08-01,Universidad de Sevilla,Adoption ;  Archetype ;  Generation ;  Innovation ;  Innovative capability ;  SME
Deciphering the scientific literature on SDG interactions: A review and reading guide,"The 2030 Agenda includes 17 overarching Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These are integrated in nature, and a principle of indivisibility should guide their implementation. Yet, the 2030 Agenda itself does not provide guidance on what indivisibility means in practice, how the SDGs interact, or on how to assess these interactions. The fast-emerging field of what could be referred to as SDG interaction studies seeks to provide such guidance, but as of yet there is no general agreement on what it means to take an integrated approach to the SDGs. Hence, navigating the diverse research landscape on SDG interactions might prove challenging. This paper aims to decipher the literature on SDG interactions by providing an overview of the current research, based on a sample of 70 peer-reviewed articles. The review explores four themes in SDG interaction research by mapping: (i) policy challenges typically addressed, (ii) ways in which SDG ‘interactions’ have been conceptualized, (iii) data sources used, and (iv) methods of analysis frequently employed. Research gaps are identified, where perspectives largely missing include policy innovation, and integrated monitoring and evaluation. Further, few studies consider actor interactions, account for geographic spill-overs, analyze SDG indicator interactions, employ participatory methods, or take a whole-systems approach to the 2030 Agenda. Failing to address these gaps could lead to inefficient SDG implementation and delay goal attainment. Another contribution of the paper is a reading guide, proposing a way to decipher the literature along the themes emerging from the review, and offering a structure to code future papers.","Bennich, Therese;Weitz, Nina;Carlsen, Henrik",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2020-08-01,Stockholms universitet;Stockholm Environment Institute,2030 Agenda ;  Network analysis ;  SDG interactions ;  SDGs ;  Sustainability governance ;  Sustainable Development Goals
Inter-sector network and clean energy innovation: Evidence from the wind power sector,"Clean energy technology innovation is never an isolated process within the energy sector. The influence of related industrial sectors on clean energy innovation has, however, not been extensively studied. In this paper, we examine how the structure of existing related industrial sectors, which we name as the inter-sector network, affects clean energy technology innovation. We present a novel approach to measuring various characteristics of the inter-sector network. Using panel data of 61 countries from 1997 to 2012, we test the impacts of three key structural attributes of the inter-sector network—size, strength, and proximity—on innovation performance in the wind power sector. We have three major findings: 1) A country with more industries related to the wind industry is likely to have higher knowledge generation and market deployment in the wind power sector; 2) A country with more globally competitive industries related to wind power is likely to have higher market deployment of wind technologies, but it does not significantly affect knowledge generation; 3) A inter-sector network that is more closely related to the wind industry facilitates knowledge generation but may hinder wind technology deployment. These findings highlight the double-sided impacts of the inter-sector network on clean energy innovation. Our findings also suggest the need for industrial policies to foster interactions between clean energy sectors and their related manufacturing sectors.","Zhang, Fang;Tang, Tian;Su, Jun;Huang, Keman",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-08-01,Tsinghua University;Tufts University;MIT Sloan School of Management;Florida State University,Clean energy technology innovation ;  Inter-sector network ;  Policy incentives ;  Wind power sector
User research enabled by makerspaces: Bringing functionality to classical experience prototypes,"This paper sheds light on the new possibilities for user research activities facilitated by access to makerspaces. We present four case studies of user research conducted in two university-based makerspaces as examples of makerspace-driven user research. Further, by comparing the cases to three classical user research activities, namely observation, prototyping, and user journey mapping, we highlight the main aspects of this new context of user research. We find that accessibility to makerspaces enables user researchers to build low-fidelity yet high-functionality prototypes for exploring users' preferences and motivations in controlled and repeatable ways. These prototypes fall into the category of experience prototypes, but they have greater functionality than the prototypes previously used in this field. Thus, a user researcher can explore a topic more systematically and in a more hypothesis-driven manner. In summary, this study encourages stakeholders in the early stages of product development to consider a makerspace as a resource for user-related requirement elicitation rather than for only specific product iteration.","Jensen, Matilde Bisballe;Steinert, Martin",Journal,"Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing: AIEDAM",2020-08-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Action research ;  human-computer interaction ;  innovation ;  makerspace ;  user research
Research Opportunities and Challenges in Engineering System Evolution,"Research in engineering system evolution studies the technical performance (e.g., speed, capacity, and energy efficiency) and the functional and architectural changes of engineering systems (e.g., automobiles, aircrafts, laptops, and smartphones) over time. The research results of engineering system evolution help designers, R&D managers, investors, and policy makers to generate innovative design concepts, set reasonable R&D targets, invest in promising technologies, and develop effective incentive policies. In this paper, we introduce engineering system evolution as an emerging research area. We develop a cyclic model to understand the general structure of engineering system evolution and summarize seven basic research questions accordingly. A review and analysis of prior research related to engineering system evolution is provided to identify the pioneering works in this promising research area. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in the quantitative and qualitative study of engineering system evolution for future research.","Zhang, Guanglu;Morris, Elissa;Allaire, Douglas;McAdams, Daniel A.",Journal,Journal of Mechanical Design,2020-08-01,College of Engineering,decision theory ;  design process ;  evolvable design ;  innovation ;  product design ;  redesign ;  system design ;  system evolution ;  systems engineering ;  technology evolution
Exploring servitization through the paradox lens: Coping practices in servitization,"The study analyzes the coping practices that emerge when a manufacturer of standardized products and add-on services expands to provide customized solutions. Based on a comparative case study methodology conducted across four case companies, and an analysis of extensive documentary data, the study challenges the dichotomous ‘either-or thinking’ in servitization research and highlights ‘both-and thinking’ by identifying both paradoxes and coping practices. The study extends the literature by identifying four paradoxes in servitization: 1) effectiveness in the customization of solutions vs. efficiency in product manufacturing, 2) building a customer orientation vs. maintaining an engineering mindset, 3) organizing product and service integration vs. separated services and product organizations, and 4) exploratory innovation in solutions vs. exploitative innovation in product manufacturing. Moreover, the study identifies nine practices that manufacturing companies apply when coping with the paradoxical challenges that emerge during servitization. The findings may help manufacturing companies understand, accept, and address paradoxical challenges and balance tensions, as not all tensions can be resolved. The identification of these paradoxes allows us to understand the difficulties that manufacturing companies face during the servitization process and may help explain the servitization-deservitization trend among some manufacturing companies that some recent studies have identified.","Kohtamäki, Marko;Einola, Suvi;Rabetino, Rodrigo",Journal,International Journal of Production Economics,2020-08-01,Luleå University of Technology;Vaasan Yliopisto;University of South-Eastern Norway,"Coping practices ;  Paradox theory ;  Product-service systems (PSS) ;  Servitization and digital servitization ;  Strategic change ;  Strategy-as-practice (SAP, Practice theory)"
The Employment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Analyzing and Mitigating Disaster Risks in Industrial Sites,"Effective safety procedures play a fundamental role in high-risk industrial contexts, because the occurrence of an accident can cause environmental catastrophes, severe damages to the structures, and fatal injuries to the workers. In particular, maintaining detailed and up-to-date information about potential accident areas is a crucial issue to prevent the occurrence of disasters and to safely plan the rescue process. In such contexts, periodic safety inspections are therefore performed on a regular basis, although they may expose the inspection personnel to harsh or hazardous environments. The employment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in such situations can provide unprecedented opportunities for predisaster analyses and site management operations. According to the current regulations, however, industrial contexts are classified as 'critical,' which substantially limits the possibilities of performing UAV operations in such places. The recent introduction of a simplified regulatory system for inoffensive UAVs has opened a wide landscape of new business opportunities. The article discusses the application of such technology for site analysis in industrial contexts, and illustrates the mandatory risk assessment procedure prescribed by the regulation. The results obtained show that although the technical advantages and economic convenience of employing this technology is generally recognized, at the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, the market spread is still poor due to fragmented regulations, cultural barriers, and technical issues. In particular, the compliance with the ATEX directives still constitutes a significant technological problem substantially limiting the spread of innovative industrial services. Such issues are discussed in the article referring to a case study, in order to provide a reference guideline and to highlight the boundaries of application of innovative approaches to the prevention and management of industrial disasters based on UAV technology. In addition, the article identifies some important directives for further research and development of UAV systems capable to operate in high-risk industrial contexts, which constitutes an emerging business area with a vast potential market.","Aiello, Giuseppe;Hopps, Fabrizio;Santisi, Domenico;Venticinque, Mario",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2020-08-01,Institute for Agricultural and Forest Systems in the Mediterranean;United Nations;Università degli Studi di Palermo,Disaster prevention ;  safety engineering ;  service innovation ;  unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
University–Industry collaborations and international knowledge spillovers: a joint-patent investigation,"The present work aims at investigating under which circumstances University–Industry (UI) collaborations develop innovations whose spillovers are largely reused by other foreign firms in the development of subsequent and related innovations. In order to answer to this research question, we carried out several analyses from a sample of 772 joint patents in the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical technology sectors, developed by German and Italian universities in collaboration with a firm. Our results show a positive effect of UI collaborations involving local partners, which encourage knowledge sharing and the adoption and combination of foreign knowledge by the same partners, which may complement knowledge and resources available at national level. Finally, we pointed out a positive moderating effect of university specialization, which may increase partners’ absorptive capacity, hence favoring a more effective use of foreign knowledge. Our paper enables a better understanding of the determinants of the innovative impact of UI collaborations, by shedding new light on the mechanisms of global innovations systems that characterize the industries under analysis. Moreover, our work shows how innovation processes in these industries may be favored by adequate search strategies and the choice of effective university partners.","Messeni Petruzzelli, Antonio;Murgia, Gianluca",Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2020-08-01,Politecnico di Bari;Università degli Studi di Siena,Absorptive capacity ;  Foreign knowledge ;  Geographical proximity ;  International knowledge spillovers ;  University–Industry collaboration
The Dynamics of Openness and the Role of User Communities: A Case Study in the Ecosystem of Open Source Gaming Handhelds,"To remain competitive, it is critical for firms to integrate external sources of knowledge. However, finding the right degree of openness is challenging, especially in complex open innovation ecosystems. The interdependencies and dynamics related to the choice of openness are not well-understood. This paper investigates the role of openness as a competitive mechanism. Specifically, we research how openness affects firms' interactions with user communities and how it changes the preference structure of customers. We build a longitudinal case study in the open source gaming handheld industry and trace the evolution and the dynamics of firms, user communities, and their interactions. We find that a suboptimal level of openness can pose a threat to a firm's very existence. Further, we identify repeated patterns characterizing the dynamics in the ecosystem. Based on these patterns, we propose a framework of the dynamics of openness. Our paper contributes to the literature on open innovation. We illuminate the relevance and the dynamics of openness as a dimension for competition. This paper also contributes to the literature on user innovation by showing a shift from manufacturer-based to user-based innovation over the course of the product lifecycle.","Zaggl, Michael A.;Schweisfurth, Tim G.;Herstatt, Cornelius",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2020-08-01,"Technische Universität München;Hamburg University of Technology;University of Southern Denmark, Sønderborg",Collaboration ;  crowdsourcing ;  dynamics ;  entrepreneurship ;  innovation management ;  open source software ;  organizational aspects ;  organizations ;  research and development management ;  technology management ;  user-generated content ;  virtual groups
Disruption Versus Discontinuity: Definition and Research Perspective from Behavioral Economics,"This paper promotes a new academic research perspective for the analysis of industrial innovation and technological development. Specifically, it aims to apply the prescriptions of behavioral economics to conjecture, which can be the result of the battle between the firms established in a mainstream market and their disruptive or discontinuous attackers. Sometimes, differentiating between disruption and discontinuity can be misleading. Therefore, the paper proposes a definition of disruptive technology that clearly sets its necessary and sufficient conditions. This definition expands Christensen's - the pioneer and the driver behind the concept of disruptive technology - opening it to include additional casuistry. It also causes the elaboration of an additional graphic representation. This paper contributes to the academic field in several ways. First, it facilitates the understanding of a very confusing concept that results from an inconsistent use of the term in the literature. Second, it proposes a new research perspective that, in addition to explain the existing and sometimes surprising empirical evidence, also opens novel and numerous future research avenues. The contributions for business practice are the recommendations that managers can derive to improve their decision making processes related to the potential attacks of emerging technologies, differentiating between disruptive and discontinuous technologies.","Fernendez, Esteban;Valle, Sandra;Perez-Bustamante, Guillermo",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2020-08-01,Universidad de Oviedo,business management ;  Engineering management ;  research and development management ;  technology management
"Development of a Scale for Measuring Students’ Attitudes Towards Learning Professional (i.e., Soft) Skills","Employers lament that science graduates, particularly engineering students, lack professional skills, despite increasing emphasis on teaching professional skills in their curriculum. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as an overarching framework, one explanation for skill development gaps may be students’ attitude towards learning professional skills. Our study purpose was to create a scale that accurately and consistently measures engineering students’ attitudes towards learning professional skills. To create the scale, we used a rigorous measurement development methodology, beginning with survey item generation and critical review by subject matter experts. Data from a sample of 534 engineering college students were split into two sets to provide (1) a development sample upon which exploratory factor analyses and parallel analyses were conducted to form the initial scale, and (2) a confirmatory sample whereby we verified the scale structure and obtained initial validity evidence for distinct dimensions. A five-factor scale of 25 items for assessing engineering students’ attitudes towards learning professional skills (ATLPS) obtained high-reliability estimates. Validity evidence supported five distinct dimensions in leadership in teams, communication, civic and public engagement, cultural adaptability, and innovation. The ATLPS can be used to facilitate improvements in engineering education and research by understanding students’ attitudes towards learning professional skills. Furthermore, researchers can expand the scale to include additional dimensions of professionalism and modify items to fit STEM disciplines where professional skill training is essential.","Byrne, Zinta S.;Weston, James W.;Cave, Kelly",Journal,Research in Science Education,2020-08-01,Colorado State University,Attitudes ;  Engineering ;  Professional skills ;  Scale development ;  STEM
A revolution in biochemistry and molecular biology education informed by basic research to meet the demands of 21st century career paths,"The National Science Foundation estimates that 80% of the jobs available during the next decade will require math and science skills, dictating that programs in biochemistry and molecular biology must be transformative and use new pedagogical approaches and experiential learning for careers in industry, research, education, engineering, health-care professions, and other interdisciplinary fields. These efforts require an environment that values the individual student and integrates recent advances from the primary literature in the discipline, experimentally directed research, data collection and analysis, and scientific writing. Current trends shaping these efforts must include critical thinking, experimental testing, computational modeling, and inferential logic. In essence, modern biochemistry and molecular biology education must be informed by, and integrated with, cutting-edge research. This environment relies on sustained research support, commitment to providing the requisite mentoring, access to instrumentation, and state-of-the- art facilities. The academic environment must establish a culture of excellence and faculty engagement, leading to innovation in the classroom and laboratory. These efforts must not lose sight of the importance of multidimensional programs that enrich science literacy in all facets of the population, students and teachers in K-12 schools, nonbiochemistry and molecular biology students, and other stakeholders. As biochemistry and molecular biology educators, we have an obligation to provide students with the skills that allow them to be innovative and self-reliant. The next generation of biochemistry and molecular biology students must be taught proficiencies in scientific and technological literacy, the importance of the scientific discourse, and skills required for problem solvers of the 21st century.","Black, Paul N.",Journal,Journal of Biological Chemistry,2020-07-31,University of Nebraska–Lincoln,

The manufacturing technology of CMM is primarily based on the theory and practices of chemical engineering in which the upgrade of its separation technology mainly relies on the advancement in chemical engineering. Our authors have been exploring and implementing membrane technology in the green manufacturing process of CMM in the past decade. Recently, we were granted funding in the topic of ""The Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine"" from The National Key Research and Development Program of China. In the research proposal, we introduced the emerging concept of ""material-chemistry engineering"", and suggested the concept of theoretical framework for ""the process design and engineering of membrane-based green manufacturing of CMM"". The framework included the establishment of analytical testing approach for precise analysis in aqueous CMM environment, a systematic testing and inspection method for the membrane and membrane process to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the CMM products, as well as the integrated membrane process design and optimization for the CMM manufacturing process. The ultimate goal of the proposal is to achieve high flux and decent separation efficiency for CMM production in multi-scale range, in particular to understand the correlation between the aqueous CMM environment and the structure, property and preparation of the membrane. Furthermore, with the aid of computational modeling in process design and manufacturing, the theoretical foundation of membrane-based CMM green manufacturing can be assured. The innovation in the interdisciplinary of CMM production and material-chemistry engineering will help overcoming the current bottleneck encountered in the CMM manufacturing industry in China, resolving the urgent issues of energy, resources and environment, and providing a feasible solution to sustainable development.","Zhong, Wen Wei;Guo, Li Wei;Yuan, Hai;Chen, Shun Quan",Journal,Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs,2020-07-28,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine;Guangzhou Nansha Information Technology Park Post-Doctoral Scientific Research Station;Guangzhou Institute of Advanced Technology;Jiangsu Jiuwu Hi-Tech Company Limited,Green manufacturing of Chinese materia medica ;  Materials science and chemical engineering ;  Membrane technology ;  Multi-scale ;  Separation
A systems-based R&D management model for the road and transport engineering sector applied to a community access roads and transport research programme,"A conceptual non-linear, systems-based R&D management model for the road and transport sector was developed to address the associated complexities of transport and road research. It takes account of all the elements of the innovation value chain as well as stakeholders. It stimulates systems-thinking in the R&D management process and allows for a non-linear approach to the process with a number of process pathways, both ‘backward’ (back casting) and ‘forward’ thinking, thus facilitating eventual impact and uptake. It includes an impact assessment ‘sensor’ that influences the process of R&D management. The model was used to augment key performance indicators in an existing transport and road research programme. It was shown that a systems-based approach can improve the impact assessment indicators of an R&D programme in a community access roads and transport research programme.","Rust, Frederik Christoffel;Sampson, Leslie Roy",Journal,"African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development",2020-07-28,Sampson Consulting;Pavement Engineering Research Consultancy,impact assessment indicators ;  research management model ;  road engineering ;  rural transport

The Utilization of Bamboo Innovation as Aggregate Substitute for Paving Block,"The paving block is part of pavement system that is widely used by people in Indonesia. Paving blocks are common in urban and rural communities. Paving blocks are very easy to make and easy to apply. Standard way of making a paving block based on SNI 03-0691-1996 method is a mixture of cement, sand/gravel and water. Excessive use of natural materials has an impact on the sustainability of the natural environment. This problem can be solved with various innovations without having to reduce the quality of paving and the pavement itself. Wiwoho, M. S., et. al., [1][2] has conducted preliminary research using bamboo materials instead of aggregates. Whilst Bamboo trees are fast-growing plants and are widely used as merely buffer buildings. So, Bamboo waste materials have not been used optimally enough. The methodology used is that unused bamboo materials being cut in to the size of the required model. The use of bamboo material as a mixture in paving block has adjusted the size, and its composition. The result of this research is that paving blocks made from bamboo trees can meet SNI 03-0691-1996 standard with D quality. Thus, paving blocks can meet eligibility requirements, reasonably enough.","Wiwoho Mudjanarko, Sri;Sugiharti, ;Daniel Limantara, Arthur;Mayestino, Machicky;Eko Adi Sutrisno, Andreas;Haziman Wan Ibrahim, Mohd;Pratama Wiwoho, Firdaus",Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2020-07-27,Narotama University;State Polytechnic of Malang;Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember;Universiti Tun Husein Onn Malaysia;Kadiri University,
You don’t forget where you come from: linking formation and operations in publicly funded innovation networks,"Publicly funded innovation networks (PFINs) are an increasing form of organizing joint innovation activities. Yet, little is known about this form of organization which mixes characteristics of centralized and de-centralized innovation networks. This research investigates how processes of network formation affect its operation in PFINs as a hybrid form between centralized and de-centralized networks. Presenting rich data from a PFIN in the Scandinavian maritime industry, the findings show three patterns linking network formation and operation. The first pattern–well-aligned centralized and de-centralized approaches–in network formation resulted in well-functioning network operation. The second pattern–misalignment between centralized and de-centralized approaches in network formation resulted in stagnating innovation activities during network operation. The third pattern–a pre-dominant de-centralized approach during network formation resulted in unconnected sub-activities during network operation. This research contributes by showing the importance of utilizing both centralized and de-centralized approaches and aligning them to enable well-functioning network formation and operation.","Kreye, Melanie E.;Perunovic, Zoran",Journal,Production Planning and Control,2020-07-26,Jones Graduate School of Business;Technical University of Denmark,case study ;  governance ;  inter-organizational relationships ;  maritime industry ;  Publicly funded innovation networks

An analysis of important issues impacting the development of stormwater management systems in Poland,"There is a clear trend in the world to increase the use of sustainable drainage systems. In Poland, it is not as much noticeable, and as a consequence, the conventional stormwater system remains the most common method of stormwater management. As part of the research, an assessment of the issues affecting the implementation of sustainable stormwater management systems in an engineering practices was performed. For that purpose the PESTLE analysis was applied. Its results indicate that legal factors are the key for the development of sustainable drainage systems in Poland. The scale of public support and availability of funding is also not without importance. The possibilities of the implementation growth of sustainable drainage systems should be sought in changes in legal regulations regarding stormwater management, while ensuring at the same time an appropriate level of financing for sustainable solutions. In the second stage of the research, stormwater management models used in Poland were identified. The strengths and weaknesses of these models were presented. There were also discussed the potential opportunities and threats associated with their implementation. The balances of positive and negative sides that were created through a SWOT analysis could be treated as the basis for the detailed analyses of the legitimate application of individual systems in specific areas. It is expected that the results of the research will allow formulating clear principles of an innovation policy in the field of stormwater management and appointing objective and transparent criteria for financing individual types of drainage investments.","Kordana, Sabina;Słyś, Daniel",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2020-07-20,Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Characterizing Extracellular Vesicles and Their Diverse RNA Contents,"Cells release nanometer-scale, lipid bilayer-enclosed biomolecular packages (extracellular vesicles; EVs) into their surrounding environment. EVs are hypothesized to be intercellular communication agents that regulate physiological states by transporting biomolecules between near and distant cells. The research community has consistently advocated for the importance of RNA contents in EVs by demonstrating that: (1) EV-related RNA contents can be detected in a liquid biopsy, (2) disease states significantly alter EV-related RNA contents, and (3) sensitive and specific liquid biopsies can be implemented in precision medicine settings by measuring EV-derived RNA contents. Furthermore, EVs have medical potential beyond diagnostics. Both natural and engineered EVs are being investigated for therapeutic applications such as regenerative medicine and as drug delivery agents. This review focuses specifically on EV characterization, analysis of their RNA content, and their functional implications. The NIH extracellular RNA communication (ERC) program has catapulted human EV research from an RNA profiling standpoint by standardizing the pipeline for working with EV transcriptomics data, and creating a centralized database for the scientific community. There are currently thousands of RNA-sequencing profiles hosted on the Extracellular RNA Atlas alone (Murillo et al., 2019), encompassing a variety of human biofluid types and health conditions. While a number of significant discoveries have been made through these studies individually, integrative analyses of these data have thus far been limited. A primary focus of the ERC program over the next five years is to bring higher resolution tools to the EV research community so that investigators can isolate and analyze EV sub-populations, and ultimately single EVs sourced from discrete cell types, tissues, and complex biofluids. Higher resolution techniques will be essential for evaluating the roles of circulating EVs at a level which impacts clinical decision making. We expect that advances in microfluidic technologies will drive near-term innovation and discoveries about the diverse RNA contents of EVs. Long-term translation of EV-based RNA profiling into a mainstay medical diagnostic tool will depend upon identifying robust patterns of circulating genetic material that correlate with a change in health status.","Veziroglu, Eren M.;Mias, George I.",Journal,Frontiers in Genetics,2020-07-17,Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology;College of Engineering;Michigan State University,biomarker ;  characterization ;  exosome ;  extracellular vesicle ;  gene expression ;  microvesicle ;  RNA ;  transcriptome
Intercultural competency among engineering doctoral students,"Purpose: Although engineering doctoral students are at the forefront of discovery and innovation and have great potential for establishing partnerships to address engineering challenges crossing national borders, there are few studies of their intercultural competency. The purpose of this study is to identify factors that are associated with intercultural competency – the ability to work effectively in multicultural environments. Design/methodology/approach: The intercultural competency levels of 390 engineering doctoral students were measured by using the Miville–Guzman Universality-Diversity Scale-Short Form (MGUDS-S). Data were analyzed using ordinary linear squares regression. Results are considered descriptive, rather than causal. Findings: Results show that female engineering doctoral students are more likely to score higher on the MGUDS-S than male engineering doctoral students. Proficiency in multiple languages and previous work- or volunteer-related travel experiences are positively associated with doctoral students’ intercultural competency. Originality/value: As internationalization of engineering research and innovation continues to expand, findings suggest that providing students with more opportunities and support for work- or volunteer-related travel and opportunities for learning new languages may help facilitate the development of intercultural competency and students’ willingness to engage in long-term international professional opportunities and research partnerships.","Main, Joyce B.;Wang, Yanbing",Journal,Studies in Graduate and Postdoctoral Education,2020-07-17,ETH Zürich;Purdue University,Doctoral students ;  Engineering ;  Intercultural competency ;  International travel ;  Research partnerships
Major achievements of CNPC overseas oil and gas exploration during the 13th Five-Year Plan and its prospects,"Since the 13th Five-Year Plan, the oil price has continuously remained low and the global investment environment has become increasingly complicated. How to adapt to the complicated internal and external environments as soon as possible, and to achieve accurate deployment and benefit exploration is a major issue faced by CNPC overseas oil and gas exploration. The company has put forward the deployment strategy of focusing on benefits, actively discovering large-scale, high-quality and rapidly-recoverable reserves, and vigorously carrying out risk exploration and fine exploration. A series of effective exploration management measures have been gradually formed, including innovating and implementing the integrated research organization mode of ""industry-college-institute-application cooperation"", optimizing the decision-making process of the headquarters, adhering to the integration of exploration-development-engineering, strengthening international cooperation in deep-water exploration, and actively exploring new exploration projects based on screening of the global large basins. In 2016-2019, through the implementation of the above deployment and measures, CNPC overseas oil and gas exploration has made 12 major breakthroughs and strategic discoveries. In mature exploration areas, findings have been achieved in several exploration fields through fine exploration. The cumulative proven oil and gas geological reserves are more than 10×108t oil equivalent, the discovery cost per barrel oil is less than $2, and the average success rate of exploration well is 76%. At present, CNPC overseas oil and gas exploration is still facing challenges such as the continuous low international oil price, the sharp decrease of exploration projects, the increasingly fierce competition for new blocks, the inferior quality of conventional oil and gas resources, the increasingly complex exploration objects, and the weak capacity of independent exploration and development of deep-water oil and gas. But the undiscovered oil and gas resources are still rich in the world. The cross-border integration of advanced technologies will certainly promote the transformation of exploration concepts and innovation of technologies, and so the prospects of overseas oil and gas exploration are broad.","Liu, Henian;Shi, Buqing;Xue, Liangqing;Wan, Lunkun;Pan, Xiaohua;Ji, Zhifeng;Li, Zhi;Ma, Hong;Fan, Guozhang",Journal,China Petroleum Exploration,2020-07-15,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation Ltd.;PetroChina Hangzhou Research Institute of Geology,CNPC ;  Exploration management ;  Exploration progress ;  Exploration situation ;  Global oil and gas resources ;  Overseas

Between source and sea: The role of wastewater treatment in reducing marine microplastics,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a focal point for the removal of microplastic (MP) particles before they are discharged into aquatic environments. WWTPs are capable of removing substantial quantities of larger MP particles but are inefficient in removing particles with any one dimension of less than 100 μm, with influents and effluents tending to have similar quantities of these smaller particles. As a single WWTP may release >100 billion MP particles annually, collectively WWTPs are significant contributors to the problem of MP pollution of global surface waters. Currently, there are no policies or regulations requiring the removal of MPs during wastewater treatment, but as concern about MP pollution grows, the potential for wastewater technologies to capture particles before they reach surface waters has begun to attract attention. There are promising technologies in various stages of development that may improve the removal of MP particles from wastewater. Better incentivization could speed up the research, development and adoption of innovative practices. This paper describes the current state of knowledge regarding MPs, wastewater and relevant policies that could influence the development and deployment of new technologies within WWTPs. We review existing technologies for capturing very small MP particles and examine new developments that may have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. The types of collaborations needed to encourage and incentivize innovation within the wastewater sector are also discussed, specifically strong partnerships among scientific and engineering researchers, industry stakeholders, and policy decision makers.","Freeman, Shirra;Booth, Andy M.;Sabbah, Isam;Tiller, Rachel;Dierking, Jan;Klun, Katja;Rotter, Ana;Ben-David, Eric;Javidpour, Jamileh;Angel, Dror L.",Journal,Journal of Environmental Management,2020-07-15,SINTEF Ocean;ORT Braude - College of Engineering;GEOMAR - Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanforschung Kiel;Syddansk Universitet;University of Haifa;National Institute of Biology Ljubljana;National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health;Galilee Society,Innovation ;  Jellyfish mucus ;  Microplastic ;  Particle removal ;  Policy ;  Wastewater
Do energy technology innovations contribute to CO<inf>2</inf> emissions abatement? A spatial perspective,"With growing concerns about global warming, energy technology innovation has attracted attention from scholars. Many studies have explored the relationship between energy technology innovations and energy consumption, while the influence of energy technology innovation on carbon emissions (CEs) has not received enough attention. Utilizing the spatial econometric model, this study aims to examine whether energy technology innovations are beneficial for CO2 emissions abatement in China. The results indicate that, first, renewable energy technology innovation facilitates CO2 abatement, while fossil energy technology innovation is ineffective in reducing CEs. Second, the influences of energy technology innovations on CEs are trans-regional. Third, economic growth would agglomerate CEs from low-growth province to neighboring high-growth provinces; mandatory environmental regulation in China would transfer CEs from provinces with strict regulations to neighboring provinces with loose regulation. Based on these findings, a series of policy recommendations are put forward to tackle China's CEs. One possible innovation is that this study considers geographic location when investigating how energy technology innovations affect CEs.","Wang, Zilong;Zhu, Yongfeng",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2020-07-15,Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,China ;  CO  emissions 2 ;  Energy technology innovation ;  Spatial econometric models

Teaching Reform of Applied Technology University Physics Based on Computer Aided System,"Physics application practice is of great significance to the application of Physics and the cultivation of basic scientific research talents. With the continuous improvement of technology value cognition in the basic industry of China, the improvement of manufacturing industry competitiveness and the realization of innovation are inseparable from the participation of physical application technology. However, according to the results of industry research in recent years, the contribution rate of university Physics to society in China is far from expected, and there is still a lot to improve in the teaching of university application technologies and application practice abilities, which should focus on the future teaching. With the continuous exploration of Chinese computer education technology and data-base teaching technology, the teaching methods in colleges and universities have been greatly changed. According to the research, the current rate of online reading habits and communication habits of college students in China is up to about 67.9%. The demands of students' independent growth and the needs for society comprehensive talents make college Physics undertake more training responsibilities and ability teaching tasks. As an important medium of college teaching, the development and application level of computer-aided system has a certain impact on the teaching effect of college Physics. At present, the CAI system with multimedia courseware as the core couldn't meet the needs of students' study. Therefore, it is necessary to design and deal with the CAI System in a more diversified way. Because of its high abstraction, theory and comprehensiveness, the past teaching practice of college Physics is difficult to achieve high results. Therefore, based on the computer aided system, this paper explores the reform direction and feasibility realization mode of applied technology college Physics teaching.","Li, Rong;Zheng, Lang;Ren, Ximei",Conference Proceeding,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,2020-07-13,East China Jiaotong University;Jiangxi Provincial Education Examination Authority,Computer Aided System ;  Physics ;  Teaching Reform

The Effect of Venture Capital on Enterprise Benefit According to the Heterogeneity of Human Capital of Entrepreneur,"This research was conducted for the purpose of exploring the role of venture capital (VC) based on the heterogeneity of human capital in the process of transforming innovation capabilities of enterprise into enterprise benefits and providing a reference for further research on enterprise performance development. In this study, 399 listed companies that obtained VC before 2018 from the China VC database and Wind China financial database were selected as research objects, and relevant data of patent number, return on equity, Tobin’s Q ratio, and research and development (R&D) investment ratio of each enterprise were obtained. Enterprise innovation ability was introduced to construct the relationship model of human-capital VC, enterprise innovation ability, and enterprise benefit, and the relationship between human-capital VC, enterprise innovation ability, and enterprise benefit was analyzed by the multiple-regression model. The results show that the number of patents of invested enterprises has an extremely significant positive correlation with the human capital index (P < 0.001), and a significant positive correlation with the education level of personnel, the proportion of engineering professionals (P < 0.05). The return on equity and Tobin’s Q ratio of enterprises have extremely significant positive correlations with the number of patents of invested enterprises (P < 0.001) and have a significant positive correlation with the number of patents of the invested enterprises × education level of the personnel, and the number of patents of the invested enterprises × proportion of engineering professionals (P < 0.05). All in all, the education level of the entrepreneur’ s VC human capital and the proportion of engineering professionals can effectively improve the innovation ability of the enterprise, thus indirectly playing a value-added role in the improvement of enterprise benefits. The invested enterprises will also face the problems of scale diseconomy and financing constraint when their profitability is enhanced, so they need to optimize their own business strategies.","Jin, Xin;Zheng, Puyang;Zhong, Ziqi;Cao, Yali",Journal,Frontiers in Psychology,2020-07-10,Guilin Tourism University;Beijing Technology and Business University;East China Jiaotong University;Kyung Hee University,China VC database ;  enterprise benefits ;  enterprise innovation ability ;  VC of human capital ;  Wind China financial database

Optimal location of an intake at a reservoir prone to salt diffusion,"There are two main factors which prompt to look for an alternative to traditional approaches to the provision of drinking water. They are climate change and population growth. Climate change and its increasing scale are no longer in doubt. It tends to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts. Changes in average water availability in most Central Asian river basins are estimated to be drastically big for the next 30 years. And, groundwater recharge may also be affected with a reduction in the availability of groundwater for drinking water in some regions. Water use has been increasing worldwide by about 1% per year since the 1980s, driven by a combination of population growth, socio-economic development and changing consumption patterns. Global water demand is expected to continue increasing at a similar rate until 2050, accounting for an increase of 20 to 30% above the current level of water use, mainly due to rising demand in the industrial and domestic sectors. These obliging to redefine the strategy for the use of water resources to ensure sustainable drinking water supply forcing the use of all available water resources even those that were not previously taken into account, for example, off stream storage reservoirs. Research, development and innovation play an important role in supporting informed decision-making. Therefore, further scientific and engineering studies are also needed for the development of financially affordable, safe and efficient infrastructure services in the areas of drinking water supply, sanitation and hygiene and its components. The article considers a particular reservoir the bottom of which is composed of saline soils operating in regular filling and emptying and subject to significant wind effects. The research conducted allowed to find a place of water intake location which provides a minimum salt content in the water abstracted.","Krutov, Anatoly;Norkulov, Bekhzod;Artikbekova, Fotima;Nurmatov, Panji",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2020-07-09,"""Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers"" National Research University;State Oceanographic Institute, Moscow",

Crossing Kingdoms: How Can Art Open Up New Ways of Thinking About Science?,"“Crossing Kingdoms” is an artist-led experiment in the biological fusion of mammalian and yeast cells and the cultural discussions of these phenomena. We present this collaboration as an experiment in responsible research and innovation (RRI), an institutionalized format for ensuring that researchers reflect on the wider social dimensions of their work. Our methods challenged us as researchers to reflect on interdisciplinary collaboration and the possibility of innovating in biology for artistic purposes, challenged audiences to reflect on biological boundaries, and challenged both groups to reflect on what it means to be responsible in science. We conclude that our experiment in RRI was successful because we have asked unexpected questions—a contrast to RRI implemented as a standard protocol. Our experiment has implications for biologists and artists pursuing interdisciplinary collaborations with each other and for researchers thinking about implementing RRI as more than a box-ticking exercise.","Szymanski, Erika;Bates, Tarsh;Cachat, Elise;Calvert, Jane;Catts, Oron;Nelson, Lenny J.;Rosser, Susan J.;Smith, Robert D.J.;Zurr, Ionat",Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2020-07-03,The University of Western Australia;The University of Edinburgh;Colorado State University,art-science collaboration ;  hybrid taxa ;  interdisciplinarity ;  responsible research and innovation ;  synthetic biology

The Impact of ICT Advances on Education: A Case Study,"ICT advances in the pace of Moore's law as well as Gilder's Law. The introduction of ICT into education has resulted astounding effects in learning. This paper presents a case study of the establishment of National Engineering Research Center for E-learning, as part of education informationized effort in China. There are four stages of China's integration of ICT with education: start-up phase, application phase, integration phase, and innovation phase. The four phases are well in line with the ICT evolutions from standalone computer, to all IP network, to all cloud infrastructure, and to today's all AI, which utilizes full spectrum of ICT including emerging technology advances in big data and artificial intelligence. The role of ICT in education has gone far beyond as an assisting tool in learning; it led to reconsider the traditional classroom centric teaching architecturally, as well as represented a paradigm shift in education including the roles of classroom teaching, the way of learning, the learning period systematically. Interactive and exploratory learning have become the mantra and education as a service is inevitable. At the same time, like any other technologies, ICT used in education can backfire if not carefully planned. This paper proposes a systematical engineering approach that integrates multiple tooling and activities around the learning of a particular subject with the purpose that engages learners through an intuitive, game-like environment where students learn through exploration and discovery.","Duan, Chao;Guo, Dongpo;Xie, Jerry;Zhang, Jing",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering, CISCE 2020",2020-07-01,Central China Normal University,classroom ;  cloud computing ;  MOOC ;  open source ;  PhET
A preliminary investigation of an autonomous vehicle validation infrastructure for smart cities,"The research and development of autonomous vehicle has entered the era of commercialization. While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI). A preliminary investigation of a new autonomous vehicle validation infrastructure that can serve a multitude of research projects for smart city is presented.","Deliparaschos, Kyriakos M.;Santha, Gergely;Fragonara, Luca Zanotti;Petrunin, Ivan;Zolotas, Argyrios C.;Tsourdos, Antonios",Conference Proceeding,"15th International Conference Mechatronic Systems and Materials, MSM 2020",2020-07-01,Cranfield University,Artificial intelligence (AI) ;  Autonomous vehicle ;  Sensor fusion ;  Smart city
Accumulation conditions and key exploration and development technologies in Qingcheng oilfield,"In 2019, PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company discovered the Qingcheng oilfield, China's largest shale oilfield, in the source beds of Chang 7 oil layer of Mesozoic Yanchang Formation in Ordos Basin, forming 3.58×108t of newly proven geological reserves and 6.93×108t of predicted geological reserves, 10.51×108t in total, and achieving a historic breakthrough in shale oil exploration in Chang 7 oil layer. In recent years, concentrating on the key challenges including whether sweet spot can be developed in source beds, whether industrial capacity can be formed and whether efficient development can be realized in a large scale, PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company has achieved a series of theoretical understanding innovations and technological breakthroughs during reservoir exploration in source rocks by deepening the study of hydrocarbon accumulation mechanism and continuously exploring key supporting technologies. The research results show that shale oil accumulation in Chang 7 oil layer is mainly controlled by the following factors. First, the broad fine-grained sedimentary combination is characterized by hydrocarbon generation in the whole reservoirs, of which the lacustrine high-quality source rocks such as black shale and dark mudstone lay the material base for the formation of shale oil. Second, the sandy deposits sandwiched by shale beds are sweet spots for exploration, and the combination types of sand bodies are mainly controlled by the lakebed landform. Third, the complementarity of microscale pores and nanoscale throats results in good reservoir properties. Fourth, the high-intensity hydrocarbon charging in the source rocks has formed reservoirs with high oil saturation and gas-oil ratio. The effective combination of the above factors is the key to the large-scale enrichment of shale oil in Chang 7 oil layer of Ordos Basin. Currently, a substantial breakthrough in large-scale exploration and development of shale oil has been made by innovating key supporting technologies and creating powerful tools. The application of logging-seismic combination technology in loess tablelands has greatly improved the quality of three-dimensional seismic data, which can effectively guide the prediction of sandy sweet spots. The ""three-quality"" logging technology can be used to evaluate geological and engineering sweet spots. The partitioned volume fracturing of long horizontal wells can further increase single well production. The initial oil production of a single well is increased from 10 t/d to more than 18 t/d. The exploration breakthrough in the source reservoir of Chang 7 oil layer represented by Qingcheng oilfield provides an important resource foundation for the second-time accelerated development of PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company. It is estimated that by 2023, the oil production from the shale beds of Chang 7 oil layer can reach 300×104t and 500×104t in 2025.","Fu, Suotang;Fu, Jinhua;Niu, Xiaobing;Li, Shixiang;Wu, Zhiyu;Zhou, Xinping;Liu, Jiangyan",Journal,Shiyou Xuebao/Acta Petrolei Sinica,2020-07-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company;National Engineering Laboratory of Low Permeability Oil and Gas Field Exploration and Development,Chang 7 oil layer of Yanchang Formation ;  Geological conditions for hydrocarbon accumulation ;  Ordos Basin ;  Qingcheng oilfield ;  Shale oil ;  Supporting technologies for exploration and development
Investigation of Mechanical Properties of Mud Concrete with Coconut Fiber Reinforcement,"Mud concrete was a sustainable innovation, invented to replace existing conventional construction materials with sustainable material. Mud concrete consists of soil and cement along with water. In terms of sustainable construction, cement which act as the stabilizer in mud concrete should be kept lesser as much as possible, according to its potential environmental issues. Therefore, evaluation of ability to enhance the mud concrete properties by adding some admixtures is essential. There are no of admixtures used in the construction industry with many forms, such as liquid, solid, semisolid or fiber. In most of the studies fiber was used as an admixture to improve the strength performance of construction materials. Hence, evaluate the strength performance of mud concrete with fiber is important to reduce cement in sustainability contest. Therefore, this study was investigated the effect of natural fiber length on compressive strength and strength variation with water content of mud concrete with fiber. According to the results, the highest strength was recorded with the fiber length of 60 mm and the compressive strength was decreasing with the increasing water content. The study concluded that the optimum fiber length is 60 mm and there is a negative correlation between compressive strength and water content.","Galabada, Harsha;Galkanda, Himahansi;Dharmaratne, P.

Bamboo structures for modern sustainable architecture,"Bamboo is an old and traditional building material throughout the world's tropical and sub-tropical regions. Considered a renewable and versatile resource, bamboo has gained popularity over the years. Although not many architects use it as the main construction material in bearing structures, it is frequently highlighted in research. New technologies combined with innovated traditional techniques enable its use in structural applications in regions with a hot-humid climate. All this significant development is not only because of engineering advances, but also reckoning the capabilities of bamboo. Many specialists are developing new technologies, some of which are already used in construction. Bamboo fibers are longer and more flexible than wood, so they are often used in the construction of earthquake-resistant buildings. Innovations in the field of bamboo constructions allow us to expand the capabilities of this natural material, making it more stable in structures with large spans. This paper presents the case for promoting bamboo structures in the modern world. The paper uses the following research methods; study of literary and online sources, abstraction, analysis and comparison. It argues that in the 21st century, bamboo structures are becoming more in demand due to the increasing environmental problems in the cities. Natural origin, rapid production, construction and recycling of bamboo structures are very good reasons for promoting bamboo as a versatile material.","Yor Maikol, Solanilla Medina;Maksimovich, Shuvalov Vasily;Ivanovna, Bykova Galina;Ainur, Sultanova",Journal,ISVS e-journal,2020-07-01,Moscow Architectural Institute;RUDN University,Bamboo constructions ;  Bamboo structures ;  Guadua Bamboo ;  Modern constructions ;  Sustainable architecture
HOTSEP: Revised Anderson's taxonomy in environmental learning of COVID-19,"Environmental learning in the 21st century requires a high level of thinking ability, especially to solve environmental problems when COVID-19 pandemic. This was to develop a new level of thinking, namely Higher Order Thinking Skills of Environmental Problem (HOTSEP) which is a revision of Anderson's Taxonomy. The purpose of this study was to measure students HOTSEP in the context of environmental problems related to COVID-19. The research method used in this research was descriptive. The sample used 277 university students from several cities in Indonesia. The instrument used HOTSEP which has 3 categories of thinking level start from develop innovation about environment (C6), solve environmental problem (C5), criticize environmental problem (C4). The results showed that students HOTSEP were still in the very low category (33.64). This study concludes that the HOTSEP of students was still low and needs to be improved to the understanding of COVID-19 concept in environmental learning. Suggestion for further research was HOTSEP need to implement in school or university for several environmental learning topics in many subjects/courses start from Natural Science, Social Science, Engineering, and others relevant subject. HOTSEP can be measured not only in school or university, HOTSEP can be implement in community and public.","Ichsan, Ilmi Zajuli;Rahmayanti, Henita",Journal,European Journal of Educational Research,2020-07-01,Universitas Negeri Jakarta,COVID-19 ;  Environmental learning ;  HOTSEP
Is disruptive innovation in emerging economies different? Evidence from China,"Most studies on disruptive innovations have focused on developed economies and little work examines this type of innovation in and from emerging economies. Moreover, previous studies on disruptive innovations have not investigated the processes behind. This study begins to fill these research gaps. Analysing disruptive innovations in and from China, we identify three important differences from the kinds of disruption observed in developed economies. First, rather than being based on launching products with inferior performance, disruptive innovations in China focus on offering different value propositions. Second, the rate at which Chinese disruptive innovations are improved and extended is typically faster than in developed markets. Third, Chinese disruptive innovations are often launched directly into a mass market rather than a niche. Besides identifying these differences, we also discuss how Chinese firms generate disruptive innovations. The findings expand the understanding of disruptive innovation and hence enrich the existing literature on this important phenomenon.","Williamson, Peter J.;Wan, Feng;Eden, Yin;Linan, Lei",Journal,Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M,2020-07-01,Zhejiang University International Business School;Cambridge Judge Business School;Norwich Business School,Disruptive innovation ;  Emerging economies ;  Innovation process
Research advances in theory and technology of the stress release applied extraction of coalbed methane from tectonically deformed coals,"The efficient exploitation of coalbed methane (CBM) in tectonically deformed coals (TDC) is the choice of China's resource endowment of CBM. Current CBM exploitation theory of dewatering-depressure-desorption is unfit for tectonically deformed coal seams, which determined by the characteristics of TDC and the occurrence characteristics of CBM in TDC. The stress release applied extraction of CBM is a new theory and technology, which is expected to transform TDC from the forbidden zone of CBM exploitation into a new field. Meanwhile, it will be a fundamental solution of coal and gas outburst control and greenhouse gas emissions (methane) in coal mine. Supported by the National Key Project for Scientific Instrument and Equipment Research and Development, the work took the key experimental platform and engineering equipment prototype of the stress release applied extraction of CBM as the basic positioning, took exploitation theory innovation and technical principle exploration as the forerunner, and took the device, engineering equipment, and technology of the stress release applied extraction of CBM as the core research content. Based on this research, the theory and technology of the stress release applied extraction of CBM has been made important and substantial progress. Currently, the theoretical and technical basis of the stress release applied extraction of CBM has been explored, which expounds the mechanical principles of the TDC in-situ CBM recovery by horizontal well cavern completion and stress relief. The design of analogue experiment system for the TDC in-situ CBM recovery by horizontal well cavern completion and stress relief has been completed, and entered the processing, based on which some important results have been obtained according to a series of supporting basic experiments, including the establishment of relation model between the stress relief of TDC and the desorption and diffusion of CBM, and the reveal of the variation rules of TDC permeability caused by the stress release applied extraction. Based on the design of the analogue experiment system, some key technologies of the stress release applied extraction of CBM in TDC haves been developed, including the large diameter horizontal well drilling technology for TDC with two-way reciprocating drilling+multistage reaming+complex circulating drilling fluid, the stress relief and permeability increase technology with horizontal well pumping+ejection-induced controllable cavitation, the efficient lifting technology of mixture of water, gas, and high concentration coal powder in vertical wells with jet pump+supporting bottom hole device, the efficient ground gravitational separation+recycle+water circulation technology, and the data acquisition and control system for the device and engineering equipment of the stress release applied extraction of CBM.","Sang, Shuxun;Zhou, Xiaozhi;Liu, Shiqi;Wang, Haiwen;Cao, Liwen;Liu, Huihu;Li, Zicheng;Zhu, Shuyun;Liu, Changjiang;Huang, Huazhou;Xu, Hongjie;Wamg, Ran;Jia, Jinlong;Ashutosh, Tripathy;Han, Sijie",Journal,Meitan Xuebao/Journal of the China Coal Society,2020-07-01,China University of Petroleum (East China);China University of Mining and Technology;Anhui University of Science and Technology;Wuhan Institute of Technology,Coal and gas outburst ;  In-situ coalbed methane ;  Stress release applied extraction ;  Tectonically deformed coals
Soil Health and Agriculture Green Development：Opportunities and Challenges,"Agriculture green development (AGD) is the future for modern agriculture, and soil health is the cornerstone of AGD. This article summarized the connotation, research progress and trend of soil health in domestic and overseas. By summarizing the main management strategies for healthy soil cultivation, this paper puts forward novel ideas and approaches for promoting soil health, and discusses the challenges and opportunities for soil health engineering. The cores for the promotion of healthy soils are; eliminating the limiting factors of soils; increasing the content of soil organic carbon and nutrient use efficiency; exploiting the biological potentials; promoting synergistic interactions between above-ground and below-ground. The aim of soil health engineering is to synergize the production and other ecosystem services delivered by soils by optimizing the internal regulatory processes whilst minimizing the external inputs. The cultivation of healthy soil needs holistic engineering, which requires comprehensive integration of whole industry chain in the nexus of external input, crop production, products-processing, and waste recycling. Meanwhile, cross-disciplinary innovation, government-farmer-research-extension institute collaboration, and policy support and incentive systems are crucial for realizing soil health towards AGD.","Zhang, Junling;Zhang, Jiangzhou;Shen, Jianbo;Tian, Jing;Jin, Kemo;Zhang, Fusuo",Journal,Acta Pedologica Sinica,2020-07-01,China Agricultural University,Agriculture green development ;  Biofortification ;  Ecosystem multifunctionality ;  Limiting factors ;  Soil health
Model of Technology Opportunity Mining Using Machine Learning Algorithm and Its Application,"The applicability of the existing technology opportunity mining results is relatively low owing to the small sample size and the lack of evaluation on the technology application prospects in the mining process. In order to solve this problem, with the goal of improving the applicability of mining results, based on the existing research, this paper proposes a three-dimensional patent prediction model by taking into account a large number of patents and adding an assessment of the prospects for technology applications. Using the PLSA algorithm in machine learning and combining with the MapReduce computing framework under Hadoop, it uses patent text mining to construct the technology and function dimensions of the patent prediction model, adopts entropy weight and TOPSIS method to construct the value dimension of the patent prediction model, and fills the element items in the patent forecasting model based on the MapReduce computing framework. Then, it applies a patent prediction model to 133 508 patent texts in the titanium field in the DII database from 1999 to 2018. The results show that the model has identified a total of 3 priority and 2 secondary technology opportunities in the titanium field, and these technology opportunities can be developed in order of priority. This model enriches the method for technology opportunity mining and provides a more accurate and prospective technology research and development direction for innovation subjects.","Bao, Qinglin;Chai, Huaqi;Zhao, Songzheng;Wang, Jilin",Journal,Shanghai Jiaotong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Shanghai Jiaotong University,2020-07-01,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Machine learning algorithms ;  Patent text mining ;  Technology opportunity ;  Titanium
Relational embeddedness and disruptive innovations: The mediating role of absorptive capacity,"What are the driving factors of disruptive innovations in emerging economies from a network perspective? We argue that three forms of absorptive capacity (i.e. exploratory, exploitative and transformative learning) mediate the relationship between a firm's network relations and disruptive innovations. We tested the hypotheses with a survey of 251 firms in China and iterated the conceptual model to reflect the crucial insight that disrupters in emerging economies can leap from exploratory learning to disruptive innovation. We surmise exploratory learning help disrupters outsource transformative and exploitative learning via their supply chains. Suggestions for future research and limitations are also discussed.","Wang, Zhiwei;Ling, Juan;Chok, Jay I.",Journal,Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M,2020-07-01,Keck Graduate Institute;Fuzhou University;Georgia College & State University,Absorptive capacity ;  Disruptive innovation ;  Relational embeddedness
Challenges of implementing nano-specific safety and safe-by-design principles in academia,"Safe-by-design is an essential component for creating awareness of the potential novel risks associated with the introduction of sophisticated nanomaterials (NMs) with novel properties. SbD is also a useful tool for meeting EU policy ambitions such as the European Green Deal which includes circular economy and moving towards a zero pollution (pollution-free) environment. Unidentified risks are a growing concern with the rapid and exponential advances of nanotechnology innovation, and the increase in fundamental research on NMs and their potential applications. Therefore, addressing nano-specific safety issues early in the innovation process is vital for reducing the uncertainties of novel NMs. The challenge is that many innovators and material scientists are not toxicologist and are not aware on how to assess the safety of their innovations and novel materials. Safe-by-design is a concept that aims at reducing uncertainties and risks for humans and the environment, starting at an early phase of the innovation process and covering the whole innovation value chain, including research. This perspective tries to get a better understanding on the role of safe-by-design within engineered nanomaterial research to create awareness on the importance on assessing the safety early in research. A method was developed that integrates SbD with a set of questions to aid material scientists assess the safety of their materials (nano-specific safety aspects) and Risk Analysis and Technology Assessment (RATA). Here we present the results of a workshop for material scientists (PhD students) with limited toxicology knowledge at the Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science (Utrecht University, The Netherlands) with the main goals to create awareness with regard to basic NM safety and to explore the possibilities for applying safe-by-design principles in academia. The approach presented here can be applied by researchers and innovators to assess the safety of NMs at an early stage of the innovation process, and this work is framed in the context of Responsible Research and Innovation using RATA.","Soeteman-Hernández, Lya G.;Blab, Gerhard A.;Carattino, Aquiles;Dekker, Frans;Dekkers, Susan;van der Linden, Marte;van Silfhout, Alex;Noorlander, Cornelle W.",Journal,NanoImpact,2020-07-01,Debye Instituut voor Nanomaterialen Wetenschap;European Synchrotron Radiation Facility;Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu,Academia ;  Responsible research and innovation ;  Safe-by-design
Disruptive innovation and national cultures: Enhancing effects of regulations in emerging markets,"Research on the effects of national cultures and their interactions with the regulatory institutional environment on disruptive innovation in emerging economies context remains scarce. Thus, to answer this gap, we draw from the sociological framework of Institutional Anomie Theory and hypothesized that disruptive innovation is a form of positive deviance to anomic conditions in societies. Using multilevel analysis, the results showed support for moderating effects of the regulatory institutional context, i.e., rule of law and regulatory quality on the cultural drivers and disruptive innovation relationships. Finally, we discuss the results, the study's contributions and conclude with limitations and future research.","Kim, Sahrok;Parboteeah, K.

Information processing in Internet of Things using big data analytics,"With innovation in persistent technologies, such as wearable sensor gadgets, sensor devices, and wireless ad-hoc communication networks connect everyday life things to the Internet, normally referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is observed as an active entity for design and development of smart and context awareness services and applications in the area of business, science and engineering discipline. These applications and services could vigorously respond to the surroundings transformation and users’ preference. Developing a scalable system for data analysis, processing and mining of enormous real world based datasets has turned into one of the demanding problems that faces both system research scholars and data management research scholars. Employing big data analytics with IoT technologies is one of the ways for handling the timely analyzing information (i.e., data, events) streams. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach that coalesce IoT systems with big data tools into a holistic platform for real-time and continuous data monitoring and processing. We propose Fog assisted IoT based Smart and real time healthcare information processing (SRHIP) system in which large amounts of data generated by IoT sensor devices are offloaded at Fog cloud form data analytics and processing with minimum delay. The processed data is then transferred to a centralized cloud system for further analysis and storage. In this work, we introduce a Fog-assisted model with big data environment for data analytic of real time data with remote monitoring and discuss our plan for evaluating its efficacy in terms of several performance metrics such as transmission cost, storage cost, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and F-measure. The proposed SRHIP system needs less transmission cost of 40.10% in comparison to SPPDA, 100% fewer bytes are compromised in comparison to GCEDA. Our proposed system data size reduction of 60% reduction due to proposed compression scheme in comparison to other benchmark strategies that offer 40% of reduction.","Li, Chaomin",Journal,Computer Communications,2020-07-01,Hunan Normal University,Cloud computing ;  Fog computing ;  Internet of Things (IoT) ;  Naïve Bayes classifier ;  Smart and real-time healthcare information processing (SRHIP)

After the first experiments were conducted in 2006, the facility has seen a sharp increase in usage and has produced a significant amount of data for the Canadian crystallographic community. Upgrades aimed at increasing throughput and flux to support the next generation of more demanding experiments are currently under way or have recently been completed. At CMCF-BM, this includes an enhanced monochromator, automounter software upgrades and a much faster detector. CMCF-ID will receive a major upgrade including a new undulator, a new monochromator and new optics to stably focus the beam onto a smaller sample size, as well as a brand-new detector.","Fodje, Michel;Mundboth, Kiran;Labiuk, Shaunivan;Janzen, Kathryn;Gorin, James;Spasyuk, Denis;Colville, Scott;Grochulski, Pawel",Journal,Acta Crystallographica Section D: Structural Biology,2020-07-01,Centre Canadien de Rayonnement Synchrotron,beamline ;  Canadian Light Source Canada Foundation for Innovation Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada National Research Council Canada Canadian Institutes of Health Research Government of Saskatchewan University of Saskatchewan ;  double crystal/multi-layer monochromator ;  macromolecular crystallography
Remote sensing and electromagnetic wave behaviour to measure vegetation phenology with physics,"Interdisciplinary models of teaching have been present in education systems for at least 30 years. The idea of the interdisciplinarity is to show students the contextualisation of subject knowledge, its relation to real-life problems and to build skills across traditional disciplinary boundaries. This is essential to future competitiveness since innovations frequently occur at the interface of disciplines when people are able to collaborate. Schools try to respond to the need to prepare students for an interdisciplinary and collaborative job market by modifying the curricula and training teachers. But one of the most primary and difficult problems is preparing a truly interdisciplinary lesson or a project. It seems that all complex issues could be good examples for this purpose. One of these complex issues is the study of climate change, which requires the collaboration of different specialists and a comprehensive understanding of the problem in different scientific fields: physical, geographical, biological, social, engineering, etc. The paper presents an interdisciplinary project which links knowledge within a few different science areas around the real-life problem important for students. The work shows the developed and tested interdisciplinary educational project 'Panta Rhei' which integrates physics and other STEM subjects to present the biological and social consequences of changes in vegetation periods for different climate zones. It shows how Earth observation research can be utilised in schools for teaching physics and other science subjects. The project was validated on a group of Polish teachers. In the paper we present the whole project together with teachers' opinions.","Woźniak, Edyta;Gabryszewski, Ryszard;Dziob, Daniel",Journal,Physics Education,2020-07-01,Space Research Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences;Uniwersytet Jagielloński;Jagiellonian University Medical College,interdisciplinary ;  remote sensing ;  science education ;  secondary school ;  vegetation
Public Procurement of Innovation: Evidence from a German Legislative Reform,"Using public procurement to promote private innovation activities has attracted increasing attention recently. Germany implemented a legal change in its procurement framework in 2009, which allowed government agencies to specify innovative aspects of procured products as selection criteria in calls for tender. We analyze a sample of 3410 German firms to investigate whether this reform stimulated innovation in the business sector. Across a wide range of specifications – OLS, nearest-neighbor matching, IV regressions and difference-in-differences – we find a robust and significant effect of innovation-directed public procurement on turnover with new products and services. At the same time, our results demonstrate that public procurement mainly stimulates innovations of more incremental nature rather than true market novelties.","Czarnitzki, Dirk;Hünermund, Paul;Moshgbar, Nima",Journal,International Journal of Industrial Organization,2020-07-01,Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung GmbH;Maastricht University School of Business and Economics;KU Leuven,Econometric Policy Evaluation ;  Innovation ;  Public Procurement of Innovation ;  Public Procurement with Contracted Innovation ;  Research and Development
Systematic analysis and usage of harmful resources,"The concept of resources in TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is to make the most use of existing resources to solve problems with zero or minimum cost. Even though resources are one of the most powerful concepts in the TRIZ tools, there have been few systematic methods to identify resources for problem solving. This research established a systematic process to analyze harmful resources and identify opportunities for converting the harmful resources to useful applications or using the useful part of the harmful resource while avoiding or being insensitive to its harmful aspects. The systematic process integrates inverse function oriented search, function attribute analysis, and effect/resource data base to identify and utilize the otherwise harmful resources. The contributions of this research include: (1) Establishing a systematic process to identify, analyze and use harmful resources converting the harmful situations into useful situations in new application scenarios. (2) Establishing a set of systematic process and structured forms with examples and usage instructions to facilitate practical applications of the tools.","Sheu, D.

Enhancing the competitiveness of multi-agent cooperation for green manufacturing in China: An empirical study of the measure of green technology innovation capabilities and their influencing factors,"Although green technology innovation (GTI) under multi-agent cooperation has become a mainstream innovation mode for green manufacturing, it is difficult to implement in practice. This study empirically investigated the measure of GTI capability and its influencing factors to enhance the capability of GTI and competitiveness of multi-agent cooperation. First, a questionnaire survey was used to construct an evaluation index system of GTI capability for manufacturing enterprises under multi-agent cooperation (MEUMC). Second, the evaluation model based on consistency and decision-making trials and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) model were combined to measure the capability and influencing factors of GTI. The key empirical results are as follows. The evaluation system of GTI capability for MEUMC should take into account four aspects: input elements, technology output, economic output, and social effect of GTI. The proportion of green R&D expenditure in the total R&D expenditure and the share of new green products in the total number of new products are the core factors affecting the GTI capability of MEUMC; the direct influencing factors comprise the proportion of green technology transformation and regulatory incentives. The proportion of green technology transformation, acceptance of green technology products by users, market driving factors, and regulatory incentive factors are the most important factors. A fusion of subjective and objective methods can be adopted to evaluate the capability of GTI. The evaluation results obtained by single-evaluation methods can be combined based on compatibility and consistency.","Yin, Shi;Zhang, Nan;Li, Baizhou",Journal,Sustainable Production and Consumption,2020-07-01,Hebei Agricultural University;Harbin Engineering University,Green technology innovation ;  Influencing factors ;  Innovation capability ;  Manufacturing enterprises ;  Multi-agent cooperation
From Empowerment Dynamics to Team Adaptability: Exploring and Conceptualizing the Continuous Agile Team Innovation Process,"To foster their innovation teams’ adaptability, organizations are increasingly relying on agile teams. While research on the adoption of agile methods and practices has grown tremendously in the past decade, little is currently known about the human side of agile teams and how it contributes toward the emergence of adaptability. While the Agile Manifesto states that individuals and interactions are more important for agile product development than tools and processes, research on how these interactions unfold is still in its infancy. To shed light on the human side of adaptability, 44 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with team members and leaders from various teams at three organizations (i.e., two German and one multinational European firm). The inductive analysis identified empowerment as a focal human factor for adaptability emergence. A model of the continuous agile team innovation process is developed and uncovers the importance of dynamic empowerment states and their temporary equilibria for team adaptability. The underlying findings demonstrate that empowerment is not a static state, but rather emerges through the interactions between various actors. Specifically, the team and its leader engage in both empowerment-enhancing and empowerment-reducing activities. These activities are further influenced by the agile team’s immediate context: Two-fold customer influences, that is, supporting and hindering empowerment interactions, and the organizational environment, that is, undergoing an agile transformation and supportive top management behaviors, play an important role in affecting the empowerment dynamics that result in team adaptability. As such, this study contributes to the innovation and management literatures by revealing the dynamic role of the empowerment and adaptability constructs for agile innovation processes and the importance of various actors and the organizational environment for fostering adaptability. Practical insights are offered to management, teams, and team members on how to create conditions for empowerment dynamics and consequently adaptability to unfold.","Grass, Anastasia;Backmann, Julia;Hoegl, Martin",Journal,Journal of Product Innovation Management,2020-07-01,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München;University College Dublin,
The role of interactive learning in innovation capability building in multinational subsidiaries: A micro-level study of biotechnology in Brazil,"Although multinational enterprises (MNEs) from advanced economies have increasingly internationalised their innovation activities, including R&D, into emerging economies, we have an incomplete understanding of how subsidiaries in these contexts create the technological capabilities to innovate. Based on a single-case qualitative study of a Brazilian subsidiary of a large biotechnology MNE (1989-2016), we found that: (1) the subsidiary's technological capability-building, from production-based to advanced levels (including R&D for applied research), reflects the effectiveness with which it implemented interactive learning strategies through the use of ‘science, technology and innovation’ (STI) and ‘doing, using and interacting’ (DUI) learning mechanisms to tap into three types of knowledge sources: within the subsidiary, the MNE corporate network, and other host sectoral system organisations; (2) the effectiveness of these strategies related to the combined and complementary use of various STI/DUI learning mechanisms over time, which supported the technological capability-building process and, ultimately, the implementation of innovation activities with increased value and novelty. By using a comprehensive and integrative approach to interactive learning, examining how such learning affects the subsidiary's accumulation of innovation capability ‘levels’ and adopting a micro-level perspective in a host emerging economy, we contribute to furthering the understanding of knowledge-seeking strategies and innovation in MNE-subsidiaries, from the standpoint of biotechnology. We also provide a basis for deepening the analysis of interactive learning in subsidiaries in other industries and other emerging economies.","Figueiredo, Paulo N.;Larsen, Henrik;Hansen, Ulrich E.",Journal,Research Policy,2020-07-01,Fundacao Getulio Vargas;Imperial College London;Technical University of Denmark,Biotechnology ;  Brazil ;  Innovation ;  Internationalisation of R&D ;  Learning strategies ;  MNE-subsidiaries ;  Technological capability building
Review of BIM Adoption in the Higher Education of AEC Disciplines,"This Technical Note serves as one of the first review-based studies by analyzing existing trends of incorporating building information modeling (BIM) into the higher education of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)-related disciplines. Assisted by a scientometric review approach, this study identified mainstream journals and conference proceedings publishing BIM educational research outputs and analyzed existing research keywords. The results show that the Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice was ranked as the top journal measured by the number of publications and the total citations received by all articles related to BIM education. However, the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management was the journal with the highest average influence per article despite its small number of publications in BIM education. The keyword analysis through visualized mapping and quantitative analysis revealed that existing BIM educational studies had focused more on construction-related disciplines. Discipline-specific pedagogical activities were reported (e.g., interactive display in construction education), and there had been educational efforts to bridge different AEC disciplines through integrated and collaborative approaches. Several research trends were identified following the keyword analysis, such as the need of incorporating BIM at the program level by extending from a single course (e.g., quantity surveying) and integrating BIM with other digital technologies (e.g., drone). This study reports the state of BIM education literature by providing an overview of the latest trends of adopting BIM in the AEC education.

However, in many cases their design is essentially based on architectural criteria rather than on structural performance mainly because the structure stability does not necessary rely on them. Among nonstructural elements, façades are one of the most visible and expensive components where innovation is very popular. Permeable cable-supported façades are a recent frontage proposal designed to allow not only flexible exterior finishes, but also the flow of natural light and the apparent building transformation according to the daytime and light; however, their structural performance for wind and earthquake loads is still a subject of research. This paper, for the first time, experimentally evaluates the wind and seismic behavior of these type of façades. A five-step comprehensive approach is proposed for the evaluation of cable-supported masonry facades including field and laboratory tests. In the first step, the individual capacity of the connections and materials of the system is evaluated under standardized and non-standardized procedures. The next step consisted in quantifying the fundamental vibration periods and the modal shapes of the façade system including the effect of the border and hanging conditions. The following phase is to estimate the wind load using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In order to understand the effect of the wind at the different scales of the structure, simulations are performed starting with few bricks and progressively increasing the size of the computational model until assessing the entire building. These analyses allow understanding how the micro and macro components distribution and geometry can affect the wind in-and-out-flow and the possibility of vortexes. Then, a full-scale experimental sub-assembly specimen of a representative module of the façade is subjected to uniformly distributed pressures; the setup considered the border conditions, tension loads, and actual materials. Finally, the seismic assessment phase includes a simplified non-linear procedure to calculate critical accelerations at the building roof, and shaking-table tests of full-scale specimens subjected to these demands. The proposed methodology is apply to a case study consisting on a 40-m height permeable façade of the 12-story Santafe Foundation Hospital located in Bogota (Colombia). The main conclusions of this study are: (1) the dynamic properties of the system mainly rely on the cable tensioning and mass of the system; (2) fundamental vibration frequencies of the façade are much higher than wind demands, so no wind-related amplifications are expected; (3) the façade porosity avoids that high wind pressures may be developed; and (4) for design level earthquakes no major damage is expected. Overall, results show an appropriate performance of this type of façades.","Reyes, Juan C.;Correal, Juan F.;Gonzalez-Mancera, Andres;Echeverry, Juan S.;Gómez, Iván D.;Sandoval, Juan D.;Ángel, Christiam C.",Journal,Engineering Structures,2020-07-01,"Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia",Full-scale wind and earthquake testing ;  No-structural components ;  Permeable cable-supported façades ;  Permeable masonry façades ;  Santafe Foundation Hospital
Leveraging preclinical models for the development of Alzheimer disease therapeutics,"A large number of mouse models have been engineered, characterized and used to advance biomedical research in Alzheimer disease (AD). Early models simply damaged the rodent brain through toxins or lesions. Later, the spread of genetic engineering technology enabled investigators to develop models of familial AD by overexpressing human genes such as those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) carrying mutations linked to early-onset AD. Recently, more complex models have sought to explore the impact of multiple genetic risk factors in the context of different biological challenges. Although none of these models has proven to be a fully faithful reproduction of the human disease, models remain essential as tools to improve our understanding of AD biology, conduct thorough pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, discover translatable biomarkers and evaluate specific therapeutic approaches. To realize the full potential of animal models as new technologies and knowledge become available, it is critical to define an optimal strategy for their use. Here, we review progress and challenges in the use of AD mouse models, highlight emerging scientific innovations in model development, and introduce a conceptual framework for use of preclinical models for therapeutic development.","Scearce-Levie, Kimberly;Sanchez, Pascal E.;Lewcock, Joseph W.",Journal,Nature Reviews Drug Discovery,2020-07-01,Denali Therapeutics,
Supported and coordinated single metal site electrocatalysts,"The ever-increasing global environmental and energy crisis issues necessitate technological innovation, especially in the development of renewable energy-related devices, such as electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, including fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and CO2 electrolyzers. Reliable and sustainable energy conversion devices are highly dependent on engineering of electrocatalysts. State-of-the-art electrocatalysts for these electrochemical conversion systems are usually platinum group metal (PGM)-based nanoparticles with high cost, which has sparked intensive research on atomically dispersed single metal site electrocatalysts for decreasing metal loadings and boosting catalytic efficiencies by taking advantage of their inherent electronic effects, quantum size effects, and metal-support interactions. In this review, we first introduce the concept of atomically dispersed single metal site electrocatalysts, including highlighting their key properties and synthesis strategies, followed by a discussion of the mutual metal-support interactions, and most importantly, how these factors correlate with catalytic properties. Next, the advances in synthetic strategies and characterization techniques for single metal site electrocatalysts are highlighted. Recent advances in single metal site electrocatalysts designs for applications in electrochemical conversion reactions are also presented. Finally, remaining challenges and a forward-looking perspective on this field of research are provided.","Shi, Qiurong;Hwang, Sooyeon;Yang, Haipeng;Ismail, Fatma;Su, Dong;Higgins, Drew;Wu, Gang",Journal,Materials Today,2020-07-01,School of Engineering and Applied Sciences;McMaster University;Brookhaven National Laboratory;Shenzhen University,
Engineering a bioprosthetic ovary for fertility and hormone restoration,"There has been an increase in childhood cancer survivors over the past few decades, and with this, an increased awareness of the co-morbidities of the treatment or disease that affect the survivor's quality-of-life. The increased rate of infertility among this patient group and the desire to have biological children voiced by childhood cancer survivors underscores the urgent need for fertility preservation and development of techniques to restore fertility and gonadal hormone function for this population. The ovarian tissue contains a finite source of female gametes that can be transplanted to restore ovarian function and has resulted in over one hundred reported live births. However, the success of biological offspring per ovarian tissue transplant, the reduced lifespan of these transplants, and the potential for these tissues to contain cancer cells from patients with metastatic diseases supports the need for improved options. One innovation that could improve ovarian transplantation is the development of a bioprosthetic ovary comprised of a 3D printed scaffold with isolated ovarian follicles. A murine bioprosthetic ovary restored ovarian hormones in ovariectomized mice, which also gave birth to healthy offspring. Research is ongoing to create the next iteration of the scaffold that would support ovarian follicles from large animal models and humans with the hopes of translating this technology for patients.","Laronda, Monica M.",Journal,Theriogenology,2020-07-01,Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,Bioprosthetic ovary ;  Fertility preservation ;  Oncofertility ;  Ovary
Assessing the Translation of Research and Innovation into Dental Practice,"Introduction: Over the past 100 y, there have been an unprecedented number of innovations that have improved oral health and functioning. Variations in lag times between discovery and clinical adoption are related to dentist education, the clinical availability of technology, and the perceived value of an innovation. Objectives: The purposes of this cross-sectional study were 1) catalogue research discoveries and innovations over the past 30 y and 2) from that list identify those which practicing dentists believe have maximally affected patient care. Methods: Thirty International Association for Dental Research leaders identified innovations over the past 30 y that have significantly affected dental care. The 30 most cited innovations were included in a questionnaire that was sent to a random sample of US dentists who graduated dental school during or before 1995 (before the recency of identified discoveries) and devoted ≥50% of their time to patient care. Eighty-two percent of respondents identified as general dentists and 18% as specialists. Respondents were asked to identify 5 to 7 items whose loss would have the most adverse effects on patient care. Results: The most cited advances were adhesive dental materials (74.5%), dental implants (71.9%), direct bonding systems (71.2%), dental loupes (54.7%), universal precautions for infection control (48.6%), and digital imaging (46.0%). There were differences in the ranking of responses between generalists and specialists. For the oral surgeons and periodontists (OMSPER, n = 51), top choices were dental implants (82%), cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging (74%), regenerative dentistry and tissue engineering (68%), universal precautions (58%), digital imaging (56%), and dental loupes (48%). Conclusions: There was agreement among generalists and specialists about the importance of dental implants, digital imaging, use of dental loupes, and universal precautions in improving patient care. However, generalists also cited the importance of adhesive dental materials and bonding, and OMSPER cited CBCT and biological-based tissue restoration as major advances. Knowledge Transfer Statement: Many advances in dental patient care capitalize on innovations and technologies that have emerged after dentists graduate from dental school. Adoption of new technologies is influenced by information acquired from professional journals, continuing education, industry marketing activities, and interactions with colleagues. The results of this study suggest that innovations that are directly related to clinical procedures were rated most impactful. Future research should consider cost-effectiveness and patient perceptions on the impact of innovations and technologies.","Heft, M. W.;Fox, C. H.;Duncan, R.

Innovation and active learning for training mobile app developers,"The mobile market is growing every year, creating a demand for mission-critical and innovative enterprises, and personal applications. This demand implies the need for skills training necessary for students to enter the professional development market. The Innovation, Development and Teaching in Complex Software Environments approach (IDEAS) was developed for the training of mobile developers to meet this need, through an innovative process for student selection, training through the active methodology Challenge Based Learning, software production, and startups creation. The approach was created through action-research applied during two cycles of a real project in a university environment, where 398 students applied for the first cycle, of which 110 were selected, and 900 applied for the second cycle, of which 100 were selected. We undertook evaluations with students and teachers through periodic reflections, questionnaires, and interviews at the end of each cycle. Some of the positive results included the prominence of 125 professional-looking apps that were finalized and published, report of dropout reduction and disapproval in the programming courses and experience in entrepreneurship and pre-acceleration startup program.","Binder, Fabio Vinicius;Albuquerque, Regina;Reinehr, Sheila;Malucelli, Andreia",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,2020-06-27,Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná,Active Learning ;  Challenge Based Learning ;  Mobile Development ;  Programming Learning ;  Programming Teaching
Software Development at the German Aerospace Center: Role and Status in Practice,"Software is an important innovation factor and an integral part of modern research. However, researchers are often faced with challenges in developing software because they do not have the necessary education and skills. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) established its software engineering initiative in 2005 to enable researchers to better meet these challenges. Continuous adaption and improvement of the supportive measures of the initiative require a good understanding of the current role and practice of software development at DLR. Therefore, we conducted a DLR-wide survey on research software development at DLR at the end of 2018. In this paper, we present the results of this survey and identify possible improvements of the software engineering initiative activities. 773 DLR employees completed our survey and provided information about their academic background, programming experience, and software development practices. The results show that software development is a very relevant topic among the researchers at DLR but also a lack of applying software development best practices. Based on these results we conclude to further enhance the practical focus of our support activities as well as to raise the awareness for these practices to bring them into the daily work of DLR researchers.","Von Kurnatowski, Lynn;Schlauch, Tobias;Haupt, Carina",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops, ICSEW 2020",2020-06-27,Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR),data set ;  DLR ;  research software ;  survey
Towards a Topology for Legacy System Migration,Dealing with legacy systems is a decade old industry challenge. The pressure to efficiently modernise legacy both to meet new business requirements and to mitigate inherent risks is ever growing. Our experience shows a lack of collaboration between researchers and practitioners inhibiting innovation in the field. To facilitate communication between academia and industry and as a byproduct to obtain an up to date picture of the state of affairs we are creating a legacy system migration topology based on generalisations from a multi-case study as well as extensive literature research. We expect the topology to be useful in connecting industry needs and challenges with current and potential future research and to improve bidirectional accessibility.,"Strobl, Stefan;Bernhart, Mario;Grechenig, Thomas",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops, ICSEW 2020",2020-06-27,Technische Universität Wien,academia industry collaboration ;  academia industry communication ;  legacy system migration ;  reengineering
On value creation in developer relations (DevRel): A practitioners' perspective,"Software Ecosystem (SECO) comprises third-party developers cooperating and competing when contributing to a platform provided by a central organization (keystone). A keystone has invested in a Developer Relations (DevRel) internal team as a global business strategy to attract and engage a critical mass of third-party developers in producing and evolving contributions. For this reason, the DevRel team should promote social relationships among SECO actors and synergy among keystone' goals and developers' expectations. It can help to establish and sustain a competitive value creation network (VCN) within a SECO that must survive to inherit changes. However, it is still a challenge the way DevRel team can act on a SECO to better engage the developers' communities aiming to establish a robust VCN. In this paper, we advance on investigating the perceptions of 31 DevRel practitioners from large, medium and small-size companies based on seven countries about value creation in DevRel. We found 55 elements of value creation distributed in retention, efficiency, innovation, and complementarity. Based on our analysis, we contribute with a set of seven insights (feedback loop, loyalty program, roadmap enhancement, technical training, processes restructuring, innovative products, cost reducing) and a DevRel VCN that involves elements, suppliers and consumers. It fosters a common perspective for DevRel practitioners, keystones and researchers for designing strategies and a research roadmap.","Fontão, Awdren;Cleger-Tamayo, Sergio;Wiese, Igor;Santos, Rodrigo Pereira Dos;Dias-Neto, Arilo Claudio",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 ACM/IEEE 15th International Conference on Global Software Engineering, ICGSE 2020",2020-06-26,Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro;Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná;Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul;Universidade Federal do Amazonas;Samsung SIDIA,developer relations ;  software ecosystem ;  value creation

Review of research issues and challenges of maturity models concerning industry 4.0,"Over the years, technological developments and innovation in the area of manufacturing have evolved which is known as industry 4.0(I4.0), and has increased the consideration of all the researchers, enterprises and countries. Manufacturing enterprises are facing manifold challenges arising due to their internal and external situations. Similarly, choices have to be made among various available disruptive technologies, like IoT (Internet of Things), CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) and cloud-based production. Thus, the need of the hour for manufacturing enterprise is to understand Industry 4.0, subsequently, it is necessary to assist the manufacturing enterprises to assess their Industry 4.0 preparedness. German's National Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech) has developed Industry 4.0 Maturity Assessment for establishing manufacturing enterprises Industry 4.0 maturity and identifying areas where actions are required to realize higher maturity stage in implementation of Industry 4.0. In this article, a review of literature is made to comprehend the concept of Industry 4.0, and with focus on maturity models. Furthermore, the articles discuss the challenges, research gaps between the current status of manufacturing and I4.0. The findings of this review article may be the basis for understanding the challenges and designing a maturity model considering various dimensions of I4.0.","Vijaya Kumar, N.;Karadgi, Sachin;Kotturshettar, B.

The spatial structure of urban residents' quality of life in Changzhou based on residential environment,"After the release of the Sixth Census Data, more research results have been achieved about the socio-spatial structure in urban China based on the method of factor ecology analysis. However, methodological innovation needs to be promoted. In this paper, combining census data with big data, with the aid of the methods of grid processing and calculation of accessibility of public service facilities, the authors try to interpret the quality of life of urban residents from both the internal and the external environments of residence, and to reveal the relationship between the spatial structure of quality of life and the socio-economic status of urban residents. Taking Changzhou City of Jiangsu province as a case study, first of all, the authors extract the housing data from the Sixth Census, and the data of facilities from the urban POI data of Baidu maps. And then, factor analysis, cluster analysis, accessibility analysis and other methods are used to identify the spatial structure of urban residents' quality of life and reveal some characteristics of urban social space from the viewpoint of socio-spatial dialectic. The results suggest that the spatial structure of the quality of life of residents in Changzhou based on residential environment shows a clear pattern of overlap between the circular structure and the fan-shaped one. In addition, there is a spatial coupling between the spatial structure of urban residents' quality of life and their socioeconomic attributes, that is, residents with different social and economic attributes have some differences in their quality of life. The formation of an interactive relationship between these two aspects is the result of a combination of administrative, market and spatial factors, which may lead to overcrowding in the old city, fire safety problems in living and production buildings, traffic congestion problems caused by tidal commuting, social isolation, unreasonable distribution of public service facilities, and other socio-spatial effects. Its enlightenment for urban planning and management lies in the following aspects including the dispersal of the old city, focusing on fire safety in certain areas, perfecting the transportation links between central and peripheral areas, preventing the emergence of social isolation in the high-tech zones, and improving the public service facilities in rural areas.","Feng, Jian;Zhong, Yichun",Journal,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,2020-06-25,Peking University;Beijing Tsinghua Tongheng Urban Planning & Design Institute,Accessibility ;  Changzhou ;  POI data ;  Quality of life ;  Urban spatial structure
Progress on renewable synthetic fuels,"Since ancient times, energy has powered the development and transformation of human society. Every great progress of mankind has been accompanied by the improvement of energy utilization efficiency. In 2018, global energy consumption has reached 13.9 billion tons of crude oil equivalent, of which the proportion of fossil fuels is as high as 84.7%. Excessive exploitation of fossil fuels has led to energy shortage. On the other hand, utilization of fossil fuels has caused massive emission of pollutants such as carbon dioxide, SOx, NOx and heavy metals, which have raised serious environmental issues such as global warming, air pollution and seawater acidification. It is an urgent challenge to secure clean alternative fuel sources to ensure sustainable development of human society. In June 2019, the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) released twenty crucial scientific and engineering problems which are keys to technological and industrial innovation, among which renewable synthetic fuels production is considered as one of crucial problems. It states ""use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and biomass to convert carbon dioxide to synthetic fuel molecules suitable for efficient and clean combustion, achieving the molecular conversion CO2+H2O→CxHy and producing synthetic fuels such as methane, alcohol-ether fuels, alkane diesel, and aviation fuels"". There are a number of options for converting renewable energy sources to a variety of synthetic fuels; however, the optimal pathway for such a process has not yet to be defined. Synthetic fuels may be derived from direct routes such as electrochemical synthesis and photocatalysis with direct catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide. Alternatively, synthetic fuels can be sourced from indirect routes via biomass accumulation and conversion process. It is well known that photosynthesis, which is a multi-step process combing light and dark reactions catalyzed by enzymes and usually takes place in land-based plants and aquatic algae, offers a green route for carbon dioxide fixation whilst producing oxygen and accumulating organic materials such as glucose polymers in term of biomass. Biomass can be converted to synthetic fuels either via biological fermentation by microbes and enzymes under an ambient temperature and pressure within a few hours to days, or via thermal conversion with or without catalysts under a high temperature within a few seconds to minutes. In the middle of the 19th century, exploring renewable synthetic fuels was established by human beings via anaerobic digestion of biomass to produce biogas (methane-rich gaseous fuel). After over 160 years of development, various routes were proposed to produce multiple types of renewable synthetic fuels. This paper reviews the developments in synthetic fuels production from renewable energy sources, with the main focus on photocatalysis, electrochemical synthesis, thermochemical conversion and microbial conversion pathways. The progress and challenges of use of renewable energy for converting carbon dioxide to various synthetic gaseous and liquid fuels, such as methane, alcohol-ether fuels, alkane diesel, and aviation fuels, are summarized and discussed. The future trends and research directions are also highlighted. This paper may offer some ideas and guidelines for clean and sustainable energy supply in the future.","Xia, Ao;Chen, Rong;Fu, Qian;Zhu, Xianqing;Zhu, Xun;Liao, Qiang",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2020-06-25,Chongqing University,Electrochemical synthesis ;  Fuel ;  Microbial conversion ;  Photocatalysis ;  Renewable energy ;  Thermochemical conversion

STEAM education: student learning and transferable skills,"Purpose: Globally, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary learning in schools has become an increasingly popular and growing area of interest for educational reform. This prompts discussions about Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM), which is shifting educational paradigms toward art integration in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Authentic tasks (i.e. real-world problems) address complex or multistep questions and offer opportunities to integrate disciplines across science and arts, such as in STEAM. The main purpose of this study is to better understand the STEAM instructional programs and student learning offered by nonprofit organizations and by publicly funded schools in Ontario, Canada. Design/methodology/approach: This study addresses the following research question: what interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary skills do students learn through different models of STEAM education in nonprofit and in-school contexts? We carried out a qualitative case study in which we conducted interviews, observations and data analysis of curriculum documents. A total of 103 participants (19 adults – director and instructors/teachers – and 84 students) participated in the study. The four STEAM programs comparatively taught both discipline specific and beyond discipline character-building skills. The skills taught included: critical thinking and problem solving; collaboration and communication; and creativity and innovation. Findings: The main findings on student learning focused on students developing perseverance and adaptability, and them learning transferable skills. Originality/value: In contrast to other research on STEAM, this study identifies both the enablers and the tensions. Also, we stress ongoing engagement with stakeholders (focus group), which has the potential to impact change in teaching and teacher development, as well as in related policies.","Bertrand, Marja G.;Namukasa, Immaculate K.",Journal,Journal of Research in Innovative Teaching and Learning,2020-06-24,Western University,21st century skills ;  Art integration ;  Art-based curriculum ;  Domain-general skills ;  Integrated curriculum ;  STEAM ;  STEAM and Canada ;  STEM and arts ;  STEM and creativity ;  Transdisciplinary ;  Transferrable skills ;  Workplace skills
Influences for engineering majors: Results of a survey from a major research university,"Engineers are critical to sustain and increase the innovation needed to solve U.S. and world problems. Of the fastest-growing jobs, 75% are based in science and mathematics, particularly with an engineering focus. But the U.S. is still short of qualified engineers to fill the jobs available. As part of the effort to increase the engineering pipeline, this paper explores the influences that are important in college students' decision to become engineering majors. Social cognitive career theory developed by Xeuli Wang (2013) is the basis of the study. According to this model, an individual's decision to choose a STEM major is affected by a variety of high school experiences, determined largely by prior mathematics success. Those experiences are important in determining the individual's goals and interests. In other words, an individual's background and participation in certain activities affect their learning experiences, and subsequently their self-efficacy, and eventually their career choices. A survey about influences on their decisions to major in engineering was completed by 251 students at a major research university. Possible influences were categorized by type (e.g., informal activities/camps, formal schooling, standardized test scores, success/abilities in STEM courses, social, job opportunities). The survey was a 4-level Likert scale (0 = Not applicable, 1 = None at all, 2 = A little, 3 = A moderate amount, and 4 = A great deal) on which participants were asked how much a given factor influenced their decision. After answering questions about these influences, students were then asked to rank the factors in order of the level of influence. Descriptive statistics, particularly frequency tables, were used to determine the importance of the various factors. Findings include the following: 1) The greatest informal STEM influence was after school programs, as opposed to other opportunities such as summer activities or camps. 2) Of the students who said formal schooling had an influence, the most important was the teacher and student success in the course with 50.8% indicating their science teacher had a 'great deal of influence and 60.5% that their success in science had a 'great deal of influence. 3) Technology class's greatest effects were hands-on experiences, success in the courses, and the teacher. 4) Of students who had pre-engineering or engineering classes, 56.8% said those classes had a moderate influence on their decisions to major in engineering; and 5) The greatest influences in pre-engineering or engineering classes were hands-on experiences and the teacher. Clearly, three factors were important for engineering majors in their science, technology, and engineering classes: hands-on experiences, great teachers, and student success in the class. Many dynamics affect students' major choices, and understanding some of these may be helpful in fostering interest through these influences. This study shows that teachers and their provisions for hands-on experiences are important for engineering majors in one major university. If replication in other places finds agreement, university faculty can help K-12 teachers increase such opportunities.","Nite, Sandra B.;Rice, Devyn Chae;Tejani, Rayan",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Texas A&M University;Allen Academy,
Understanding context: Propagation and effectiveness of the concept warehouse in mechanical engineering at five diverse institutions and beyond - Results from year 1,"Several consensus reports cite a critical need to dramatically increase the number and diversity of STEM graduates over the next decade. They conclude that a change to evidence-based instructional practices, such as concept-based active learning, is needed. Concept-based active learning involves the use of activity-based pedagogies whose primary objectives are to make students value deep conceptual understanding (instead of only factual knowledge) and then to facilitate their development of that understanding. Concept-based active learning has been shown to increase academic engagement and student achievement, to significantly improve student retention in academic programs, and to reduce the performance gap of underrepresented students. Fostering students' mastery of fundamental concepts is central to real world problem solving, including several elements of engineering practice. Unfortunately, simply proving that these instructional practices are more effective than traditional methods is not enough to ensure widespread pedagogical change. In fact, the biggest challenge to improving STEM education is not the need to develop more effective instructional practices, but to find ways to get faculty to adopt the evidence-based pedagogies that already exist. In this project we seek to propagate the Concept Warehouse (CW), a technological innovation designed to foster concept-based active learning, into Mechanical Engineering (ME) and to study student learning with this tool in five diverse institutional settings. The CW is a web-based instructional tool that we developed for Chemical Engineering (ChE) faculty. It houses nearly 3,000 ConcepTests, which are short questions that can rapidly be deployed to engage students in concept-oriented thinking and/or to assess students' conceptual knowledge, along with more extensive concept-based active learning tools. The CW has grown rapidly over the last four years (around 1,200 faculty accounts and 30,000 student users). We propose to expand use of the CW into mechanics and ME and thereby impact 50,000 students during this project. Although the current CW content is discipline-specific, the functions are generic and readily transferable to other engineering disciplines as content is developed. To date, our Statics and our Dynamics Teams have developed 107 and 105 new ConcepTests, respectively. Question development and categorization has included a framework developed by Beatty et al. (2006), and includes utilizing Content, Process, and Epistemological Goals for each question. Beta testing with students is currently being conducted, and includes questions on both clarity and on educational effectiveness. Our goal is to create 150 ConcepTests in each subject by the time of the conference. Twelve instructors from the partner schools have been recruited to help us study how context affects the adoption of the Concept Warehouse. These Phase I participants were asked to use the CW to deploy a Concept Inventory, and were then interviewed to examine the instructors' perceptions of their institutional and learning context and their histories and beliefs. Phase II participants will be asked to deploy ConceptTests within their classrooms, and site visits will be conducted for additional interviews, classroom visits, and student focus groups. These will be used in conjunction with institutional context at five very different schools (a large research public university, a small private university, a 2-year college serving a large number of underrepresented students, a large non-PhD granting public university, and a bilingual research university) to determine the conditions that are most supportive of adopting educational innovations.","Self, Brian P.;Dal Bello, Dominic J.;Koretsky, Milo;Nolen, Susan Bobbitt;Papadopoulos, Christopher;Prince, Michael J.;Widmann, James M.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,"Universidad de Puerto Rico;Bucknell University;Oregon State University;California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo;University of Washington;Allan Hancock College",
WIP Introducing design thinking in first-year engineering education,"Our initial Work in Progress student research suggests today's engineering student sometimes choose engineering as a profession that can make a difference in the world. They see it as providing them an education that will enable them to join a profession that has substantial social purpose which is congruent with their values and goals. This student aspiration conforms to one of the basic tenets of design thinking in that it is a methodology that imbues the full spectrum of innovation with a human-centered design ethos. At our university we have started to infuse the concepts of design thinking in our initial Introduction to Engineering course and then later in our capstone senior design project courses. Between those course bookends we are working with our faculty to introduce to them the design thinking concept of identifying the need in place of only teaching transactional engineering concepts and theories and how to solve engineering problems. This paper will illustrate how we have introduced design thinking in our first-year introduction to engineering course and then conducted indirect assessment of our students' learning outcomes for the course for the purpose of continuous improvement. The indirect study results were obtained by an anonymous survey given to over several hundred freshman engineering students who are matriculating in a wide range of undergraduate engineering and engineering technology programs. One of our key findings was that about 82% of students agreed that Design Thinking was a valuable learning experience. Further, 93% of students agreed that having a basic understanding of Design Thinking will be of assistance to them as they pursue their engineering education. After being informed by students that one of the two design thinking projects had a relatively low value with regard to providing future assistance to them as they pursued their engineering education we substituted that project with a choice of 6 projects that we believe will be more favorably appreciated by the students. At the completion of the modified course we will survey the students again to see if there are further opportunities for continuous improvement of the course.","Sadeghipour, Keyanoush;Brookstein, David;Fagan, Shawn;Budischak, Cory",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,College of Engineering;Temple University,
Factors influencing the performance of scientific and technological innovation in Chinese universities: Evidence from fsQCA,"In the process of modernization, Chinese universities play an important role in the innovation and development of scientific research. In 2015, the Chinese government vigorously promoted the construction of world-class universities, raising the overall level of scientific and technological innovation in Chinese universities. Existing researches and policies only focus on the impact of a single academic condition on the performance of scientific and technological innovation in universities, and lack of a holistic approach. This study aims to explore the factors influencing the performance of science and technology innovation in Chinese universities, obtain the necessary conditional variables and allocation factors, and provide policy Suggestions for the development of higher education and scientific research in China in the new era through empirical research. Therefore, the research question of this paper is: ï¼ˆ1ï¼‰what are the comprehensive factors that affect the performance of scientific and technological innovation in universities? ï¼ˆ 2 ï¼‰ From the perspective of policy formulation, how should universities improve the performance of scientific and technological innovation? Firstly, on the basis of literature research, condition variables are listed as references. Secondly, resource dependence theory is used to establish a model, and descriptive variables are selected according to university types, human capital resources and academic resources. Thirdly, according to the model, the data of 42 world-class universities in China are analyzed. Finally, according to the factors of output allocation, seven paths influencing the scientific and technological innovation performance of Chinese universities are classified, and policy Suggestions are put forward to improve the scientific and technological innovation performance. The article comes to the following conclusion: 1. From the development experience of Chinese universities, engineering advantage universities or comprehensive universities tend to focus on academic papers in order to achieve higher scientific and technological innovation performance 2. China's leading engineering universities have more strategic combinations and less dependence on a single resource element. 3. Engineering advantage universities need to focus on adjusting the allocation of human capital resources, while comprehensive universities need to fully guarantee academic resources, avoid dependence on a single resource element, and realize ""multiple equilibrium"" of resource allocation.","Zhou, Xiangyu;Wei, Lina;Zhang, Wei",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Zhejiang University,
"If engineers solve problems, why are there still so many problems to solve?: Getting beyond technicalsolutions in the classroom","This Evidence-Based Practice Paper describes implementation and assessment of an exercise bringing international perspectives, liberal arts, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals into a first-year engineering program - challenging the arbitrary boundary between engineering and the liberal arts. First-year engineering students (Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical) participated in a role-playing game recreating the 2009 United Nations Climate Talks in Copenhagen, Denmark. The exercise is part of a series of published games called Reacting to the Past (RTTP), with the purpose of engaging students to enhance their understanding of a given event or topic, while improving their research and communication skills. In this case, the further goal was for students to broaden their understanding of the technical aspects of climate change, as well as the political and social reasons that technological solutions are not always implemented, despite the best intentions and technical knowledge. Students practiced researching a topic, selecting and evaluating resources, proper citation of works used, written and oral communication, and advancing a position in a professional manner. These skills, while crucial for practicing engineers, are often relatively weak in incoming students. Our initial success integrating international perspectives and traditional liberal arts concepts into a first-year engineering course was supported by several classroom innovations, including a classroom-embedded librarian and gamification. Benefits of this activity in the first-year classroom include: - Getting students to interact with each other in a substantive way, strengthening the cohort, and supporting retention. - Providing structure for learning library, writing, and presentation skills, etc. - Introducing how professionals handle concepts of politics, tact, and negotiating across boundaries. - Providing an experiential learning environment to understand how politics, both personal and professional, can interact with technical solutions, leading to improvement or disruption in the lives of all. - Starting a discussion about United Nations Sustainable Development Goals early in the careers of engineering students. Certainly, students will see these concepts again; there are multiple group projects and research projects in their time at our school, as well as courses on ethics and professionalism. However, introducing these concepts in their first semester prepares students for future courses, and helps them understand that engineering is not just problem sets and robotics.","Carlson, Cynthia Helen;Wong, Catherine Woodworth",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Merrimack College,
To start or not: Impact of engineering students' engagement in entrepreneurship competitive activities on their entrepreneurial intentions,"An increased number of technological innovation and entrepreneurial competitive activities have been organized in engineering schools and beyond to raise students' entrepreneurial awareness and cultivate relevant skills. In this study, a mixed method research based on Planned Behavior Theory is being used to explore the outcomes of innovation and entrepreneurial competitions, in particular the influence of engaging in these competitive activities on engineering students' entrepreneurial intention. This work-in-progress first reports the construction of a customized survey, in particular the process of identifying the specific activities in the context of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions that may be relevant when exploring students' entrepreneurial intention. Next, the report proposes hypotheses of possible pathways of how the constructs of PBT may have an impact on engineering students' entrepreneurial intention for later verification.","Huang, Yaxin;Zhu, Jiabin;Zhang, Zhinan",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,
A scalable approach to student team formation for innovation based learning,"We present a distributed, scalable, student-driven method for both defining a set of projects and subsequently assigning students to project teams. This process has been implemented within a mixed online/in-person multi-university course comprised of both undergraduate and graduate level students who are predominantly, but not exclusively, pursuing engineering degrees. Our Innovation Based Learning (IBL) course seeks to provide students with maximum freedom and responsibility for their own learning; we seek to radically rethink and reduce the organizational tasks normally performed by the instructor. Re-assigning these tasks to the students creates new opportunities to learn soft skills such as giving an elevator pitch, project management, market research, and online collaboration. Key technology enablers used in this process are: Flipgrid for sharing short videos, and a Slack channel for both one-to-one and group chat. All projects are defined and proposed by the students. We teach market needs analysis, and jump-start student brainstorming, by requiring that each proposal relate to a Federal Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Student-proposed projects also ensure that each semester's mix of projects addresses the unique set of backgrounds/interests of that student cohort. By increasing student autonomy in the formation of working groups, we increase student motivation for their topic and team. One concern with this distributed process is speed; will it take too long to crowd-source ideas and self-assemble teams? Using new digital platforms, individual student project proposals are created and reviewed entirely outside of class meeting times. Grouping students into teams is also a student-driven activity which requires minimal instructor intervention or in-class overhead. We will share considerations, surprises, and lessons-learned from this process as it has been employed and refined, over multiple years, within a multi-university IBL course. A step-by-step implementation guide is provided for others wishing to emulate the process.","Striker, Ryan;Vazquez, Enrique Alvarez;Pearson, Mary;Singelmann, Lauren;Swartz, Ellen M.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,NDSU College of Engineering,
"Nascent professional identity development in freshman architecture, engineering, and construction women","Increasing the persistence of talented women into male-dominated architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) professions could reduce prevailing workforce shortages and improve gender diversity in AEC industry. Identity theorists advocate that professional identity development (PID) improves students' persistence to become professionals. However, little empirical research exists to inform and guide AEC educators and professionals on AEC-PID in undergraduate AEC women. As the preliminary part of a larger nationwide and longitudinal research study investigating PID processes in undergraduate AEC women, the objective of this research is to examine the characteristics and nascent AEC-PID in 69 women enrolled in freshman AEC courses in five U.S. institutions. A purposive sampling approach ensures participants have a wide range of demographic characteristics. Data from a recruitment survey is analyzed using the NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Content and relational inductive open coding are conducted vertically for each participant and horizontally across different participants. Results indicate passion/interest, inherent abilities, significant others, benefits from industry, and desire to contribute to industry influence decisions to pursue AEC careers. With 52% of participants having science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) subject preferences, an in vivo code, Perfect Middle Ground, demonstrated the quest to combine STEM and visual art preferences in AEC career decisions. A participant noted that 'this major (civil engineering) is the perfect middle ground because I can be creative, but still use my strong gift which happens to be math'. Girls with STEAM strengths and passion, particularly in math and fine art, are most likely to develop nascent AEC-PID. Beyond STEM pre-college programs, AEC educators should consider recruiting from sports, as well as visual and performing arts events for pre-college students. Participants' positive views focus on the importance and significant societal impact of the AEC industry; while, negative views focus on the lack of gender and racial diversity. A combination of participants' AEC professional experiences and views reveal four increasing levels of nascent AEC-PID which are categorized as the 4Ps: Plain, Passive, Progressive, and Proactive. As a guide to AEC education and professional communities, recommendations are made to increase the AEC-PID of women in each category. With the highest nascent AEC-PID, women in the Proactive category should serve as leaders in AEC classrooms and student organizations. Considering their AEC professional experience and enthusiasm, they should serve as peer mentors to other students, particularly AEC women. Furthermore, they should be given the opportunity to step into more complex roles during internships and encouraged to pursue co-op opportunities. Insights can guide more targeted recruitment, mentoring, preparation, and retention interventions that strengthen the persistence of the next generation of AEC women professionals. In the long term, this could reduce AEC workforce shortages, improve gender diversity, and foster the innovation and development of more gender friendly AEC products and services.","Ofori-Boadu, Andrea Nana;Ofori-Boadu, Victor;Vanderpool, Jacob Randall;Deng, Dongyang",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University;Penuel Consult Inc,
Undergraduate summer research in high performance computing with engineering applications: An experience report,"High Performance Computing (HPC) stands at the forefront of engineering innovation. With affordable and advanced HPC resources more readily accessible than ever before, computational simulation of complex physical phenomena becomes an increasingly attractive strategy to predict the physical behavior of diverse engineered systems. Furthermore, novel applications of HPC in engineering are highly interdisciplinary, requiring advanced skills in mathematical modeling, algorithm development as well as programming skills for parallel, distributed and concurrent architectures and environments. Reasons such as this have created a shortage of qualified workforce to conduct the much-needed research and development in these areas. This paper describes our experience with mentoring a cohort of ten high achieving undergraduate students in Summer 2019 to conduct engineering HPC research for ten weeks in Clarkson University. Our mentoring activity was informed and motivated by an initial informal study with the goal to learn the roles and status of HPC in engineering research and what can be improved to make more effective use of it. Through a combination of email surveys, in-person interviews, and an analysis of faculty research profiles in Clarkson University, we learn several characteristics of their research. First, a large proportion of the engineering faculty conducts research that is highly mathematical and computational and driven by disciplinary sciences, where simulation and HPC are widely needed as solutions. Second, due to the lack of resources to provide the necessary training in software development to their students, the interviewed engineering groups are limited in their ability to fully leverage HPC capability in their research. Therefore, novel pathways for training and educating engineering researchers in HPC software development must be explored in order to further advance the engineering research capability in HPC. With a three-year support from NSF, our summer research mentoring activities were able to accommodate per year ten high-achieving undergraduate students recruited from across the USA and their faculty mentors on the theme of HPC applications in engineering research. In this experience report, we describe our first offering of the site in summer 2019, including the processes of students recruitment and selection, training and engagement, research mentoring, and professional development for the students. Best practices and lessons learned are identified and summarized based on our own observations and the evaluation conducted by an independent evaluator. In particular, improvements are being planned so as to deliver a more holistic and rigorous research experience for future cohorts.","Hou, Daqing;Liu, Yu",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Clarkson University,
Research initiation: Enhancing the learning outcomes of empathic innovation in biomedical engineering senior design projects,"One of the aims of biomedical engineering is to facilitate the development of innovative technologies to address socioeconomic challenges in healthy living and independent aging. Realizing such innovations requires empathy, agility, and creativity. This project aims to support the professional development of a competent biomedical engineer workforce that can effectively accomplish emphatic innovation, and one that can frame and re-frame problems through the innovation process. Our research examined how engineering students empathize with users and develop empathic abilities that have implications on their design innovation skills. The project team developed empathic innovation workshops and embedded them into existing biomedical engineering capstone courses. Data were collected using surveys, student project reports, ideation tasks, and observations. These workshops resulted in significant changes in students' emphatic tendencies. From our qualitative studies, we also conjectured that the overall empathic potency of a student design team helped facilitate problem re-framing based on user input. These findings contribute to the literature on the critical role of innovation behaviors in relationship to empathic design tendencies in the context of biomedical engineering, as well as suggest instructional practices designed to promote empathy, agility, and creativity.","Kong, Nan;Purzer, Senay;Payne, Lindsey B.;Kim, Eunhye;Vivas-Valencia, Carolina",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,College of Engineering;Purdue University,
Undergraduate students as visiting students in the UK,"In this work-in-progress paper, we discuss our NSF-supported program designed to select, mentor, and send U.S. undergraduate students in electrical power engineering to the University of Strathclyde in the U.K. during summer to engage in research projects and research-related activities. We discuss the program need, logistics, design, and evaluation results. Each year, six new students participate in the program; they are selected via a nation-wide competition. Our primary motivation for this program is to provide students with experience in international research and help prepare the next generation of U.S. competitive STEM workforce capable of innovation. Moreover, the students will develop soft skills such as teamwork, oral and written communication, and time management. Since the operating parameters of the electric grid (e.g., frequency and voltage levels) are different in Europe from those in North America, the students will also gain a firsthand experience of different practices in distribution and transmission systems. The research performed under this program helps achieve the smart grid vision through a combination of technological advances and workforce training. Ultimately, this research will increase the utilization of smart grid infrastructure by integrating distributed renewable energy resources. Our preliminary evaluation results show that overall student participants were very satisfied with how the program is set up, designed, and run, giving an average score of 4.7 out of 5: 100% of scholars said they would consider graduate school after attending this program, and pointed to its catalyzing role. Students appreciated the international experience; for all of them, it was their first time living in a foreign country for an extended time. For more than half, this was also the first time to Europe; 90% of scholars said knowing what they know now, they would participate in the program again, citing hands-on research experience, learning about the culture, learning how others solve their power needs, and availability of PhD students to help them as the highlights of the program. We have received applications from 17 states, and 8 of 16 scholars were female, providing evidence for the effectiveness of our advertisement and minority recruitment plans.","Mehrizi-Sani, Ali;Liu, Chen Ching;McArthur, Stephen",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;University of Strathclyde,
Investing in the future: Bringing research and industry into simulation-based manufacturing education,"Manufacturing makes tremendous contributions to the economy as it increases gross domestic product and exports, creates high-paying jobs, generates meaningful return on investment, and supports many other sectors. The future of manufacturing depends on preparing younger generations for innovation and skill-intensive jobs through Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) programs. However, there is a dearth of manufacturing presence in the current curricular content as most STEM high school and community college educators do not have training in manufacturing concepts and likely have not worked in the modern manufacturing industry. An effective way of bringing manufacturing to the curriculum is to include simulation and automation hands-on experimentation. This paper presents the second year of an ongoing Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site in Manufacturing Simulation and Automation. The objectives of the program are to 1) improve instructors' research and professional skills, and 2) help them translate the cutting-edge manufacturing research to their classrooms by creating and implementing new curricula. This will stimulate students' interest in the topic and strengthen manufacturing education.","Aqlan, Faisal;Dunsworth, Qi;Resig, Jessica",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Penn State Behrend,
The new engineering education in chinabased on 207 new engineering research and practice projects,"Under the background of accelerating new industrial revolution, China's higher engineering education is in urgent need of cultivating a group of innovative talents in engineering science and technology. In order to improve the quality of engineering education, China proposed the ""New Engineering Research and Practice Project"" in June 2017. This study attempts to conduct a system review based on the 207 projects of the top engineering universities in China's New Engineering Research and Practice Project. It discovered the common key issues such as mechanism, ability, and discipline issues that are raised in the existing projects, in the meanwhile discussed how to meet industry demand in the process of new engineering construction. The research findings are as following: (1) The commonness of programs' schemes is emerging. In terms of mechanism construction, the mechanism of collaborative education receives the most attention, while the cultivation of soft ability and engineering innovation ability are focused most in terms of the talent ability; (2) Most of the construction plans are aimed at the transformation of traditional disciplines, and there is little construction of corresponding disciplines for national key industries such as energy conservation, environmental protection and new materials; (3) The overall design of the project somewhat lacks innovation and features, and certain construction schemes are similar with minor differences, failing to effectively combine the advantages of universities and disciplines to serve local industries and truly show its characteristics.","Shen, Jinlu;Li, Tuoyu",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Zhejiang University,
Early engineering experience (E3) initiative,"This Work in Progress paper details an initiative designed to broaden exposure and attract increased interest in the study of engineering of a minority-serving institution (MSI) with a plurality of races represented. The University's student population where this initiative is being implemented consists of 26.2% African American and 6% that identify with two or more races. In contrast, the College of Engineering in this University is 20% African American; the freshmen class makes up 6.3% of this figure. By USDOE standards, this characterization is indicative of a predominantly white institution (PWI). According to the Bureau of Labor Statics, underrepresented minorities (URMs) are critical to not only fulfilling the growing need for STEM professionals but also to enhance diversity in the workforce; the National Academy of Science report states similar theories about the need of URMs to increase innovation. This paper focuses on reporting on an initiative seeking to close the gap of African American representation between the College and the University and foster the innovation of URMs in engineering. The initiative Early Engineering Experience targets African American high school juniors and seniors. Designing the program began with the Participatory Action Research Model that ultimately ends with continual program enhancement. The structure of the initiative is not only based on the details of the schedule but also on the feedback of the participants. The lack of URMs in the college provoked an idea from personal experiences at other minority events. With the use of a systematic online document review of current weekend outreach programs, a plan of action was developed, and effective program designs were synthesized. Based on the systematic review of similar programs, the current plan is to implement a program in February of 2020 that will target about 30 participants. Mentees will be able to connect with multiple organizations such as the VEX robotics club, the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers, and etc. This weekend initiative is designed to allow participants to gain personal exposure and access to various engineering curriculums, lab collaboration and organizational and club introductions while mirroring the campus activities of four mentors. Changing the Conversation: Messages for improving public understanding of Engineering demonstrates student misconceptions about what the field of engineering entails. Therefore, students are often unaware of the technological contributions that have and can be made through the study of engineering. With the implementation of this program, the initiative will make a lasting impression on the participants. The Early Engineering Experience aims to foster interest in African American youth in a field that is in desperate need of new innovative minds.","Carter, Danielle Nicole;Landaeta, Rafael E.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Batten College of Engineering & Technology,
Engineering students' comprehension of phase diagram concepts: An international sample,"Materials science is an essential discipline for students in the mechanical and metallurgical engineering programs because many of them find jobs in industries where materials are relevant, such as electronics, aerospace, and automobile. Phase diagrams have proven to be a topic in materials science in which students demonstrate alternate conceptions. An essential first step in constructing a pedagogical approach to teaching phase diagrams in a specific program is to assess the students' conceptions. There has been significant interest in improving the teaching of materials science in general and phase diagrams in particular in two top universities, one in Mexico and the other in Canada. In both universities, there are successful mechanical engineering programs in which materials science is part of the curricula. In this research, we implemented a project aimed to improve the students' conceptions of crucial concepts in materials science. In this work, as a first step, we used an instrument inspired by items from the Materials Science Concept Evaluation (MSCE) to assess students' understanding of concepts related to phase diagrams. In addition to multiple-choice questions, we asked for their reasoning to deepen our understanding of their conceptions. We added open-ended items with corresponding spaces for their reasoning. We administered that instrument to undergraduate engineering students from these two universities after the phase diagram topics were covered. With the analysis of the multiple-choice and open-ended questions combined with a qualitative method to categorize the students' approach to each item, we present in this paper the students' conceptions and difficulties they had with this topic. We concluded that students in both countries had difficulties with the identification of phase fractions, the compositions of both alloys and individual phases, and solid solubility in binary phase diagrams.","Sanchez-Mata, Oscar;Brochu, Mathieu;Zavala, Genaro",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello;Université McGill,Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Materials research education ;  Phase diagrams ;  STEM
Paper: Bringing science education and research together to REACT,"This 'Innovation in Engineering Teaching Practices' paper will describe the student led co-curricular REACT (Research Education and Activities for Classroom Teachers) program at the University of Michigan. REACT was formed in 2017 to bring K-12 math and science teachers from Michigan together for a one-day, interactive learning experience to help incorporate research into their classrooms. Teachers listen to graduate student talks, go on research lab tours and are provided novel lesson plans and materials for two hands-on activities that can be used in their K-12 classrooms. Graduate students from eleven engineering and science departments collaborate to develop these materials and ensure they meet the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers earn continuing education credits for attending. REACT is an opportunity not only for teachers to learn about the cutting-edge research happening at University of Michigan, but also serves as a professional development tool for graduate students, giving them the opportunity to work on science communication skills as well as participate in curricula development. The program has also developed a unique funding model, where university professors and departments sponsor individual teachers, so attendance and all materials are free for educators. Since 2017, REACT has hosted ninety K-12 teachers from seventy different school districts. Similar workshops are being developed at other universities based on REACT's model. At times, the distance between graduate school and K-12 education can seem very large, but as one REACT participant stated: 'REACT has been an effective way to bridge the gap between the research community at the University and the education sphere.ï¿½","Travitz, Alyssa;Muniz, Ayse;Beckwith, Joanne Kay;Cersonsky, Rose K.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",

These evaluation strategies will be detailed with special emphasis on the steps taken to modify the educational programming in response to evaluation findings from year one.","Oakes, Maeve Drummond;Everett, Kristin;Harris, Michael T.;Sydlik, Maryanne;Godwin, Allison",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Purdue University;Western Michigan University,
Making improvements: Pedagogical iterations of designing a class project in a makerspace,"This research paper examines a professor's pedagogical adjustments over two semesters teaching a course that included a project in the university makerspace. In recent years, substantial resources have been invested into makerspaces in higher education with the underlying assumption that their creation will lead to experiences that ignite interest and engagement in engineering. In particular, university affiliated makerspaces have the potential to support innovation and design alongside the undergraduate engineering curriculum. the instructor's perspective is vital to support engineering students in their use of these spaces. To better understand these strategies, this paper uses a descriptive case-study approach to identify lessons learned to encourage student engagement in a university makerspace. This research used qualitative methods and was guided by the following research question: ¢ What is the professor experience across two semesters in teaching a course that incorporates a project in the makerspace? During the Spring and Fall of 2019, researchers conducted two semi-structured interviews, 6 observations, and collected student artifacts from two civil engineering courses. A faculty member, Dr. Cook, at a large research university who received an institutional grant to support the design and implementation of a class project which utilized the makerspace, was the faculty participant. Dr. Cook's investment in project design and outcomes gave researchers the opportunity to observe the impact of iteration and intention in designing and implementing course projects that utilized the university makerspace. Observations of class presentations and final projects demonstrated a difference in project quality from the first semester to the second semester. One of the essential institutional supports that encouraged both professor and student engagement in the project was the funding used to employ a teaching assistant (TA) familiar with the content of the course as well as the makerspace. From Spring 2019 to Fall 2019, Dr. Cook had thought that an overhaul of her project would be necessary to generate more engagement and output from students. Instead of these large changes, researchers alongside Dr. Cook found that familiarity with the makerspace, prior experience with an open-ended project, and peer support for students seemed to produce superior student engagement and output without vast pedagogical shifts.","Carbonell, Roxana Maria;Boklage, Audrey;Clayton, Patricia;Borrego, Maura",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,The University of Texas at Austin,
Intercollegiate coaching in a faculty professional development program that integrates pedagogical best practices and the entrepreneurial mindset,"This work-in-progress (WIP) paper reports on intercollegiate faculty coaching experiences in a large-scale engineering professional development program funded through the Kern Family Foundation. Research demonstrates that adding coaching and one-on-one targeted discussions to the traditional workshop professional development model effectively supports faculty with integration of pedagogical approaches, conceptualization of strategy application in their classes and content, and persistence through later phases of Diffusion of Innovation models including confirmation and adoption. Despite increased interest and offerings of higher education faculty development programs in recent years, coaching in higher education settings, particularly in the engineering disciplines, remains relatively rare. If coaching does take place, it typically occurs on a small-scale or in single discipline programs. Rarely, if ever, does intercollegiate coaching occur. This study reports on the effectiveness of a large-scale coaching effort, with 73 faculty participants from 15 engineering disciplines at more than 30 universities across the country. Beginning in the summer of 2019, a diverse group of engineering faculty participated in the Innovating Curriculum with Entrepreneurial Mindset (ICE) faculty development workshop. This intensive three-day workshop introduced faculty to the framework of entrepreneurially minded learning (EML) centered on curiosity, connections, and creating value. The workshops promoted evidence-based pedagogical best practices and participants experienced different active learning techniques that can be applied to instill the entrepreneurial mindset in students at their home institution. Following the workshops, faculty were provided with ongoing coaching and support comprised of two individual coaching sessions and two small-group Community of Practice coaching sessions. Coaching sessions included in this study were led by a four-member, intercollegiate coaching team comprised of experts in engineering education, EML classroom integration, and instructional effectiveness. This WIP paper reports on the first half of this ongoing project, including the summer workshops and summer and fall coaching sessions. This paper reports and reflects on coaching session notes and discussions with participants. Evaluation includes trend analysis to identify themes raised during coaching sessions, and assessment of the effectiveness of the coaching meetings. Future survey data will be used to measure the effectiveness of coaching sessions for implementation and accountability of project goals.","Dillon, Heather;Mayled, Lindy Hamilton;Nagurka, Mark L.;Carnasciali, Maria Isabel;Melton, Douglas E.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,University of New Haven;Marquette University;University of Portland;Arizona State University;Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network,
Individual resilience as a competency for aviation professionals: A review of the literature,"Graduates from aviation and aerospace technical and engineering disciplines emerge with certifications and academic coursework to fulfill the respective degree requirements, but may still lack fluency in key non-technical competencies to fully leverage their professional credentials and academic preparation. Due to the applied nature of the aviation and aerospace disciplines, problem-based learning approaches implicitly seek to incorporate and develop such skills as part of the educational experience. Individual resilience is one example of a nontechnical competency sought by employers across high consequence, technology-based industries. However, a stronger shift from traditional lecture/lab course formats to more in-depth problem-based approaches can cause some learners to retreat from challenges due to early failures or from lack of sufficiently developed recovery techniques. This paper presents a theoretical model of individual resilience for applied engineering and technology-based learners. Such a model could assist instructors tailor pedagogical experiences to more fully integrate resilience during academic preparation. Toward this end, a cross-domain review from seminal and modern research on resilience theory from aviation/aerospace, education, medical and psychology literature was conducted. Five common resilience themes emerged: (1) Adversity persistence/perseverance; (2) Contextual awareness (picture making; visualizing and assessing problems and synthesizing decision strategies); (3) Self-directed/learning autonomy; (4) Change management and innovation, and (5) Social connectivity (peer relationships). The paper concludes with suggestions for next steps toward a practical teaching and learning resilience model for educators.","Ropp, Timothy D.;Belt, Stephen M.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,College of Engineering;Saint Louis University,
Students' abilities to solve RC circuits with cognitive scaffolding activities,"There are many examples of research-based instructional materials that have been shown to help increase students' conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills for most topics covered in introductory undergraduate and some graduate-level Physics courses. The typical Electricity and Magnetism courses often spend little time solving non-trivial quantitative circuits with resistances and capacitances (RC circuits) using calculus and differential equations. Furthermore, the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) courses taught to Engineering students focus on mathematical techniques, not on the conceptual understanding of the physical phenomena being modeled nor whether the solution makes physical sense. A recent study indicated that even students with a firm understanding of all relevant concepts struggle when trying to apply those ideas to solve non-trivial RC circuit problems analytically. Building on that work, we designed a team-structured classroom activity based on conceptual cognitive scaffolding to help students construct a mathematical model for an RC circuit starting from the conceptual ideas and solving the differential equation obtained. At the end of the course, we gave the designed RC diagnostic test to the students and compared the results with those obtained from students who had participated in the same class one year before but without the class activity. In this report, we present the analysis of the diagnostic results and compare the similarities and differences between the results of the previous-year students (who had no intervention) and those of the current-year students who had the cognitive scaffolding activity.","Zavala, Genaro;Martinez-Torteya, Carlos Eduardo",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Cognitive scaffolding activities ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Mathematical modeling ;  RC circuits
Effect of psychological safety on the interaction of students in teams,"CONTEXT Diverse contributions from team members have the potential to improve innovation in engineering student teams, but students must feel psychologically safe to contribute fully. Low psychological safety can decrease cohesion in teams and increase conflict. PURPOSE This study aims to explore trends in the psychological safety of students, teams, course sections and their effect on the interactions of students within the teams. METHODS We used multilevel (hierarchical) modeling to address our research question. The quality of teammate interaction is the outcome variable and is predicted by individual psychological safety in the first level, the team's average psychological safety in the second level, and the course sections' average psychological safety of students in the third level. RESULTS Based on the result, peer evaluations of the interaction each student has with team members (the outcome) can significantly be predicted by the psychological safety of a student and the level of psychological safety in teams. The sections' average psychological safety did not affect our outcome. CONCLUSIONS If we expect students to interact more with peers within the teams, we should make sure that psychological safety is high in both individual and team levels. It is possible that the lack of variability by the course section is a result of studying all the sections of a coordinated course.","Beigpourian, Behzad;Ohland, Matthew W.;Ferguson, Daniel M.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Purdue University,Interaction with teammates ;  Multilevel (hierarchical) modeling ;  Psychological safety ;  Teamwork
Fostering entrepreneurial mindset and innovation in a cross-listed science and engineering course,"Greater attention to promoting entrepreneurial mindset and innovation among STEM disciplines in recent years enhances the potential role for science and engineering majors as changemakers. The efforts by the emerging and growing Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PIE) community in recent years bear resemblance to and overlaps with the efforts of engineering educators in terms of cultivating entrepreneurial mindset among college students. Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PIE) efforts at Loyola University Maryland is shaped by the launch of two NSF funded initiatives; the Pathways to Innovation in 2015 and the PIPELINE Network; an NSF collaborative research grant in 2016. One of the outcomes of these efforts is a new course on Technical Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a cross listed course by Physics, Computer Science, and engineering. In this course students are introduced to innovation and entrepreneurial mindset through User Innovation concept, which is the focus of this report. Physics, computer science, and engineering students, as well as those majoring in communication, business, chemistry, biology, and psychology often take this as an elective course. The User Innovation module introduces Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) concepts in context of students' passion and their personal experience instead of using textbook definitions. Students are engaged in active learning practices that guides them through a journey, starting with User Innovation module and ending with a team project. In this process students identify needs, pains, and issues they care about, and concluding with a prototype developed through a team project that represent solutions to student defined problems. Teams project members collaboratively work on the necessary steps for launching a startup based on the team project product. They develop and submit a team project portfolio that document the challenges they faced, and their progress and achievements, while documenting how their prototype was treated to launch a startup. The success of the team project is measured by the quality of the prototype created, ability to adhere to a project timeline, quality of the written project report and documentations, the oral presentation, and the team project portfolio. Future plans include leveraging concept map to assess the impact of the whole course as well as the User Innovation module on students' perception and attitudes about entrepreneurial mindset.","Roughani, Bahram",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Loyola University Maryland,
Implementing product dissection in virtual classrooms,"Problem-based learning activities, such as physically reverse engineering competitors' products or virtually dissecting products, can be integrated into graduate-level engineering curriculum to demonstrate to engineers, scientists and other technical professionals how to systematically disassemble and analyze an assembly, as well as its components. In the early 1990's, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) first introduced these concepts of reverse engineering and product dissection, thus making them cornerstones of introductory engineering courses. Many studies have been conducted in introductory and undergraduate level engineering courses, finding that virtual product dissection can be used as a proxy for physical dissection in order to have an impact on learning and creativity. While these studies have been systematic in nature, they have only explored product dissection in undergraduate co-located classrooms. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the deployment of product dissection modules in graduate-level engineering classrooms-both in an online (non-co-located) setting and in a residential classroom setup. This concept was introduced to graduate students in an engineering leadership and innovation management program course that focused on product innovation in a corporate setting. This study aimed to understand the usefulness of virtual product dissection in online classrooms through the implementation of an online virtual product dissection module where students completed individual reflections and written discussions. The results from this case study yield recommendations for the use of product dissection in non-co-located classrooms for graduate students and further engineering leadership development education. Additionally, we provide insights into the deployment of this module in an engineering graduate classroom, as well as in a corporate setting for professional development for production innovation. The results from the case study indicate that graduate engineering students gained self-efficacy from pre to post-dissection and that they found the dissection activity to be useful for both understanding how products work and for idea generation. In addition, the students indicated that they were able to draw inspiration from their dissected products when completing the alarm clock design activity. These results indicate that the virtual product dissection module is effective for use in a non-residential/online classroom. These results are in line with prior research that has shown that virtual dissection is an effective residential classroom tool.","Ragonese, Andrea M.;Starkey, Elizabeth Marie",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Pennsylvania State University,
Work-in-Progress: Novel ethnographic approaches for investigating engineering practice,"There remains a limited amount of research on professional engineering work practices [1]. This deficiency is troubling because engineering education is organized and reorganized based on claims and assumptions about what professional engineering work is or will be. Without well-researched and trustworthy representations of practice, it is questionable whether engineering educators can adequately prepare future engineers for workplace realities. Although it is important that the preparation of future engineers not be tied solely to the workforce, there is a significant disconnect between engineers in practice and engineers in academe [2, p. 18]. If educators want to prepare students for professional success - including by assuming roles as future leaders and change agents - concrete images of engineering work are critical resources for rethinking engineering education [1]. The need for such resources is even more urgent given ongoing changes to engineering work under the forces of globalization, new organizational configurations, and new technologies of communication, design, and production. More research is needed to document images that are often discounted by students and even faculty, i.e., portrayals of engineering practice that emphasize its non-technical and non-calculative sides, including work processes and dynamics that involve social and cultural dimensions [3-4]. The aim of this work-in-progress paper is to introduce an exploratory project that will test innovative approaches to data collection and analysis for rapidly generating new knowledge about engineering practice. Traditionally, engineering practices have been studied using individual interviews or in-depth ethnographic field research, the latter requiring researchers to embed themselves as participant observers in the workplace. Yet technical work increasingly involves open workspaces and geographically distributed teams, frequent changes in job roles and team composition, and many layers of digital abstraction and collaboration. It thus may not be feasible or optimal to perform on-site research for extended periods of time. The main aim of this paper is to introduce method innovations for conducting field research that can potentially generate higher quality data more efficiently. Before doing so, we briefly review prior research on engineering practice.","Jesiek, Brent K.;Johri, Aditya;Brozina, Cory;Korte, Russell",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,College of Engineering;George Mason University;Youngstown State University;The George Washington University,

Undergraduate engineering students enhance novel instrumentation to detect the mach effect,"Undergraduate electrical engineers performing summer research have enhanced the real-time data collection system of one of their professor's novel detectors to uncover some remarkable results. Over the past two summers at Bucknell University students in engineering have been working on an innovative detector that has repeatedly produced results indicative of a real Machian like reaction force to inertia. Each summer (2018 and 2019) multiple students continued to make electrical enhancements and refinements to this novel instrument and its test protocol at the suggestions of reviewing scientists and their professor. In the most recent version of this instrument, real-time data collection appears to confirm that the Mach Effect is real, directional and electromagnetic in nature. The device is able to observe an electromagnetic interaction of the Mach Effect during incidents of significant local celestial matter alignment (such as the solar eclipse of July 2nd 2019). While some of these scientific results have been reported in multiple IEEE publications, this paper goes into detail as to the role that the students (undergraduate engineers) have played in the research and their work to use and refine the instrument as well as developing innovations to the protocol of the sensor array instrumentation. As a team, they helped their professor successfully continue the hunt to answer the query of whether a Mach Effect (inertial reaction force) is actually detectable. Due partly to their efforts the science around this instrument is now quite robust and this novel device provides consistent, replicable and predictable results. During the summer research, the students got to apply much of their theoretical electrical engineering training to a real-world application in sensor arrays and instrumentation.","Jansson, Peter Mark;Kaladius, Peter Sawirs",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Bucknell University,
A learner and equity-centered approach to makerspaces,"The growth of makerspaces is a trend that has been decades in the making. Engineers are most effective when, in addition to technical knowledge in their field, they understand the capabilities of processes such as milling, welding, and 3D printing. Makerspaces enhance engineering education by encouraging creativity and hands-on fabrication skills in students. The benefits of providing high-impact opportunities are evident to prospective students and the employers that will one day hire them. At our institution, we have a unique opportunity to expand on previous research on makerspaces as we design a new building which will include a 20,000 square foot Innovation Center. While the benefits of makerspaces are well-documented, increasingly so are the potential shortcomings [1], [2]. It is critical to design welcoming and inclusive spaces that support all types of learners. We addressed this challenge by conducting a needs and opportunities assessment of our currently available fabrication areas. Data were collected through interviewing faculty, staff, and students; surveying student attitudes and satisfaction with existing facilities; and tracking student use. Data were used to inform an assessment plan for the future Innovation Center. This proactive framework includes the voices and experiences of students from across the institution including those of diverse backgrounds and disciplines. The process has allowed us to improve our understanding of the role of making in the future of our university and of how regular feedback and collaboration with constituent groups helps us to create a more learner-friendly and equitable space. Furthermore, this effort to collect and analyze data in preparation for a new makerspace has been beneficial as we develop curricular and co-curricular experiences for our students that are designed to build on our strengths and provide new areas of success.","Keller, Carolyn;Prosise, Jodi F.;Parker, Philip J.",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,University of Wisconsin-Platteville,
Student response to instructional practices (StRIP) survey in engineering classrooms: Validating a Spanish version,"This research paper reports the validity methodology and the results obtained in constructing the Spanish version of a well-known instrument to assess instructional practices. Since 2014, the School of Engineering of the Universidad Andres Bello in Chile has invested resources into transforming teaching practices from a traditional approach to active learning methodologies. To reach this goal, the Educational and Academic Innovation Unit (UNIDA, for its acronym in Spanish) designed a recursive Engineering Faculty Development program that uses the conceptual change approach as a framework. It is specially designed to promote and ensure the use of innovative, active-learning methodologies in Engineering classes. Since 2015, we have been implementing this program and reporting on its evolution and the resulting shifts in paradigm in the teaching practices of the faculty members. All the interventions are done by the faculty (teaching); however, the final impact is on the students (learning). So, we assessed how students responded to these new programs and analyzed the diverse types of teaching implemented by the engineering faculty, using the Student Response to Instructional Practices (StRIP) survey. The StRIP measures students' responses to the kinds of instruction delivered in the undergraduate engineering classrooms. It consists of three main sections: 1) the types of instruction, categorized as interactive, constructive, active, and passive, 2) the strategies underlying the in-class activities, i.e., explanation and facilitation, and 3) the student responses to instruction, as measured in the subscales of value, positivity, participation, distraction, and evaluation. In this paper, we present the process of translating the StRIP from English into Spanish and its subsequent validation. The process included i) forward and backward translation, ii) review by an expert committee, iii) two focus group sessions with engineering students and iv) pilot testing. In the pilot testing, 346 students enrolled in Engineering courses in various semesters of their curricula participated. We used this data to evaluate the internal reliability of the tool using the Cronbach alpha test (Î± = 0.920), which indicated that our Spanish version of the StRIP was internally consistent. We concluded that the translated version of the StRIP was a validated instrument that could be applied in future formal implementations where the aim is to understand better the students' responses to pedagogical strategies used in Spanish-speaking classrooms.","Quezada-Espinoza, Monica;Dominguez, Angeles;Zavala, Genaro;Calder³n, Juan Felipe",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,Tecnológico de Monterrey;Universidad Andrés Bello,Active learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Instructional practices ;  STEM
Towards the development of a research engineer identity scale,"This paper reports on research that is part of a broader National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded, Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) project. The project aims to enhance the research culture and broaden the participation in research of underrepresented groups within graduate engineering programs at a mid-sized historically black college or university. The project includes three initiatives that seek to assist in the development of a research engineer identity among the graduate students pursuing research-based degrees in the college. One of the three initiatives of the project, and focus of this paper, involves the development of a survey-based Research Engineer Identity Scale (REIS). A two stage sequential mixed-method research design is being used to develop the scale. This paper focuses on the first stage in the design which involved conducting focus groups with research engineers to gain insight into the content, character, and complications associated with internalizing a Research Engineer Identity (REI) in general and among people from underrepresented groups in particular. We report on four semi-structured focus groups that each lasted approximately 90 minutes in Fall 2019. Each focus group included about 6 to 9 faculty members, industry professionals, or graduate students who actively engaged in engineering research in the Southeastern United States. Focus group participants represented various academic disciplines within engineering as well as a range of demographic characteristics such as sex, race, ethnicity, and citizenship status. The focus group conversations were transcribed and transcriptions were entered into NVivo for coding and analysis. Inter-rater reliability procedures were used to ensure consistency of coding. This paper reports on the themes that emerged within the focus group discussions regarding what it means to be a research engineer. The findings describe similarities and differences across demographic characteristics in regard to the content, character, and complications associated with efforts to develop a Research Engineer Identity. The paper concludes by briefly describing the process that will be used to transform the emergent themes into pool of items to be included in a web-based questionnaire designed to measure Research Engineer Identity.","Walton, Tobin N.;Ram, Bala;Teixeira-Poit, Stephanie",Conference Proceeding,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2020-06-22,North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University,
System analysis and design of aromatherapy products for innovation performance assessment toward competitive commercialization phase,"Many new essential oil-based aromatherapy products invented by researchers failed to be commercialized and ended up in scientific publication. In fact, many commercialized products were unable to survive in market. In order to avoid these failures, performance of technology has to be assessed. Technology readiness assessment for innovation of aromatherapy products or services represent assuredness to the products. Technological readiness levels (TRLs) are widely adopted to assess the maturity of new technology. The business process model of innovation performance toward commercialization is conducted using System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method. Through SDLC, the innovation performance system entity and Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) were constructed. BPMN which constructs notation of business process shows that the stakeholders involved in innovation performance assessment are innovator, evaluator, research center and investor. TRLs system of aromatherapy products were then developed for innovation performance assessment. It was able to define criteria, attributes, and metrics for performance assessment based on the basic concept of TRLs and aromatherapy. Finally, validation was done using Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The result shows that the developed TRLs system of aromatherapy products is valid for performance assessment. It is also conforming to TRLs and aromatherapy basic concept.","Hasanah, U.;Djatna, T.;Raharja, S.;Bantacut, T.",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-06-22,IPB University,
Smart sensor based distillation for fractionating citronella oil: Current research challenges,"Citronella oil is one of the essential oils derived from the leaves and stem of lemongrass (Cymbopogon nardus). At present, most of the lemongrass oil industry in Indonesia is still in the form of upstream industries which only provide crude purified oils with low purity for export with a fairly low sales value. Technology in improving the purity of citronella oil needs innovation in following the development of the industrial revolution 4.0. This article presents an overview of the research opportunities in the development of distillation for fractionating citronella oil referring to automation of optimization processes in the vacuum fractional distillation accompanied by inspection of the quality of essential oil isolation run in the line process based on smart sensors integrated in a computer program. The combination technique of quality control of essential oils in line process system combined with the optimization technique of the vacuum fractional distillation process has not been studied by advanced researchers. Therefore, this study has a state of the art process engineering and smart sensor-based quality control systems that can be developed for strengthening the Indonesian citronella oil industry.","Wahyudi, D.;Noor, E.;Setyaningsih, D.;Djatna, T.;Irmansyah, ",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-06-22,IPB University;Agricultural Development Polytechnic of Medan,Citronella oil ;  Fractional distillation ;  Smart sensor
Bio-value chains for high-value products and compounds as an example for innovation and management for sustainable agroindustry,"The rapid rise in the use of natural resources and the emission of greenhouse gasses and extensive use of fertilizers to satisfy rising demand for food have led to a dynamic but unsustainable development even in agricultural areas. The principle of sustainability aims to conserve land, water and resources for future generations and to preserve the natural fertility of the soil. The BIVAC project seeks to develop novel, economically interesting products from residues streams produced in the agricultural sector. This surplus biomass could be very diverse. Residues are presently mostly returned to the fields, used in biogas plants or treated as waste. The material often contains valuable components, which could still be of use for the production in other companies. The project aims to determine which components can be found in these residue streams. To this end, different analytical methods are used ranging from photometric determinations to HPLC but also including determination of proteins using the Kjeldahl method or determination of parameters as dry matter, carbon and nitrogen content, analysis of heavy metals or the vitamin C content. The analyses carried out so far show that different residue streams contain candidate components that could be valuable for companies that do not primarily deal with agricultural products.","Brands, B.;Kleinke, Mitthias",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-06-22,Hochschule Rhein-Waal - University of Applied Sciences,

New product development in coconut-based agro-industry: Current research progress and challenges,"The new product development of coconut agro-industry is very urgent because of the low innovation in launching new products. New products that are more effective and adaptive are needed to achieve higher market growth and acceptance of end-users to obtain competitive coconut agro-industry in the future. Based on this, this study aims to claim the current development of our research in new coconut-based product development and provide an initial approach to construct new products as a case study. The results show that the development of new products is divided into eight groups and the development of coconut derivatives in agro-industry is around eight percent. The low development of coconut derivatives in agro-industry results in a research challenge framework. Methods for developing new products in the coconut agroindustry include consumer preference to identify product opportunities including data mining techniques, investment feasibility study, and spatial data mining by taking analysis in multi-criteria decisions for compatibility of potential raw materials with products. The results of case studies show that alternative sequences of derivative products that are potentially developed in agro-industries are soap (H), itching medication (O), fungicide (D), sterilizing agent (L).","Wardah, S.;Djatna, T.;Marimin, ;Yani, M.",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-06-22,IPB University;School of Graduate Studies IPB University,
"A mapping of current downstream shallot supply chain based on agent-based modeling and quadruple innovation helix: A case study at Cirebon district, Indonesia","Shallots have the prospect of developing value-added downstream products. Currently, the only downstream product on the market is fried shallots, so it is necessary to map the downstream product supply chain shallots in Cirebon Regency as one of the regions producing shallots. The issue in the downstream development is how to map current downstream supply chain development, including current interaction between actors, so we can make a decision for future downstream development priority. This paper designs the mapping of the downstream supply chain of shallot commodities to see the interaction between actors in the shallots agorindustrial downstream supply chain network. The research method used was agent-based modeling (ABM) based modeling to determine agent behavior and its interactions in the shallots agro-industry supply chain. The structure of the agent structure in the supply chain was designed with the quadruple innovation helix (QIH) approach, which consists of 4 actors' classifications, namely farmers, private sector, government, and universities. This research produces an interaction design that can be used as a basis for evaluating performance, added value and other aspects through the interaction behavior of each QIH actor in agent-based modeling to support downstream innovation in shallots agro-industry. Case studies in the Cirebon district of Indonesia show that the ABM and QIH models designed are able to show the form of interaction between downstream supply chain actors.","Sjafrina, N.;Marimin, ;Udin, F.;Anggraeni, E.",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-06-22,IPB University,Agent based modeling ;  downstream supply chain ;  quadruple innovation helix

Progressive modelling of feature-centred product family development,"Modelling a product family is critical for understanding the evolution of key design and manufacturing features associated with products in the product through-life development. This research aims to establish a model for the holistic description of the evolution process of a product family to support rapid development of new products with hybrid innovations. In this study, a new broader definition of the product family is proposed for products on cross-platforms but in the same class or category, called feature-centred product family. A progressive modelling of feature-centred product family is developed for progressively addressing the evolution of products and achieving the dynamic expression of a product family. A prototype system has been developed and tested with an industrial case study, which indicates that the proposed new feature-centred product family concept and progressive modelling method are not only supportive to realise the common and adaptive analysis of key design features but also helpful to improve the design and production efficiency of innovative products with knowledge and feature reuse.","Zhang, Haizhu;Qin, Shengfeng;Li, Rong;Zou, Yisheng;Ding, Guofu",Journal,International Journal of Production Research,2020-06-17,Southwest Jiaotong University;University of Northumbria,feature-centred ;  hybrid innovations ;  knowledge and feature reuse ;  product family ;  progressive modelling

What are We Asking our Students? A Literature Map of Student Surveys in Computer Science Education,"Many research papers pull data from student surveys. But are those surveys well designed? Are the questions used validated? Are the results comparable across studies? What exactly are we asking our students? In this work, we performed a systematic literature map of the past 15 years of papers in the three main conferences sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education: International Computing Education Research (ICER), Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE), and the Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education Technical Symposium (SIGCSE). We search for all papers referring to student surveys or questionnaires. Out of 1313 papers analyzed, 42 papers referred to surveys containing general questions applicable to many or all computer science students. Our analysis showed that many papers were using surveys to extract similar types of information, such as demographics, prior experience or motivation to study computer science. However, the questions were being asked in different ways, using different scales, thus making it difficult or impossible to compare survey results between studies. We further found that while some studies based their questions on well-validated surveys, or at least shared their questions for possible later validation, approximately half of the papers found neither validated their questions, nor shared them to allow for post-hoc validation.","Zavaleta Bernuy, Angela;Harrington, Brian",Conference Proceeding,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2020-06-15,University of Toronto,literature map ;  questionnaires ;  questions ;  surveys ;  validation

From PBL to innovation: a decennial case-study from an HPV student team,"Purpose: The implementation of project-based learning (PBL) activities in the curricula of engineering students has become a consolidated method to improve their skills. The purpose of this paper is to share the experience acquired by the authors from a decennial case-study on a student team PBL activity focused on design and development of human-powered vehicles (HPVs). A review of the project evolution, boundary constraints and management choices could provide inspiration and suggestions to faculty staff that would like to set-up similar experiences for engineering students in their universities. Design/methodology/approach: A student team was funded by the authors in 2008 to gather engineering students interested in design and construction of HPVs. In the past decade, the team has grown from 10 up to 60 students enrolled per year and stimulated to develop a range of HPV designs for sports and mobility. The project management evolved as a consequence to com ply with the growing ambitions of the group and complexity of the goals. Findings: A thorough analysis of factors contributing to the success of the project led to identification of the key factors to increase student participation: persistence of the faculty staff is essential, attending competitions and challenges increases students’ recruitment and formal recognition of the activity through credits and the implementation of intermediate assessment steps increase the active participation rate. Bigger teams reduce the negative impact of recruits eventually abandoning the project in an early stage. Ambitious goals keep students motivated for longer periods and enable a virtuous circle by transferring enthusiasm and knowledge to new members. Research limitations/implications: The activity is analyzed starting from a subjective experience perspective and some of the findings/conclusions may be not applicable in a different context. However, such review can suggest strategies on the long-term period to create similar conditions elsewhere. Social implications: In the last part of the paper, it is pointed out how PBL projects can provide a fertile ground for innovation and lead to patents and development of new products aiming at the market. Originality/value: This study contributes to provide an insight view of how a student team PBL activity can grow over a decade if guided by faculty staff.","Baldissera, Paolo;Delprete, Cristiana",Journal,"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology",2020-06-15,Politecnico di Torino,Design team management ;  Education practices ;  Human-powered vehicles ;  Innovation ;  Project-based learning
Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials with Unconventional Phases,"Challenges and opportunities: • Although some unconventional phases that differ from the thermodynamically stable phases in bulks have been realized in 2D nanostructures, the rational design and controlled synthesis of 2D nanomaterials with unconventional phases are still challenging. It is urgently necessary to develop general synthetic strategies to prepare 2D nanomaterials with desired phases and morphologies. • From the mechanism point of view, it is of great importance to conduct systematic studies to gain the fundamental understanding toward the formation and stabilization of unconventional phases as well as the phase transformation process. • The relationship between the phase and property of 2D nanomaterials still remains vague. Further efforts should be devoted to unravel the phase-property relationship and phase-dependent applications on the basis of systematically experimental and theoretical investigations.","Ge, Yiyao;Shi, Zhenyu;Tan, Chaoliang;Chen, Ye;Cheng, Hongfei;He, Qiyuan;Zhang, Hua",Journal,Chem,2020-06-11,School of Materials Science and Engineering;City University of Hong Kong,"SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure ;  two-dimensional nanomaterials ;  unconventional phases"
"Education for flourishing: an illustration of boundary object use, peer feedback and distance learning","Purpose: Teaching sustainable development at the higher education level requires that existing curricula are supplemented with multi-disciplinary (and sometimes multi-national) collaboration and integrated thinking. The purpose of this paper is to increase the understanding of a particular framework for business model innovation for sustainability-as-flourishing that is used as a boundary object in the context of interdisciplinary, peer-assessed distance learning. This study is positioned in the broader picture of enlarging curricular content so as to reflect the systemic and interconnected nature of socio-technical and economic developments. The motivation behind this study is the authors’ wish to achieve a deeper understanding of how students engage with the complex concept of sustainable business modelling, while using the flourishing business canvas (FBC). Design/methodology/approach: An experiment was conducted on the use of the FBC as a boundary object among 52 engineering students at two universities. Data were provided by the following: iterations of the FBC; oral and written peer feedback; and an online survey. Findings: Based on an evaluation of the experiment, this study shows that the FBC supports the use of multi-disciplinary, multi-national peer and distance learning in sustainability education. Research limitations/implications: This study used one test condition of multi-disciplinary, multi-national collaboration for peer and distance learning at one point in time. Additional tests, using the tools and approaches of this study, are needed. Originality/value: Various tools and methods for use in education have been developed that support a new view of sustainability –sustainability-as-flourishing. Extant research focusses primarily on the development of tools and methods in this area. Not enough attention has been paid to the analysis of their implementation and use in higher education. This paper seeks to fill that research gap.","Ostuzzi, Francesca;Hoveskog, Maya",Journal,International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education,2020-06-08,Universiteit Gent;Högskolan i Halmstad,Engineering education ;  Flourishing business model canvas ;  Peer feedback ;  Sustainability education ;  Sustainability-as-flourishing

Effects of collaboration networks on technology innovation in the solar photovoltaic (Pv) sector: A case study of China,"Efficient use of energy is an essential aspect of green building development. In order to achieve a more energy efficient society, innovation of solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies is a necessity. Collaboration between innovators is regarded as important for innovation; however, the existing literature has made few attempts to investigate how a collaboration network can affect technology innovation in the context of the solar PV sector. This study aims to fill this research gap. In this study, innovation activities are categorized as exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation. A conceptual framework and a series of hypotheses are proposed from the perspectives of network structure (including direct ties, indirect ties, and network efficiency) and network composition (such as geographical proximity, institutional proximity, and technological proximity). The empirical results show that in the solar PV sector of China, collaboration networks with different kinds of structure and composition can imply diverse effects on exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation. Followed with the derived results, it can be concluded that network collaboration is not always beneficial for PV technology innovation. The research findings could convey useful information to both practitioners and policy-makers to adopt appropriate strategies for promoting effective innovation collaboration.","Liang, Xinning;Lu, Weisheng;Wu, Zezhou",Journal,Journal of Green Building,2020-06-01,The University of Hong Kong;Shenzhen University;Qianhai Institute for Innovative Research,Collaboration network ;  Energy efficiency ;  Exploitative innovation ;  Exploratory innovation ;  Solar photovoltaic

Supplemental Cultivation Plan of Innovation Quality for the Undergraduates of Building Environment and Energy Engineering in the Applied Technology Universities,"One of the most fundamental qualities for science research and technology development is the innovation quality, which covers many aspects such as consciousness, method and spirit. The innovation quality developed in the undergraduate period would be the most basic foundation in their over forty-years working life. A supplemental cultivation plan with a routine consisting of hardware, programming, simulation and optimization was presented in this paper for the undergraduates of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (BEEE). The hardware manufacture of digital devices was trained to promote the freshmen manipulative capability, while software programming with general-purpose languages was introduced to enhance the comprehension of data analysis in the 2nd academic year. During the period when some professional courses were taught, the building simulation modular could be introduced to enhance the understanding for the building thermal process and its corresponding Heating, Ventilating, Air-conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC R) system. A building management system (BMS) would be developed step by step and interactive with virtual building platform. That BMS and its virtual cases could be employed as the testbed for optimization of HVAC R system, such as energy consumption prediction, fault detection and diagnosis. Python and EnergyPlus were used in the custom training program oriented to the employment direction for the system operation and maintenance. Group achievements and individual cases show that the presented supplemental cultivation plan played a very important role in the cultivation of BEEE graduates' innovative quality. The effect for the graduated students need pay more attention to investigate the long-term effects, and more volunteers will participate in this plan to find out their better future.","Qiu, Qingling;Hu, Yunpeng;Liu, Jiani;Liu, Qing;Dong, Zhao",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education, ICAIE 2020",2020-06-01,Wuhan Business University,applied technology university ;  building environment and energy engineering ;  cultivation plan ;  innovation quality ;  operation and maintenance

At present, financial management has become the top priority of high-tech enterprises. Ocean engineering high-tech enterprises are different from traditional enterprises, which makes it necessary to continuously explore enterprise financial management modes suitable for their own characteristics in the process of enterprise development. Therefore, ocean engineering financial management modes should be innovated in the process of enterprise development. Marine engineering high-tech enterprises play an important role in the development of modern society and economy. Different from other traditional enterprises, high-tech enterprises have specific management modes. What is not suitable for the rapid development of high-tech enterprises is that the current financial management system and mode of high-tech enterprises are relatively backward. In order to innovate the financial management mode of marine engineering high-tech enterprises, we should solve the current problems such as limited liquidity of funds, lack of efficiency of management mode, and not conducive to the mobilization of enterprise resources, so as to form a financial management concept suitable for the characteristics of enterprises.","Liang, Wei",Journal,Journal of Coastal Research,2020-06-01,Shandong Huayu University of Technology,Financial management ;  high tech enterprise ;  ocean engineering
Analysis of SMEs' innovation capability: Towards a taxonomic approach based on internal and contextual factors,"The objective of this research work is to identify standard profiles that reflect the innovative behavior of SMEs in relation to the maturity of their internal practices. A method of Hierarchical Ascending Classification (HAC) was applied to a panel of 319 SMEs by combining an evaluation of 6 innovation practices from the Potential Innovation Index (PII) framework with contextual variables related to the structure, the environment and the market of the companies. The results showed that 6 profiles could be identified and that they reflect specific innovative behaviors. While some of these profiles seem to be slightly connected to particular business sectors or geographical areas, factors related to the structure of the firm itself (size in particular) do not seem to be differentiating.","Enjolras, Manon;Camargo, Mauricio;Galvez, Daniel;Schmitt, Christophe",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Université de Lorraine;Universidad de Santiago de Chile,contingency factors ;  Innovation ;  Innovation profiles ;  Practices ;  SMEs ;  Taxonomy
Digital Fitness - Goal for the Chief Digital Officer,"Digital Transformation (DT) causes a technology-driven change in organizations and society. But a precise state, an organization should strive for by this change, is not discussed adequately. Anyway, organizations implement a Chief Digital Officer (CDO) as a strategic management role, to control the journey of DT. This new role should be supported by assessment and control guidance. In this contribution we aim to understand and conceptualize the target state of DT. Based on a discussion of literature and expert interviews, we found out, practitioners themselves are not aware of the target state, although they must decide what is to reach on the DT journey. As a starting point for the development of guidance for the CDO, we secondly propose a model of digital fitness that conceptualizes the target state of DT comprising of three determinants: Digital Adoption, Digital Expertise and the Adoption Rate of Digital Innovations.","Kossowski, Julia;Heumuller, Erich;Richter, Sebastian",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Industry Consulting Manufacturing;BW Cooperative State University,Chief Digital Officer ;  Digital Fitness ;  Digital Transformation ;  Target State

A Systems Theory and Action Design Research Perspective on Supply Chain Collaboration in the Context of SCM 4.0,"This paper deals with the development of a generic process model for the implementation of digital Supply Chain Collaboration (SCC) concepts in future supply chains. The research undertaken in the course of this paper follows a systems theory and Action Design Research (ADR) approach to allow the researchers to take a holistic and systems-oriented perspective on Supply Chain Management (SCM). The research results were obtained through a systemic and systematic approach. This paper presents a review of the current literature as well as the theories relevant for the conceptualization of the process model, among which systems theories, Action Research (AR), ADR and interoperability play an important role. The implementation process model adapts the four iterative stages proposed by the ADR method, thereby allowing for more participation by practitioners and end-users, and potentially a more successful implementation of digital SCC processes in future supply chains. It was found that the ADR method is well-suited for the development of the implementation model as the complexity and interconnectedness of supply chain networks requires all agents to be involved in order to enable a comprehensive system innovation and digitalization.","Clauss, Anna Maria;Schumann, Christian Andreas",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Universität Leipzig;University of Applied Sciences Zwickau (WHZ),Collaboration ;  Digitalization ;  Supply Chain Management ;  Systems Theory
Product Discovery - Building the Right Things: Insights from a Grey Literature Review,"Context: In recent years companies have faced challenges by high market dynamics, rapidly evolving technologies and shifting user expectations. Together with the adaption of lean and agile practices, it is increasingly difficult to predict upfront which products, features or services will satisfy the needs of the customers and the organization. Currently, many new products fail to produce a significant financial return. One reason is that companies are not doing enough product discovery activities. Product discovery aims at tackling the various risks before the implementation of a product starts. The academic literature only provides little guidance for conducting product discovery in practice. Objective: In order to gain a better understanding of product discovery activities in practice, this paper aims at identifying motivations, approaches, challenges, risks, and pitfalls of product discovery reported in the grey literature. Method: We performed a grey literature review (GLR) according to the guidelines to Garousi et al. Results: The study shows that the main motivation for conducting product discovery activities is to reduce the uncertainty to a level that makes it possible to start building a solution that provides value for the customers and the business. Several product discovery approaches are reported in the grey literature which include different phases such as alignment, problem exploration, ideation, and validation. Main challenges are, among others, the lack of clarity of the problem to be solved, the prescription of concrete solutions through management or experts, and the lack of cross-functional collaboration.","Munch, Jurgen;Trieflinger, Stefan;Heisler, Bernd",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Shell Global;Hochschule Reutlingen,continuous discovery ;  continuous experimentation ;  innovation ;  MVP ;  OKR ;  product discovery ;  product management ;  product strategy ;  user research ;  UX

Strengthening Organizational Ambidexterity through Corporate Entrepreneurship Activities,"In today's volatile world, established companies must be capable of optimizing their core business with incremental innovations while simultaneously developing discontinuous innovations to maintain their long-term competitiveness. Balancing both is a major challenge for companies, since different types of innovation require different organizational structures, operational modes and management styles. Established companies tend to excel in improving their current business through incremental innovations which are closely related to their current knowledge base and competencies. However, this often goes hand in hand with challenges in the exploration of knowledge that is new to the company and that is essential for the development of discontinuous innovations. In this respect, the concept of corporate entrepreneurship is recognized as a way to strengthen the exploration of new knowledge and to support the development of discontinuous innovation. For managing corporate entrepreneurship more effectively, it is crucial to understand which types of knowledge can be created through corporate entrepreneurship and which organizational designs are more suited to gain certain types of knowledge. To answer these questions, this study analyzed 23 semi-structured interviews conducted with established companies that are running such entrepreneurial activities. The results show (1) that three general types of knowledge can be explored through corporate entrepreneurship and (2) that some organizational designs are more suited to explore certain knowledge types than others are.","Selig, Christoph J.;Baltes, Guido H.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences,corporate entrepreneurship ;  corporate venturing ;  discontinuous innovation ;  knowledge exploration ;  organizational ambidexterity
The influence of perceptions in adoption intention and behavior - A case study of a biomedical product,"Similar to the case of biotechnology industry, companies providing devices in the biomedicine industry face several challenges, and to stand out from competitors need to know how to get to the right customer. Potential customers (i.e., individuals and organizations) may choose to adopt or reject an innovative product and will later confirm that decision or not. Such decision is of utmost importance to the success of innovative products and, therefore, of the company that provides them. The aim of this study is to understand how perceptions formed about a biomedical product can influence its adoption intention and behavior and, hereafter, influence the decision of other potential adopters. Findings from a multiple case study provide a clear definition of the adoption process of a specific biomedical product, combining two existing theories - the Diffusion of Innovations Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model - and including the feedback created by interactions between current users of the product and potential users, to understand what influences potential adopters' decisions.","Abreu, Patricia;Rodrigues, Jose Coelho",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Universidade do Porto,adoption ;  adoption behavior ;  adoption intention ;  biomedical products ;  perception
Evaluating User eXperience as a Means to Reveal the Potential Adoption of Innovative Ideas,"This paper presents an empirical study dedicated to the evaluation of user experience (UX) and its possible causal influences on adoption. The empirical study was conducted in the context of an Innovation Management track in Fall 2019, where student teams had the opportunity to co-create innovative mobile app ideas. The applied UX-based adoption model, which in previous studies, has undergone numerous limited scale reliability, validity, and goodness of fit tests, was initiated through the first tentative model created in 2016. For each mobile app idea, a bipolar survey allowed the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data in order to evaluate the degree of UX satisfaction and its causal effect on adoption. This new study offers limited, early-stage evidence for possible cross-validation of the UX multidimensional aspect of the model by demonstrating that several UX facets, belonging to different dimensions, directly influence the anticipated UX and intention to adopt in the context of eight unique, innovative mobile app ideas. It also reveals that this approach could be used to sift through innovative ideas during the Fuzzy Front End stage in predicting their potential adoption success at the later close-to-market and on-the-market stages. Finally, it also provides some empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that the higher the degree of UX satisfaction, the stronger the intention to adopt.","Pallot, Marc;Pawar, Kulwant;Krawczyk, Piotr;Topolewski, Marcin;Lecossier, Adrien;Abdel Razek, Abdul Rahman",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,LAMPA Laboratoire Angevin de Mécanique Procédés et Innovation;Jyväskylän ammattikorkeakoulu;Szkola Glówna Handlowa w Warszawie;University of Nottingham;Service Innovation,formative measurement model ;  fuzzy front end innovation ;  goodness of fit ;  mixed-methods ;  quantitative qualitative methods ;  reliability ;  research design ;  user experience ;  validity
Critical Actions of and Synergies between Corporate Entrepreneurship Programs,"Uncertainty about the future requires companies to create discontinuous innovations. Established companies, however, struggle to do so; whereas independent startups seem to better cope with this. Consequently, established companies set up entrepreneurial initiatives to make use of startups' benefits. Consequently, this led-amongst others-to great interest in socalled corporate entrepreneurship (CE) programs and to the development and characterization of several different forms. Their processes to achieve certain objectives, yet, are still rather ineffective. Thus, considerations of the actions performed in preparation for and during CE programs could be one approach to improve this but are still absent today. Furthermore, the increasing use of several CE programs in parallel seems to bear the potential for synergies and, thus, more efficient use of resources. Aiming to provide insights to both issues, this study analyzes actions of CE programs, by looking at interviews with managers of seven corporate incubators and accelerator programs of five established German tech-companies.","Heinzelmann, Nicolai;Selig, Christoph J.;Baltes, Guido H.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences,actions ;  corporate accelerator ;  corporate entrepreneurship ;  corporate incubator ;  programs ;  synergies
Connecting the strategic intent of innovation labs and projects: The case of the Green Fablab,"The creation of innovation laboratories within universities arises from the need to consolidate pedagogical and research aspects. These innovation laboratories are becoming key spaces for the development of innovation competences. In this article, we describe the experiences of developing a pilot project on distributed recycling approach. The results showed how the development of this project can play a role in strategy development at the innovation laboratory level. These insights are pertinent for the managers of these spaces to identify competencies to develop in the middle/long term. The development of methodological tools to connect the operational, tactical and strategic levels and competences for these spaces are important future paths of development.","Roux-Marchand, Thibaut;Cruz, Fabio;Dupont, Laurent;Camargo, Mauricio;Osorio, Ferney",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,École d’ingénieurs CESI;Université de Lorraine;Universidad Nacional de Colombia,distributed recycling ;  Green Fablab ;  innovation labs ;  strategic intent
Investigating the barriers and facilitators to implementing an eHealth innovation into a resource-constrained setting: A South African case study,"eHealth describes any healthcare innovation that makes use of information and communication technology. The implementation of eHealth into developing countries has positive impacts on their health systems. There are numerous healthcare benefits associated with eHealth innovations, such as an increase in equity, efficiency and timeliness. However, without good implementation and technology transfer practices these benefits do not materialize or are temporary. In this paper, the barriers and facilitators to successfully and sustainably implementing an eHealth innovation into a developing country's health system are investigated. Specifically, this paper investigates the implementation of an audiology eHealth innovation into a resource-constrained setting in South Africa. The investigation was conducted using a case study and was structured according to the concepts from the Conceptual Health Innovation System framework (institutions, knowledge, relations and networks, actors, resources and innovation). The barriers and facilitators identified during the investigation were analysed and categorized into the appropriate health level: community, healthcare provider, district or national level; and recommendations for future eHealth implementation programs were discussed. This paper aims to inform stakeholders who are involved with eHealth development and implementation in developing countries on the factors that should be considered to ensure success and sustainability when implementing eHealth. This study contributes to the knowledge on health innovation management and promotes improved access to eHealth.","Leonard, Elizabeth;De Kock, Imke;Bam, Wouter",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Stellenbosch University,eHealth ;  health technology management ;  health technology transfer ;  implementation science ;  South Africa
The First-Three-Month Review of Research on Covid-19: A Scientometrics Analysis,"Responsiveness is one of dimensions in the concept of responsible research and innovation (RRI). This dimension, among others, is manifested through responses to the challenges faced by society. Responsiveness from the scientific community is clearly evident recently in the response to the recent great challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to provide an early review to assess publications in the first three months of the pandemic, since December 2019. Scientometrics and descriptive statistics were used to analyse documents indexed in the Scopus academic database. Open access tools from VOSviewer were used to help in visualising the network of countries and research topic density map. On average, 150.33 documents were published every month, with medicine as the main field of research (62.04%). Researchers from China, US, and UK institutions have published the most documents. Analysis of the keywords shows that the main topics of research regarded acute respiratory diseases, contact tracing, and molecular epidemiology. Although fields such as psychology, mathematics, computer science, engineering, nursing, business, management and accounting still have very few Covid-19 related studies at the moment, these fields likely to contribute in the future with regard to the great impact of this pandemic.","Harsanto, Budi",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Universitas Padjadjaran;University of Liverpool,Covid-19 ;  review ;  scientometrics ;  VOSviewer
Living Lab as enabler of new technologies in Public Administrations: The B@ARCA project,"The research aims to assess whether the Living-Lab methodology can facilitate the introduction of new technologies within a Public Administration (PA). Previous research explored the challenges and benefits derived from the introduction of ICT into public organizations through the presentation of qualitative case studies. None of these works evaluates if, and eventually how, the introduction of new technologies in Public Administrations (PAs) can be facilitated by the Living Lab (LL). This paper attempts to close this gap by presenting the results of B@ARCA - BIM at ARCA, a research project where the development of Building Information Modelling (BIM) based methodologies and technologies and their introduction into a Public Organization has been carried out embracing the Living Lab methodology. In detail, the project objective is to equip the ARCA agency, the authority in charge of the management of the social housing asset in the Puglia Region, with innovative technological solutions useful to improve the maintenance work of the old and great heritage. The level of acceptance of the new technology, measured through quantitative questionnaires, resulted in increased after the completion of the Living Lab development activities. These initial results may encourage public administrations to use the Living Lab to expose their employees to not just BIM but also the series of new technologies needed for the digitization of the public administration.","Di Biccari, Carla;Lazoi, Mariangela;Malagnino, Ada;Mangialardi, Giovanna;Romano, Tecla",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Università del Salento;ALTEA SPA,BIM ;  Innovation ;  Living Lab ;  Public Administration ;  Social housing
Proposition of a Tool to Evaluate User-Driven-Innovation in a Manufacturing Company,"Innovation is one of the key pillars of development for many companies, and especially for mature manufacturing companies operating in a B2B market. In addition to this, these companies involve more and more their users to develop their innovation capacity. Indeed, user-driven innovation (UDI) is popular in companies wishing to improve their sustainability in increasing their competitiveness on their market. However, it can be difficult for manufacturing companies to evaluate where they stand in terms of user-driven innovation, and more globally in terms of innovation. All degrees and types of innovation could be confused with them. The objective of this study is to bring valuable knowledge to manufacturing companies aiming to meet this challenge. In this paper, we propose a research approach based on criteria selected from the literature to assist manufacturing companies to evaluate their UDI score and analyze it over time. An evaluation tool based on this approach was developed and tested twice in an international manufacturing company before and after having set up UDI specific tools and actions. The results given by the tool show the positive evolution of the UDI score of the company.","Lacom, Pauline;Sagot, Sylvain;Sagot, Jean Claude",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté,decision-making ;  evaluation tool ;  manufacturing company ;  multi-criteria evaluation ;  UDI ;  User-Driven-Innovation ;  user-driven-innovation evaluation
Technological characteristics and organizational innovation: Examining as genotypes and phenotypes,"Organizations to remain competitive expand their product portfolio, enter new markets, and/or consolidate their market position. To achieve competitiveness, they use their traits (genotypes), expand their internal resources or the existing elements and components (phenotypes) with new elements and components i.e. innovation. Another aspect of competitiveness is the genotypes need to assist their innovations (or phenotypes) to cumulate as stable designs in their services/products (phenotypes). The extent to which organizations combine their generalist and specialist phenotypes decides the characteristics of its phenotypes, thereby, their competitiveness or height in the fitness landscape. Organizations acquire phenotypes (products or organizations) but their genotypes decide the extent to which the acquired phenotypes assist them in increasing their height in the fitness landscape. As organizations expand phenotypes it requires combining genotypes that assist both short-term aspects, economic and financial, and the long-term aspects such as equilibrium with natural and built environments. In fast-changing systems such as IT, organizations face considerable challenges in developing phenotypes by combining short-term and long-term genotypes. By selecting an IT organization and examining the extent to which phenotypes and genotypes increase its height in the fitness landscape, we can contribute to the existing body of knowledge on sustainable development, especially for fast-changing systems.","Kompella, Lakshminarayana",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,"National Institute of Technology, Warangal",fitness landscape ;  genotypes ;  innovation ;  phenotypes ;  technological characteristics
Integrated Management of Environmental Technologies: A New Approach based on the Concept: Green Integrated Technology Management Leadership 'Green IMLead®',"How to strengthen the resilience of urban areas and megacities? How to reduce the carbon footprint in a sustainable way? An answer to the two questions is the use of latest technologies for implementing integrated waste to energy systems. In order to manage green systems the concept Green Integrated Management Leadership (Acronym: Green IMLead®) is offered in this article. The concept was tested and evaluated in international waste management projects and consists of the seven fields: manager, individual, information, innovation technology, processes, agility and finance. The new concept is connecting regional and intercultural aspects, management leadership and system integration of different green technologies. In the investigated green projects following technologies were combined: waste collection, pre-treatment, recycling/upcycling of solid materials (e.g. plastics, wood, metal, paper), and the production of biomethane and fertilizer out of biomass. It was found that the key for success factors for such green systems are social and regional integration, trained people for running such complex processes and successful technology transfer.","Lohmuller, Bertram;Petrikhin, Alexander",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Steinbeis-Hochschule-Berlin,carbon footprint ;  green frugal innovation ;  green management and leadership ;  green technologies ;  Integrated waste management (IWM) ;  social and regional integration
Industry 4.0 and Business Model Innovation: A Scoping Review,"The term Industry 4.0 is associated with terms such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Services (IoS), Robotics, Big Data, Cloud Manufacturing and Augmented Reality and will narrow the gap between the physical and the digital world. Industry 4.0 sets the scene for business model innovation (BMI). The aim of this article was to explore current literature regarding Industry 4.0 when considered from a business model perspective. A scoping review was conducted to explore current research at the intersect of the Business model and Industry 4.0 research domains. The research question we pose thus is a general one: What is the nature of the evidence for Business model innovation in the context of Industry 4.0? The main impacts of Industry 4.0 on 1) industry, 2) products and services, 3) economy, 4) work environment and 5) skills development were mapped. We then conclude by reflecting on these drivers that Industry 4.0 holds a huge potential for business models to become renewed, improved, changed and novel. New value creation will not only originate from new products or services, but also the availability of data to the benefit of the business for example new value propositions like personalization, prediction of customer demand.","King, Susan;Grobbelaar, S.

A Framework for Responsible Research and Innovation in new Technological Trends towards MENA Region,"Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is a term used to explain ground-breaking tactics for ethically and socially governing technological research. Recent attention is being focused on the concept, particularly in Europe. However, the perception of RRI within MENA region is still required to be fuzzy and non-existent. This research aims to stretch the understating of RRI beyond the European countries to reach parts of the MENA region and its recent research and innovation trends. The research followed a qualitative Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM) to shape a proposed set of categories and themes presented as a final RRI framework towards some MENA countries engaged in the study (Jordan, UAE, and Bahrain). Data was collected via Semi-Structured interviews for tackling potential creation of synergies amongst entities involved in IS/technology research. The Practical implications delivered a pragmatic contribution to the ethical and societal build-up of IS research in MENA, aiming to achieve a transformative power of recent technological research.","Al-Eisawi, Dalia",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Princess Sumaya University,Artificial Intelligence ;  Coronavirus ;  Grounded Theory Methodology ;  Information Communication Technologies ;  Information Systems ;  Responsible Research and Innovation
The Examination of the Corporate Organisation and Implementation of Industry 4.0 in a High Value German Manufacturing Firm,"This paper examines the corporate organisational aspects of the implementation of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 builds on new technologies and appears as a disruptive innovation to manufacturing firms. Although we do have a good understanding of the technical components, the implementation of the management and organisational aspects of Industry 4.0 is under-researched. It is challenging to find qualitative empirical evidence which provides comprehensive insights about real implementation cases. Based on a case study in a German high value manufacturing firm, we explore the corporate organisation and implementation of Industry 4.0. By using the framework of Complex Adaptive System (CAS), we have identified three key factors which facilitate the implementation of Industry 4.0 namely 1.) Organisational structure changes such as the foundation of a central department for digital transformation, 2.) The election of a Chief Digital Officer as a personnel change, and 3.) Corporate opening up towards cooperating with partners as a cultural change. We have furthermore found that Lean Management is an important enabler that ensures readiness for the adoption of Industry 4.0.","Rueb, Julian;Bahemia, Hanna",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,"Newcastle University Business School, United Kingdom",Complex Adaptive System ;  Industry 4.0 implementation ;  Innovation management
Applying A User eXperience-based Adoption Model in Several App Idea Cases,"This paper presents an empirical study dedicated to the evaluation of User eXperience (UX) and its impact on potential adoption. This empirical study, which was carried out in Fall 2019, took place in the context of exploring the transferability of a previously validated mixed-methods survey instrument and the underlying formative UX model. Several app idea co-creation experiments were conducted in the context of an Innovation Management course where student teams had to co-create mobile app ideas. The resulting formative model was operationalized in the form of a mixed-methods bipolar survey instrument. Based on empirical evidence in the form of 328 responses from the same population of students participating in the eight distinct app idea co-creation experiments, the instantiated and refined UX model has met multiple criteria of reliability, validity, and goodness of fit. This study demonstrates that several UX facets, belonging to different dimensions, directly influence the anticipated UX satisfaction and the related degree of adoption. In particular, the high value of the coefficient of determination R2 = 0.707 shows, that almost 71% of the variability of Intention-to-Adopt is explained by User-Experience. The study provides early-stage evidence of possible transferability of the UX-based adoption model in evaluation of both the UX satisfaction and its impact on the adoption of any product, service or bundle idea in either concept, prototype or ready-to-market stage of the New Product Development cycle.","Topolewski, Marcin;Krawczyk, Piotr;Pallot, Marc;Huotari, Jouni",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Jyväskylän ammattikorkeakoulu;University of Nottingham,anticipated user experience ;  formative measurement model ;  goodness of fit ;  intention to adopt ;  mixed-methods survey instrument ;  quantitative qualitative methods ;  reliability ;  research design ;  validity
Innovation Strategies of Mature Resilient Businesses during the Covid-19 crisis,"The current sanitary crisis all over the world is unprecedented and affects all areas of activities. While companies have been investing in innovation strategies for years, crisis periods are very often conducive to downscaling RD investment and realizing incremental innovations. However, the COVID-19 crisis caused the emergence of new multidimensional stakes summarize in the 'Monde d' Après' movement. This exploratory study proposes to analyze the innovation strategy of mature companies applied during the COVID-19 sanitary crisis in order to understand if they apply specific strategies according to the 'unprecedented' aspect of this crisis. The results based on the analysis of collected lessons learned show that most of companies mainly focus on incremental innovation strategies during this crisis.","Lecossier, Adrien;Pallot, Marc",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,LAMPA Laboratoire Angevin de Mécanique Procédés et Innovation,Covid-19 ;  Established companies ;  Innovation crisis strategies ;  Innovation strategies ;  Mature companies
Applying a Living Lab Approach to Smart Grid Training Course Design,"Humanity is facing environmental issues that require the whole way in which we produce, distribute, and consume energy to be challenged. One technical solution that is widely considered is the smart grid, meaning a decentralized and multi-scale smart energy system. For more than a decade, various pilot projects have been implemented successfully all over the European Union. If such pilots are to be scaled up into effective roll-outs, the electrical engineering workforce needs to be prepared, as do the public authorities, engineering researchers and broader public. They need quick awareness-raising and training in the benefits, drawbacks, opportunities and skills associated with smart grids. Due to the complex nature of the situation and the related challenges for society, designing this training requires an innovative and participative approach. This article proposes a case study on applying a living lab approach to the design of innovative online courses on smart grids.","Gabriel, Alex;Berger, Kevin;Dupont, Laurent;Rault, Valerie;Camargo, Mauricio;Mayer, Frederique",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Université de Lorraine,Innovation ;  Instructional Design ;  Living Lab ;  Pedagogy ;  Smart Grid
Towards an adaptive reference model for agile and hybrid frameworks in automotive development,"While the German car industry was very successful over the past few decades, new challenges have surfaced in recent years. Societal changes, technological innovation and sustainability requirements call for improvements in flexibility and speed during the automotive development process. Traditionally, plan-based frameworks like the waterfall or Vee-model are used by the automotive industry. However, these frameworks do not work well for all suppliers that partake in the automotive product development process. An agile or hybrid framework may offer a better alternative for specific suppliers. To create an innovative, digital and adaptive product development process, this research aims at the integration of the whole value chain. This includes the requirements of the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and their suppliers. To allow for simple usage and adaptation, the knowledge is processed into a digital reference model. This generic reference model is then used to derive specific development processes that consider the context of each partner. By integrating communication mechanisms, it ensures that all partners can use their preferred framework for their development process while still ensuring a consistent product. In order to be able to select the most appropriate framework according to the context of a specific partner, the reference model takes into consideration all contextual factors of the development process.","Schmidtner, Markus;Timinger, Holger;Blust, Martina;Doering, Claudia;Hilpoltsteiner, Daniel",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Fachhochschule Landshut,adaptive models ;  agile processes ;  Automotive ;  hybrid processes ;  interorganizational communication ;  product development process ;  reference model
DIGITAL LEADERSHIP - Character and Competency Differentiates Digitally Mature Organizations,"This article describes digital leadership-specifically character and competency-that differentiate digitally mature organizations from digitally developing organizations. We assess the differentiated actions of leaders of digitally mature organizations and discuss their results. The study is based on Patterns of Digitization survey with insights from 559 decision makers across five geographic regions-America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania designed to assess how companies are implementing digital transformation, the various strategies they employ, the investments they make, and the actions they take to achieve large-scale institutionalized digital transformations. The insights gleaned from the study should help lagging companies understand what is involved in implementing a digital transformation and what they need to do to catch up.","Abbu, Haroon;Mugge, Paul;Gudergan, Gerhard;Kwiatkowski, Alexander",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Poole College of Management;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;VP/GM Analytics Practice,Change Management ;  Character and Competency ;  Corporate Culture ;  Digital Leadership ;  Digital Transformation ;  Innovation Management ;  Trust
Digital Pyramid: An approach to relate industrial automation and digital twin concepts,"The so-called fourth industrial revolution has brought different technologies to aid in the launching of new products, automation of manufacturing process and designing of intelligent manufacturing systems to monitor and control activities inside the factories. One recurrent challenge of the industrial sector is to evaluate multiple scenarios to make decisions at different levels of the business model. Innovative technologies and tools are used to provide solutions to existing gaps in current manufacturing systems. The evaluation of scenarios is used to manage risks, costs, prepare for upcoming work and forecast demand. Thus, the use of Digital Twin (DT) has proven its value covering the simulation and creation of virtual environments without the physical investment needed. With emergent technologies comes to a great responsibility for institutes to prepare undergraduate students in the development of novel skills, thus, technologies should be adapted and included into the teaching-learning process to aid the adoption from educational to the industrial sector. In this work, it is shown how the adoption of DT has been used to teach industrial concepts such as the automation pyramid, the programming of programmable logic controllers PLC and the exchange of information through industrial networks along with the concepts that constitute digital twins, such as digital master, digital shadow and modelling through system dynamics. Besides, the general vision of how digitalization is understood aligned to the vision of education 4.0 and applied to teach a tool to reduce the time for decision making into the industrial sector.","Cortes, Daniel;Ramirez, Jose;Villagomez, Luis;Batres, Rafael;Vasquez-Lopez, Virgilio;Molina, Arturo",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Digital Pyramid ;  Digital Twin ;  Educational Innovation ;  Higher Education ;  Industrial Automation ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Virtual Commissioning
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in Emerging Economies: A Preliminary Review,"Interest in responsible research and innovation (RRI) has been increased in recent years in the academic, practical and policy domains. Although initially introduced in Europe and the US, in the subsequent development, attention to RRI grows in another context. The aim of this paper is to provide a preliminary review of the current status of responsible research and innovation (RRI) research, focusing on emerging economy's context. Systematic review method is used for this purpose. The current research on RRI in emerging economies has emerged since 2013, involving multi-disciplinary researchers and has been published in journals from various disciplines. The most discussed dimension is 'inclusion' through public engagement in different phase of research and innovation. The dimension of 'anticipation' that plays an important role in the early phase of research and innovation has not been much discussed compared to other dimensions.","Harsanto, Budi;Kumar, Niraj;Zhan, Yuanzhu;Michaelides, Roula",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Universitas Padjadjaran;Manchester Metropolitan University;University of Liverpool,emerging economies ;  responsible research and innovation ;  systematic review
Sustainability Is Not Enough: Towards AI Supported Regenerative Design,"Sustainability, to describe it in simpler words, is a process of making things less bad. It is not a long-term solution even if it limits the destruction of the environment to a manageable level. Nevertheless, by just becoming sustainable, one cannot bring back what has been lost. The restoration approach is immediately required to fixing what has been broken by using renewable energy, reforestation and creating biodiversity gains. Redesigning our industrial system of production and consumption around the circular patterns of resource and energy use that we observe in mature ecosystems is a must and a complex endeavour. To create a truly regenerative economy challenges us to work with huge amounts of data. New techniques of data science and artificial intelligence are required in each step of the ecological design. This paper presents some examples of biomimicry in circular design and proposes techniques that integrate data science and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools to accelerate the transition towards the regenerative approach. AI, as an emergent 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' technology, can support and accelerate the pace of human innovation to design the future urban developments, to enable innovation in cities. AI has the capability to create a step change, to support an effective economic system that is regenerative by design.","Kadar, Timea;Kadar, Manuella",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2020",2020-06-01,Central Saint Martins;Universitatea 1 Decembrie 1918 din Alba Iulia,artificial intelligence ;  big data ;  circular design ;  future cities ;  regenerative economy
Developing a territorial diagnostic as part of a living lab process: Implementation to improve management and wood mobilization in small French private forest,"Living lab produces a wide variety of innovation results. To produce these results, territorial living labs can be mobilized, they implement the conditions of innovation in territorial development. However, because of their geographical areas and their stakeholders, territories are complex systems. Thus, it should be noted that in any territorial approach, a territorial diagnostic is essential. Nevertheless, in a territorial living lab process, the territorial diagnostic is rarely used and formalized. This research aims at developing a replicable and adaptable forest territorial living lab at the scale of each territory in order to meet the objectives of French forest policy regarding the improvement of wood management and mobilization in small private forests. For this purpose, we propose to include a territorial diagnostic as a step in forest territorial living lab process.

Methodology Concept for the Determination of the Idea-specific Requirement Space for the Execution of Radical Innovations,"Due to increasing globalization and continuously shorter product life cycles, the pressure on companies to innovate is significant. Regarding this, companies do not lack in the basis for radical innovations, namely a wide variety of novel ideas. The challenge is rather to identify, evaluate and execute ideas with high success potential. At this, implicit, unfounded criteria are often used within the evaluation and selection of ideas which partly results in an elimination of highly potential ideas. Furthermore, companies show a lack of knowledge regarding the specific requirements for the implementation of an idea and corresponding innovation catalysts, e.g. the integration of complementors. These challenges result in a neglection of required resource support for promising ideas and, consequently, in failing at the exploitation of the full market potential. Against this background, this paper provides a conception of a methodology for the determination of the idea-specific requirement space for the implementation of radical innovations. The presented concept is subject of current research activities.","Schuh, Gunther;Rwth, Paul Zeller",Conference Proceeding,"2020 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Conference, TEMSCON 2020",2020-06-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology IPT;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Idea Description ;  Idea Execution ;  Innovation Catalyst ;  Innovation Process ;  Radical Innovation ;  Success Potential
Simulation of a Generalized Equation for Innovation in Complex Adaptive Systems,"Complex Adaptive Systems are known to be amongst the most resilient systems due to their ability to self-organize when faced with challenge. Such self-organization is marked by innovation and this paper simulates a mathematical model of innovation positioned to be at the heart of any complex adaptive system, regardless of scale.

A multi-source image fusion algorithm based on gradient regularized convolution sparse representation,"Image fusion based on the sparse representation (SR) has become the primary research direction of the transform domain method. However, the SR-based image fusion algorithm has the characteristics of high computational complexity and neglecting the local features of an image, resulting in limited image detail retention and a high registration misalignment sensitivity. In order to overcome these shortcomings and the noise existing in the image of the fusion process, this paper proposes a new signal decomposition model, namely the multi-source image fusion algorithm of the gradient regularization convolution SR (CSR). The main innovation of this work is using the sparse optimization function to perform two-scale decomposition of the source image to obtain high-frequency components and low-frequency components. The sparse coefficient is obtained by the gradient regularization CSR model, and the sparse coefficient is taken as the maximum value to get the optimal high frequency component of the fused image. The best low frequency component is obtained by using the fusion strategy of the extreme or the average value. The final fused image is obtained by adding two optimal components. Experimental results demonstrate that this method greatly improves the ability to maintain image details and reduces image registration sensitivity.","Jian, Wang;Chunxia, Qin;Xiufei, Zhang;Ke, Yang;Ping, Ren",Journal,Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,2020-06-01,Northwestern Polytechnical University,convolution sparse representation (CSR) ;  gradient regularization ;  image fusion
Ecological value estimation method of the straw pyrolysis engineering,"The straw pyrolysis project is an ecological production project designed to convert high quality agricultural straw waste into gas, carbon, oil, and liquid. It has an important practical significance for conserving national energy and reducing emissions in the China’s agricultural fields. It has been an important scientific basis to accurately estimate the ecological value of the straw pyrolysis project and provides a systematic and comprehensive quantitative evaluation index system and calculation method to effectively promote green development in agriculture. This paper analyzed the ecological value composition of straw pyrolysis engineering based on the dichotomy theory of ecological value theory. It was concluded that the main ecological beneficial assets generated by the project of straw pyrolysis project were emission reduction and waste resource commercialization. The general formula for estimating the ecological value of straw pyrolysis project established was the ecological value of straw pyrolysis and the gasification project (VPE) = the monetary value of straw pyrolysis project emission reduction (VEB) + the economic value of straw resource products (VRC). In the calculation process, the life cycle analysis (LCA) method was selected to measure the net emission reduction of the straw pyrolysis project, and then the net emission reduction was valued with the help of carbon dioxide shadow prices to obtain the project’s emission reduction (VEB). Furthermore, the economic value of straw resource products achieved by the ecological production project (VRC) was calculated. Finally, VEB and VRC were included to obtain the ecological value of straw pyrolysis and gasification engineering (VPE). The method was designed using the literature research method to analyze the parameter selection required by each calculation link, and the parameter system required for the calculation process was provided. This study attempted to achieve substantial breakthroughs and innovations during the integration of both method and parameter research in the following three aspects: firstly, the ecological value estimation model of straw pyrolysis project was constructed; not limited to analysis and research from the emission reduction benefits perspective, with a more systematic and comprehensive ecological value estimation method and its required parameter system was established. Secondly, the potential value of the project should be reasonably converted into the “real market value”; in this study, the ecological benefits of the straw pyrolysis project were monetarily priced and measured. Thirdly, this study considered the impact of different technological levels and product energy conversion rates on greenhouse gas emissions during the process of estimating the displacement reduction of end-use energy products. Throughout the study, the general idea of “scientific modelling, reasonable pricing, and accurate estimation” was followed to provide a reliable foundation and support the decision to formulate the national energy saving and emission reduction plans.","Wang, Ying;Wang, Yajing;Wang, Hongyan;Wang, Huan;Bi, Yuyun",Journal,Chinese Journal of Eco-Agriculture,2020-06-01,Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,Ecological value ;  Energy substitution ;  Estimation method ;  Parameter system ;  Pyrolysis engineering ;  Straw

Experimental characterization of the hydraulic jump profile and velocity distribution in a stilling basin physical model,"The study of the hydraulic jump developed in stilling basins is complex to a high degree due to the intense velocity and pressure fluctuations and the significant air entrainment. It is this complexity, bound to the practical interest in stilling basins for energy dissipation purposes, which brings the importance of physical modeling into the spotlight. However, despite the importance of stilling basins in engineering, bibliographic studies have traditionally focused on the classical hydraulic jump. Therefore, the objective of this research was to study the characteristics of the hydraulic jump in a typified USBR II stilling basin, through a physical model. The free surface profile and the velocity distribution of the hydraulic jump developed within this structure were analyzed in the model. To this end, an experimental campaign was carried out, assessing the performance of both, innovative techniques such as the time-of-flight camera and traditional instrumentation like the Pitot tube. The results showed a satisfactory representation of the free surface profile and the velocity distribution, despite some discussed limitations. Furthermore, the instrumentation employed revealed the important influence of the energy dissipation devices on the flow properties.

Adaptation of EAP-NOOB Method for LoRaWAN with LO-CoAP-EAP and CBOR,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is driving research and innovation in the areas of security and device management. The bootstrapping procedure is yet another security problem that needs to be solved. At the bootstrapping period, a newly deployed device is performing a set of actions that allows it to join a network as a trusted party. One of the currently proposed methods in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) EAP Method Update (EMU) Working Group (WG) is employing the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to enable the authentication of IoT devices in more efficient and scalable ways. In this sense, we select and investigate the suitability one of the newly proposed EAP method in LoRaWAN, a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technology. EAP-Nimble out-of-band (EAPNOOB) method works without pre-established configuration and enables an out-of-band channel to improve authentication. In this paper, we analyse how the EAP-NOOB method can be employed in LoRaWAN networks, we then propose the use of two mechanisms that can be used to reduce the message size of the EAP-NOOB exchange.","Ingles-Sanchez, Eduardo;Garcia-Carrillo, Dan;Papadopoulos, Georgios Z.;Montavont, Nicolas;Skarmeta Gomez, Antonio F.",Conference Proceeding,"GIoTS 2020 - Global Internet of Things Summit, Proceedings",2020-06-01,IMT Atlantique;Universidad de Murcia;Odin Solutions SL,Authentication ;  Boot-strapping ;  CoAP-EAP ;  EAP ;  EAP-NOOB ;  Enrollment ;  IoT ;  IoT onboarding ;  LO-CoAP-EAP ;  LoRaWAN ;  LPWAN

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. University is a significant part of the national innovation system. Technological innovation of universities has become an important driving force of economic growth and achieving high-quality economic development. This paper uses a variety of spatial econometric analysis techniques to investigate the inter-regional flow of the elements of university scientific and technological innovation capability and the effects of university technological innovation ability on economic growth and further studies the direct and indirect effects of university technological innovation capability by using panel data of coastal provinces and cities in China from 2005 to 2017. This research finds that the scientific and technological innovation ability of universities has obvious spatial spillover effect and it has a significant positive impact on regional economic growth. And the spatial spillover effect is greater than the direct effect, that is to say, the elasticity coefficient of the technological innovation ability of colleges and universities in the surrounding areas to the regional economic growth is greater than that of colleges and universities in the region. In addition, the investment of fixed assets, the process of urbanization and the scale of government only have the direct effect on the regional economic growth, and there is no spatial spillover effect. The scale of government and the opening-up have the direct effect and spillover effect. The conclusions for this study provide a useful reference for the government and universities to strengthen the technological innovation ability of universities so as to promote regional economic growth.","Wang, Xinyu;Ren, Yanzhou;Zhang, Lili;Ma, Yu",Journal,Journal of Coastal Research,2020-06-01,Beijing University of Technology;Beihang University;Beijing College of Social Administration;Anyang Preschool Education College,coastal provinces and cities ;  regional economic growth ;  Scientific and technological innovation ability of colleges and universities ;  space panel ;  spatial spillover effect
The Efficiency Analysis Model of Technological Innovation Resource Allocation of Coastal Enterprises Based on Genetic Algorithm,"Sun, G.; Chen, H., and Mao, Y., 2020. The efficiency analysis model of technological innovation resource allocation of coastal enterprises based on genetic algorithm. In: Yang, Y.; Mi, C.; Zhao, L., and Lam, S. (eds.), Global Topics and New Trends in Coastal Research: Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 103, pp. 691-695. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. With the continuous development of marine technology, the tasks of marine survey, exploration, navigation, transportation and development are becoming more and more serious. It is necessary to pay attention to the problem of planning resource allocation in coastal areas, so as to design a more reasonable resource allocation scheme. The traditional analysis model can only converge locally, resulting in the deviation of the analysis results of resource allocation efficiency. Therefore, the construction method of the efficiency analysis model of technological innovation resource allocation of coastal enterprises based on genetic algorithm is proposed. According to the relationship between fuzzy operator and fuzzy scale, this method calculates the carrying capacity of coastal environmental resources. In light of the prediction results of the dynamic demand forecast function of emergency resources, it sets the evaluation weight of the efficiency of technological innovation resource allocation of coastal enterprises. Based on the global convergence characteristics of genetic algorithm, it realizes the construction of the efficiency analysis model of technological innovation resource allocation of coastal enterprises. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional method, the model based on genetic algorithm has stronger convergence and can achieve global data convergence. It can be seen that the analysis results of this model accord with the reality and can be applied to the analysis of resource allocation efficiency at this stage.","Sun, Guangyu;Chen, Huanyu;Mao, Yihua",Journal,Journal of Coastal Research,2020-06-01,College of Civil Engineering and Architecture Zhejiang University;Zhejiang University,coastal enterprises ;  efficiency analysis model ;  Genetic algorithm ;  technological innovation resource allocation

This paper studies the interactive mechanism between the characteristic town of Zhejiang Province and the industrial upgrading. We examined how aspects of characteristic town influenced industrial upgrading, such as industry merit-based and synergistic mechanism, mechanism of technological innovation and mechanism of brand effect - high consumption. In a longitudinal, multiple-informant study of characteristic towns in Zhejiang Province, we found that industry merit-based and synergistic mechanism, mechanism of technological innovation and mechanism of brand effect - high consumption and their interrelationships selectively influenced planning and development of a characteristic town. As anticipated, industry merit-based and synergistic mechanism and mechanism of technological innovation positively influenced characteristic town, they can promote industrial transformation and upgrading. Counter to our expectations, however, mechanism of brand effect - high consumption by itself was negatively associated with characteristic town. Interestingly, the three mechanisms played a significant role in characteristic town, as it positively influenced industrial transformation and upgrading.","Tang, Honglei;Wei, Zhen;Xiao, Hanjie",Journal,Journal of Coastal Research,2020-06-01,Huzhou University,Characteristic town ;  industrial upgrading ;  interactive mechanism

Improvements in patient monitoring in the intensive care unit: Survey study,"Background: Due to demographic change and, more recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent. One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.","Poncette, Akira Sebastian;Mosch, Lina;Spies, Claudia;Schmieding, Malte;Schiefenhövel, Fridtjof;Krampe, Henning;Balzer, Felix",Journal,Journal of Medical Internet Research,2020-06-01,Berliner Institut für Gesundheitsforschung;Einstein Center Digital Future,Digital health ;  Email ;  Intensive care medicine ;  Intensive care unit ;  Monitoring ;  Online survey ;  Patient monitoring ;  REDCap ;  Technological innovation ;  Transdisciplinary ;  Usability ;  User-centered

Thoughts of the combination of medicine and engineering and collaborative innovation on surgery in China,"The combination of medicine and engineering is a new interdisciplinary subject, which is a mode of cross integration and collaborative innovation between medical science and engineering. The combination and collaborative innovation of medicine and industry means more about the improvement, innovation and R&D of medical devices. However, the combination of traditional industry with biomedical engineering, modern medical imaging technology, electronic information technology and other high ⁃ tech in medical device industry is a reflection of the manufacturing industry and high ⁃ tech level of a country. The development mode of medical industry integration and collaborative innovation in China is mainly to merge medical colleges and universities with science and engineering colleges, promote the cross of different departments, and set up biomedical engineering specialty under the support of a series of relevant national policies, relying on large⁃scale comprehensive hospitals and research institutes, establish numerous research centers of translational medicine, thus achieving a series of achievements. Our team has made some explorations in the practice of the combination of medicine and engineering, including the utility model patent ""reusable simple anal expander"" and ""incision protective cover of transanal multi⁃channel endoscopic surgery operation platform"", which have been authorized by the State Intellectual Property Office, meanwhile the ultra ⁃ fine laparoscope, intragastric gasbag and other projects have been demonstrated by relevant research and development teams and are to be transformed into production. On January 10, 2020, with the approval of Guangdong Pharmaceutical Association, the Medical Innovation and Transformation Expert Committee of Guangdong Pharmaceutical Association was established jointly with the representatives of medical colleagues, scientific research institutions and enterprises, who are interested in the combination of medical industry and collaborative innovation. This Committee provides a platform for the exchange of medical colleagues, scientific research institutions and enterprises. We realize that clinical practice is the source of the combination of medical workers and collaborative innovation, and clinicians are the driving force of the combination of medical workers and collaborative innovation. At present, the main problems faced by the development of medical industry integration in China are as follows: insufficient integration of medical industry integration disciplines in the basic research stage; less interaction of clinical application needs in the application research stage; difficult transformation of scientific research achievements; the unconnected whole chain of ""production, learning, research and application"". If we can increase the investment in scientific research and policy incentives, strengthen the communication and interaction with enterprises, pay more attentions to the social and economic benefits of the promotion of achievements, open the whole process of the combination of medicine and industry, and improve the evaluation mechanism of the innovation ability of such combination, combination of medicine and engineering and collaborative innovation in China will enter the golden period of rapid development.","Lyu, Zejian;Li, Yong",Journal,Chinese Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery / Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi,2020-06-01,Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital of Southern Medical University,Collaborative innovation ;  Combination of medicine and engineering ;  Development ;  Surgery
"Integrated Security, Safety, and Privacy Risk Assessment Framework for Medical Devices","The substantial improvements and innovations in communication networks and bio-medical technologies have led to the adoption of networked medical devices due to which the attack surface has increased profoundly. Numerous devices in practice were designed and developed years ago without security measures. In such a scenario, the role of regulatory bodies has become evident. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) validates and approves devices before commercialization. In contrast, the European Union (EU) follows a decentralized approach and Notified Bodies (NB) for assuring high standards, safety and quality of medical devices being marketed in Europe. Once the device has gone through stringent regulations including good manufacturing practices, Quality Management System (QMS), labeling, clinical tests, performance standards, adequate storage and packaging practices, a declaration of conformity will be granted, which is a legal binding document stating that the device is conformant with applicable European requirements and can be marketed in Europe. However, such regulations lack a systematic methodology to determine unified security, safety and privacy risk that eventually influence the health of patients. To cover these gaps, this research proposes Integrated Safety, Security, and Privacy (ISSP) Risk Assessment Framework to determine the risk level of the device and required security controls. It is, then applied to a case scenario of an infusion pump and further evaluated by comparing it with current standards and practices.

"Retinal Tissue Bioengineering, Materials and Methods for the Treatment of Glaucoma","Background:: Glaucoma, a characteristic type of optic nerve degeneration in the posterior pole of the eye, is a common cause of irreversible vision loss and the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. As an optic neuropathy, glaucoma is identified by increasing degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), with consequential vision loss. Current treatments only postpone the development of retinal degeneration, and there are as yet no treatments available for this disability. Recent studies have shown that replacing lost or damaged RGCs with healthy RGCs or RGC precursors, supported by appropriately designed bio-material scaffolds, could facilitate the development and enhancement of connections to ganglion cells and optic nerve axons. The consequence may be an improved retinal regeneration. This technique could also offer the possibility for retinal regeneration in treating other forms of optic nerve ailments through RGC replacement. Methods:: In this brief review, we describe the innovations and recent developments in retinal regenerative medicine such as retinal organoids and gene therapy which are specific to glaucoma treatment and focus on the selection of appropriate bio-engineering principles, biomaterials and cell therapies that are presently employed in this growing research area. Results:: Identification of optimal sources of cells, improving cell survival, functional integration upon transplantation, and developing techniques to deliver cells into the retinal space without provoking immune responses are the main challenges in retinal cell replacement therapies. Conclusion:: The restoration of visual function in glaucoma patients by the RGC replacement therapies requires appropriate protocols and biotechnology methods. Tissue-engineered scaffolds, the generation of retinal organoids, and gene therapy may help to overcome some of the challenges in the generation of clinically safe RGCs.","Behtaj, Sanaz;Öchsner, Andreas;Anissimov, Yuri G.;Rybachuk, Maksym",Journal,Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine,2020-06-01,Griffith University;Hochschule Esslingen;Royan Institute;Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University,Biomaterials ;  Cell therapy ;  Glaucoma ;  Retinal ganglion cells ;  Tissue engineering
Flexible-lean processes optimization: A case study in stone sector,"During the downturn in demand in Engineering and Construction Architecture (AEC) activities registered in 2007, the Cluster of Mineral Resources of Portugal (CPMR) put into practice an initiative to boost the Ornamental Stone sector, based on incorporating lean thinking concepts, combined with techniques and technologies to make production processes more flexible. This was called the leanstone hornbook (LH). Since then, the LH has been adopted by several Portuguese Ornamental Stone (OS) companies. For these companies, using the LH means changing their operations to a new model based on (i) their participation in R&D consortium projects, (ii) incorporating the resulting innovations, and (iii) combining innovation with lean thinking. Based on a convenience sample of OS companies, the objective of this research was to assess the economic-financial impact of leanstone operations on Portuguese OS companies. Through a methodological framework based on Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and Innovation Outcomes (IO), indexed to companies’ economic-financial performance, LH was found to generate a potentially positive impact in terms of sales volume, exports, investment capacity and net result.","da Silva, Agostinho;Dionísio, Andreia;Coelho, Luís",Journal,Results in Engineering,2020-06-01,ISG - Instituto Superior de Gestão;University of Évora;Polytechnic Institute of Leiria,AEC ;  Lean construction ;  Lean thinking ;  Ornamental stones ;  Sustainability
Citizen science and sustainability transitions,"Citizen Science (CS) projects involve members of the general public as active participants in research. While some advocates hope that CS can increase scientific knowledge production (“productivity view”), others emphasize that it may bridge a perceived gap between science and the broader society (“democratization view”). We discuss how an integration of both views can allow Citizen Science to support complex sustainability transitions in areas such as renewable energy, public health, or environmental conservation. We first identify three pathways through which such impacts can occur: (1) Problem identification and agenda setting; (2) Resource mobilization; and (3) Facilitating socio-technical co-evolution. To realize this potential, however, CS needs to address important challenges that emerge especially in the context of sustainability transitions: Increasing the diversity, level, and intensity of participation; addressing the social as well as technical nature of sustainability problems; and reducing tensions between CS and the traditional institution of academic science. Grounded in a review of academic literature and policy reports as well as a broad range of case examples, this article contributes to scholarship on science, innovation, and sustainability transitions. We also offer insights for actors involved in initiating or institutionalizing Citizen Science efforts, including project organizers, funding agencies, and policy makers.","Sauermann, Henry;Vohland, Katrin;Antoniou, Vyron;Balázs, Bálint;Göbel, Claudia;Karatzas, Kostas;Mooney, Peter;Perelló, Josep;Ponti, Marisa;Samson, Roeland;Winter, Silvia",Journal,Research Policy,2020-06-01,ESMT Berlin;Museum für Naturkunde;Maynooth University;BOKU University;National Bureau of Economic Research;Göteborgs Universitet;Aristotle University of Thessaloniki;Universiteit Antwerpen;Universitat de Barcelona;Hellenic Military Geographic Directorate;Institut für Hochschulforschung Halle-Wittenberg (HoF);Environmental Social Science Research Group (ESSRG),Citizen science ;  Co-design ;  Crowd science ;  Science and innovation studies ;  Science education ;  Sustainability transitions
Users segmentation based on the Technological Readiness Adoption Index in emerging countries: The case of Chile,"We set two main objectives in this study. First, to validate the Technology Readiness Index 2.0, which originated in the USA and measures technology adoption, in a less technologically mature country, Chile. Second, to explore the perceptions of Chilean users of new technologies to classify and compare them with users from the USA. Data were collected in two Chilean regions through a face-to-face survey with a final sample size of 788 respondents. Latent class analysis was used as a segmentation tool. We obtained five groups of users: pioneers, hesitators, avoiders, explorers, and skeptics. The clusters found in this current study are to some extent similar to those obtained in the pioneering research conducted in the USA, although there are differences in their order of importance. These findings can help companies to adopt innovations to specific market segments. As a result, the rate of success of these innovations would improve.","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio;Grandón, Elizabeth E.;Rondán-Cataluña, F.

On data-driven decision-making for quality education,"Effective quality education is one of the most efficient tools to empower individuals and help them out of poverty and exclusion. The paper is aimed to present and analyse data-driven decision making methodology to evaluate suitability, acceptance and use of innovative technologies to enhance the quality of education. Analysed example of those innovative technologies is Augmented Reality (AR). AR is known as one of the most recent technological advances that can be used as an educational tool to enhance the quality of education. In the paper, user-centered methodology (i.e. model and method) to evaluate suitability, acceptance and use of AR applications in education is presented. Many recent studies have suggested that differences between individuals influence acceptance and use of Information Technology (IT). AR suitability, acceptance and use evaluation methodology presented in the paper is based on (1) well-known principles of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis for identifying evaluation criteria; (2) Educational Technology Acceptance & Satisfaction Model (ETAS-M) based on well-known Unified Theory on Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, and (3) probabilistic suitability indexes to identify AR applications' suitability to particular students' needs i.e. learning styles. In the paper, there is also an example of implementing the methodology using different weights of evaluation criteria. This methodology is a typical case of data-driven decision-making for quality education. It is applicable in real life situations where teachers have to help students to apply IT that is the most suitable for their needs and thus to improve learning motivation, and consequently, its quality and effectiveness.","Kurilovas, Eugenijus",Journal,Computers in Human Behavior,2020-06-01,Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas;Vilniaus Universitetas,Augmented reality ;  Decision-making ;  Learners' needs ;  Learning innovation ;  Quality education ;  Social business
A survey on river water quality modelling using artificial intelligence models: 2000–2020,"There has been an unsettling rise in the river contamination due to the climate change and anthropogenic activities. Last decades’ research has immensely focussed on river basin water quality (WQ) prediction, risk assessment and pollutant classification techniques to design more potent management policies and advanced early warning system. The next challenge is dealing with water-related data as they are problematic to handle owing to their nonlinearity, nonstationary feature and vague properties due to the unpredictable natural changes, interdependent relationship, human interference and complexity. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown remarkable success and superiority to handle such data owing to their higher accuracy to deal with non-linear data, robustness, reliability, cost-effectiveness, problem-solving capability, decision-making capability, efficiency and effectiveness. AI models are the perfect tools for river WQ monitoring, management, sustainability and policymaking. This research reports the state of the art of various AI models implemented for river WQ simulation over the past two decades (2000–2020). Correspondingly, over 200 research articles are reviewed from the Web of Science journals. The survey covers the model structure, input variability, performance metrics, regional generalisation investigation and comprehensive assessments of AI models progress in river water quality research. The increasing contaminants, the lack of funding and the deficiency in data, numerous variables and unique data time series pattern based on the geological area have increased the need for river WQ monitoring and control even more. Hence, this is highly emphasising the involvement of AI models development which can deal with missing data, able to integrate the features of a black-box model and white-box models, benchmarked model and automated early warning system are few of many points need more research. Despite extensive research on WQ simulation using AI models, shortcomings remain according to the current survey, and several possible future research directions are proposed. Overall, this survey provides a new milestone in water resource engineering on the AI model implementation, innovation and transformation in surface WQ modelling with many formidable problems in different blossoming area and objectives to be achieved in the future.","Tiyasha, ;Tung, Tran Minh;Yaseen, Zaher Mundher",Journal,Journal of Hydrology,2020-06-01,Ton-Duc-Thang University,Artificial intelligence ;  Hybrid model ;  Literature assessment and evaluation ;  River water quality ;  State of the art
Towards product-service system oriented to circular economy: A systematic review of value proposition design approaches,"Based on service-based value propositions, product-service systems (PSS) are commonly understood as a means to realize circular economy. However, the design of value propositions of circular product-service system is not widely investigated and understood in literature, leading to the lack of guidance for the incorporation of circularity into product-service system design. This study presents a systematic analysis of 46 approaches that can support the design of circular and/or product-service system value propositions in the context of business model innovation. The research methodology is based on a three-step systematic literature review, followed by a critical analysis grounded on content analysis procedures. The 46 approaches identified were classified according to their theoretical and practical characteristics (development level, nature of data, representation style, process type, actors’ perspective, and purpose). The results point to a heterogeneity of approaches, although most are focused on the development of business models in a broader scope, with no clear boundaries on value proposition design. A critical analysis is presented in relation to the interface of the design scope of value propositions oriented to circular economy and product-service system. The paper proposes guiding principles that can support effective development of value propositions of circular product-service system at the early stages of the business modeling. A research agenda is outlined and indicates key trends oriented towards the development of an integrated and systemic approach based on a multiple stakeholder perspective, definition of design options of value propositions of circular product-service system, exploitation of perceived value, and more quantitative and empirical studies.","Fernandes, Sânia da Costa;Pigosso, Daniela C.A.;McAloone, Tim C.;Rozenfeld, Henrique",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-06-01,Technical University of Denmark;Universidade de São Paulo,Business model innovation ;  Circular economy ;  Circular product-service system ;  Product-service system ;  Value proposition design
Implementing the Innovation Agenda: A Study of Change at a Research Funding Agency,"With the rise of an innovation agenda in science policy, previous studies have identified a shift in how the state delegates responsibility to funding agencies in order to change the behaviour of the scientific community. This paper contributes to this literature through a micro-level study of how one of Canada’s largest research funding agencies, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), has changed resource allocation for research over 25 years. Our study foregrounds research funding agencies as key sites for examining the reconfiguration of the relationship between the state and science, as expressed in programmatic and resource allocation decisions. Through analysis of an original dataset compiled from NSERC’s funding and documentary data, we demonstrate the relationship between the introduction of innovation objectives in funding instruments, the adoption of new delegation modes to guide resource allocation, and changes in funding among research fields over time. Our study empirically demonstrates the cumulative effect of programmatic and funding decisions in a major agency, going beyond previous accounts of more general trends at the national level.","Veletanlić, Emina;Sá, Creso",Journal,Minerva,2020-06-01,University of Toronto,Canada ;  Delegation modes ;  Innovation ;  Principal-agent theory ;  Research councils ;  Research policy
3D printed tissue and organ using additive manufacturing: An overview,"Background: Research papers on Additive Manufacturing (AM)/3D printing in tissue/organ printing are studied to understand its capability for tissue and organ printing with and new advancement in the medical field. Aim of the research: To study and discuss the advantages and limitations of AM when used for printing of customised scaffold, tissue and organ, which are a challenge to the medical field. Materials and methods: This literature-based study understands the creation of innovation in the medical field and its different areas to address upcoming challenges. Thus, relevant research papers from the Scopus database are identified and purposefully analysed. Result: Studied the main components of additive manufacturing as required for tissue and organ printing and process used to create tissue/organ by using this technology. We have further identified different materials based requirements for tissue and organ printing and how this technology can fulfil this requirement to save the life of the patient. Finally, this paper identifies eight significant advancements of AM in the medical field with a brief description and limitations when additive manufacturing is used for tissue and organ printing. Conclusion: In the current scenario, tissue engineering and cell therapy employ an innovative approach to reduce the mortality rate. However, the main challenge for this is customisation, which is somewhat taken up by AM technologies. This technology has already addressed different challenges in the medical field. For tissue and organ printing, this technique seems better as compared to 2D conventional cell technique. With the help of scanned data, 3D printing allows us to create intricate internal structures. Thus, it can be used to develop bone tissues, which are required for clinical applications towards the treatment of bone defects. It also plays an outstanding role in cardiac masses, heart disease, physiology, electrophysiology, tested for diagnosis and better treatment of valvular heart disease. Doctors and surgeon easily understand the aortic valve of the patient. It improves post-surgery, blood flow and helps proper selection of devices including stents. AM is to take up the challenge for the development of artificial bone with biomechanical properties as similar to bone. It uses the material in the form of powder, wire and ceramic. It has promising applications to print liver tissue and liver cell and fulfils the requirement of customisation in different fields.","Javaid, Mohd;Haleem, Abid",Journal,Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health,2020-06-01,Jamia Millia Islamia,3D printing ;  Additive manufacturing (AM) ;  Organ printing ;  Scaffold ;  Tissue printing
Reprint of “The role of state ownership and institutions in the innovation performance of emerging market enterprises: Evidence from China”,"Although it has been suggested that institutional context influences a firm's innovation performance, the role of regulatory institutions has been underexplored. Extending previous research, this study investigates whether and how regulatory institutions (i.e. state ownership, region-specific marketization and industry-specific institutional policy) affect innovation performance of emerging market enterprises (EMEs). Evidence derived from a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms demonstrates that state ownership positively moderates the effect of R&D intensity on innovation performance. However, state ownership is not equally beneficial for all firms. Our analysis shows that region-specific marketization and industry-specific institutional policy enhance the innovation-enhancing effect of state ownership. By revealing the role of regulatory institutions, our study points to the importance of looking beyond firm boundaries to understand why EMEs are able to innovate despite their weak internal capabilities.","Yi, Jingtao;Hong, Junjie;Hsu, Wen chung;Wang, Chengqi",Journal,Technovation,2020-06-01,Renmin Business School;National Chi Nan University;University of Nottingham;University of International Business and Economics,Emerging market enterprises ;  Industry policy ;  Innovation performance ;  Marketization ;  State ownership
Requirements analysis gamification in legacy system replacement projects,"The replacement of legacy systems in the public sector is fraught with project delays, budgetary overruns, technological and business process complexities. Moreover, the software implemented to replace legacy systems is developed or configured to largely mimic their features and functionality in order to minimize the disruption to organizational operations that accompanies the introduction of new technology. When the requirements for legacy replacement primarily replicate existing applications and processes, opportunities for business process improvement are bypassed. However, it is difficult for practitioners to transcend the business and systems models prevalent in their organizations for many years. The challenge is to support them to overcome such a difficulty, and be creative and engaged during requirements discussions. Our research aims to evaluate the utility of gamifying the requirements activities during legacy replacement projects for scoping replacement systems efforts in a way that takes advantage of opportunities for innovation while minimizing unnecessary changes to the status quo. The supplementation of the requirements process with game elements is explored in our research through the development of a requirements discussion game (RE-PROVO) and its evaluation by practitioners in two government agencies. Our findings reveal that key elements of RE-PROVO, including competition, anonymity and roleplay, encourage a more critical evaluation of business requirements in legacy replacement projects, but that the success of requirements gamification is contingent on a proper incentivization model which takes organizational culture and values into account.","Alexandrova, Assia;Rapanotti, Lucia",Journal,Requirements Engineering,2020-06-01,The Open University,Digital government ;  Gamification ;  Legacy systems ;  Requirements analysis
Micro-solutions to global problems: understanding social processes to eradicate energy poverty and build climate-resilient livelihoods,"This research explores the agent dynamics, learning processes, and enabling conditions for the implementation of microscale win-win solutions that contribute to energy poverty eradication and climate resilience in a selection of low-income rural and peri-urban communities in India, Indonesia, and South Africa. We define these micro-solutions as energy-related interventions and resilience services or products—used at community, household, small production unit, or business level—that yield both economic and climatic gains. Our analysis identifies five elements critical for the robust design of these interventions: (i) The ability to collaborate and share different kinds of expertise with a range of networks operating at multiple levels of activity; (ii) The application of place-based systems-learning perspectives that enable project participants to integrate different types of solutions to meet different needs at the same time; (iii) The ability to yield tangible short-term benefits as part of long-term strategic visions and commitment; (iv) The use of novel technologies and financial instruments in ways that foreground the needs of poor populations; and (v) The inclusion and empowerment of economically marginalised groups through institutional and technological innovations and responsible business models. We conclude that the most critical aspect of successful micro win-win solutions is support for communities’ own endogenous transformative capacities as this helps ensure that solutions are shared and continuously adapted to changing conditions over time.","Tàbara, J.

The role of R&D and input trade in productivity growth: innovation and technology spillovers,Productivity improvements generally are driven by technology innovation and its spillovers. This study explores the role of R&D investment and intermediate input trade in productivity growth using country-industry-level data for 25 advanced and emerging economies. This paper confirms that R&D investment and intermediate input import/export (both intra- and inter-industry) with technologically advanced economies play important roles in productivity growth in non-frontier countries. We further find that the productivity gains of technology spillovers via input trade channels are likely larger for countries/industries where technology converges to the frontier. These findings imply that the recent slowdown in R&D investment and intermediate input trade in some advanced economies may contribute to declining productivity growth. The potential productivity improvements from R&D investment and free trade as well as the importance of domestic capacity in facilitating technology spillovers should be recognized.,"Lee, Dongyeol",Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2020-06-01,International Monetary Fund,Innovation ;  Intermediate input trade ;  Productivity ;  Research and development (R&D) ;  Technology spillovers

Four-dimensional printing using fused-deposition modeling: a review,"Purpose: This paper aims to provide a review of four-dimensional (4D) printing using fused-deposition modeling (FDM). 4D printing is an emerging innovation in (three-dimensional) 3D printing that encompasses active materials in the printing process to create not only a 3D object but also a 3D object that can perform an active function. FDM is the most accessible form of 3D printing. By providing a review of 4D printing with FDM, this paper has the potential in educating the many FDM 3D printers in an additional capability with 4D printing. Design/methodology/approach: This is a review paper. The approach was to search for and review peer-reviewed papers and works concerning 4D printing using FDM. With this discussion of the shape memory effect, shape memory polymers and FDM were also made. Findings: 4D printing has become a burgeoning area in addivitive manufacturing research with many papers being produced within the past 3-5 years. This is especially true for 4D printing using FDM. The key findings from this review show the materials and material composites used for 4D printing with FDM and the limitations with 4D printing with FDM. Research limitations/implications: Limitations to this paper are with the availability of papers for review. 4D printing is an emerging area of additive manufacturing research. While FDM is a predominant method of 3D printing, it is not a predominant method for 4D printing. This is because of the limitations of FDM, which can only print with thermoplastics. With the popularity of FDM and the emergence of 4D printing, however, this review paper will provide key resources for reference for users that may be interested in 4D printing and have access to a FDM printer. Practical implications: Practically, FDM is the most popular method for 3D printing. Review of 4D printing using FDM will provide a necessary resource for FDM 3D printing users and researchers with a potential avenue for design, printing, training and actuation of active parts and mechanisms. Social implications: Continuing with the popularity of FDM among 3D printing methods, a review paper like this can provide an initial and simple step into 4D printing for researchers. From continued research, the potential to engage general audiences becomes more likely, especially a general audience that has FDM printers. An increase in 4D printing could potentially lead to more designs and applications of 4D printed devices in impactful fields, such as biomedical, aerospace and sustainable engineering. Overall, the change and inclusion of technology from 4D printing could have a potential social impact that encourages the design and manufacture of such devices and the treatment of said devices to the public. Originality/value: There are other 4D printing review papers available, but this paper is the only one that focuses specifically on FDM. Other review papers provide brief commentary on the different processes of 4D printing including FDM. With the specialization of 4D printing using FDM, a more in-depth commentary results in this paper. This will provide many FDM 3D printing users with additional knowledge that can spur more creative research in 4D printing.

It has been estimated a period of ten years and an expense of the order of one billion USD are required. Meanwhile, even if a promising molecule has been identified, there is the need for operative methods for its delivery. The extreme case is given by gene therapy, in which molecules with tremendous in-vitro efficacy cannot be used in practice because of the lack in useful vector systems to deliver them. Most of the recent efforts in pharmaceutical sciences are focused on the development of novel drug delivery systems (DDSs). In this review, the work done recently on the development and testing of novel DDSs, with particular emphasis on the results obtained by European research, is summarized. In the first section of the review the DDSs are analyzed accordingly with their scale-size: starting from nano-scale (liposomes, nanoparticles), up to the micro-scale (microparticles), until the macroscopic world is reached (granules, matrix systems). In the following two sections, non-conventional testing methods (mechanical methods and bio-relevant dissolution methods) are presented; at last, the importance of mathematical modeling to describe drug release and related phenomena is reported.","Barba, A.

Biological Materials: The Next Frontier for Cell-Free Synthetic Biology,"Advancements in cell-free synthetic biology are enabling innovations in sustainable biomanufacturing, that may ultimately shift the global manufacturing paradigm toward localized and ecologically harmonized production processes. Cell-free synthetic biology strategies have been developed for the bioproduction of fine chemicals, biofuels and biological materials. Cell-free workflows typically utilize combinations of purified enzymes, cell extracts for biotransformation or cell-free protein synthesis reactions, to assemble and characterize biosynthetic pathways. Importantly, cell-free reactions can combine the advantages of chemical engineering with metabolic engineering, through the direct addition of co-factors, substrates and chemicals –including those that are cytotoxic. Cell-free synthetic biology is also amenable to automatable design cycles through which an array of biological materials and their underpinning biosynthetic pathways can be tested and optimized in parallel. Whilst challenges still remain, recent convergences between the materials sciences and these advancements in cell-free synthetic biology enable new frontiers for materials research.","Kelwick, Richard J.R.;Webb, Alexander J.;Freemont, Paul S.",Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2020-05-12,Imperial College London,biological materials ;  biomaterials ;  biomimetics ;  cell-free synthetic biology ;  metabolic engineering

Choice and interest in designed learning environments: the case of FUSE Studios,"Purpose: Empirical investigation into the e-learning innovation, FUSE Studios, is both timely and relevant because FUSE is rapidly expanding domestically and abroad and there is continued interest in the interdisciplinary fields of information and learning sciences in the constructs of choice and interest as they relate to the provision and design of learning experiences. In particular, this paper aims to contribute to scholarly and design-based conversations on how e-learning innovations – especially those situated within the digital youth and constructionism strands of research – can be designed in ways that support robust opportunities for learning for young people (Reynolds et al., 2019). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon a large corpus of mixed-methods data including computer-generated activity log data, youth survey data and studio facilitator interview data, this paper examines patterns of use and interest-related experience among young people in a range of FUSE Studios settings across the USA. Findings: The results suggest that student choice within FUSE’s curricular and Studio model tends to support a broad exploration of interests across a wide range of youth, rather than a deep dive into particular Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) content areas. Practical implications: Alongside the broad exploration that was found to characterize the patterns of student choice in FUSE Studios, a striking number of students from those surveyed reported that FUSE supported their interest development: they liked the FUSE challenges, were always able to find something of interest to do in the FUSE Studios and saw the FUSE challenges are supportive of their current and future interests. (See similar findings in Stevens et al., 2016). We understand these student self-reported experiences as evidence that the FUSE Studios model did well to encourage meaningful, interest-driven learning experiences for youth. Originality/value: Committed to making research usable for practice, this paper offers implications for future e-learning designs that seek to make choice and interest central to the organization of activity and environment.","DiGiacomo, Daniela K.;Van Horne, Katie;Penuel, William R.",Journal,Information and Learning Science,2020-05-04,University of Kentucky;University of Colorado Boulder,Choice ;  Designed learning ;  Interest ;  Mixed-methods ;  STEAM environments ;  Youth experience
ENLARGING INTERNAL AUDIT RESULTS WITH ACTION RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,"A case study approach is used to illustrate how Action Research methodology can be used by Internal Audit to enlarge the locus of benefits derived from the audit process. Management of a newly privatized Australian railway were affronted by a material spike in the annual cost of compulsory casualty insurance which threatened business plan achievement. Initially rebuffed in their attempts to have the premium reduced, management turned to Internal Audit to analyse why the cost had increased far above inflation and whether there were any avenues for negotiation. Due to the exploratory and multi-disciplined nature of the task Internal Audit used Action Research methodology to coordinate a learning group consisting of Internal Audit and an outside actuary to understand the insurance problem and solve it to the company’s benefit over a three month period. The audit exceeded management’s expectations by achieving a US$1.8 million net present value insurance premium reduction. Furthermore, Action Research allowed Internal Audit to gain novel insights into the escalating insurance premium’s underlying causal factors across engineering, safety and public relations which led to a wide locus of unexpected innovations by operational management at the audit’s conclusion. As the Action Research approach was readily generalisable, management agreed to further trials engaging subject matter experts when necessary to boost the effectiveness of future audits.","Kelly, Chris",Trade Journal,EDPACS,2020-05-03,,
"Imaging porphyry copper alteration using aeromagnetic data at Highland Valley Copper, British Columbia, Canada","We evaluated imaging alteration associated with porphyry copper style mineralisation using aeromagnetic data in the Highland Valley Copper (HVC) district as part of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Canada Mining Innovation Council (CMIC) Footprints project. The first step of the investigation involved construction of a 3D geological model based on surface and regional information, and petrophysical data of the host rocks. From the petrophysics, it was observed that hydrothermal alteration affected the magnetic susceptibility of some batholithic host rocks at HVC, and low susceptibility values were associated with the altered rocks. From this observation, an alteration index was devised, differencing, based on the magnetic susceptibility, between unaltered and altered batholith host rocks. Three-dimensional inversions were conducted using geological constraints obtained from surface and borehole geology as well as physical property data. Then the alteration index methodology was tested using 3D inversions and residual models within five overlapping blocks covering portions of the batholith. The indices inferred from inverted susceptibility were compared to surface mapped alteration. For some felsic facies of the batholith, the alteration index derived from inverted magnetic susceptibility corresponds to the mapped alteration and delineates the known porphyry Cu system district. However, it is not true for others where alteration was less magnetite-destructive and more focused in structures.","Vallée, Marc A.;Byrne, Kevin;King, Julia J.;Lee, Robert G.;Lesage, Guillaume;Farquharson, Colin G.;Chouteau, Michel;Enkin, Randolph J.",Journal,Exploration Geophysics,2020-05-03,University of Alberta;Polytechnique Montréal;Memorial University of Newfoundland;Geological Survey of Canada;The University of British Columbia;Consultant,Airborne magnetics ;  imaging ;  inversion
Comparing grounded theory and phenomenology as methods to understand lived experience of engineering educators implementing problem-based learning,"Convincing teachers to implement pedagogical innovations is notoriously hard. This research project investigated the shift in pedagogical approach among a small group of faculty as they replaced traditional lecture-based methods with problem-based learning projects. Interviews were conducted with eight drivers of this change, around the question: What was it like to be part of a learning group focused on tangible change toward student-centred learning? Objectives were to understand how pedagogical change happened in an electrical engineering programme at a post-secondary institution in Ireland; analyse data using two different research methods; describe the processes, results, and findings, determining: To what extents do the research methods of grounded theory and phenomenology fit our data and yield relevant and useful findings? Results of this multiple-methods approach indicate enjoyment, camaraderie, and grassroots ownership were essential to driving transformation. With this specific dataset, grounded theory produced valuable findings (including a graphic model of change). Phenomenological methodologies seeking to understanding raw, pre-reflective experience were not as effective, because interviews occurred two years after the events and thus interview comments were inherently reflective. This report should be of particular use to teachers and administrators strategising change and engineering education researchers assessing the applicability of various methods.","Chance, Shannon;Duffy, Gavin;Bowe, Brian",Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2020-05-03,University College London;Technological University Dublin,change management ;  Comparative methods ;  faculty learning communities ;  grounded theory ;  phenomenology
Mechanical engineering education handbook,"This book is believed to be the first to specifically address mechanical engineering education. It is divided into three sections: pedagogy, curriculum, and future. The pedagogy section contains seven chapters on various aspects of enhancing student learning. Chapter one concerns research regarding mechanical engineering (ME) students' learning preferences. ME students are much more visual and prefer more problem solving compared to the general population. Chapter two is on leveraging technology to elevate pedagogy. The authors show many different ways of using technologies, such as the use of iMovie and Doceri, to enhance the practice of teaching. Chapter three on mastery-based learning concerns assessing students on what skills they can do well rather than almost solely on how well they do on exams. Chapter four discusses how team-based assignments can be used to meet multiple student outcomes. Examples are given for a fluid mechanics lab and a thermodynamics class. Chapter five describes how team-based active learning can be used to expose students to the aerospace design process and industry practices. Chapter six shows how a problem-based learning approach was converted to an entrepreneurially minded learning approach in a mechatronics design course. The application of the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) framework showed a significant increase in the students' entrepreneurial mindset. Chapter seven recommends the inclusion of open-ended problems in courses at all levels to help prepare students for real-world problems, which often have multiple possible correct solutions. Section two on curriculum has five chapters more specifically on ME courses and programs. Chapter eight advocates incorporating more hands-on design into the ME curriculum because of its importance in practice. Chapter nine shows an example of how an entrepreneurial mindset can be fostered and developed in an engineering experimentation course. Chapter ten demonstrates how research has shown that replacing thermodynamic tables, which students often struggle to use, with thermodynamic property charts can help students form better mental models. Chapter eleven discusses the use of active learning techniques to more effectively incorporate the teaching of materials in the ME curriculum. Chapter twelve considers how reverse engineering can be incorporated into the ME curriculum. While original design is incorporated into the ME curriculum, reverse engineering of existing designs can be a valuable addition that can help prepare MEs for professional practice. Section three has two chapters related to the future. Chapter thirteen discusses how ME students can be more effectively prepared for their future in the industry, not so much by changing the curriculum, but by changing the teaching approach. Some examples include less theory and more practice, improved problem solving and simulating the industrial work environment. The authors include those who work or have worked full time in industry and work part time or full time in academia, as well as two relatively recent ME graduates. The last chapter discusses possible future areas of research for improving mechanical engineering education. Those areas include, for example, improved course content, curriculum, communication, assessment, virtual reality, codes and standards, multimedia and innovation/entrepreneurship.","Baukal, Charles E.",Book,Mechanical Engineering Education Handbook,2020-05-01,Oral Roberts University;The University of Tulsa;Oklahoma State University-Tulsa;John Zink Hamworthy Combustion,

Analysis of Bottlenecks and Countermeasures of Ecological Environment Governance in Yangtze River Basin,"Ecological environment governance of the Yangtze River Basin is one of the most important tasks in Yangtze River protection. Significant progress has been made in improving the ecological environment of the Yangtze River Basin after the 19th CPC National Congress. However, there are still deficiencies in the river basin of data perception and evaluation, system guarantee, management support, technology innovation drive, and project governance. Drawing on foreign experience in river basin governance, the ecological environment governance of the Yangtze River Basin should be based on the establishment of a legal, professional, intelligent and efficient governance system to create a new pattern of co-management and sharing of river basin governance to achieve continuous improvement in the quality of the river basin's ecological environment. Based on the characteristics and investigation and analysis of ecological environment governance in the Yangtze River Basin, this paper proposed to establish a reasonable and effective governance evaluation system by strengthening the legal system construction and top-level design of the Yangtze River protection, taking enterprises as the main body, innovating research and development models, promoting the transformation and application of results, leveraging the intelligence and application value of big data, promoting the application of big data and artificial intelligence technologies in governance, take into account system governance at the river basin level and differentiated governance at the regional level, promoting the governance of the Yangtze River Basin ecosystem and the continuous improvement of the ecological environment quality of the Yangtze River Basin. This study shows that strengthening system construction, widening financing channels, using big data intelligence to promote the popularization and application of high and new technology, and to improve engineering efficiency are the countermeasures to break through the bottleneck of ecological environment management in the Yangtze River Basin.","Li, Yunsheng;Wang, Hao;Wang, Xinhong;Tian, Rensheng",Journal,Research of Environmental Sciences,2020-05-01,Tianjin University;China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (CECEP) & China International Engineering Consulting Corporation (CIECC) Huarui Technology Co.

Especially in the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary surgery, the clinical application of magnetic surgery has developed rapidly and is becoming increasingly mature. With the wide use of magnets in clinical practice, the discipline of magnetic surgery has been developed in recent years. After further innovation and continuous development, a magnetic system for clinical application is produced and contains five parts: Magnetic compression technique, magnetic anchor technique, magnetic navigation technique, magnetic levitation technique, and magnetic tracer technique. In the field of urology, obstetrics, and gynecology, researchers have constantly absorbed and integrated the advantages of magnetic compression technique, magnetic anchor technique, and magnetic navigation technique to explore more minimally invasive, more accurate, simpler, and safer operations. Magnetic devices have been used in clinical practice effectively to develop new diagnosis and treatment methods. However, the application range of magnetic technology in urology, obstetrics, and gynecology is limited; fundamental and clinical research is scattered; and the development process is slow. There is still no breakthrough in magnetic levitation and magnetic tracer technique. Therefore, combined with the current content of magnetic surgery, this article briefly describes the development status of magnetic surgery technology and summarizes fundamental research or clinical examples of magnetic technique application in urology, obstetrics, and gynecology. It consists of three parts: Introduction of the content of magnetic surgery system, demonstration of application in urology, obstetrics, and gynecology, and discussion on future prospects. In general, the use of magnetic technology in the field of urology starts relatively early, but the development is slow; the interaction between magnetic technology and obstetrics and gynecology starts late, but the depth and breadth are rapidly expanding. Magnetic technology makes diagnosis and treatment more minimally invasive, more efficient, and safer. Although magnetic levitation and magnetic tracer techniques are rarely used in the field of urology, obstetrics, and gynecology, it is believed that with the advancement of biomaterial science combined with modern surgery, especially the combination of medicine and engineering, magnetic surgery will have a broader effect. Rapid development of magnetic surgery will be achieved, and its richer application will be beneficial to human health. This paper is aimed at introducing advances of magnetic surgery in the field of urology, obstetrics, and gynecology in recent years, providing references and directions for clinical innovation in future research. At the same time, summarizing the current research advances of the discipline is beneficial for further interdisciplinary integration and the mutual promotion between the magnetic surgery system and the field of urology, obstetrics, and gynecology.","She, Zhanfei;Li, Jinping;Wang, Lei;He, Shijun;Xu, Haoyu;Wang, Zhong;Li, Qiling;Ma, Feng",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2020-05-01,The First Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University;Tianjin First Central Hospital;Ordos Central Hospital;Xi'an No.1 Hospital,Magnetic anchor technique ;  Magnetic compression technique ;  Magnetic navigation technique ;  Magnetic surgery ;  Obstetrics and gynecology ;  Urology

Trend and prospect of the magnetic surgery,"Reviewing the development history of magnetic surgery in the past 40 years, it has obtained plentiful achievements. By means of the magnetic surgery, a number of sophisticated clinical problems are solved, and some basic surgical operations are optimized, showing good development prospect. The theoretical knowledge system of magnetic surgery has been established, and it enriches the surgical system, and cultivates a group of medical-engineering professionals. The representative achievements of the magnetic surgery are as below. The related basic researches and clinical researches are becoming more comprehensive in breadth and depth, and the rate of transformation of the research achievements is gradually increasing. Additionally, the magnetic surgery practically serves the clinic and benefits the patients. With the deepening of the basic research and the expansion of medical-engineering cross, magnetic surgery has shown huge development space and has accumulated the potential to lead several surgical techniques to change. At present, global scientific and technological innovation has entered an unprecedented period of intensive activity, and a new round of technological revolution and industrial change is restructuring the global innovation landscape and reshaping the global economic structure. Today, the concept of precision surgery, that safe, efficient, minimally invasive, and maximum benefits for patients, has put forward higher requirements for surgical instruments and equipment. Although the surgical energy equipment and instruments, especially original instruments and equipment, has not achieved tremendous development yet, magnetic surgery pays more attention to original innovation and integrated innovation. It is expected to follow the trend driven by innovation and become an emerging branch of surgery. Therefore, this article aims to briefly review the history of the development of magnetic surgery, focusing on the future development trends and directions of magnetic surgery. In the history of the development of magnetic surgery for more than 40 years, the achievements of magnetic surgery research was observed chronologically. We have concluded that the current development of magnetic surgery has the following four trends. Firstly, the basic research on magnetic surgery and research on magnetic materials are getting more thorough. Secondly, the applied research on magnetic surgery is getting deeper. Thirdly, the cross of science and technology related to magnetic medicine is getting closer. Fourthly, the transformation of achievement of magnetic surgery research is getting faster and faster. In addition, we discusse and summarize three potential development directions of magnetic surgery in the next few years. Firstly, new magnetic materials lead to new applications on surgery, such as magnetic hydrogel software robot used in interventional operation and the application of light-curable magnetic materials used in the endoscopic surgery. Secondly, magnetic materials can be combined with other elements to solve complex surgical problems. For instance, magnet and gel will be combined to achieve rapid liver transplantation, and hard magnet combined with soft magnetic solution for treating the refractory constipation. Thirdly, the new application scenarios of magnetic surgery will be discovered and expanded. For example, the magnetic damping technique used to treat nystagmus. In summary, magnetic surgery shows a good development trend, and there are still huge development prospects and directions in the future. We hope that the magnetic surgery will continue to develop and achieve great achievements in the future.","Wang, Yue;Ma, Feng;Li, Yan;Chen, Huan;Yang, Lifei;Mao, Shoudong;Shen, Baogen;Lü, Yi",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2020-05-01,"Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences;The First Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University;Chinese Academy of Sciences",Magnetic current blocking technique ;  Magnetic damping technique ;  Magnetic hydrogel ;  Magnetic surgery ;  Photocurable magnetism

Analysis on the Development and Innovation of Oil Recovery Engineering Techniques in the New Period,"Since the new period of reform and opening up in 1978, China has witnessed rapid social and economic development, higher living standards, and greater petroleum demands, which further promotes the scale and intensity of oil recovery. Oil recovery is progressing with greater difficulties. Traditional oil recovery techniques can no longer meet the demands for petroleum against the backdrop of today's national economic development, and so we need to further enhance the efficiency and quality of oil recovery. This paper analyzes the research status of oil recovery techniques at home and abroad, illustrates the basic principles of the techniques and the development difficulties, and then explores the future development and innovation of oil recovery techniques. It is believed that only with bold innovations of oil recovery techniques can oil companies enhance recovery efficiency and oil quality, thereby effectively alleviating the contradiction between supply and demand of oil resources.","Hong Li, Shi",Conference Proceeding,E3S Web of Conferences,2020-05-01,,

Rare Earth Luminescent Material Urgently Need Dual-drive Collaborative Innovation in Technology and Application,"In recent years, rare earth luminescent materials, as the core component of lighting, display and signal detector, have been developed rapidly. China has been the largest producer and consumer of rare earth luminescent materials for many years. The article introduces the developing situation of rare earth luminescent materials, and points out the development trends in the fields of ultro-high color gamut display, healthy lighting of full spectrum and phosphor converted near infrared light source. Presently, there are some core problems for domestic industry, such as weakness of original innovation ability, poor goal orientation and lack of industry-univerisity-research collaborative innovation. To solve these problems, we propose to build a collaborative innovation technology platform by gathering superior strength, and dual drive forces of technological innovation and terminal application demand, which realize the leap-forward road from ""following and running"" to ""leading"".","Liu, Rong Hui;Liu, Yuan Hong;Chen, Guan Tong",Journal,Faguang Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Luminescence,2020-05-01,General Research Institute for Non-ferrous Metals China;Grirem Advanced Materials Co.

Open innovation engineering—preliminary study on new entrance of technology to market,"As engineering is required to answer directly and more heartily than before the requirement of society and markets, we want to answer the following questions. What kind of open innovation channels exist, and how can these channels operate as a knowledge funnel to conquer the growth limit of capitalism in the 4th industrial revolution? At first, we built up the concept model of open innovation engineering from a conceptual experiment and attempted to prove this model by literature reviews. Second, we applied this open innovation concept model at the papers of Society of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity (SOI) 2019 Special Issues of Electronics as a preliminary study. Additional field researches on each open innovation engineering channel in addition to research on finding out more open innovation engineering channels are required.","Yun, Jinhyo Joseph;Kim, Daechul;Yan, Min Ren",Journal,Electronics (Switzerland),2020-05-01,Hanyang University Business School;Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology;Chinese Culture University Taiwan,Big data ;  Mechanism design ;  Open innovation engineering ;  Open SCM ;  Open source computing ;  System dynamics ;  TRIZ
"Assessing gender gaps in educational provision, research and employment opportunities in the transport sector at the european level","Serious gaps are found when evaluating the recognition and inclusion of gender aspects in transport strategies, research and innovation. Similar issues can be spotted in the transport labor market, where only 22% of workers are women at the European level. The roots of these limitations are in the low participation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) studies and, therefore, in the traditionally male-dominated transport field occupations. Stemming from the European project TInnGO, the current paper proposes a descriptive analysis to evaluate the gender gaps in educational provision and research in ten European countries. Specific indicators, such as percentages in the gender composition or the presence of university courses dealing with mobility and transport, have been defined and their availability in different countries is verified. In addition, a desktop review of practices for encouraging and supporting women in STEM studies is operated, underling characteristics such as the kind of initiative, the methods and tools used, the target group or the type of promoter. The results of this activity show that a wide network of associations and mentoring operates in various European nations, mostly targeting secondary school students, trying to make females aware of their potentialities in a deeply genderbiased field like the STEM one.","Pirra, Miriam;Carboni, Angela;Diana, Marco",Journal,Education Sciences,2020-05-01,Politecnico di Torino,Gender issues ;  H2020 ;  Smart mobility ;  STEM culture ;  Women in transport
An Evolutive and Scientometric Research on Tissue Engineering Reviews,"Number of publications has been widely used as a measure of research output, especially academic and university research. Number of publications in tissue engineering (TE) has increased year by year since early 1990s. However, after an exponential growth phase, recently publications increase at lower rates, suggesting a consolidation process in which reviews become a relevant and high-evidence document type. The aim of this study is to perform a scientometric evaluation of published literature reviews on TE to assess the status of scientific evolution and confirm the consolidation of TE as a research area. Published reviews on TE from 1991 to 2018 were retrieved from Web of Science core collection and this corpus of knowledge was analyzed by growth rate, research area, source title, and citation. Our results revealed that TE can be considered a consolidating area as it leaves the forefront stage of a gompertzian growth curve model. Original research/review ratio is lineally decreasing during the past decade. The emergence of reviews serves to confirm and refute hypothesis and build up a more reliable theoretical framework as well as a guide for future educational approaches. Distribution assessment of categories and journals indicates the multidisciplinary profile of this area focused on the design and development of new tissues. Biomedical sciences become relevant productors of reviews as they need to support TE innovations with high evidence leading to a safer and more efficient treatment of current injuries and diseases. Scientometric analysis of published reviews about tissue engineering (TE) suggests that TE can be considered a consolidating area as it leaves the forefront stage of a gompertzian growth curve model. Biomedical sciences become relevant productors of reviews as they need to support TE innovations with high evidence leading to a safer and more efficient treatment of current injuries and diseases.","Martin-Piedra, Miguel Angel;Santisteban-Espejo, Antonio;Moral-Munoz, Jose Antonio;Campos, Fernando;Chato-Astrain, Jesus;Garcia-Garcia, Oscar Dario;Sanchez-Porras, David;Campos, Antonio",Journal,Tissue Engineering - Part A,2020-05-01,Universidad de Granada;Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar;Universidad de Cádiz,advanced therapies ;  evolution ;  literature reviews ;  scientometrics ;  tissue engineering
The Influence of Entrepreneurial Mindsets on Student Design Problem Framing,"Contribution: Increased understanding of the influence of a project-based multidisciplinary design and innovation course on students' engineering design thinking, specifically regarding problem framing. Background: Entrepreneurship-related education has been offered to engineering and technology students, but its influence has been discussed mainly in terms of students' self-efficacy or awareness of entrepreneurship or technological innovation, relying mostly on their self-reported data. Research Questions: 1) How do undergraduate students perceive the relationship between entrepreneurial mindsets and engineering design thinking after a project-based design course that integrates entrepreneurial activities and 2) How differently do they frame a design situation after this course? Methodology: This qualitative case study involved 14 undergraduate students pursuing a minor in design and innovation at a polytechnic institute. For more systematic data collection and analysis, a conceptual framework was developed based on literature about cognitive operations for problem framing and entrepreneurial engineering mindsets. Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews and pre-and post-activities focused on problem framing. The interview and activity data were analyzed through multiple qualitative analysis approaches based on the conceptual framework. Findings: The analysis of the interview responses reveals the participants' thoughts on the role of an entrepreneurial mindset in engineering design practice, and the comparison between their pre-and post-problem framing activities shows that they tended to focus more on Customer and Social problem elements and less on Technical and Business problem elements after the course. However, important questions remain to better understand the impact of this change on their design abilities.","Kim, Eunhye;Strimel, Greg J.",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Education,2020-05-01,Purdue Polytechnic Institute;Purdue University,Capstone projects ;  design thinking ;  entrepreneurship ;  innovation ;  multidisciplinary design ;  problem based learning ;  problem definition
Integrating Artificial and Human Intelligence: A Partnership for Responsible Innovation in Biomedical Engineering and Medicine,"Historically, the term ""artificial intelligence"" dates to 1956 when it was first used in a conference at Dartmouth College in the US. Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large.","Dzobo, Kevin;Adotey, Sampson;Thomford, Nicholas E.;Dzobo, Witness",Journal,OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology,2020-05-01,International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology;University of Portsmouth;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust;University of Cape Town,Artificial intelligence ;  Automation ;  Biomedical engineering ;  Deep learning ;  Health care innovation ;  Neural networks

However, for various reasons, this potential is rarely realised. Aims: This paper aims to present a collaborative approach to innovation between clinicians and engineers, using two nursing case studies as examples. Suggestions are offered to improve facilitation of innovation in healthcare settings. Methods: An engineering design process was applied to develop novel medical devices in response to unmet clinical needs identified by nurses. This process includes problem exploration, definition of project scope, concept generation, detailed design, manufacture, prototype evaluation and iterative design improvements. Results: Two case studies are presented to showcase the results of this multidisciplinary approach to innovation. Both projects resulted in novel medical devices being put into clinical use safely and effectively. Conclusions: Collaboration between nurses and engineers facilitates rapid iteration of novel solutions to unmet clinical needs. Both professions have similar approaches to problem-solving, complemented by specialist knowledge in their contrasting areas of expertise, making for a highly capable multidisciplinary team.","Andrews, Rachael;Greasley, Sarah;Knight, Sarah;Sireau, Sonya;Jordan, Andrea;Bell, Andrew;White, Paul",Journal,Journal of Research in Nursing,2020-05-01,Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,innovation and improvement ;  instrument development ;  inter-professional working ;  nursing influence ;  patient experience ;  research impact
Statistical data-based approach to establish risk criteria for cascade reservoir systems in China,"The risk management of cascade reservoir systems (CRSs) is a major public challenge, and the establishment of risk criteria is critical to solving this issue. In this paper, an approach is presented to establish risk criteria of for CRSs in China based on statistical data (reservoir dam break accidents; fatalities due to reservoir dam breaks; the construction date of defective reservoirs; and the current situation of CRSs), F–N curves, F–E curves, F–I curves, and the as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) principle. This paper has some innovations in the following aspects. First, the characteristics of CRSs are revealed for the first time. Second, risk criteria for CRSs are suggested. Third, the engineering safety level, risk exposure level, and risk level of CRSs in China are determined. The research results of this paper provide abundant information for the operation management, maintenance and reinforcement of CRSs in China.","Wang, Cancan;Ren, Qingwen;Zhou, Jianfang;Yang, Yin",Journal,Environmental Earth Sciences,2020-05-01,Hohai University;Hohai University Changzhou;Jiangsu Hydraulic Research Institute,Cascade reservoir system ;  Economic loss risk ;  Risk criteria ;  Risk level ;  Societal risk
"Combining high-performance hardware, cloud computing, and deep learning frameworks to accelerate physical simulations: Probing the Hopfield network","The synthesis of high-performance computing (particularly graphics processing units), cloud computing services (like Google Colab), and high-level deep learning frameworks (such as PyTorch) has powered the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. While these technologies are popular in the computer science discipline, the physics community is less aware of how such innovations, freely available online, can improve research and education. In this tutorial, we take the Hopfield network as an example to show how the confluence of these fields can dramatically accelerate physics-based computer simulations and remove technical barriers in implementing such programs, thereby making physics experimentation and education faster and more accessible. To do so, we introduce the cloud, the GPU, and AI frameworks that can be easily repurposed for physics simulation. We then introduce the Hopfield network and explain how to produce large-scale simulations and visualizations for free in the cloud with very little code (fully self-contained in the text). Finally, we suggest programming exercises throughout the paper, geared towards advanced undergraduate students studying physics, biophysics, or computer science.","Vavilala, Vaibhav S.",Journal,European Journal of Physics,2020-05-01,The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science,cloud computing ;  computational physics ;  deep learning ;  graphics processing unit ;  high-performance computing ;  Hopfield network ;  pyt
Towards the integration of modern power systems into a cyber-physical framework,"The cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture provides a novel framework for analyzing and expanding research and innovation results that are essential in managing, controlling and operating complex, large scale, industrial systems under a holistic insight. Power systems constitute such characteristically large industrial structures. The main challenge in deploying a power system as a CPS lies on how to combine and incorporate multi-disciplinary, core, and advanced technologies into the specific for this case, social, environmental, economic and engineering aspects. In order to substantially contribute towards this target, in this paper, a specific CPS scheme that clearly describes how a dedicated cyber layer is deployed to manage and interact with comprehensive multiple physical layers, like those found in a large-scale modern power system architecture, is proposed. In particular, the measurement, communication, computation, control mechanisms, and tools installed at different hierarchical frames that are required to consider and modulate the social/environmental necessities, as well as the electricity market management, the regulation of the electric grid, and the power injection/absorption of the controlled main devices and distributed energy resources, are all incorporated in a common CPS framework. Furthermore, a methodology for investigating and analyzing the dynamics of different levels of the CPS architecture (including physical devices, electricity and communication networks to market, and environmental and social mechanisms) is provided together with the necessary modelling tools and assumptions made in order to close the loop between the physical and the cyber layers. An example of a real-world industrial micro-grid that describes the main aspects of the proposed CPS-based design for modern electricity grids is also presented at the end of the paper to further explain and visualize the proposed framework.","Konstantopoulos, George C.;Alexandridis, Antonio T.;Papageorgiou, Panos C.",Journal,Energies,2020-05-01,University of Patras;The University of Sheffield,Analysis ;  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) ;  Framework ;  Power systems ;  Smart grid

New perspectives on the treatment of mycobacterial infections using antibiotics,"More than 100 years have passed since the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in 1882, as the pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB). However, globally, TB is still one of the leading causes of death by infectious diseases. In 2018, approximately 10.0 million people were diagnosed with TB owing to the development of advanced strategies by M. tuberculosis to resist antibiotics, including the development of a dormant state. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are dedicated to ending TB by 2030. However, the development of strategies to discover new TB drugs and new therapies is crucial for the achievement of this goal. Unfortunately, the rapid occurrence of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis has worsened the current situation, thereby warranting prioritized discovery of new anti-TB drugs and the development of new treatment regimens in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. In this mini review, we provide a brief overview of the current research and development pipeline for new anti-TB drugs and present our perspective of TB drug innovation. The data presented herein may enable the introduction of more effective medicines and therapeutic regimens into the market.Key Points• The Updated Global New TB Drug Pipelines are briefly summarized.• Novel strategies for the discovery of new TB drugs, including novel sources, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology strategies, are discussed.• New therapeutic options, including living therapeutics and phage therapy, are proposed.","He, Yile;Fan, Aili;Han, Meng;Zhang, Yihan;Tong, Yigang;Zheng, Guojun;Zhu, Shaozhou",Journal,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,2020-05-01,Tsinghua University;Beijing University of Chemical Technology,Anti-TB ;  Genome mining ;  Lassomycin ;  Mycobacterium tuberculosis ;  Natural products ;  Phage therapy ;  Synthetic biology ;  Teixobactin
The practice of responsible research and innovation in “climate engineering”,"Sunlight reflection and carbon removal proposals for “climate engineering” (CE) confront governance challenges that many emerging technologies face: their futures are uncertain, and by the time one can discern their shape or impacts, vested interests may block regulation, and publics are often left out of decision-making about them. In response to these challenges, “responsible research and innovation” (RRI) has emerged as a framework to critique and correct for technocratic governance of emerging technologies, and CE has emerged as a prime case of where it can be helpfully applied. However, a critical lens is rarely applied to RRI itself. In this review, we first survey how RRI thinking has already been applied to both carbon removal and sunlight reflection methods for climate intervention. We examine how RRI is employed in four types of activities: Assessment processes and reports, principles and protocols for research governance, critical mappings of research, and deliberative and futuring engagements. Drawing upon this review, we identify tensions in RRI practice, including whether RRI forms or informs choices, the positionalities of RRI practitioners, and ways in which RRI activities enable or disable particular climate interventions. Finally, we recommend that RRI should situate CE within the long arc of sociotechnical proposals for addressing climate change, more actively connect interrogations of the knowledge economy with reparative engagements, include local or actor-specific contexts, design authoritative assessments grounded in RRI, and go beyond treating critique and engagement as “de facto” governance.

"Organoids to study immune functions, immunological diseases and immunotherapy","Three-dimensional organoid culture systems show great promise as innovative physiological and pathophysiological models. Their applications in immunological research have been widely explored. For instance, immune organoids allow functional studies of immune system-related conditions, in a context that closely mimics the in vivo microenvironment, enabling an in-depth understanding of the immune tissue structures and functions. The newly developed coculture organoid and the air-liquid interface (ALI) systems also provided new insights for studying epithelia-immune cell interactions based on their endogenous distribution. Additionally, organoids have enabled the innovation of immunological disease models and exploration of the link between immunity and cancer, showing potential for personalized immunotherapy. This review is an overview of recent advances in the application of organoids in immunological research. Furthermore, the potential improvements for further utilization of organoids in personalized immunotherapy are discussed.","Ye, Wenrui;Luo, Cong;Li, Chenglong;Huang, Jing;Liu, Fangkun",Journal,Cancer Letters,2020-05-01,Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine;Central South University,Immune organoids ;  Immunity ;  Immunological disease ;  Immunotherapy ;  Organoids
50 Years of corporate and organizational foresight: Looking back and going forward,"On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Technology Forecasting & Social Change, we review the evolution of corporate and organizational foresight within the journal and look ahead to the coming decade. We apply a systematic literature review process to identify the major contributions in this area of foresight theory and practice spanning five decades and present a thematic summary of these articles. We reveal the concerns of authors as they have sought to apply foresight in corporations, organizations, and institutions; how they have attempted to resolve the concerns; and the progress the authors have made. We discuss how these authors have cumulatively defined and evolved this portion of the strategic foresight field, from integrating technology with market forecasting, to expanding forecast approaches to include multiple futures and integrating foresight to create agile and adaptive organizations. We use this as a base for discussing current priorities and future challenges in corporate and organizational foresight and suggest three trajectories for further research: (a) further advancing organizational foresight practices; (b) connecting organizational foresight to strategy practice and theory; (c) and connecting organizational foresight to innovation, engineering, and R&D management practices and theory.","Gordon, Adam V.;Ramic, Mirza;Rohrbeck, René;Spaniol, Matthew J.",Journal,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2020-05-01,EDHEC Business School;Aarhus Universitet,Corporate foresight ;  Discontinuities ;  Forecasting ;  Futures ;  Literature review ;  Organizational foresight ;  Planning ;  Scenarios ;  Technology roadmapping

We explain these differences by describing the legal rules and practice governing citation. Empirical validations suggest that in-text citations are qualitatively different. Further, there is suggestive evidence that they more accurately proxy for knowledge flows, consistent with their legal role.","Bryan, Kevin A.;Ozcan, Yasin;Sampat, Bhaven",Journal,Research Policy,2020-05-01,Rotman School of Management;Columbia University;National Bureau of Economic Research,
It's time to bring human factors to primary care policy and practice,"Primary health care is a complex, highly personal, and non-linear process. Care is often sub-optimal and professional burnout is high. Interventions intended to improve the situation have largely failed. This is due to a lack of a deep understanding of primary health care. Human Factors approaches and methods will aid in understanding the cognitive, social and technical needs of these specialties, and in designing and testing proposed innovations. In 2012, Ben-Tzion Karsh, Ph.D., conceived a transdisciplinary conference to frame the opportunities for research human factors and industrial engineering in primary care. In 2013, this conference brought together experts in primary care and human factors to outline areas where human factors methods can be applied. The results of this expert consensus panel highlighted four major research areas: Cognitive and social needs, patient engagement, care of community, and integration of care. Work in these areas can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of innovations in Primary Care. We provide descriptions of these research areas, highlight examples and give suggestions for future research.","Beasley, John W.;Holden, Richard J.;Ötleş, Erkin;Green, Lee A.;Steege, Linsey M.;Wetterneck, Tosha B.",Journal,Applied Ergonomics,2020-05-01,University of Michigan Medical School;University of Alberta;University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health;Indiana University School of Medicine;University of Wisconsin Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering;International Collaborative to Improve Primary Care Through Industrial and Systems Engineering (I-PrACTISE);University of Wisconsin School of Nursing,Health information technology ;  Human factors ;  Primary care
"The role of science, technology and innovation in the UN 2030 agenda","The transition path to inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic development must be Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) intensive. As such, we outline an economic framework that demonstrates the need to transform the nature of STI and reorient it towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) together with the various public policy options that can reorient investment patterns in STIs towards achieving the SDGs. In addition, the Means of Implementation (MoIs) of the UN 2030 agenda will need to be blended to create new modalities of finance, governance and public policy at all levels if STI is to be reoriented and transformative changes in economic, social, environmental and political systems are to be achieved for the SDGs. After laying out a framework, the paper also addresses the implications of our analysis for the UN global Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) which aims to promote STI access, transfer and capacities across nations to achieve the SDGs.","Walsh, P.

Prognostics methods and degradation indexes of proton exchange membrane fuel cells: A review,"Prognostics is a promising solution to the short lifetime and high-cost bottlenecks of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The advances of PEMFCs prognostics research can be divided into two main categories, namely, the innovations of prognostics methods and the innovations of degradation indexes. Among them, the degradation indexes are the prerequisites for accurate prognostics of PEMFCs. Although many prognostics methods have been proposed in recent years to improve the performance of prognostics, the research on degradation indexes of PEMFCs has been slow, and few studies have focused on more effective and more general degradation indexes. Currently, the most widely used degradation indexes are still the traditional indexes, which only reflect the macro-scale degradation of PEMFCs, such as voltage and power. In addition, the traditional indexes change as operating conditions change. For PEMFCs under dynamic operating conditions, especially in transportation applications, it is difficult to obtain accurate degradation information based on the traditional indexes. Due to the lack of more accurate, comprehensive, and general degradation indexes, the existing prognostics methods inevitably have limitations and deficiencies. The purpose of this paper is to provide a full review of the latest research advances in the prognostics of PEMFCs, especially the degradation indexes. Moreover, the challenges and future directions of prognostics research are also analyzed.","Liu, Hao;Chen, Jian;Hissel, Daniel;Lu, Jianguo;Hou, Ming;Shao, Zhigang",Journal,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2020-05-01,State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology;State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials;Femto-St - Sciences et Technologies;Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences;Zhejiang University,Contact resistance ;  Degradation index ;  Electrochemical surface area ;  Membrane thickness ;  Prognostics ;  Proton exchange membrane fuel cells
The evolution and research framework of carbon footprint: Based on the perspective of knowledge mapping,"Carbon footprint can monitor the degree of human stress on the ecological environment and has been widely used to measure the level of climate change and sustainable development. To systematically sort out and analyse the development history of carbon footprint research, a keyword co-appearance and literature co-citation knowledge mapping has been drawn, the carbon footprint research hotspots, knowledge bases, research frontiers, and research features have been analysed, from Web of Science core database since 2008 as a data source. From the review, by establishing a carbon footprint research framework from the perspectives of both government and market, the problems of regional environmental governance efficiency, fairness mechanisms, and carbon emission rights are analysed under the government-led and market-led approaches and reviewed the development of carbon footprint research methods. In addition, the boundary and the applicability of the carbon footprint accounting methods has been discussed. The results show: (1) China is increasingly becoming an ideal for carbon footprint research due to its varied and complicated problem of climate and environment. (2) Future research hotspots will focus more on carbon sinks, land use changes, energy consumption, industrial ecology, buildings, livestock, and international trade. (3) Half-life, burst, and centrality indicate that the knowledge bases of carbon footprint are the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, ISO14040 (2006) and Livestock's long shadow. (4) The latest international fronts of carbon footprint research focus on the carbon footprint generated in international trade, innovations of methods and discrimination and definition of the theory concept, for example, the expression of carbon footprint means the use of either ecological land area units or physical weight units. (4) The research features are mainly concerned with the carbon footprint application of the multi-region input-output model in international trade, multi-scale assessment of human impact on the environment and sustainable development, and resource-environment effects associated with food loss and waste.","Yang, Yi;Meng, Guanfei",Journal,Ecological Indicators,2020-05-01,Xi'an University of Technology,Bibliometric analysis ;  Knowledge bases ;  Research frontiers ;  Research hotspots
The effect of environmental policy tools on regional green innovation: Evidence from China,"Environmental policy tools are an important means of improving environmental pollution and promoting regional green development. Working from a heterogeneous perspective, this study constructed a model using several different types of environmental policy tools and green innovation. Data from China's 30 provinces, spanning the period 1997 to 2014, was selected as the sample, and a multiple regression analysis and difference-in-differences model was used to analyze the data. The results showed that command-and-control type environmental policy tools had the most positive effect on innovations relating to end-of-pipe treatment and green products. By contrast, their effect on clean production technology lacked significance. Pollution charges played a positive role in promoting green process innovation, but a negative role in green product innovation. In addition, the overall effect of the emission trading mechanism was not significant. Despite this, the emission trading system that was independently implemented within some provinces was more successful than the system used within trial provinces that were identified and approved by the central government.","Shen, Chen;Li, Shenglan;Wang, Xiaopeng;Liao, Zhongju",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-05-01,Zhejiang Sci-Tech University;Sun Yat-Sen University,Clean production technology innovation ;  Command-and-control type environmental regulation ;  End-of-pipe treatment technology innovation ;  Green product innovation ;  Market-based incentive type environmental regulation
Research on regional differences and influencing factors of green technology innovation efficiency of China's high-tech industry,"Through the K-means clustering analysis, it divides the regions of China into four clusters according to the differences in high-tech industry development level between 2008 and 2016. Considering ”environmental pollution” and ”innovation failure”, an improved SBM-DEA efficiency measurement model was constructed to measure the green technology innovation efficiency of China's high-tech industry clusters. Lasso regression was used to screen out the factors affecting the green technology innovation efficiency of high-tech industry in each cluster area. On this basis, quantile regression method is used to study the influence degree and regional differences of various influencing factors on green innovation efficiency of high-tech industry at different quantile. Meanwhile, DEA-tobit model is used for robustness test. The research shows that in each cluster area, the factors that significantly affect the green innovation efficiency of high-tech industry are different, and the degree of influence of each factor on the innovation efficiency at different quantile is also different. Combining the empirical results with the reality of high-tech industries in various regions, the corresponding policy recommendations are put forward.","Liu, Chunyang;Gao, Xingyu;Ma, Wanli;Chen, Xiangtuo",Journal,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,2020-05-01,"Shandong University, Weihai;Université Paris-Saclay",Influencing factors ;  Innovation efficiency ;  Regional differences
"Innovation policy, scientific research and economic performance: The case of Iran","Motivation: Why, despite substantial investment in science and technology infrastructure during the last two decades, has Iran performed relatively poorly in terms of innovation and economic output? The investment has been wide-ranging, from the inclusion of science and technology in the National Development Plans to the impressive growth in the number of science and technology parks and incubators. Iran is among the top five countries in terms of science and engineering graduates, and Iran's scientific publications are among the world's fastest-growing. Purpose: This study attempts to discover the reasons for this poor performance despite the investment. Approach and Method: This is a qualitative study which tries to explore the research question through extensive archival data and semi-structured interviews. We also use an inductive bottom-up approach for data analysis, including open coding of collected data. Findings: Our first level of analysis, based on National Innovation Systems studies, will show that there are two main causes: (a) Iran's industrial policies have been unsuccessful in encouraging domestic firms to export or exposing them to international competition. As a result, there are no meaningful incentives for them to approach technological frontiers by exploiting domestic science and technology infrastructures; (b) whereas universities and research centres have played an important role in the catch-up process of other newly developed countries by engaging practically with the problems that face their societies, Iranian universities and research centres have become article-publishing factories. Our second level of analysis will show that behind these two causes are other important latent factors: the power of incumbents and their efforts to maintain the status quo, and the “rules of the game” in the fields of science and technology which have discouraged hands-on engagement. This study analyses strategic action literature, and proceeds to emphasize the role of incumbents and those “rules of the game” in inhibiting innovation and economic success. Policy Implications: Effective innovation policy is not just about investing in science and technology infrastructure, but also about industrial policy, exposing domestic firms to international competition, overcoming entrenched interests and changing paths of career advancement in science and technology so that scientists are less inclined to pursue theoretical work and are encouraged to collaborate closely with business to solve practical problems.","HamidiMotlagh, Rouholah;Babaee, Ali;Maleki, Ali;Taghi Isaai, Mohammad",Journal,Development Policy Review,2020-05-01,Sharif University of Technology,field theory ;  industrial policy ;  innovation ;  ivory tower ;  new organizational form
Customer value in lean product development: Conceptual model for incremental innovations,"As the lean product development (LPD) process is responsible for maximizing the value/waste relation by encouraging different types of innovation, it needs a clear understanding of end customer value. Moreover, lean systems engineering is related to the application of lean thinking (LT) in systems engineering to improve the delivery of value to all stakeholders of the system. Then, faced with this scenario, this research aims to propose a value-adding conceptual model for incremental product innovations in LPD. A systematic review of the literature from the LT perspective was performed and the conceptions of value were identified and then analyzed and contrasted with the concepts and characteristics of the areas of product development, marketing, and consumer psychology, which made possible the proposition of a conceptual model. The results show that customer value is multidimensional, and it was possible to identify the importance and the need for prioritization of certain dimensions of value for specific markets and customers. The conceptual model named VA2I presented in this study is generic and can be adapted and applied in any type of organization.","Santos, Ana Carolina Oliveira;da Silva, Carlos Eduardo Sanches;Braga, Rodrigo Aparecido da Silva;Corrêa, João Éderson;de Almeida, Fabricio Alves",Journal,Systems Engineering,2020-05-01,Universidade Federal de Itajubá,customer value ;  industrial application ;  lean systems engineering ;  lean thinking ;  manufactured products ;  product development

Fostering soft and hard skills for innovation among informatics engineering students – An emancipatory approach,"Informatics engineers are currently in the spotlight of innovation. It is, therefore, relevant to analyse and reflect on how higher education can, and should, prepare future engineers to innovate as expected in this ever-changing world. This paper aims to further research and foster scholarly debate regarding the requirements and implications of teaching innovation. For that purpose, we examine an exploratory case study on interdisciplinary cooperation between two higher education courses, designed to promote students’ active learning of innovation through the progressive development of their soft and hard skills. Both courses engaged in an emancipatory pedagogical approach, mostly grounded in project-based work, active learning, and formative assessment. To obtain feedback on this interdisciplinary cooperation, questionnaires were devised to ascertain the students’ perceptions about this pedagogical approach. Individual responses were collected from both courses and data was analysed through simple statistical procedures. Articulating a priori soft skills development with a posteriori hard skills learning process is perceived by students as beneficial in gradually, yet successfully, understanding the subject of innovation. Also, there were even some external success indicators which showed the recognition of successful innovation skills development in informatics engineering students. Thus, according to students’ perceptions of their experience with an emancipatory pedagogy that connected soft with hard skills development, we conclude that such approach encouraged students to create new knowledge and allowed them to develop the necessary skills to innovate.","Torres, Manuel F.;Flores, Nuno;Torres, Raquel T.",Journal,Journal of Innovation Management,2020-04-30,"Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science;Manuel Firmino and Associados",Emancipatory Pedagogy ;  Informatics Engineering ;  Innovation ;  Soft and Hard Skills
"Promising practices for addressing the underrepresentation of women in science, engineering, and medicine: Opening doors","Careers in science, engineering, and medicine offer opportunities to advance knowledge, contribute to the well-being of communities, and support the security, prosperity, and health of the United States. But many women do not pursue or persist in these careers, or advance to leadership positions - not because they lack the talent or aspirations, but because they face barriers, including: implicit and explicit bias; sexual harassment; unequal access to funding and resources; pay inequity; higher teaching and advising loads; and fewer speaking invitations, among others. There are consequences from this underrepresentation of women for the nation as well: a labor shortage in many science, engineering, and medical professions that cannot be filled unless institutions and organizations recruit from a broad and diverse talent pool; lost opportunities for innovation and economic gain; and lost talent as a result of discrimination, unconscious bias, and sexual harassment. Promising Practices for Addressing the Underrepresentation of Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine reviews and synthesizes existing research on policies, practices, programs, and other interventions for improving the recruitment, retention, and sustained advancement into leadership roles of women in these disciplines. This report makes actionable recommendations to leverage change and drive swift, coordinated improvements to the systems of education, research, and employment in order to improve both the representation and leadership of women.","Saunders, Jennifer",Book,"Promising Practices for Addressing the Underrepresentation of Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine: Opening Doors",2020-04-30,,
State-of-Art Bio-Assay Systems and Electrochemical Approaches for Nanotoxicity Assessment,"Innovations in the field of nanotechnology, material science and engineering has rendered fruitful utilities in energy, environment and healthcare. Particularly, emergence of surface engineered nanomaterials offered novel varieties in the daily consumables and healthcare products including therapeutics and diagnostics. However, the nanotoxicity and bioactivity of the nanomaterials upon interaction with biological system has raised critical concerns to individual as well as to the environment. Several biological models including plant and animal sources have been identified to study the toxicity of novel nanomaterials, correlating the physio-chemical properties. Biological interaction of nanomaterials and its mediated physiological functions are studied using conventional cell/molecular biological assays to understand the expression levels of genetic information specific to intra/extra cellular enzymes, cell viability, proliferation and function. However, modern research still demands advanced bioassay methods to screen the acute and chronic effects of nanomaterials at the real-time. In this regard, bioelectrochemical techniques, with the recent advancements in the microelectronics, proved to be capable of providing non-invasive measurement of the nanotoxicity effects (in vivo and in vitro) both at single cellular and multicellular levels. This review attempted to provide a detailed information on the recent advancements made in development of bioassay models and systems for assessing the nanotoxicology. With a short background information on engineered nanomaterials and physiochemical properties specific to consumer application, present review highlights the multiple bioassay models evolved for toxicological studies. Emphasize on multiple mechanisms involved in the cell toxicity and electrochemical probing of the biological interactions, revealing the cytotoxicity were also provided. Limitations in the existing electrochemical techniques and opportunities for the future research focusing the advancement in single molecular and whole cell bioassay has been discussed.","Shinde, Ravikumar B.;Veerapandian, Murugan;Kaushik, Ajeet;Manickam, Pandiaraj",Journal,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,2020-04-28,Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR);Florida Polytechnic University;Rajarshi Shahu College,bioelectrochemical methods ;  biological assay models ;  molecular mechanism of toxicity ;  nanomaterials ;  toxicological effects on human
40 years of development and prospect on underground coal mine tunnel drilling technology and equipment in China,"The underground drilling plays an irreplaceable role in ensuring the safe and efficient mining, increasing the supply of clean energy and realizing green development. Since the reform and opening up, the underground drilling technology and equipment have achieved a historical leap from nothing to existence to weak to strong. Relying on the scientific and technological innovation of underground drilling technology and equipment, the geological support capacity of coal mine is continuously enhanced. First of all, from the aspects of mine disaster prevention and control, hidden disaster geological factors exploration, CBM resource development and other engineering applications, this paper comprehensively explains the demand of safe, efficient and green mining for underground drilling. Combined with monographs, patents, papers, standards and awards in the field of underground drilling underground coal mines, the development process and representative achievements of underground drilling technology and equipment in China in the past 40 years are systematically reviewed and summarized. In the aspect of underground drilling technology and equipment, the paper puts forward and develops the rotary drilling technology, the directional drilling technology of stable BHA and the directional drilling technology of MWD, so as to realize the leap from uncontrolled drilling to controlled drilling and then to precise directional drilling. Meanwhile, the underground drilling rig, mud pump (truck), drilling pipe, drilling bit, DHM, MWD system, circulation purification system for flushing fluid are developed, which promotes the localization process and upgrading of underground drilling technology and equipment underground coal mines. And the system with independent intellectual property rights is formed which is suitable for the geological conditions and mining conditions of coal seams in China. In particular, the research and development of technology and equipment of high-power directional drilling, automation and intelligent drilling have raised the level of underground drilling technology to a new level, promoted the progress of coal mine safety assurance technology, and supported the release of scientific coal production and high-efficiency development of coalbed methane in China. In the face of a new round of energy science and technology revolution, in view of the new requirements for the development of coal mine safety under the new situation, the development of accurate and fast drilling technology and equipment characterized by informationization and intellectualization is imminent. On this basis, the development direction and suggestions of the underground drilling technology and equipment are put forward.","Shi, Zhijun;Yao, Ke;Yao, Ningping;Li, Quanxin;Tian, Hongliang;Tian, Dongzhuang;Wang, Qingfeng;Yin, Xinsheng;Liu, Fei",Journal,Meitan Kexue Jishu/Coal Science and Technology (Peking),2020-04-26,Chongqing Research Institute of China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corporation;China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp.,Drilling equipment ;  Drilling technology ;  Intellectualization drilling ;  Measurement while drilling ;  Underground drilling

A dynamic AI system for extending the capabilities of blind people,"We introduce an advanced computer vision-based AI system that offers people with vision impairments (VI) dynamic, in-situ access to information about the location, identity and gaze-direction of other people nearby. Our AI system utilizes the camera technology of a head-worn HoloLens device, which captures a near 180° field-of-view surrounding the person who is wearing it. Captured images are then processed by multiple state-of-the-art perception algorithms whose outputs are integrated into a real-time tracking model of all people that the system detected. Users can receive information about those people acoustically (via spatialized audio) using a wrist-worn input controller. Having such dynamic access to information, through AI system interactions, enables people with VI to: develop their communication skills; more easily focus on others; and be more confident in their social interactions. Thus, our work explores how AI systems can serve as a useful resource for humans, helping expand their agency to develop new or extend existing skills.","Grayson, Martin;Thieme, Anja;Marques, Rita;Massiceti, Daniela;Cutrell, Ed;Morrison, Cecily",Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2020-04-25,Microsoft Research Cambridge;Microsoft Research,Accessibility ;  AI system ;  Blindness ;  Design + AI ;  Disability ;  Inclusive design ;  Innovation ;  Visual impairment
Human-centered approaches to fair and responsible AI,"As AI changes the way decisions are made in organizations and governments, it is ever more important to ensure that these systems work according to values that diverse users and groups find important. Researchers have proposed numerous algorithmic techniques to formalize statistical fairness notions, but emerging work suggests that AI systems must account for the real-world contexts in which they will be embedded in order to actually work fairly. These findings call for an expanded research focus beyond statistical fairness to that which includes fundamental understandings of human use and the social impact of AI systems, a theme central to the HCI community. The HCI community can contribute novel understandings, methods, and techniques for incorporating human values and cultural norms into AI systems; address human biases in developing and using AI; and empower individual users and society to audit and control AI systems. Our goal is to bring together academic and industry researchers in the fields of HCI, ML and AI, and the social sciences to devise a cross-disciplinary research agenda for fair and responsible AI systems. This workshop will build on previous algorithmic fairness workshops at AI and ML conferences, map research and design opportunities for future innovations, and disseminate them in each community.","Lee, Min Kyung;Grgić-Hlača, Nina;Tschantz, Michael Carl;Binns, Reuben;Weller, Adrian;Carney, Michelle;Inkpen, Kori",Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2020-04-25,International Computer Science Institute;University of Cambridge;University of Oxford;Microsoft Research;The University of Texas at Austin;Google LLC;Max Planck Institute for Software Systems,Algorithmic fairness ;  Ethics ;  Fair AI ;  Responsible AI
"SIGCHI lifetime research award talk: Icons, metaphor, and end-user programming","Throughout my career I have tried to make computers easier to use-and therefore more useful- for ordinary people.

Within applications, I tried to make the interface simpler by reducing the number of commands, making them more general (""universal""), and making their options and parameters visible with dialog boxes. I also tried to make it possible for ordinary people to program computers, since as long as people can only use predefined applications, they will be able to access only a fraction of the power of computers.

New mobilities: A workshop on mobility beyond the car,"HCI research on mobility and transport has been dominated by a focus on the automobile. Yet urgent environmental concerns, along with new transport technologies, have created an opportunity for new ways of thinking about how we get from A to B. App-based services, innovations in electric motors, along with changing urban transport patterns, are transforming public transit. Technology is creating new collective transit services, as well as new ways for individuals to move, such as through rental, free-floating e-scooters, so called 'micro-mobility'. This workshop seeks to discuss and establish HCI perspectives on these new mobilities - engaging with and even inventing new modes of transport, fostering collaboration between scholars with varied topical interests around mobility. We seek to bring together a group of industry and academic collaborators, bringing new competences to HCI around the exciting opportunities of redesigning our contemporary mobilities.","Glöss, Mareike;Tuncer, Sylvaine;Brown, Barry;Laurier, Eric;Pink, Sarah;Fors, Vaike;Vinkhuyzen, Erik;Strömberg, Helena",Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2020-04-25,Stockholms universitet;The University of Edinburgh;Högskolan i Halmstad;Monash University;Chalmers University of Technology;Nissan Research Laboratory,Interfaces ;  Intermodal transport ;  Mobility ;  Research methodologies ;  Services ;  Transportation
"Speculative designs for emergent personal data trails: Signs, signals and signifiers","As networked sensing technologies continue to infiltrate new corners of the built environment, innocuous daily activities -turning on a light, streaming TV, commuting- increasingly create personal data trails. Assisting users in negotiating permissions for services and managing known personal data trails is currently a significant design challenge. However, as this landscape is rapidly evolving year by year, what is urgently needed is for designers to speculate, ideate and design for emergent and near-future data trails. This one-day workshop will bring together a wide range of researchers, practitioners and designers working in areas such as smart cities, smart homes, responsible research & innovation, surveillance, privacy, IoT, smart energy and beyond, in order to ideate and design around emergent personal data trails. The intended outcome of the workshop is to co-create a suite of signs, signals and signifiers with the purpose of acquainting and empowering users to navigate and manage these types of data.","Snow, Stephen;Khan, Awais Hameed;Viller, Stephen;Matthews, Ben;Heiner, Scott;Pierce, James;Luger, Ewa;Gomer, Richard;Filipczuk, Dorota",Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2020-04-25,"The University of Queensland;The University of Edinburgh;University of Southampton;University of California, Berkeley",Consent ;  Data trails ;  Personal data ;  Privacy ;  Semiotic ;  Speculative design

The HADES Facility for High Activity Decommissioning Engineering & Science: Part of the UK National Nuclear User Facility,"Research and innovation is key to delivering UK Government's civil nuclear energy policy, in particular to accelerate reduction in the hazard, timescale and cost of legacy decommissioning and geological disposal of radioactive wastes. To address this challenge, a national centre of excellence, the HADES Facility, has been established to support research and innovation in High Activity Decommissioning Engineering & Science, as part of the wider network of UK National Nuclear User Facilities. Herein, we describe the development of this user facility, the current status of its capability, and functional equipment specifications. The unique capabilities of the HADES Facility, in the UK academic landscape, are emphasised, including: handling of weighable quantities of 99Tc and transuranics; quantitative electron probe microanalysis of radioactive materials; hot isostatic pressing of radioactive materials; and laboratory-based X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. An example case study of the application of the HADES capability is described, involving thermal treatment of a real radioactive ion exchange resin waste to produce a conceptual vitrified waste form.","Hyatt, N.

Digital Liminalities: Understanding Isolated Communities on the Edge,"This paper brings together three distinct case studies to explore how social isolation and notions of liminality shape ontological security within communities on ""the edge"" of society. Each case study exemplifies the differing nature of liminality in everyday contexts and the extent to which increased digitalisation perturbs it in multiple ways. Taking an ethnographic approach, the research engaged with seafarers onboard container ships in European waters, communities in Greenland and welfare claimants in the North East of England. It posits that technological innovation must attend to the routinisation of everyday life through which people establish ontological security if such innovation is to be supportive. The paper thus moves beyond existing HCI scholarship by foregrounding the contextual and relational aspects of social isolation rather than the technological. It does so by advocating a ground-up design process that considers ontological security in relation to notions of liminality among communities on the edge.","Jensen, Rikke Bjerg;Coles-Kemp, Lizzie;Wendt, Nicola;Lewis, Makayla",Conference Proceeding,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2020-04-21,"Royal Holloway, University of London",communities ;  design principles ;  ethnography ;  isolation ;  liminality: ontological security

We conduct a Grounded Theory analysis of interviews with 12 HCI researchers and find that miscommunication can occur at four origins along the socio-technical infrastructure known as the Media Production Pipeline (MPP) for science news. Results yield researchers' perceived hazards of disseminating their work through mass media, as well as strategies for fostering effective communication of research. We conclude with implications for augmenting or innovating new MPP technologies.","Smith, C.

Performance of shallot (Allium cepa var. ascalonicum) derived from true seed under a dry condition area,"To reduce the dependence of bulbs as planting material, the innovation technology of shallot (Allium cepa var. ascalonicum) cultivation with using true shallot seed (TSS) as planting material was tried. Four cultivars namely Bima Brebes, Trisula, Tuk Tuk, and Sanren were planted at Laleten Village, Malaka District, from April to December 2018. TSS seedlings were raised with a 10x15cm planting spacing or 2,000 plants/30m-2. The aim of this research was to evaluate the using TSS at the shallot cultivation in the areas where the farmers have never carried out such technology. The vegetative growth of all varieties is not significantly different. The productive plants are range from 70 to 75% of population, which the highest was Trisula. The bulbs number/plant highest in Bima Brebes. The number and fresh bulbs weight/bed were 2,293 - 4,601 bulbs and 19.8 - 31.5kgs, respectively. Bulbs weight loss during storage was about 48-65%, which the driest bulbs was Tuk Tuk. The estimated of fresh production was only 5.28 to 8.41 tons/ha.

Concept Design of the Tritium Plant on the TRINITI Site for the Tokamak Ignitor Project Tasks,"The tokamak Ignitor project is one of the main topics of long-term scientific cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Italian Republic. The tokamak Ignitor has a super-strong magnetic field (13 T) and a powerful discharge current (11 MA for 10 s). Ohmic heating is the main mechanism for the ignition of the fusion reaction. The location of the tokamak Ignitor on the Russian side has been proposed to be the complex Tokamak with Strong Field (TSP complex), which is located on the JSC “SRC RF TRINITI” (TRINITI) Joint Stock Company–State Research Center of Russian Federation Troitsk Institute for Innovation and Fusion Research site (Moscow, Troitsk, Russia). The TSP complex has unique engineering and physical and energy infrastructure, but it will be necessary to deeply modernize the infrastructure. In the phase of the deuterium-tritium experiments on the tokamak Ignitor, providing a total tritium flow of 10 to 15 g/day will be required. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the development of a full-scale tritium complex with the entire set of solved tasks for the preparation and supply of the fuel mixture, the purification of the plasma exhaust products, and the separation of the isotopes.","Subbotin, M.;Rozenkevich, M.;Gostev, A.;Bukin, A.;Khripunov, V.;Kochin, V.;Marunich, S.;Pak, Yu;Perevezentsev, A.;Sharova, G.",Journal,Fusion Science and Technology,2020-04-02,"Troitsk Institute for Innovation and Fusion Research;National Research Centre ""Kurchatov Institute"";Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia",fuel cycle ;  Ignitor ;  tokamak ;  TRINITI site ;  tritium
A method to encourage and assess innovations in public tenders for infrastructure and construction projects,"Purpose: Stimulating innovation in projects can contribute to achieving policy goals, addressing societal challenges and meeting objectives within programs and projects. Despite their potential, innovations are rarely included in tender assignments and evaluated in the award of civil engineering projects. One explanation for this is the perceived difficulty in triggering and objectively assessing innovations in the awarding of projects. The aim of this paper is to develop, implement and evaluated a method to encourage and assess innovations in the awarding of bridge construction projects to address this problem. Design/methodology/approach: A design science research (DSR) approach is used to develop, implement and evaluate a method to trigger and assess innovations in tenders for bridge projects. DSR approaches are used to develop “well-tested, well-understood and well documented innovative generic designs, dealing with authentic field problems or opportunities” (van Aken et al., 2016). Findings: The findings show that the application of the developed method in a bridge project led to the inclusion of a broad range of innovations in the tender offers. Despite the broad support for the defined criteria, there were some differences in the way the criteria were interpreted by the public procurement team and by the tenderers. Despite these differences, no legal claims were filed in court. Practical implications: Further development and wider adoption of the method is likely to have a positive impact on the application of innovations in bridge projects. With some adjustments, the method would also be appropriate for other civil engineering and construction projects. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the discussion on how the terms innovation and innovativeness can be operationalized and used in the literature and practice. The developed method provides definitions for assessing the degree as well as the level of innovations in tenders for bridge projects. Further, it provides a way to rank innovations and determine the additional value of the offered innovations in terms of a notional reduction in tender price. Finally, it provides insights into how to encourage innovations through public procurement in civil engineering projects.","Lenderink, Bart;Halman, Johannes I.M.;Boes, Hans;Voordijk, Hans",Journal,Construction Innovation,2020-04-02,Universiteit Twente,Civil engineering ;  Civil engineering projects ;  Infrastructure ;  Innovation ;  Procurement ;  Projects ;  Public policy
"High-value, collaborative networks","Networks that generate collaboration and innovative ideas on a regular basis are characterized in this paper as high-value, collaborative networks. The initiation and development of these networks outside of the confines of a formal organization is analyzed in the context of the Engineering Project Organization Society (EPOS). The society, initiated by Professor Raymond Levitt, has existed for 15 years and continues to grow while retaining a core group of founding members. We conducted and analyzed interviews with society members to develop a framework that describes how individuals can form a core with sufficient pull to enable a network to form, stabilize and grow. The framework provides a perspective on how networks sustain through its individual members, the environment in which the network exists, and the rewards individuals obtain from being part of the network. Each of these elements by itself is insufficient to develop network stability; rather, it is the combination of a stable network core and continuous reinforcement of value from the network that serves to preserve and expand network membership. The development of the framework will benefit both academic and professional contexts by highlighting the key elements required to introduce and sustain a dynamic knowledge network.","Chinowsky, Paul S.;Javernick-Will, Amy",Journal,Construction Management and Economics,2020-04-02,College of Engineering and Applied Science;University of Colorado Boulder,group dynamics ;  Social network analysis

Perdurable and long-term knowledge retention using project-based learning,"Higher education needs to evolve and innovate to prepare students for future challenges and, especially, for developing the competencies to meet the needs of industry. One of the main considerations underlying this achievement is how to improve long-term knowledge retention. Research projects often involve experiential learning; this paper discusses how Semestre i, a project/challenge-based learning initiative, improved the students' long-term retention of knowledge. Having participated in this project for two years, the students involved showed a higher level of knowledge retention compared to the students who participated in the traditional educational model. This was validated by a comparison of student grades obtained in the official national undergraduate exam.","Forte-Celaya, Maria Rubi;Sandoval-Correa, Alejandro;Resendez-Maqueda, Luis Fernando",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2020-04-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Challenge-based learning ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher Education ;  Industrial Engineering ;  Long-term knowledge retention ;  Project-based learning ;  Semestre i
Virtual reality as a tool for active learning and student engagement: Industrial engineering experience,"The opportunity to bring real experience to the classroom in order to promote active learning and student engagement is achieved through extended realities as virtual reality (VR). The use of VR cases in engineering education has promote a flexible learning space (real industrial facilities) and the increasing of the studentś motivation. This research had the objective to evaluate the impact of using VR cases versus using traditional cases in two different campi of a private university, in the same academic course during 2 weeks. The methodology has 3 phases: (1) case design with VR and with the traditional paper case format, (2) application of the cases (VR and traditional) in two groups (no control group, it was the same group). (3) Results analysis based on observations, direct surveys, and students reports. This experience contributed to understand the dynamics of the case methodology under two perspectives: students and professors. While real experience, innovation, and fun represent the student's perspective using VR to understand layout facilities and work design as real application concept, from a professor's perspective this experience derived in more student engagement, critical thinking and systemic perspective. In addition, the process to develop VR cases was for itself an interesting challenge from academic and industrial possibilities, but allows us to develop active learning in-and out- of the classroom.","Ruiz-Cantisani, Maria Ileana;Lima-Sagui, Fabiola Del Carmen;Aceves-Campos, Nancy;Ipina-Sifuentes, Ricardo;Flores, Elvira G.Rincon",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2020-04-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Active Learning ;  Case Method ;  Educational Innovation ;  Higher Education ;  Virtual Reality
"Predicting academic performance with Artificial Intelligence (AI), a new tool for teachers and students","Learning Analytics (LA) is data science applied to the educational field. It enables the measurement, collection, and analysis of learners' data and their context. In this research we utilized two algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence (AI): K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest. These algorithms trained a predictive model for the academic performance of students pursuing an engineering degree. This research found that a general picture of the performance of the group is enough to improve, despite the forecast for each student not being accurate. This allowed the instructor to adapt their teaching technique to get better results. Finally, most students agree to take advantage of LA and they think that knowing their predictive results at the beginning of the course will help them do better in class.","Rincon-Flores, Elvira G.;Lopez-Camacho, Eunice;Mena, Juanjo;Lopez, Omar Olmos",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2020-04-01,Universidad de Salamanca;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Artificial intelligence ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Learning analytics
Research-based learning to attract students to control engineering,"Despite being fundamental in the degree of Mechatronics Engineering, the Control Engineering course is one of the most complicated to understand for a student. Contrary to control engineering, Automation is attractive due to the degree of practical application it has. This paper presents an approach to Research-Based Learning technique that can help solve this problem by combining these two areas. In particular, the control technique called Fuzzy Logic Control FLC is studied. This tool, which has proven to be a powerful methodology for designing and analyzing control systems, is implemented in a PLC Programmable Logic Controller using a Text Structure language. This learning by discovery and knowledge construction will allow the student to approach the research area and especially the Control Engineering discipline.","Olivares Hernandez, A.

Integration of circular economy principles for developing sustainable development competences in higher education: An analysis of bachelor construction management courses,"The integration of Circular Economy (CE) principles into higher education programs can be seen as an important step in achieving true sustainability in higher education. Even though the adoption of CE in higher education has improved in recent years, there has been little research about the effective integration of CE principles into academic programs. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis of the redesign and restructuring of an undergraduate construction management course integrated with CE principles as a methodology to impart sustainable development (SD) competencies; this research was done within the framework of the Tec21 educational model that has been in the process of implementation in the Tecnologico of Monterrey university system throughout its 26 campuses in Mexico. Although the new educational model calls for the development of SD competencies, among others, there is no information available on the current status of the integration of CE principles into bachelor-level courses in Construction Management. Therefore, this study contributes to research by providing a detailed analysis and documentation of the design process for the efficient incorporation of CE principles into such a course. The results of the study show that it is necessary to incorporate CE principles into the structure of course content in order to develop the SD competencies that are demanded by industry now and in the future.","Sanchez, Benjamin;Ballinas-Gonzalez, Romeo;Rodriguez-Paz, Miguel X.;Nolazco-Flores, Juan Arturo",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2020-04-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Circular economy ;  Construction management ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Sustainability ;  Tec-21
Involvement of students in online master's studies of Engineering and Science: A path to minimize the gender gap in STEM,"E-learning provides an individualized course path which provides a user the convenience of pacing one's way through a course. One of the key privileges it offers is the flexibility of the course and consistent delivery of the material. In this study, over 5, 000 participants of online master's studies in the areas of business, engineering and sciences, social sciences and government, and humanities and education were analyzed to find the gender gap between participation of the candidate with a specific emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The results of this analysis shows lower participation of women in majority of the fields with a major shift in their interest over the course of 6 years from education, social sciences and humanities to the field of engineering.

Evaluation of decision-making quality using multi-attribute decision matrix and design thinking,"This work describes the capstone project assigned to two different cohorts in Fluid Mechanics classes. The outcomes presented by our research come from changes in the assessed knowledge of students on vessel hull design using an exam, as well as the students' experience and sentiment based on a feedback survey. The activity reinforced the theoretical and applied knowledge of engineering design. Students designed a transportation system and vessels for the artificial channel of Santa Lucia (Monterrey, Mexico). Access to DelftShip software was granted to the students to provide an opportunity to test different types of boat design concepts and analyze their hydrostatic performance. 'Design Thinking' methodology was used from ideation to the winning solution phase. Students funneled stronger concepts using multi-attribute decision matrices. On average, theoretical exam scores were found to be higher after completion of the project. Moreover, most students positively valued the use of tools such as multi-attribute decision matrices (MADM), project requirements lists, and thought maps. An open-ended question from the survey revealed a positive sentiment amongst the students. The capstone project showed to be appealing and students recognized the value of using MADM and 'Design Thinking' methodology in future decision-making scenarios. Students learned problem-solving and evaluated the quality of their decisions using a matrix analysis, which is an applicable skill in the labour market.","Martinez-Lopez, J.

How challenge based learning enables entrepreneurship,"One of the goals of the MSc Energy for Smart Cities has evolved to the creation of start-ups after educating innovative engineers in the 4 European Universities that participate. The results of the Challenge Based Education applied to 1st year Master students during the Innovation Journey (IJ) using this methodology has increased the motivation of a part of the students for being entrepreneurs and also to create their own startup. The first edition of the Entrepreneurship Journey (EJ) for 2nd year students started in the course 2016-17 with 10 students and 3 start-up initiatives, and the success story of the FlexiDao start-up created. In this paper, the main characteristics of the Challenge Based Education in the IJ that fosters the creation of start-ups in the EJ are detailed for each of the key stakeholders involved: students, challenge owners, teachers and start-up ecosystem. Two of those elements, students and ecosystems, are further analysed in this paper using different research methodologies. The student perspective has been analysed via a survey to the participants in the last three editions with a self-evaluation of their progression using the EntreComp Framework. The ecosystem perspective has been analysed with a literature review and experts' opinions. Main results provide insights on how entrepreneurship is a natural consequence of Challenge Based learning.","Martinez, Ir Mar;Crusat, Xavier",Conference Proceeding,"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON",2020-04-01,KU Leuven;Innovation Manager and Entrepreneur Coach,Challenge-based education ;  Competition ;  Engineering ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Startup ;  Startup ecosystems
Comparison of Different Spatial Interpolation Techniques to Thematic Mapping of Socio-Economic Causes of Crime Against Women,"The increase in the crime rate numbers and a rise in the need to find better solutions to handle information about criminality is affected by the ever-changing socio-economical order of the world. Despite the number of solutions implemented for reducing crime (against women), cities continue to have an unsafe environment. The prime drawback lies in the inability to provide a prompt response in real-time when in danger. Thus, the effective utilization of technology in public safety management is important. The present state of the art solutions focus on technological innovations with limited human intervention and are insufficient in ensuring the safety of the women as and when required. To dig deeper into the root cause of preventing a crime from occurring in a particular place, it is vital to analyze the parameters and factors contributing to the crime in a community. This research applies the Information Communication Technologies (ICT) along with harnessing big data tools to identify crime hotspots and patterns. After a comprehensive literature review, it has been noted that there are different social-economic factors affecting the crime in an area. The proposed work aims to integrate the socio-economic attributes leading to increasing crime against women. Interpolation strategies used for thematic maps generation also play a major role in predicting and studying the area affected by a crime. This research initially identifies the various social-economical parameters that affect crime against women. Some of them to mention include unemployment, illiteracy, population, sex ratio, traffic, age, no. of schools, and location of liquor shops. Subsequently, a comparison of major interpolation methods used in crime mapping: Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW), Kriging, and Spline are formulated to understand the overall contribution of socio-economic factors on the crime thematic map to further ascertain if one parameter poses substantially more important than the other. The comparison of different Interpolation techniques used in pixel by pixel error analysis on high definition satellite images of the crime site, of resolution as high as 2.5m x 2.5m, is created using visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Finally, the thematic maps are created using the best Interpolation technique chosen and help in predicting the pattern of the crime. The proposed framework developed using Geographic Information System (GIS) based visualization and big data tools for crime mapping can then be applied in the development of user interactive platforms and designing safety strategies to help the needy in real-time. To validate the methodology, a case study is performed with real data, in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan, India.","Rastogi, Aamil;Sridhar, Smriti;Gupta, Rajiv",Conference Proceeding,"2020 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2020",2020-04-01,"University of Virginia;Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani",crime ;  IDW ;  interpolation ;  Kriging ;  overlay ;  Spline
Introducing Virtual Reality in an Automated Manufacturing Systems course - First approach,"Currently, Information Technologies (IT) are widely used in the automation of manufacturing systems to exchange data between different workstations along the production lines. To manage the information that is handled, software applications are required that understand communications between various industrial equipment such as robots, CNC machines, parts storage systems, programmable logic controllers (PLC), vision systems and materials handling systems. To be able to perform simulations of the manufacturing processes and allow users to be present in a virtual way within the production systems, Virtual Reality (VR) is used. In recent years, the use of VR has become a key element, both in the Industrial area and in the field of Education. For students, they must know the advantages and disadvantages of the different software applications that allow generating production lines through VR; since in this way, they will know the scope of each of these computational tools. Nowadays, most Mechatronics Engineering curricula do not include a subject that involves the use of VR in the different areas of Mechatronics; Therefore, it is necessary to find alternatives for students to learn on their own, the applications that this technology has in their professional field. The above must be achieved without using the time of normal classes since the original syllabus would be neglected. This article shares the experiences obtained by introducing VR in a Manufacturing Systems Automation course through the use of Research-based learning methodology followed by a sequence of activities. To know the students' perception of the use of VR in their course, a survey was applied at the end of the semester.","Morano Okuno, Hector Rafael;Sandoval Benitez, Guillermo;Lopez, Virgilio Vasquez;Villagomez Guerrero, Luis;Moran, Emmanuel Garcia;De Jesus Solis Cordova, Jose",Conference Proceeding,"2020 5th International Conference on Information Technologies in Engineering Education, Inforino 2020 - Proceedings",2020-04-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,educational innovation ;  higher education ;  research-based learning ;  virtual reality

A design review session protocol for the implementation of immersive virtual reality in usability-focused analysis,"Research and applications related to Virtual Reality (VR) in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry are steadily increasing, being considered as one of the current trends in digital innovation. A convergence is currently on-going between Building Information Modelling (BIM), VR implementation and the soft landings principles, which highlight the need for a smooth transition from design to operation through the early involvement of clients and end-users. In particular, immersive virtual environments could allow stakeholders to experience the full-scale representation of a virtual facility prototype in an intuitive and engaging manner through immersion and sense of presence, promoting feedback collection during usability-focused design review meetings. On the other hand, despite the renewed interest in immersive VR, both technological and procedural challenges to its effective implementation still exist. The latter are within the scope of this study, which aims to address them in a systematic way as a comprehensive guideline for clients and design teams. This study describes the development of a VR-aided usability-focused design review session protocol for implementing immersive VR when clients and end-users are involved in design review meetings. It is the result of an inductive approach associated with qualitative research methods for data collection and data analysis. A case study has been selected as a main research method for facing the first step into the research problem. A further iteration of data collection and analysis was adopted to guarantee the validity of the research, including talks with experts and literature comparison. Finally, the session protocol has been developed in the form of a process map representing all the necessary phases and activities to consider for the effective adoption of immersive VR to evaluate design intents with clients and end-users. As a comprehensive summary, the session protocol fills a gap in the research on the adoption of virtual reality in the AEC industry, which was lacking a prescriptive and structured process to drive the effective use of this technology in collaborative meetings and decision-making processes.","Ventura, Silvia Mastrolembo;Castronovo, Fadi;Ciribini, Angelo L.C.",Journal,Journal of Information Technology in Construction,2020-04-01,"California State University, East Bay;Università degli Studi di Brescia",Design management ;  Design review ;  Procedural guidelines ;  Stakeholder engagement ;  Usability evaluation ;  Virtual facility prototype ;  Virtual reality
The role of intellectual property rights in technology transfer in the context of engineering sector,"After the enactment of Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 1994, the value of technology transfer has assumed much importance. It is a matter of great concern that whether the stronger Intellectual property protection can ultimately reap rewards in terms of greater innovation and increased technology diffusion. India has a vast network of publicly owned research and development facilities. The numerous laboratories under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research umbrella, the IITs, the IISc, TIFR etc, produce world class research in various technology areas of importance to mankind. This paper focuses on role of intellectual property rights in technology transfer particularly for developing countries. In addition to this, Contribution of IPR in the context of engineering sector also is being discussed.","Shanmuga Sundaram, A.;Rajavenkatesan, P.

Managing the product's creation of an innovation-oriented engineering business,"The article is devoted to the study of theoretical aspects and the development of practical recommendations for managing the product's creation of an innovation-oriented engineering business. The article proposes a model for the formation of an innovative engineering product that allows you to create service innovation based on the identified factors of competitive advantage, which increases the likelihood of an engineering company to win competitive tenders. The advantage of this methodology is a comprehensive approach, which includes researching customer needs and their systematization, searching for technological solutions based on patent research, evaluating engineering solutions taking into account technical and operational and market parameters, as well as significance factors, estimating the costs of manufacturing an engineering solution, and also the selection of engineering innovation. The presented methodology for the formation of demand-oriented engineering services can be recommended for use by engineering companies, including general contractors, who are faced with the choice of a competitive solution from several alternative technical combinations. Moreover, the proposed mechanism allows you to take into account the economic type of the customer, the innovative nature of the proposed solution, including the technological / non-technological nature of the innovation, as well as a combination of market parameters, the values of which directly depend on the technical and operational characteristics. It helps to increase the competitiveness of engineering services, which should be reflected in the growth in the number of contracts concluded.","Khaminich, Svetlana;Kuznietsov, Eduard;Ptashchеnko, Olеna;Halaz, Lina;Milcheva, Viktoriia;Boiko, Olga",Journal,International Journal of Advanced Research in Engineering and Technology,2020-04-01,Odesa National Economic University;Simon Kuznets Kharkiv National University of Economics;Lviv Polytechnic National University;Odesa I.I.

Adoption of enterprise social networking: Revisiting the IT innovation adoption model of Hameed et al,"Enterprise social networking (ESN) is still an underused IT innovation; although its advantages are widely recognized, its adoption remains a challenge. This research aims to study the characteristics involved in the adoption process of ESN by using the integrative conceptual model of Hameed et al., which combines the individual/organizational dimensions of adoption with the three-phase adoption process dimensions (i.e., pre-adoption, adoption, and post-adoption). Based on exploratory qualitative research, our research question is twofold: What are the specific characteristics of the adoption of IT innovation involved in the adoption of ESN? What new insights into the adoption of IT innovation does ESN reveal? We identify that “security”—already well known as a characteristic of the IT innovation factor that influences adoption—is a characteristic of the organizational factor too. Eighteen characteristics identified are in line with the conceptual model but not present in the corresponding phases of the adoption of IT innovation. In terms of the innovation factor, we identify that “compatibility” and “security” are new characteristics in the pre-adoption phase, and that “business process re-engineering” is a new characteristic in the pre-adoption and adoption phases. Regarding the organizational factors, we identify that “image” and “information-sharing culture” are new characteristics in the pre-adoption phase, and that “security” is a new characteristic in all three phases. For the environmental factor, we identify that “partners support” is a new characteristic of the post-adoption phase. Finally, for the user acceptance factor, we identify that “perceived usefulness” and “attitude towards use” are new characteristics in the pre-adoption phase, “perceived playfulness” is a new characteristic in the pre-adoption and adoption phases, “user involvement” is a new characteristic in the pre-adoption and post-adoption phases, and “user age” is a new characteristic in all three phases. Overall, we underline that the most critical stage is pre-adoption: this is the period in which most of the characteristics are concentrated, and in which most of the challenges of adopting ESN arise.","Caron-Fasan, Marie Laurence;Lesca, Nicolas;Perea, Céline;Beyrouthy, Sarah",Journal,Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M,2020-04-01,Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches Appliquées à la Gestion (CERAG),Adoption ;  Enterprise social networking ;  Integrative model ;  IT innovation
Commercialization process of disruptive innovations in corporate ventures and spinoff companies: A comparison,"One of the most critical challenges that large companies, small enterprises and research institutes face, when commercializing their innovations, is the transfer process at the moment of scaling up. These organizations often transfer their innovation to either existing business units or create a new business entirely. The process of transferring innovations to an existing unit is known as corporate venture, while creating a new business is called spinoff. Both processes have been studied separately, but not yet together and from different business sectors and countries. In order to understand both processes, this article compares the commercialization of disruptive innovations from these sectors: electronics, information technology, telecommunications, engineering, healthcare, biotechnology or research equipment. The article used multiple case study methodology from commercialization projects carried out in large, small and medium-sized companies and research institutes based in Spain, Germany, UK and Finland. The findings showed that certain activities needed to be done at pre-transition /commercialization, transition/commercialization, and post-transition/commercialization phases to reach a successful transition. Furthermore, the study provides similarities between the corporate venture and spinoff approaches that include team formation, network development and getting the commitment from the company and stakeholders. Additionally, the article outlines divergences between the approaches which consist of innovation readiness, knowledge management or the activities of the post-transition phase. The article also provides insight for innovation scholars, commercialization practitioners, and business enterprises. Therefore, the article contributes to the commercialization of disruptive innovations.","Cubero, Javier Nieto;Gbadegeshin, Saheed Adebayo;Segura, Carolina Consolación",Journal,"Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems",2020-04-01,Turun Kauppakorkeakoulu;Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona;Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya,Ambidexterity ;  Commercialization ;  Corporate Venturing ;  Disruptive Innovations ;  Spin-off ;  Transition Management

Approaches for modelling the physical behavior of technical systems on the example of wind turbines,"Models of technical systems are an essential means in design and product-development processes. A large share of technical systems, or at least subsystems, are directly or indirectly connected with the generation or transformation of energies. In design science, elaborated modelling approaches were developed for different levels of product concretization, for instance, requirement models and function models, which support innovation and new product-development processes, as well as for energy-generating or -transforming systems. However, on one product-concretization level, the abstract level that describes the physical behavior, research is less mature, and an overview of the approaches, their respective advantages, and the connection possibilities between them and other modelling forms is difficult to achieve. This paper proposes a novel discussion structure based on modelling perspectives and digital-engineering frameworks. In this structure, current approaches are described and illustrated on the basis of an example of a technical system, a wind turbine. The approaches were compared, and their specific advantages were elaborated. It is a central conclusion that all perspectives could contribute to holistic product modelling. Consequently, combination and integration possibilities were discussed as well. Another contribution is the derivation of future research directions in this field; these were derived both from the identification of “white spots” and the most promising modelling approaches.","Stetter, Ralf",Journal,Energies,2020-04-01,Ravensburg-Weingarten University (RWU),Abstract physics ;  Behavior modelling ;  Control engineering ;  Design engineering ;  Wind turbines
The knowledge mapping of concentrating solar power development based on literature analysis technology,"Decreasing the levelized cost of renewable energy and improving the stability of power systems are the key requirements for realizing the sustainable growth of power production capacity. Concentrating solar power (CSP) technology with thermal energy storage can overcome the intermittent and unstable nature of solar energy, and its development is of great significance for the sustainable development of human society. In this paper, topic discovery and clustering were studied using bibliometric, social network analysis and information visualization technology based on the Web of Science database (SCI-Expanded) and the incoPat global patent database. The technology searched for papers and patents related to CSP technology to reveal the development trends of CSP technology and provide the references for related technical layout and hot spot tracking. The results show that the global output of CSP technology papers has continued to grow steadily, whereas the number of patent applications showed a significant downtrend. CSP technology, which is at the initial stage of commercialization, still needs technological breakthroughs. Technological innovation that integrates thermal engineering, control engineering, physics, chemistry, materials, and other disciplines may become an effective path for CSP technology development in the future. CSP technology research shows increasing research and development trends in high-temperature receivers, phase-change thermal energy storage, the overall performance of thermal power generation systems, and a development trend from a single technology to multi-energy complementary systems.","Chen, Qimei;Wang, Yan;Zhang, Jianhan;Wang, Zhifeng",Journal,Energies,2020-04-01,"National Science Library, Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chinese Academy of Sciences",Bibliometrics ;  Concentrating solar power ;  Domain development trend ;  Knowledge mapping ;  Renewable energy
Signals and Metrics Identifying Partnerships for Innovation,"The global science and technology landscape is rapidly changing. In an environment where collaboration is necessary for scientific and technological innovation, it is nonetheless challenging to identify and establish relationships between international partners, especially in emerging technological fields where no country has yet demonstrated a clear advantage. This article describes a model to facilitate a quantitative assessment and ranking of national innovation potential based on the integration of established measures (e.g., patents and peer-reviewed publication counts) as well as nonobvious or subjective measures (e.g., national attitudes toward particular veins of research) to predict future performance. Such an assessment can provide a helpful step toward improving projections of scientific performance, particularly for those countries with a relatively limited footprint in the scientific landscape.

In light of this public expectation, a number of challenges are raised for veterinarians and the veterinary profession. These challenges involve: (1) re-envisioning the nature of disease treatment that goes beyond traditional conceptions of health or clinical matters, and which include animal welfare; (2) re-imagining disease prevention at the intersection of animal-human-ecosystem health; (3) developing core competencies in animal welfare science and ethics in order to provide professional leadership in animal welfare; and (4) taking a more active role in the development of novel networked devices, monitoring technologies and automated animal welfare solutions, and understanding their effects on the welfare of animals, human-animal relationships, and the veterinary profession in general. What should leading discourses and innovation regarding animal welfare look like for the veterinary profession in the 2020s? This essay considers four main challenges into which veterinarians are increasingly being drawn, as they respond to increasing public expectation for them to be scientific and moral authorities in animal welfare in addition to their traditional role as trusted health experts. They include: (1) to go beyond traditional conceptions of health by adopting a holistic view that also considers animal welfare, not only disease treatment; (2) to reimagine their professional duties when it comes to disease prevention at the intersection of animal-human-ecosystem health; (3) to develop core competencies/proficiency in animal welfare science and ethics in order to navigate discourses concerning competing priorities and socio-political ideologies and to provide professional leadership in animal welfare; (4) to provide feedback on novel networked devices, monitoring technologies and automated animal welfare solutions and their impact on animals' welfare. To competently navigate the intricacies of the socio-political and connected world as trusted authorities and conduits for innovation in and through animal welfare, veterinarians and veterinary students are encouraged to: (a) develop core competencies in veterinary ethics, animal welfare science and deliberative capacities that are well-informed by current multidisciplinary frameworks, such as One Health; (b) engage interested parties in more effective collaboration and ethical decision-making in order to address animal welfare related concerns within their immediate sphere of influence (e.g., in a given community); and (c) participate in the process of engineering and technological design that incorporates animals' welfare data (such as their preferences) for real-time animal monitoring through adding animal scientific and values-aware evidence in information technology systems. In order to tackle these challenges, four pillars are suggested to help guide veterinarians and the veterinary profession. They are: Collaboration, Critical Engagement, Centeredness on Research, and Continuous Self-Critique.","De Paula Vieira, Andreia;Anthony, Raymond",Journal,Animals,2020-04-01,Universidade Positivo;University of Alaska Anchorage,Animal health ;  Animal welfare ;  One health ;  Veterinary education ;  Veterinary ethics ;  Welfare technology and systems
Evaluation of Technological Innovation Capability in China's Provinces Based on Structural Equation,"Selecting indicators from the three dimensions of innovation environment, innovation investment and innovation output, an evaluation index system for technological innovation capability was constructed. Aiming at the problem that the index system is characterized by hierarchical structures and has existing correlations, a SEM-G evaluation model was proposed for the indirect importance of the fusion index, and the technological innovation capability of 30 provinces in China from 2009 to 2017 was evaluated and analyzed. It was found that the technological innovation capability of 30 provinces in China is relatively weak, and the development of technological innovation capability in most provinces is insufficient. The level gap between innovation environment, innovation investment and innovation output is significant, and the balance between different innovation elements is low. On this basis, corresponding suggestions were given.","Chen, Yang;Yi, Ping Tao;Li, Wei Wei",Journal,Dongbei Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Northeastern University,2020-04-01,"School of Business Administration, Northeastern University",Comprehensive evaluation ;  Innovation capacity ;  Innovation evaluation ;  Order relation analysis ;  Structural equation
"A literature review of disruptive innovation: What it is, how it works and where it goes","The disruptive innovation theory, proposed and developed by Christensen over 20 years ago, has been widely discussed and applied. However, there are still serious misunderstanding and misusing of the concept and connotation of disruptive innovation. Doubts about its practical significance and predictability also remain. In this paper, we attempt to further clarify the concept and emphasize its important role in guidance in practices through reviewing relevant literatures published in SSCI journals. Furthermore, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework to examine the influence factors of disruptive innovation by integrating various research results. We also provide suggestions and implications for future research.","Si, Steven;Chen, Hui",Journal,Journal of Engineering and Technology Management - JET-M,2020-04-01,"School of Management, Zhejiang University;Bloomsburg University",Basic concept ;  Disruptive innovation ;  Influence factors ;  Practical significance ;  Predictability
"Soft, Implantable Bioelectronic Interfaces for Translational Research","The convergence of materials science, electronics, and biology, namely bioelectronic interfaces, leads novel and precise communication with biological tissue, particularly with the nervous system. However, the translation of lab-based innovation toward clinical use calls for further advances in materials, manufacturing and characterization paradigms, and design rules. Herein, a translational framework engineered to accelerate the deployment of microfabricated interfaces for translational research is proposed and applied to the soft neurotechnology called electronic dura mater, e-dura. Anatomy, implant function, and surgical procedure guide the system design. A high-yield, silicone-on-silicon wafer process is developed to ensure reproducible characteristics of the electrodes. A biomimetic multimodal platform that replicates surgical insertion in an anatomy-based model applies physiological movement, emulates therapeutic use of the electrodes, and enables advanced validation and rapid optimization in vitro of the implants. Functionality of scaled e-dura is confirmed in nonhuman primates, where epidural neuromodulation of the spinal cord activates selective groups of muscles in the upper limbs with unmet precision. Performance stability is controlled over 6 weeks in vivo. The synergistic steps of design, fabrication, and biomimetic in vitro validation and in vivo evaluation in translational animal models are of general applicability and answer needs in multiple bioelectronic designs and medical technologies.","Schiavone, Giuseppe;Fallegger, Florian;Kang, Xiaoyang;Barra, Beatrice;Vachicouras, Nicolas;Roussinova, Evgenia;Furfaro, Ivan;Jiguet, Sébastien;Seáñez, Ismael;Borgognon, Simon;Rowald, Andreas;Li, Qin;Qin, Chuan;Bézard, Erwan;Bloch, Jocelyne;Courtine, Grégoire;Capogrosso, Marco;Lacour, Stéphanie P.",Journal,Advanced Materials,2020-04-01,"Motac Neuroscience;Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College;Institut des Maladies Neurodégénératives;Université de Bordeaux;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;University of Fribourg;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois;University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine",biomimetic materials ;  multimodal characterization ;  neural implants ;  soft electrodes
Adapting Gerontechnological Development to Hospitalized Frail Older People: Implementation of the ALLEGRO Hospital-Based Geriatric Living Lab,"Gerontechnology aims at improving the functioning of older people and their carers in their daily lives as well as improving gerontological practices. To promote gerontechnology innovation in the hospital and bridge the gap between gerontechnology developers and hospitalized frail older patients, our objective was to create and implement a hospital-based geriatric living lab. We designed a hospital-based living lab, providing reflexive workshops bringing around the table gerontechnology users and developers, supplemented with an experimental hospital room receiving both the users and the devices to be tested. Three different types of users were distinguished: seriously ill older inpatients, professional hospital caregivers, and informal carers. Three different kinds of devices were also distinguished: prototypes under development, new services and/or care organizations, and new uses. Finally, we were able to open in 2018 the Angers Living Lab En GéRiatrie hOspitalière (ALLEGRO) hospital-based geriatric living lab. ALLEGRO offers the organization of “idea incubator workshops” for users and developers, together with one “experimental hospital room” equipped with validated devices to provide reference measures used as a standard to test the diagnostic efficacy of prototypes. The room is intended to accommodate one older inpatient with severe acute organic failures. No patient selection is planned at admission, apart from consent to research. Until now, no refusal to participate in a study was noted. In conclusion, we offer a new and unprecedented hospital-based geriatric living lab to improve hospital care for older inpatients and to promote successful aging through gerontechnology.","Noublanche, Frédéric;Jaglin-Grimonprez, Cécile;Laignel, Laurence;Sacco, Guillaume;Allain, Philippe;Annweiler, Cédric",Journal,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2020-04-01,Laboratoire de Psychologie des Pays de la Loire;Robarts Research Institute;CHU Angers,Gerontechnology ;  hospital ;  innovation ;  living lab ;  older adults

Unleashing the cure: Overcoming persistent obstacles in the translation and expanded use of hematopoietic stem cell-based therapies,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is broadly used for treating and curing hematological cancers and various disorders of the blood and immune system. However, its true therapeutic potential remains vastly constrained by significant scientific and technical hurdles that preclude expansion to new indications and limit the number of patients who could benefit from, gain access to, or financially afford the procedure. To define and overcome these challenges, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) held multiple workshops related to HSCT and has subsequently invested in a new generation of approaches to address the most compelling needs of the field, including new sources of healthy and immunologically compatible hematopoietic stem cells for transplant; safe and efficient genome modification technologies for correction of inherited genetic defects and other forms of gene therapy; safer and more tractable transplantation procedures such as nongenotoxic conditioning regimens, methods to accelerate immune reconstitution and recovery of immune function, and innovations to minimize the risk of immune rejection; and other life-threatening complications from transplant. This Perspective serves to highlight these needs through examples from the recent CIRM-funded and other notable investigations, presents rationale for comprehensive, systematic, and focused strategies to unleash the full potential of HSCT, thereby enabling cures for a greatly expanded number of disorders and making HSCT feasible, accessible, and affordable to all who could benefit.","Talib, Sohel;Shepard, Kelly A.",Journal,Stem Cells Translational Medicine,2020-04-01,California Institute for Regenerative Medicine,bone marrow ;  gene therapy ;  hematopoetic stem cell transplantation ;  hematopoietic stem cells ;  immune reconstitution
Do research subsidies crowd out private R&D of large firms? Evidence from European Framework Programmes,"We evaluate whether public research subsidies are complements or substitutes to the private R&D spending of large firms. Combining data on the EC's three most recent Framework Programmes (FP6, FP7 and H2020) with data on the world's largest research companies, we use matching and difference-in-difference estimation to compute the causal impact of subsidies on private R&D spending. While, on average, subsidies have not led to increased private research budgets, we identify policy-relevant heterogeneities, finding that subsidies increased own R&D for smaller firms and projects as well as more R&D-intensive firms. We also find that Horizon 2020 successfully stimulated firms’ private R&D spending, while its predecessors did not.","Szücs, Florian",Journal,Research Policy,2020-04-01,WU Vienna University of Economics and Business,Crowd out ;  FP6 ;  FP7 ;  H2020 ;  Innovation ;  Research subsidies
Status of research and development of learning-based approaches in nuclear science and engineering: A review,"Nuclear technology industries have increased their interest in using data-driven methods to improve safety, reliability, and availability of assets. To do so, it is important to understand the fundamentals between the disciplines to effectively develop and deploy such systems. This survey presents an overview of the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and the state of development of learning-based methods in nuclear science and engineering to identify the risks and opportunities of applying such methods to nuclear applications. This paper focuses on applications related to three key subareas related to safety and decision-making. These are reactor health and monitoring, radiation detection, and optimization. The principles of learning-based methods in these applications are explained and recent studies are explored. Furthermore, as these methods have become more practical during the past decade, it is foreseen that the popularity of learning-based methods in nuclear science and technology will increase; consequently, understanding the benefits and barriers of implementing such methodologies can help create better research plans, and identify project risks and opportunities.","Gomez-Fernandez, Mario;Higley, Kathryn;Tokuhiro, Akira;Welter, Kent;Wong, Weng Keen;Yang, Haori",Journal,Nuclear Engineering and Design,2020-04-01,"College of Engineering;Ontario Tech University;NuScale Power, LLC",Advanced technologies ;  Artificial monitoring and controls ;  Decision-making ;  Human-machine symbiosis ;  Innovation ;  Machine learning ;  Nuclear science ;  Robust artificial intelligence
Analyzing influencing factors of green transformation in China's manufacturing industry under environmental regulation: A structural equation model,"The promotion of the green transformation of the manufacturing industry has become the main means to achieve the dual goals of environmental protection and economic growth. Environmental regulation, as an environment governance tool, exerts an important impact on the green transformation of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, this paper focused on the influencing factors of green transformation of the manufacturing industry under environmental regulation. Based on survey data of 500 Chinese manufacturing enterprises (2017), the influencing factors of green transformation were studied by developing a targeted structural equation model. The main conclusions showed that (1) human capital, financing ability, technology innovation, and government behavior all exerted significant positive impact on green transformation performance in the manufacturing industry. (2) Environmental regulation, as a moderating variable, positively affected the green transformation in the manufacturing industry by acting on technology innovation and governmental behavior; however, it decreased the positive impact of financing ability on green transformation. (3) Environmental regulation was a reversal mechanism, which affected green transformation by influencing financing capacity, technology innovation, and governmental behavior of manufacturing enterprises. The study suggested that the government should consider the positive impact of these influencing factors, and design appropriate environmental regulation policies to promote the green transformation in the manufacturing industry to achieve economic green growth.","Zhai, Xueqi;An, Yunfei",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-04-01,Henan University of Economics and Law;Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Environmental regulation ;  Influencing factors of green transformation ;  Manufacturing industry ;  Structural equation model
Should nursing be considered a STEM profession?,"Background: The National Science and Technology Council developed a 5-year plan in 2013 to ensure that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) experienced sustained growth within the United States (US). Nursing is comprised of multiple sciences that include chemistry, physics, biology, microbiology, anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, and the social and behavioral sciences of sociology, developmental lifespan psychology, and psychology. Science, technology, engineering, and math constitute the traditional STEM acronym. Nursing programs graduate nurses with both the rigorous academic coursework and diverse clinical skills necessary to provide patient care. These skills employed by nurses in the clinical setting can serve as the basis for the inclusion of the nursing profession as a STEM-designated profession by the federal government and educational institutions within the US. Problem: Currently, the US government does not acknowledge the profession of nursing as a STEM-designated profession. Acknowledgment of nursing as a STEM profession could potentially make more funding available for nursing education within the US and address nursing shortages both in clinical and academic settings. As well as position professional nurses for careers not only within the health sector but that of business and industry because of nurses’ STEM knowledge. Hence, enhancing the growth of STEM within the US and creating global market economic competitiveness with new innovation development. Approach: In the practice of nursing, nurses apply the sciences, math, and innovative technology in the assessments, diagnoses, and planning of patients’ care. Nurses implement scientifically-based interventions to treat illness and sustain human life and to ultimately evaluate the outcomes of the care provided to patients. Outcomes: Methodologies of evaluation of outcomes of patient care status post nursing interventions (ie, administration of intravenous antibiotics to treat pneumonia) are based upon rationales that have been derived from evidenced-based practice and nursing research; both originating from applied STEM knowledge. Conclusion: The formal designation by the US federal government, for nursing to be recognized as a STEM profession, can increase funding to the nursing profession and enhance the diversity of employment opportunities for nurses in industry and business. Thereby potentially decreasing nursing shortages and bringing national and worldwide recognition to nursing in both academia, industry, business, and clinical settings, as a profession contributing to the science of improvement of the health of all people through STEM knowledge.","Green, Cheryl;John, Lori",Journal,Nursing Forum,2020-04-01,Southern Connecticut State University,education ;  health care ;  inclusion ;  innovation ;  nursing ;  STEAM ;  STEM
AMICAI: A Method Based on Risk Analysis to Integrate Responsible Research and Innovation into the Work of Research and Innovation Practitioners,"The integration of ethics into the day-to-day work of research and innovation (R&I) is an important but difficult challenge. However, with the Aachen method for identification, classification and risk analysis of innovation-based problems (AMICAI) an approach from an engineering perspective is presented that enables the integration of ethical, legal and social implications into the day-to-day work of R&I practitioners. AMICAI appears in particular capable of providing a procedural guidance for R&I practitioners based on a method established in engineering science, breaking down the object of consideration into partial aspects and prioritizing the innovation-based problems in dependence of potential risk. This enables the user to apply AMICAI continuously during all stages of the research and development (R&D) process and to analyze and choose between certain sociotechnical alternatives. In this way, problems that affect ethical, legal, and social aspects can be understood, reflected and considered in the mostly technically focused R&D process. The paper gives a general guidance about AMICAI by describing principles and assumptions, providing the steps of analysis and application aids, giving an example application, explaining the necessary adjustments of AMICAI compared to the methodical basis of failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis and discussing the advantages and limits. AMICAI’s simple applications can stimulate interdisciplinary cooperation in the R&D process and be a starting point for the development of an “open RRI risk analysis platform” allowing society to evaluate innovation-based problems.","Brandl, Christopher;Wille, Matthias;Nelles, Jochen;Rasche, Peter;Schäfer, Katharina;Flemisch, Frank O.;Frenz, Martin;Nitsch, Verena;Mertens, Alexander",Journal,Science and Engineering Ethics,2020-04-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,ELSA ;  ELSI ;  Risk analysis ;  RRI ;  Technology assessment
Technology before engineering: How James Bond films mediate between fiction and reality in the portrayal of innovation,"Imaginary technical devices and machinery portrayed in the James Bond films are known to have inspired real innovation activities. This paper investigates the dynamics of cultural entrepreneurship behind this phenomenon. It presents a hermeneutic analysis of the James Bond film series which identifies various patterns in the portrayal of technology which create labels and vocabularies for innovation activities and cognitive legitimacy for their implementation. These patterns have little in common with systematic approaches known from industrial research and development. They are instead related to general strategies of sense-making among users, which neglect practical issues in engineering. Drawing on Suvin's concept of the novum, the paper describes this as a transformational approach to innovation, which is less interested in the actual characteristics of a new artefact, but rather its function as an enabler for change.","Fritzsche, Albrecht;Dürrbeck, Konrad",Journal,Technovation,2020-04-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Cultural entrepreneurship ;  Film ;  James Bond ;  Novum ;  Objective hermeneutics
The more funding the better? The moderating role of knowledge stock on the effects of different government-funded research projects on firm innovation in Chinese cultural and creative industries,"Based on prior research, this study attempts to examine how effectively government-funded research projects (GFPs) can facilitate firm innovation in the cultural and creative industry (CCI), as well as the internal organizational contingency associated with the effects of GFPs. Specifically, this paper differentiates two types of GFP – central-government-funded projects (CGFPs) and local-government-funded research projects (LGFPs) – and explore how effectively the two types of GFP affect two types of firm innovation, i.e., radical innovation and incremental innovation. Based on an empirical study of the panel data of Chinese innovative firms related to the CCI, this paper finds that CGFPs have an inverted U-shaped effect on both firms’ radical innovation and incremental innovation in the CCI, while LGFPs have an inverted U-shaped effect on firms’ incremental innovation, but they have no significant effects on firms’ radical innovation. The effects of both CGFPs and LGFPs are moderated by firms’ knowledge stock.","Zhou, Jianghua;Li, Jizhen;Jiao, Hao;Qiu, Hang;Liu, Zixu",Journal,Technovation,2020-04-01,Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management;Beijing Normal University,Cultural and creative industries ;  Government-funded project ;  Incremental innovation ;  Knowledge stock ;  Radical innovation
Collaborative modes with Cultural and Creative Industries and innovation performance: The moderating role of heterogeneous sources of knowledge and absorptive capacity,"Organizations can no longer be isolated entities in the current dynamic competitive environment but tend to establish alliances and networks with external parties. Recently, research has suggested that organizations develop collaborative modes with Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) to acquire and combine Heterogeneous Sources of Knowledge (HSK) within their organizational environment. Innovation thus becomes increasingly generated by a cross-process involving a diverse set of industries. Nevertheless, few studies have assessed how knowledge from distant industries, such as CCIs, can affect firms’ innovation performance. Accordingly, this empirical research on a sample of 187 firms evaluates whether formal and informal collaboration modes with CCIs affect innovation performance. Moreover, it assesses the moderating role of both HSK and absorptive capacity. In particular, it aims to answer the following questions. What are the effects of collaboration modes with CCIs on firms’ innovation performance? What are the differences (in terms of effects) between Formal Collaboration Modes (FCMs) and Informal Collaboration Modes (ICMs) with CCIs on firms’ innovation performance? Do heterogeneity of knowledge sources and absorptive capacity increase the possibility of benefiting from FCMs and ICMs with CCIs in terms of innovation performance? The results contribute to the theory indicating that HSK are important to benefit from knowledge from CCIs, while absorptive capacity does not fulfil the same role.","Santoro, Gabriele;Bresciani, Stefano;Papa, Armando",Journal,Technovation,2020-04-01,Università degli Studi di Torino,Absorptive capacity ;  Cross-innovation ;  Cultural and Creative Industries ;  Formal Collaboration Modes ;  Heterogeneous Sources of Knowledge ;  Informal Collaboration Modes
Factors of university–industry collaboration affecting university innovation performance,"The rapid development of technology and knowledge-based economies has drawn attention to the linkage between academic institutions and private industries. Universities are a major source of knowledge creation; different industries are increasingly recognizing the importance of scientific knowledge creation and seeking alliances with universities to not only enhance their knowledge base but also gain a competitive advantage. To facilitate university–industry collaborations (UICs), financial support from governments and industries is necessary for resource allocation. This study investigates the effects of UIC funding on universities’ technology innovation performance in Taiwan. The Taiwanese government has implemented a variety of policies and programs to enhance the research innovation capability of universities and bridge the gap between academic research and industrial application. Three fundamental factors of UIC environments within universities—namely, management mechanism, innovation climate, and reward system—are identified as critical antecedents of UIC funding and universities’ technology innovation performance. The results reveal that UIC funding is directly instrumental to universities’ technology innovation. The UIC management mechanism and innovation climate within universities support diverse UIC funding. In addition, mechanism incentives affect directly and moderately university researchers’ involvement in and contribution to technology innovation.","Tseng, Fan Chuan;Huang, Mu Hsuan;Chen, Dar Zen",Journal,Journal of Technology Transfer,2020-04-01,National University of Tainan Taiwan;National Taiwan University,UIC funding ;  UIC management mechanism ;  UIC reward ;  Universities’ innovative climate ;  Universities’ technology innovation performance ;  University–industry collaboration

Based on the characteristics of the decentralization of local governments in China, whether there are local governments competing to set up major engineering projects at the expense of the environment in order to maintain local economic development. From the perspective of evolutionary game, this paper constructs a game model between engineering construction innovation and local government under the influence of local government's choice of different environmental regulations. Through the dynamic replication equation, the behavior selection path and evolution strategy of local government and engineering construction firms are obtained. The research results show that the strict environmental regulation of local governments and the technological innovation of engineering construction firms can achieve stability at the same time, and the conditions are effective government investment by local governments.","Yan, Xiaoming",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2020-03-30,East China University of Politics and Law,

Critical issue mapping of Indonesian natural rubber industry based on innovation system perspectives,"The added value of Indonesian natural rubber industry is the lowest among other main natural producing countries, Malaysia and Thailand. It is necessary to overcome this problem especially based on innovation system perspectives. The objectives of this study are to map the problems of the natural rubber industry and developing alternative solutions to these problems. This study use systems approach, namely Soft System Methodology (SSM) and Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing (SAST), which aim is to get a complete picture (rich picture) of the problems in Indonesian rubber industry and to identify the strategic issues that become the industry priorities through sectoral innovation system approach. Based on the mapping of strategic issues, it shows that almost all indicators were in a certain planning region. Such as policy issues (general/parent policies, financing policies, price policies, tax policies for R&D and Innovation, education and training policies), Institutional Issues (formation of financial institutions and institutional arrangements), Human Resources, Industrial issues (Development of downstream industries), technology (technology development as needed), as well as financial and market problems. This implied that there were many strategic and urgent problems that must be addressed in the development of the downstream industry and the innovation system of Indonesia's natural rubber industry. It is important to highlight the interaction between innovators, intermediaries and innovation users. In addition to the interaction within the system, interactions outside the systems are also needed, such as foreign research institutions, etc. Government and financial institution support, strengthening the innovation institution and the existence of a legal direction and protection (such as the system innovation law/act) are the key factors in enhancing the innovation-based industry and increasing the industry competitiveness.","Kurnia, D.;Marimin, ;Haris, U.;Sudradjat, ",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-03-25,IPB University;Rubber Association of Indonesia,
Workers’ safety behaviors in the off-site manufacturing plant,"Purpose: Although research on prefabricated construction has gained increasing attention in recent years, limited efforts have been devoted to investigating safety issues in the off-site manufacture, especially workers’ behavioral intentions to work safely. Thus, research is needed to identify the motivational factors determining off-site construction workers’ safety behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to investigate workers’ safety behavior by examining the determinants of behavioral intention in the off-site manufacturing plants in China. Design/methodology/approach: Theory of planned behavior (TPB) was modified and used in this study to explain how the elements in the hypothesized model interact. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Structural equation modeling technique with partial least-squares estimation was used to analyze the data collected. Findings: The findings of this study indicated that workers’ tendency to engage in safety behavior is positively related to attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and behavioral habit, among which attitude toward the behavior and behavioral habit have most significant influences on safety behavior. This finding provides a better explanation on the pathways and the impacts of the crucial factors on the safety behaviors for the off-site manufacture. Originality/value: The possible innovation of this research lies in its attempt to understand the antecedents of workers’ safety behavior in the off-site construction environment, which may make original contributions to construction safety research and practice. The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge in TPB. Corresponding countermeasures are put forward in order to improve workers’ safety behavior in off-site construction.","Liu, Qinjun;Ye, Gui;Feng, Yingbin",Journal,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2020-03-25,Chongqing University;Western Sydney University,Construction safety ;  Construction site ;  Influencing factors ;  Off-site manufacturing plants ;  Questionnaire survey ;  Risk management ;  Safety behaviour ;  Theory of planned behaviour (TPB)
Scientometric analysis of research on “remotely piloted aircraft”: A research agenda for the construction industry,"Purpose: Remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) systems have emerged as an established tool within the construction industry. Concurrent with this trend has been the rise in research on RPA, establishing this as a new field of study within the construction management domain. What is needed now is an assessment of the current state of research in this emerging discipline – its strengths and weaknesses – by which future research on RPA in construction may be guided. The purpose of this paper is to address this need. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 59 peer-reviewed journal articles covering RPAs within the construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods approach, utilizing qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques. Findings: The results reveal a field of study in its fledgling stage, with a limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation, from a limited number of institutions. Key publication outlets are identified, with the main focus of research being in the technical areas of remote sensing, photogrammetry and image processing. Practical implications: The study benefits researchers and industry practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas of high priority in future research. For construction companies, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of RPAs in the industry.

Leveraging integrative research for inclusive innovation: Urine diversion and re-use in agriculture,"This report describes the evolution of a qualitative research design used in a study that integrated academic and non-academic expertise and involved multiple stakeholders concerned with the diversion of human urine from the waste stream for its re-use in agriculture. The study took place in two regions of the U.S., New England and the Upper Midwest (most specifically Vermont and Michigan) and suggests the importance of ethnographic perspectives in a participatory action research framework going forward. This manuscript presents a novel mix of researchers, from a grassroots organization to R1 University teams, and explores the perspectives of a wide range of research participants with whom we conferred to understand whether and how fertilizers made from nutrients recovered from diverted urine might be accepted, adapted, and scaled in agricultural use. Our manuscript thus articulates new territory for such interpretive social science work (focus groups, interviews and participant observations) neither within basic ethnographic research, nor within the kind of ""rapid ethnography"" widely used in business, engineering and international development fields. We describe how our research process entailed the modifications of our methods, and we consider the overlapping and sometimes opposed knowledges and attitudes of multiple stakeholders who are crucial to the uptake and scale of such new technologies for closing loops in our waste and water processing infrastructures and our food production systems. To best leverage these diverse knowledges, we suggest incremental steps for teams like ours towards an inclusive research process.","Schreiber, Tatiana;Opperman, Shaina;Nace, Kim;Pallmeyer, Audrey N.;Love, Nancy;Hardin, Rebecca",Journal,Elementa,2020-03-24,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Keene State College;Rich Earth Institute",Agriculture ;  Collaboration ;  Inclusivity ;  Innovation ;  Sustainability

Does renewable energy technological innovation control China's air pollution? A spatial analysis,"China's rapid industrialization has led to severe air pollution, which has attracted considerable attention from academia and media. To achieve cleaner production, the Chinese government has incorporated the construction of ecological civilization into the overall layout of the ‘Five in One’ and proposed that environmental protection and economic development should be placed on an equal footing. Based on the panel dataset covering 31 Chinese provinces during 2011–2017, this study investigates the spatial features of air pollution and the relationship between energy technology innovation (RETI) and air pollution through Moran's I index and spatial panel econometric models. The results indicate that, first, the air quality in northern China is generally worse than in southern China, especially in Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, and Henan. Second, technological innovations in renewable energy are beneficial to alleviate nitrogen oxides (NOx) and respirable suspended particles (PM10) concentrations, while they are not significantly associated with sulfur dioxide (SO2). Third, the spatial econometric model shows that the spatial spillover effects of SO2, NOx, and PM10 are 0.626, 0.585, and 0.177, respectively. It is suggested that regional and district policymakers need to consider spatial locations when improving air quality.","Zhu, Yongfeng;Wang, Zilong;Yang, Jie;Zhu, Lingling",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-03-20,Nanjing Agricultural University;Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Air pollution ;  China ;  Renewable energy technology innovation ;  Spatial analysis
Decision Research on Patent Licensing of Original Manufacturers and Technology Innovation of Independent Remanufacturers,"The innovation of remanufacturing technology is an effective way to keep the cost advantage of reproducts, and patent licensing facilitates the production of reproducts by independent remanufacturers. Considering people's different preferences for reproducts and new products, we first construct an evolutionary game composed of original manufacturers and independent remanufacturers based on the theory and method of evolutionary game. Next, we study the evolutionary stable point and the influence factors of patent licensing and remanufacturing technology innovation strategy selection by Jacobian matrix. Finally, the model conclusion is verified by numerical analysis. The research shows that when the innovation level of remanufacturing technology is within a certain threshold, independent remanufacturers ultimately choose the technology innovation strategy, while original manufacturers always ultimately choose the patent licensing strategy and it is not affected by the innovation level of remanufacturing technology.","Sheng, Xin",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2020-03-18,Shanghai University,

"From the beaker to the body: Translational challenges for electrochemical, aptamer-based sensors","The ultimate goal of implantable bioanalytical sensors is to enable the continuous and precise monitoring of clinically and physiologically important targets in the body for prolonged periods. Electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors already achieve this goal in a modular way, so far allowing the multihour in vivo monitoring of over half a dozen molecular targets without relying on their specific chemical reactivities. E-AB sensors achieve this modularity by employing nucleic acid aptamers as recognition elements, which can reversibly and selectively bind to molecular targets even in complex biological fluids such as unprocessed blood. However, the translation of the E-AB platform from bench-top, in vitro proof-of-concept demonstrations to truly relevant in vivo clinical applications still faces challenges, some of which are dependent on innovations in the fields of material sciences, interfacial chemistry, biomedical engineering and data management. In this review we critically discuss some of the challenges that the E-AB platform still needs to overcome before it can achieve full, unhindered translation to biomedical and clinical research, decentralized diagnostics and medical applications.","Arroyo-Currás, Netzahualcoyotl;Dauphin-Ducharme, Philippe;Scida, Karen;Chávez, Jorge L.",Journal,Analytical Methods,2020-03-14,"Air Force Research Laboratory;Université de Sherbrooke;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine;Diagnostic Biochips, Inc.",
Tick-tock sounds different for women working in IT areas,"Women represent over the half of university graduates in Spain. However, the percentage of women graduating with degrees in Computing and Engineering drops to 23% (European Commission. [2016. She figures. Brussels: Directorate-General for Research and Innovation]). Women are a minority in the workplace in the IT sector, despite it being one of the most dynamic industries with a positive future outlook. Existent literature highlights that women face a variety of barriers that can impede their progress in the workplace, mainly related to work–life conflicts. However, the attempts carried out thus far to improve women’s work–life balance have had little effect in this sector, where the numbers lag behind those of other sectors. The reasons behind those numbers must be understood. In this sense, this study aims to gain a deeper understanding of work/personal lives of women in IT sectors throughout the course of their lives. The results obtained from a tailor-made survey in Spain show that women working in IT are very work-oriented and committed to their careers and have fewer conflicts regarding work–life balance than was expected. It was in fact age, income and perception of gender discrimination that stood out as significant variables that may explain the difficulties encountered. In light of this, flexible work policies are not enough to increase the number of women in IT, and we suggest actions that could serve to fight stereotypes regarding gender and age in the workplace.","Lamolla, Laura;González Ramos, Ana M.",Journal,"Community, Work and Family",2020-03-14,Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia;Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,gender ;  IT ;  life course ;  Work centrality ;  work–life integration

Extended Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle via Structural Electrical Power Storage and Energy Generation Devices,"As the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have increased in the military, commercial and private sectors, special attention has been focused on improving upon high altitude long endurance (HALE) performance. Therefore, under a multi-year, multi-discipline senior project team comprised of Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mechanical engineering, and Chemical Engineering undergraduate teams, investigative and experimental research has begun into the substitution of various aircraft structural components with power storage and power generation devices used also as structure to improve flight endurance and performance capabilities of solar powered UAVs. One viable solution may be found in the reduction of the amount of parasitic weight due to the required power systems on board these types of aircraft. These power systems are usually found in the form of energy storage devices such as lithium polymer batteries and energy generation devices such as solar cells. This path led to the innovation of theFlying Battery'. TheFlying Battery' integrates various free energy generating devices such as structural solar cells, structural energy storage devices, thermo-electric generators, and vibration induced power generators to create a flying structure that will be more efficient overall. By weighting the design factors for the power systems by their structural strengths and stiffnesses, the power-to-weight ratio of the aircraft may be significantly improved in the long run while also enabling a structure that may withstand the various nominal and off-nominal aerodynamic loading conditions experienced during flight. This paper discusses the mission operations, methods of testing and the progress achieved thus far toward achieving potential endurance and efficiency increases in unmanned aerial vehicles. These will be done through laboratory and eventual model flight experiments of novel structural designs for graphene super-capacitors, solar cells, and other power generation devices.","Oetting, Geoffrey Smith",Journal,SAE Technical Papers,2020-03-10,,
Defining 'Integration' for Total Worker Health®: A New Proposal,"The effects of work and the conditions of employment on health behaviors and intermediate health conditions have been demonstrated, to the extent that these relationships should be addressed in efforts to prevent chronic disease. However, conventional health promotion practice generally focuses on personal risk factors and individual behavior change. In an effort to find solutions to the myriad of health challenges faced by the American workforce, the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) established the Total Worker Health® (TWH) program. Originally organized around the paradigm of integrating traditional occupational safety and health protections with workplace health promotion, TWH has evolved to a broader emphasis on workplace programs for enhancing worker safety, health, and well-being. Among the research programs and approaches developed by investigators at NIOSH Centers of Excellence for TWH and elsewhere, definitions of 'integration' in workplace interventions vary widely. There is no consensus about which organizational or individual outcomes are the most salient, how much to emphasize organizational contexts of work, or which program elements are necessary in order to qualify as 'Total Worker Health'. Agreement about the dimensions of integration would facilitate comparison of programs and interventions which are self-defined as TWH, although diverse in content. The specific criteria needed to define integration should be unique to that concept-i.e. distinct from and additive to conventional criteria for predicting or evaluating the success of a workplace health program. We propose a set of four TWH-specific metrics for integrated interventions that address both program content and process: (i) coordination and interaction of workplace programs across domains; (ii) assessment of both work and non-work exposures; (iii) emphasis on interventions to make the workplace more health-promoting; and (iv) participatory engagement of workers in pivotal ways during intervention prioritization and planning to develop self-efficacy in addressing root causes, skill transfer, building program ownership, empowerment, and continuous improvement. Thus we find that integration requires organizational change, both to engage two managerial functions with different goals, legal responsibilities, and (often) internal incentives & resources, and also to orient the organization toward salutogenesis. Examples from research activity within the Center for the Promotion of Health in the New England Workplace illustrate how these criteria have been applied in practice.","Punnett, Laura;Cavallari, Jennifer M.;Henning, Robert A.;Nobrega, Suzanne;Dugan, Alicia G.;Cherniack, Martin G.",Journal,Annals of Work Exposures and Health,2020-03-10,University of Massachusetts Lowell;University of Connecticut;UConn School of Medicine;UConn Health,CPH-NEW ;  intervention ;  participatory ;  salutogenesis ;  Total Worker Health ;  well-being ;  work organization

At the same time, it has brought about technological innovation, industrial transformation, and product life cycles have become shorter and shorter. The inventory control of short-life cycle products is the core issue of short-life cycle product management. Inventory control management has received extensive attention in today's market economy environment. Excessive inventory will lead to product backlog and excessive inventory costs. Too low inventory will cause shortages, which will directly lead to excessive shortage costs. Therefore, a reasonable inventory is very important for short life cycle products. Products with a short life cycle have the characteristics of relatively large demand fluctuations, fast update, strong uncertainty, and high risk. Use the time-varying demand EOQ method and the S-M method to compare and analyze the inventory of short life cycle products, solve with MATLAB software, and draws the best inventory control method under these two methods.","Wang, Jing;Wang, Xiaonan",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Logistics and Systems Engineering 2020,2020-03-01,Wuhan University of Science and Technology,S-m method ;  Short life cycle products ;  Time-varying demand eoq method
Frameworks for urban water sustainability,"Integrated water management, sustainable water management, water sensitive cities, and other formulations are often presented as the latest in a series of paradigms of water management. This implies a unified approach, while urban water debates reflect a wide diversity of political, social, and technical view-points. Five distinct but overlapping frameworks for urban water sustainability are evident in research, policy and practice, reflecting wider environmental theory, politics, and discourse. Sustainable development is based on meeting the needs for water and sanitation of the urban poor. Ecological modernization focuses on policies to improve water efficiency and treatment through technological innovation and individual behavior change. Socio-technical framings aim to understand how change in water systems occurs across physical and institutional scales and addresses the co-evolution of infrastructures, cultures, and everyday practices. Urban political ecology analyses water infrastructure in terms of relationships of power, pointing to the unequal distribution of costs and benefits of urban water management for the environment and citizens. Radical ecology addresses the relationship between human culture and non-human nature, proposing fundamental reorganization of society to solve ecological and hydrological crises. Characterizing alternate frameworks of urban water sustainability provides clarity on the underlying assumptions, methods, and politics across a diversity of approaches. Frameworks may be deployed strategically to deliver policy impact, or may reflect deeply held political or epistemological standpoints. Understanding different conceptions of urban water sustainability provides the basis for more constructive dialogue and debate about water and its role in sustainable cites.

"Model-based Tools designed for the FACE™ Technical Standard, Editions 3.0 2.1","The promise of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), as described by DO-178C's supplement, DO-330 [1], [2] is with a sufficiently described system and software model, one should be able to auto-generate system's control software, testing, and lifecycle documentation. If aligned to a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA), like the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) Technical Standard [3], and if aligned to Military Aircraft Airworthiness Qualification efforts, the lifecycle artifacts can be used and reused across a fleet of dissimilar aircraft systems, enhancing aircraft capabilities across the battlespace [4]. The Open Group FACE Consortium [https://www.opengroup.org/face] has long requested metrics regarding time savings and level of effort (LOE) using the Modular Open Systems Approach described by the FACE Approach. This paper presents three (3) working use cases of using the TES-SAVi AWESUM MBSE tool suite converting FACE Technical Standard data models. AWESUM now has the capability to convert software developed to the FACE Technical Standard from Standard, Editions 2.x to 3, up to the interface validation process. Designed as a complete lifecycle tools suite, AWESUM has the ability to address the complete lifecycle objectives described by DO-178C, support software aligned to the FACE Technical Standard, and support Military Airworthiness Qualification processes [5]. The use cases reported within this paper include the conversion of the BALSA (Basic Avionics Lightweight Source Archetype) User Supplied Model (USM) v2 with 100 data elements to USM v3; secondly, the v2 to v3 conversion of a US Army Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) topic requesting common reusable FACE development efforts, namely the Army Common Engine FADEC Interface (CEFI) FACE component, which was intentionally designed to leverage BALSA as its starting point for design; and thirdly a sizable real-world application, the conversion of a Raytheon Missile Systems' (RMS) program with 15,000 data elements. This third product is a FACE Domain Specific Data Model (DSDM) awarded FACE Conformance Certification in April 2019 to FACE Technical Standard, Edition 2.1. This DSDM is based on the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Control Segment (UCS) Version 3.4 [6]. This paper records the efficiencies of MBSE tools applied to FACE Technical Standard development efforts, lessons learned, and metrics on level of effort (LOE) saved. Should the products be ported and reused across a fleet of dissimilar aircraft platforms, the reuse efficiencies further increase.","Simi, Stephen M.;Uidenich, Joe;Mulholland, Sean P.;Head, James",Conference Proceeding,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2020-03-01,"Raytheon;Tucson Embedded Systems, Inc.",

"At the frontiers of the body. Identity, corporeality and technology in disability studies","This article, conceived as a broad overview, is devoted to shedding light on how to take into account phenomenological experience of the body as a fruitful approach to analysing the new frontiers between body and technology in Disability Studies and in Science and Technology Studies. While assistive technologies constitute a field of innovation full of promise for people with disabilities, social science research highlights a critical junction which points to a paradox. Despite frequent declarations on the need to consider the point of view of users and patients, the development of a top down engineering technology is still very common. The design of assistive technologies between industrial standardization and the individuality of the disabled person constitutes a privileged point of observation of the current and future dynamics of building scientific, technological, critical and experiential knowledge.","Maestrutti, Marina",Journal,Rassegna Italiana di Sociologia,2020-03-01,Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne,Design ;  Disability studies ;  Phenomenology ;  Sociology of the body ;  Technology
Designing new yeasts for craft brewing: When natural biodiversity meets biotechnology,"Beer is a fermented beverage with a history as old as human civilization. Ales and lagers are by far the most common beers; however, diversification is becoming increasingly important in the brewing market and the brewers are continuously interested in improving and extending the range of products, especially in the craft brewery sector. Fermentation is one of the widest spaces for innovation in the brewing process. Besides Saccharomyces cerevisiae ale and Saccharomyces pastorianus lager strains conventionally used in macro-breweries, there is an increasing demand for novel yeast starter cultures tailored for producing beer styles with diversified aroma profiles. Recently, four genetic engineering-free approaches expanded the genetic background and the phenotypic biodiversity of brewing yeasts and allowed novel costumed-designed starter cultures to be developed: (1) the research for new performant S. cerevisiae yeasts from fermented foods alternative to beer; (2) the creation of synthetic hybrids between S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces non-cerevisiae in order to mimic lager yeasts; (3) the exploitation of evolutionary engineering approaches; (4) the usage of non-Saccharomyces yeasts. Here, we summarized the pro and contra of these approaches and provided an overview on the most recent advances on how brewing yeast genome evolved and domestication took place. The resulting correlation maps between genotypes and relevant brewing phenotypes can assist and further improve the search for novel craft beer starter yeasts, enhancing the portfolio of diversified products offered to the final customer.","Iattici, Fabrizio;Catallo, Martina;Solieri, Lisa",Journal,Beverages,2020-03-01,Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia,4-vinyl guaiacol ;  Artisanal fermented food ;  Craft brewing ;  Evolutionary engineering ;  Hybrids ;  Natural biodiversity ;  Non-conventional yeasts ;  Saccharomyces cerevisiae ;  Saccharomyces eubayanus

"Environmental regulation, government support and green technology innovation efficiency: Based on the empirical research of industrial enterprises above the scale from 2009 to 2017","This paper uses DEA method to measure the efficiency of green technology innovation in 30 provinces from 2009 to 2017. From the perspective of government behavior, this paper focuses on the impact of environmental regulation and government support on the efficiency of green technology innovation. The conclusions show that: (1) the innovation efficiency of green technology is lower than that of traditional technology. (2) there is a u-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and green technology innovation efficiency. With the improvement of environmental regulation, the efficiency of green technology innovation tends to decrease first and then rise. (3) government science and technology support not only significantly promotes the efficiency of green technology innovation, but also positively regulates the process of environmental regulation promoting the efficiency of green technology innovation. (4) government environmental protection support does not play an obvious role in promoting the efficiency of green technology innovation, nor does it play a significant role in positive regulation. Based on this, we should further adjust and improve the role of environmental regulation. Continue to increase government support for science and technology; expand spending on environmental protection and improve its structure.","Li, Dan Qing;Sun, Li",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Logistics and Systems Engineering 2019,2020-03-01,Wuhan Donghu University;Jianghan University,Environmental regulation ;  Government support ;  Green technology innovation efficiency

Facilitation Engineering: A realization of Dense Learning Through Facilitation Embedded in Serious Game,"Education as a service industry is carrying out voices for serious research. Over the past several years, active learning is getting enough attention from the researchers but it is still at its developing phase and requires prerequisites for more improvements. These days, the educational trend has shifted from just gaining knowledge to the practice of dense learning. The purpose of this research is to realize the dense learning through facilitation embedded in the serious game (facilitation engineering- this concept is borrowed from the software engineering) that will help to conquer a good facilitator and its contribution towards active learning. By applying a serious game concept in active learning, it will emerge effective facilitation by introducing training sessions for multiple disciplines towards building engagement. The research findings explain that the role of facilitator and subfacilitator is important to create a serious situation to level up the motivational attitude. And motivation is the key to innovation that acts as a trigger for active learning. Therefore, the Active learning method needs to reflect knowledge gain and 'how to learn' in parallel by building engagement for altruism.","Javed, Amna;Kohda, Youji",Conference Proceeding,"2020 6th IEEE International Conference on Information Management, ICIM 2020",2020-03-01,Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,active learning ;  co-engagement ;  dense learning ;  Facilitation engineering ;  serious game
"Automation, research technology, and researchers' trajectories: Evidence from computer science and electrical engineering","We examine how the introduction of a technology that automates research tasks influences the rate and type of researchers' knowledge production. To do this, we leverage the unanticipated arrival of an automating motion-sensing research technology that occurred as a consequence of the introduction and subsequent hacking of the Microsoft Kinect system. To estimate whether this technology induces changes in the type of knowledge produced, we employ novel measures based on machine learning (topic modeling) techniques and traditional measures based on bibliometric indicators. Our analysis demonstrates that the shock associated with the introduction of Kinect increased the production of ideas and induced researchers to pursue ideas more diverse than and distant from their original trajectories. We find that this holds for both researchers who had published in motion-sensing research prior to the Kinect shock (within-area researchers) and those who did not (outside-area researchers), with the effects being stronger among outside-area researchers.","Furman, Jeffrey L.;Teodoridis, Florenta",Journal,Organization Science,2020-03-01,USC Marshall School of Business;National Bureau of Economic Research;Boston University,Automation ;  Breadth and depth of knowledge ;  Diversification ;  Idea space ;  Innovation ;  Knowledge production ;  Knowledge trajectories ;  Machine learning ;  Rate and direction of innovation ;  Research technology ;  Research trajectories ;  Technological change ;  Topic modeling
Antibody conjugates-recent advances and future innovations,"Monoclonal antibodies have evolved from research tools to powerful therapeutics in the past 30 years. Clinical success rates of antibodies have exceeded expectations, resulting in heavy investment in biologics discovery and development in addition to traditional small molecules across the industry. However, protein therapeutics cannot drug targets intracellularly and are limited to soluble and cell-surface antigens. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein engineering, formulation, and delivery devices. These advances continue to push the boundaries of biologics to enable antibody conjugates to take advantage of the target specificity and long half-life from an antibody, while delivering highly potent small molecule drugs. While the “magic bullet” concept produced the first wave of antibody conjugates, these entities were met with limited clinical success. This review summarizes the advances and challenges in the field to date with emphasis on antibody conjugation, linker-payload chemistry, novel payload classes, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), and product developability. We discuss lessons learned in the development of oncology antibody conjugates and look towards future innovations enabling other therapeutic indications.","Leung, Donmienne;Wurst, Jacqueline M.;Liu, Tao;Martinez, Ruben M.;Datta-Mannan, Amita;Feng, Yiqing",Journal,Antibodies,2020-03-01,Eli Lilly and Company,ADC ;  ADME ;  Antibodies ;  Antibody-drug conjugates ;  Bioconjugates ;  Developability ;  Formulation ;  Linkers ;  Nucleic acids ;  Payloads ;  Site-specific conjugation

Real-time remote maintenance support based on augmented reality (AR),"In the realm of the current industrial revolution, interesting innovations as well as new techniques are constantly being introduced by offering fertile ground for further investigation and improvement in the industrial engineering domain. More specifically, cutting-edge digital technologies in the field of Extended Reality (XR) have become mainstream including Augmented Reality (AR). Furthermore, Cloud Computing has enabled the provision of high-quality services, especially in the controversial field of maintenance. However, since modern machines are becoming more complex, maintenance must be carried out from experienced and well-trained personnel, while overseas support is timely and financially costly. Although AR is a back-bone technology facilitating the development of robust maintenance support tools, they are limited to the provision of predefined scenarios, covering only a limited number of scenarios. This research work aims to address this emerging challenge with the design and development of a framework, for the support of remote maintenance and repair operation based on AR, by creating suitable communication channels between the shop-floor technicians and the expert engineers who are utilizing real-time feedback from the operator's field of view. The applicability of the developed framework is tested in vitro in a lab-based machine shop and in a real-life industrial scenario.","Mourtzis, Dimitris;Siatras, Vasileios;Angelopoulos, John",Journal,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2020-03-01,University of Patras,Augmented reality ;  Maintenance ;  Real-time
"Stemming the gender gap in STEM entrepreneurship – insights into women’s entrepreneurship in science, technology, engineering and mathematics","Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are notably important for innovation and technological development, which in turn are seen as drivers of social and economic growth. Hence, researchers and policy-makers have paid substantial attention to analyzing and promoting high-growth ventures in STEM fields. However, STEM fields are highly gender-skewed, regardless of whether the population considered is students, faculty members, graduates, top managers, or entrepreneurs. This is noticeable in the small number of women entrepreneurs with STEM backgrounds. This underrepresentation of women in innovation-driven business startups highlights existing gender biases and systemic disadvantages in social structures, making visible the double masculinity that exists at the intersection of STEM and entrepreneurship. This article addresses this issue by combining insights from research about women’s entrepreneurship and research about the gender aspects of STEM fields. We emphasize institutional, organizational, and individual factors influencing women’s entrepreneurship in STEM fields, laying the foundation for the articles included in this special issue. Finally, we discuss the way forward for research on the gender aspects of STEM entrepreneurship to help us create the knowledge needed to close this gender gap.","Kuschel, Katherina;Ettl, Kerstin;Díaz-García, Cristina;Alsos, Gry Agnete",Journal,International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal,2020-03-01,CENTRUM PUCP Escuela de Negocios;Universität Siegen;Nord Universitet;Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,Gender ;  High-growth ventures ;  Innovation ;  STEM ;  Technology ;  Women’s entrepreneurship

"The Rise, Regulation and Risks of Genetically Modified Insect Technology in Global Agriculture","The article explores the rise, regulation and risks of genetically modified (GM) insect technology in global agriculture. It contributes to the debate on the nexus of science, technology and food security in Science and Technology Studies from an International Relations perspective. The study locates GM insect technology within the context of conceptual debates about global agriculture, transnational entrepreneurship and the pooling of different sources of political authority. It introduces the pooling of political authority as a potential causal mechanism that transmits biotechnical innovations and entrepreneurship to the spread of GM insect technology in the global agri-food regime. The study focusses, especially on Oxitec Limited, the most important business entrepreneur in the field. The empirical findings reveal that Oxitec has pooled moral and technical political authority and has influenced the global rise and regulation of GM insect technology. The contribution discusses the implications of Oxitec’s entrepreneurial involvement and identifies the three key challenges concerning the global regulation of GM insect technology: the transboundary scope, the provision of transparency, and the assessment of risks. Finally, the study outlines future areas of research.","Schwindenhammer, Sandra",Journal,"Science, Technology and Society",2020-03-01,,authority pooling ;  entrepreneurship ;  Genetically modified insect technology ;  Oxitec ;  risk assessment ;  transparency

Recommendation of startups as technology cooperation candidates from the perspectives of similarity and potential: A deep learning approach,"Companies consistently strive to prepare for new technologies for survival. In a rapidly changing market, absorbing innovation through cooperation strategies can complement internal research and development for new technology development. Startups with state-of-the-art technologies are good candidates for successful cooperation; however, it is difficult to identify their technological positions. Our study suggests a framework to identify appropriate startup candidates using startup profile texts provided by the Crunchbase database. We utilize a doc2vec approach to extract feature vectors representing technological meanings from the startup profile texts and patent abstracts of acquiring companies. Based on these vectors, we apply item-based collaborative filtering to estimate scores for technological similarity between a company and a startup to be acquired. Furthermore, we screen for promising startups using factor analysis, with variables representing the startup's potential. We believe that our framework can save time and effort in the early stage of cooperation planning by supporting effective decision-making.","Kim, Hyoung Jun;Kim, Tae San;Sohn, So Young",Journal,Decision Support Systems,2020-03-01,Yonsei University,Doc2vec ;  Factor analysis ;  Item-based collaborative filtering ;  M&A ;  Startup
Fostering innovation via ambidexterity in aerospace organizations,"This paper discusses an on-going study that examines the role of organizational ambidexterity associated with the pursuit of Disruptive Innovation by incumbent organizations in the space sector. The study pursues evidence of the approaches used by organizations to pursue balance between the paradoxical tensions of exploration versus exploitation, and integration versus differentiation. Many authors have theorized how organizations might achieve such balance and some have produced empirical data to show how rare firms have survived a disruption. This study analyzes cases from the space sector as an example of a public service sector in which government agencies or regulators play a strong role. It is theorized that the unique interaction between firms and government within public service sectors may lead to different empirical patterns regarding innovation dynamics. Furthermore, well-established organizations may harness ambidexterity to simultaneously explore and exploit or to integrate and differentiate. The research question asks, how do well-established organizations in the space sector harness ambidexterity as part of their innovation strategy? This study reviews literature from organizational studies and innovation theory and proposes a framework by which to analyze the innovation behavior of incumbent organizations in the space sector. Specifically, the framework asks how organizations exercise ambidexterity in the areas of organizational architecture, culture, technology, policies, processes and communication.","Joseph, Christine;Wood, Danielle",Journal,Acta Astronautica,2020-03-01,Massachusetts Institute of Technology;MIT Media Lab,Ambidexterity ;  Incumbents ;  Innovation
Design principles for fostering pedagogical provenance through research in technology supported learning,"This paper contributes new critical and theoretical approaches that build the capacity to link research and practice in the field of educational technology. Building on a recent meta-narrative review of the problematic concepts of impact and measurability of educational technologies, we explore the case for methodological design principles that could have the effect of increasing the pedagogical provenance of research into technology supported learning. We extend our previous review by exploring how the design principles we have delineated can contribute to evidence, that increases pedagogical provenance. We also extend this work through critical reflection on how meta-narrative approaches to reviews have the potential to contribute to increased pedagogical provenance in ways that systematic reviews often fall short.","Turvey, Keith;Pachler, Norbert",Journal,Computers and Education,2020-03-01,University of Brighton;UCL Institute of Education,Design principles ;  Educational technology ;  Meta-narrative ;  Methodological innovation ;  Pedagogical provenance ;  Praxis
''Only Social Scientists Laughed'': Reflections on Social Sciences and Humanities Integration in European Energy Projects,"This paper gathers reflections on what can bring together academics and practitioners involved in energy-related European Union (EU) funded projects aiming at, or striving to reach, higher integration of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). To this end, four multidisciplinary workshops carried out in the EU Project ‘Social Sciences and Humanities for Advancing Policy in European Energy - SHAPE ENERGY- (2017–2019)' have been analysed in order to address the following questions: (1) Which STEM-SSH aspects are dealt with in EU-funded projects?; (2) Which tasks relate to SSH practitioners in the Work Packages distribution?; (3) How do EU-funded projects engage in interdisciplinary work?; (4) Which barriers for effective SSH integration have been envisaged?. The main findings emphasise how SSH is still predominantly regarded as a means to orient the market and encourage individuals to accept a top-down policy, technology or process, and this is further illustrated through the ways in which the Horizon 2020 energy and transport calls are fundamentally framed and positioned. Based on the research conducted in this paper, the four workshops represented the right approach not only for comparing current directions and ongoing tasks in individual EU energy and transport projects, but also for proposing concrete ideas to increase the impact of said projects on society. Moreover, this approach favoured reflections on innovative methods of interdisciplinary project ideas for energy-related topics. The conclusion of this paper gives suggestions on how to achieve better interdisciplinary practices when designing EU calls and projects related to energy topics, calling for further interdisciplinary and society-relevant research and innovation, through enhanced multi-stakeholder cooperation and interdisciplinary communication on complex topics.","Sonetti, Giulia;Arrobbio, Osman;Lombardi, Patrizia;Lami, Isabella M.;Monaci, Sara",Journal,Energy Research and Social Science,2020-03-01,Università degli Studi di Torino,Collaboration ;  Energy ;  European union ;  Interdisciplinarity ;  Multidisciplinary workshops ;  Organizational learning ;  Research design ;  Research funding programmes ;  Sandpits ;  Social sciences and humanities (SSH) ;  Stem disciplines
Technology-enhanced learning in higher education: A bibliometric analysis with latent semantic approach,"Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) describes information and communication technology applications as enhancing the outcomes of teaching and learning. Its adoption in higher education is an innovation as well as a disruption to conventional learning mechanisms. To further understand its development from the perspective of academic communities, a hybrid bibliometric approach that combines both direct citation network analysis and text analytics was proposed to examine the related research articles retrieved from the Web of Science database. In addition to visual analytics on the TEL research, a direct citation network approach with cluster analysis was used to delineate the historiographic development of the TEL research domain in higher education. Among the top internally cited articles, five main streams of TEL development were identified, namely adoption, critique, social media, podcasting, and blended learning. Then, the accumulated state of knowledge was summarized by highlighting the essential subgroup topics in each stream with latent semantic analysis. The extraction of the key features of the research domain by the proposed hybrid approach, including the principal streams of development, associated subgroup topics, and a critical article list, contributes a comprehensive method to enable the rapid understanding of the overall research development of the TEL in higher education.","Shen, Chien wen;Ho, Jung tsung",Journal,Computers in Human Behavior,2020-03-01,National Central University,Bibliometrics analysis ;  Direct citation network ;  Latent semantic analysis ;  Technology-enhanced learning ;  Topic analysis
A realist evaluation of student use of a virtual reality smartphone application in undergraduate legal education,"This paper provides a realist evaluation of the Open Justice virtual reality (VR) smartphone app, designed to develop presentation skills for students on an undergraduate legal education module. This work addresses two research questions: what proportion of students engaged with the Open Justice app, and what worked for whom in what circumstances and why? Questionnaire and interviews were conducted and analysed using a realist evaluation approach. This approach is particularly pertinent to the evaluation of how emerging educational technologies are used, as it can point to the potential affordances of a technological intervention, in addition to assessing its current use. In keeping with the realist evaluation approach, data analysis was completed using the context–mechanism–outcome framework. The findings suggest that more than half of students did not engage with the app during their studies, but this was not surprising as it was a pilot project into using VR with our students and such innovations can be difficult to manage in distance education contexts. Those who did engage with it recognised the potential of immersive VR to contribute to legal skills development, but they found the application of the technology, in this context, to be of limited use. By utilising a realist evaluation framework, this study contributes to the emerging field of programme theory-based evaluations of educational technology, which might form the basis of further research. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Smartphone-based virtual reality technology has developed exponentially and is now widely and cheaply available. Smartphone-based virtual reality technology has the potential to develop professional skills, and thereby provide a useful addition to experiential learning pedagogies. This is of particular relevance to the development of professional legal skills in the context of clinical legal education. Realist evaluation methodology is increasingly common in health literature to evaluate the impact of education programmes. What this paper adds This is the first empirical study of the use of VR technology to develop professional skills in a distance learning setting. This is the first paper to use realist methodology to evaluate virtual reality technology in legal education. It provides a granular analysis of particular contexts and user responses that can facilitate or inhibit learner engagement with VR technology. Implications for practice and/or policy It provides an analysis of VR used to support teaching and learning, where the students are distance learners—this highlights issues and challenges to be overcome. It provides an evidence base to inform the development of, and further research into, smartphone-based virtual reality for legal education settings. It provides a detailed example of how realist methodology can be utilised to evaluate educational technology in real-world settings.","McFaul, Hugh;FitzGerald, Elizabeth",Journal,British Journal of Educational Technology,2020-03-01,The Open University,

Legal framework for small autonomous agricultural robots,"Legal structures may form barriers to, or enablers of, adoption of precision agriculture management with small autonomous agricultural robots. This article develops a conceptual regulatory framework for small autonomous agricultural robots, from a practical, self-contained engineering guide perspective, sufficient to get working research and commercial agricultural roboticists quickly and easily up and running within the law. The article examines the liability framework, or rather lack of it, for agricultural robotics in EU, and their transpositions to UK law, as a case study illustrating general international legal concepts and issues. It examines how the law may provide mitigating effects on the liability regime, and how contracts can be developed between agents within it to enable smooth operation. It covers other legal aspects of operation such as the use of shared communications resources and privacy in the reuse of robot-collected data. Where there are some grey areas in current law, it argues that new proposals could be developed to reform these to promote further innovation and investment in agricultural robots.","Basu, Subhajit;Omotubora, Adekemi;Beeson, Matt;Fox, Charles",Journal,AI and Society,2020-03-01,TÜV Rheinland;University of Lincoln;University of Leeds;University of Lagos;Ibex Automation Ltd,Agriculture ;  Legal ;  Robotics ;  Safety agribot
Thailand's software startup ecosystem,"Software startups are currently very popular in Thailand, and existing information reveals an increase in the number of participants and investors in software startup businesses. Moreover, widespread events have been held to showcase the products and services these businesses have contributed. Software startups primarily develop innovations in the form of software produced from limited resources within a limited time. This software must be able to contribute to a sustainable business, and must be adjustable to each business size. Previous research indicates that both attention and emphasis must be placed on the importance of studying software startups in the form of empirical research. This will assist decision-making for those who are interested in initiating software startups and those who want to support them. Research has scarcely studied software startups in Thailand, and therefore, we are interested in Thai startups' current situation as well as the startup ecosystem. This study clarifies that software startups in Thailand are defined as newly emerging businesses anticipated to help businesses grow quickly. Each software startup is in search of a different business model, as current software startups in Thailand have been created to help and support particular businesses. However, software startups rarely invent their own unique, exotic business models or apply advanced technologies and research in their startups.","Nanthaamornphong, Aziz;Wetprasit, Rattana",Book,Fundamentals of Software Startups: Essential Engineering and Business Aspects,2020-02-28,Prince of Songkla University,Case study ;  Software engineering ;  Software startups
Six pillars of modern entrepreneurial theory and how to use them,"In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in entrepreneurship from both practical entrepreneurs and researchers. While theories are helpful for explaining business-driven activities in a startup, they are also valid in reasoning for the practical activities occurring in the entrepreneurial context. We believe that startups would benefit from the awareness of these entrepreneurial theories and the understanding of how they can be connected to decision-making in both business and engineering perspectives. In particular, we want to focus on theories that are already used by practical entrepreneurs and their advisors. As an example, we have studied the Scandinavian entrepreneurial ecosystem. We selected six groups of theories that might be particularly relevant for the startup population, namely (1) core competence and resource-based view, (2) effectuation, (3) the fulfillment of entrepreneurial opportunities, (4) bricolage, (5) business model innovation, and (6) lean startup. In this chapter, we explain these theories including the ongoing research around them, the connections among these theories, and how they can be applied in a real case study.","Dahle, Yngve;Nguyen-Duc, Anh;Steinert, Martin;Reuther, Kevin",Book,Fundamentals of Software Startups: Essential Engineering and Business Aspects,2020-02-28,University of South-Eastern Norway;University of the West of Scotland;Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Bricolage ;  Business modeling ;  Effectuation ;  Entrepreneurship theories ;  Lean startup ;  Resourcebased view ;  Software development ;  Software startups

A Report on the FirstWorkshop on Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence (SE4AI 2020),"With advancement in technology-driven decision making, the softwareintensive systems for decisions have become more robust, dynamic, adaptive, context-aware, dependable. Architectural designs of such systems crave for new approaches where the data-driven decision making has to be incorporated in the solution. Methods for recommendation mechanism, prediction of operation failures, dealing with unsafe conditions etc are going to be part of the solution itself. Integrating such features to conceive an intelligent system that will directly influence the business solution is mostly appreciated. This would not have been possible without the direct interference of Artificial Intelligence which has been a standard procedure of industrial repertoire since 1980s. The direct impact of AI on social and economic life has been been felt mostly in last decade (since 2007) with the advent of smart phone, which contribute largely to big data. The era of big data has witnessed the efficacy of Machine Learning and there is a need of the hour to combine data-driven machine intelligence with human intelligence (insights and domain knowledge) to effectively make the software development (requirement, design, testing, deployment and operation management) intelligent. The research community has shown a keen interest in this emerging field. In this report, we present a pre-organization summary of the workshop to be held on February 27, 2020, at IIIT Jabbalpur (India), co-located with the 13th Innovations in Software Engineering Conference (ISEC 2020).","Bandyopadhyay, Soumyadip;Mukherjee, Rohan;Sarkar, Santonu",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-02-27,"Goa Institute of Management;ABB Corporate Research India;Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani",Ai ;  Big data ;  Software engineering
A paradigmatic model for shared value innovation management in the supply chain: A grounded theory research,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a paradigmatic model for shared value innovation management in the supply chain. This research seeks to identify the causal conditions, strategies, contextual factors, intervening factors and the consequences of shared value innovation in the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: The approach of this research is qualitative and has been carried out in the framework of the grounded theory. Required data for the research was collected through semi-structured interviews. Coding was done in two steps and the reliability of the results of the research was confirmed by calculating the similarity index of codes by two methods. Findings: The proposed framework is presented in the form of a paradigmatic model and demonstrates how to achieve shared value innovation through increasing adoption with customer considerations, improving communication between supply chain members, improving collaboration among supply chain members, enhancing trust among supply chain members, enhancing the commitment of the supply chain members, enhancing supply chain members’ interdependence while maintaining their independence and simultaneously reducing costs. The results of the analysis showed that the shared value innovation leads to positive consequences such as increasing competitive abilities, human development, synergy, inclusive growth and development and also the sustainability of the business situation. Originality/value: Although some studies have shown the importance of value innovation in different parts of the organization and to some extent the introduction of shared value innovation, no research has been done to provide a framework or model for managing shared value innovation.","Rasti Borazjani Faghat, Ebrahim;Khani, Naser;Alemtabriz, Akbar",Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2020-02-27,"Islamic Azad University, Isfahan Branch;Shahid Beheshti University;Islamic Azad University, Najafabad Branch",Grounded theory ;  Paradigmatic model ;  Shared value innovation ;  Supply chain
Learning from design-prototyping interaction for engineering innovation from a cross-functional perspective,"Purpose: Novel engineering designs are usually infeasible for manufacturing or fail to meet the required performance. The dissimilar functionalities and mindsets between design and manufacturing pose challenges, as well as opportunities for innovation projects. This paper aims to report the innovation process that prototyped a novel engineering design of a haptic device in an engineering research lab. The innovation process went through several design generations. Interaction between design and manufacturing drove the innovation toward both better and worse directions between generations. Design/methodology/approach: Using the case research method, the steps of theoretical proposition development, case selection, data collection, data analysis and theory modification were followed. By interviewing the key persons, the characteristics, issues and recommendations for improvement of the innovation process were identified. Findings: It was found that technical issues were not the hurdles in the innovation process. Instead, managing the inter-organizational mechanism proved critical to its eventual success. The educational gap between the design and manufacturing groups gave rise to communicational and perceptional distance, while the gap in terms of work experience between the two groups enlarged that distance. Research limitations/implications: The research results may be limited to cases with similar organizational and technological contexts. Practical implications: Within an organization, the design and the manufacturing divisions are separated by a functional gap. The functional gap should be managed with multiple views, namely, technical, personal and organizational perspectives. The identified innovation process could help bridge such a gap and facilitate innovative engineering designs in research institutes. Originality/value: The effectiveness of the innovation process was, thus, found to be determined by the positive or negative reinforcement of these two gaps between the design and manufacturing of the research institute.","Lee, Demei",Journal,International Journal of Innovation Science,2020-02-27,Chang Gung University,Creative problem solving ;  Design-manufacturing integration ;  Haptic device ;  Innovation process ;  Prototyping
Research progress in biosynthesis and metabolism regulation of gibberellins in Gibberella fujikuroi,"Gibberellin is one of the most important plant growth regulators, and widely used in agricultural production. However, the high cost of gibberellins production is restricting its efficient application. In recent years, biotechnological innovations have improved the synthesis of gibberellin. Gibberellin biosynthesis requires various enzymes. Current research focuses on the biosynthetic mechanisms of gibberellin and the metabolic engineering techniques to improve the production of gibberellin.

The making of information nations,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the main characteristics of what have come to be called information nations and to identify some of the determinants of success in becoming an information nation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a critical review of the literature and of secondary data on information technology and services from studies of the innovativeness of nations. Findings: Success in becoming an information nation is not necessarily closely connected with investments in information technology and services by firms and policies supporting these investments by governments, or with education policies designed to support the development of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Other factors, such as the vibrancy of capitalism, particularly the funding of new ventures, the culture of the nation and its focus on non-scientific determinants of innovation, such as design, are also important. Governments should be careful not to take credit for achievements when their policies are merely coincident with those achievements. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations relate to the focus of this article on two sets of nations, South East/East Asia and two Western nations. The review of their performance is relatively high level and needs to be deepened, while the number of nations included in the research needs to be increased. Practical implications: This paper has substantial practical implications for government policymakers, in terms of whether and how they should make policy at all in this area, and for companies trying to establish a long-term position in the global economy, in terms of being careful not to go against the very strong economic forces which favour certain kinds of activities in certain countries. Social implications: This paper has significant social implications, because much of the thinking about developing information societies relies on generalisations about the creation of information nations that may not hold. Governments and social commentators are encouraged to approach the idea of making “big policies” in this area with some scepticism. Originality/value: The content of this paper is not original, but the challenge to policymakers is relatively original, as too often the work of academics is sponsored by governments that are trying to legitimate the value of their own efforts.","Stone, Merlin;Machtynger, Jon;Machtynger, Liz;Aravopoulou, Eleni",Journal,Bottom Line,2020-02-24,"St Mary’s University, Twickenham;University of Surrey;Customer Essential Ltd",Smart city ;  Trade
Emerging technologies and educational requirements in engineering education for the fourth industrial revolution,"Higher education institutions and their engineering departments have a vital role in fulfilling the new requirements and opportunities of the information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, understanding the guidelines to adapt to the new ICT innovations in relation with the Fourth Industrial Revolution such as the internet of things, cloud computing, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence is vital to determine the emerging patterns in their development, delivery, implementation, and assessment. This study aims to define the new educational requirements in engineering education based on the developments of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Conducting an in-depth analysis of the current literature revealed that although these emerging technologies have been widely used, there are some challenges being faced for their effective use in engineering education. Therefore, the authors provide some guidelines and discuss possible research directions for the use of these technologies in near future..

Circular business models in biological cycles: The case of an Italian spin-off,"As a new economic model fostering increased resource efficiency, the circular economy has become the subject of academic research, national and supranational policies and attracted the interest of business leaders recently. The primary role of corporations and business model innovation to make significant progress towards a circular economy has been emphasised in scholarly literature. However, there is a dearth of academic studies investigating examples of circular economy implementation at the company level and, particularly, in the bio-based industry. Hence, this article contributes to the academic literature by casting some light on the characteristics of circular business models in a practical, bio-based context, using a theoretical framework that bridges academic and practitioners’ literature on the circular economy and business models. To illustrate our points we draw on an in-depth, qualitative case of a circular start-up from the Italian ecological paint market. Albeit constrained in its generalisability, this research does provide some useful insights concerning how companies design and implement circular activities and business models.","De Angelis, Roberta;Feola, Rosangela",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-02-20,University of Exeter Business School;Università degli Studi di Salerno,Biological cycle ;  Circular business models ;  Circular economy
"Circular economy indicators for organizations considering sustainability and business models: Plastic, textile and electro-electronic cases","Circular Economy is the optimal point of sustainability, given that it offers a set of practices capable of generating more sustainable operations, making sustainability feasible in organizations. To measure the innovations brought by Circular Economy, there is a recent need to develop circularity indicators, mainly for micro level (companies and products). Furthermore, the complexity of Circular Economy implies in a set of multi-dimensional indicators instead of a single one. This paper aims to develop a set of indicators linking Circular Economy principles, Circular Business Model and the pillars of Sustainability. The set of indicators was developed based in the hypothetic-deductive approach, following a number of iterations (cycles) and testing the theory in the empirical world. A mix of research methods (e.g. expert consulting, user's feedback, and case studies) was applied. The proposed indicators should be able to achieve the principles of the Circular Economy, and, at the same time, help to meet the specificities and needs of each circular business model. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a group of indicators, focused in the three dimensions of Sustainability (environmental (from material perspective), economic and social), applied in Circular Business Models to capture the innovations brought by Circular Economy that conventional indicators do not measure. Moreover, they will help any company to identify areas with high importance and potential for improvement, and thus increase Circular Economy performance in an efficient, clear and prompt manner. These indicators were applied in three Brazilian companies which have three different Circular Business Models. The results show that data from economic and social dimensions was not available or was diffused in the companies. It represents a barrier because most of the positive impacts gained with Circular Economy are presented in the social dimension, including job creation, mindset change, etc.","Rossi, Efigênia;Bertassini, Ana Carolina;Ferreira, Camila dos Santos;Neves do Amaral, Weber Antonio;Ometto, Aldo Roberto",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-02-20,Universidade de São Paulo,Circular business model ;  Circular economy ;  Indicators ;  Metrics ;  Sustainability
Emerging Priorities for Microbiome Research,"Microbiome research has increased dramatically in recent years, driven by advances in technology and significant reductions in the cost of analysis. Such research has unlocked a wealth of data, which has yielded tremendous insight into the nature of the microbial communities, including their interactions and effects, both within a host and in an external environment as part of an ecological community. Understanding the role of microbiota, including their dynamic interactions with their hosts and other microbes, can enable the engineering of new diagnostic techniques and interventional strategies that can be used in a diverse spectrum of fields, spanning from ecology and agriculture to medicine and from forensics to exobiology. From June 19–23 in 2017, the NIH and NSF jointly held an Innovation Lab on Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical Data Science Challenges in our Understanding of the Microbiome. This review is inspired by some of the topics that arose as priority areas from this unique, interactive workshop. The goal of this review is to summarize the Innovation Lab’s findings by introducing the reader to emerging challenges, exciting potential, and current directions in microbiome research. The review is broken into five key topic areas: (1) interactions between microbes and the human body, (2) evolution and ecology of microbes, including the role played by the environment and microbe-microbe interactions, (3) analytical and mathematical methods currently used in microbiome research, (4) leveraging knowledge of microbial composition and interactions to develop engineering solutions, and (5) interventional approaches and engineered microbiota that may be enabled by selectively altering microbial composition. As such, this review seeks to arm the reader with a broad understanding of the priorities and challenges in microbiome research today and provide inspiration for future investigation and multi-disciplinary collaboration.","Cullen, Chad M.;Aneja, Kawalpreet K.;Beyhan, Sinem;Cho, Clara E.;Woloszynek, Stephen;Convertino, Matteo;McCoy, Sophie J.;Zhang, Yanyan;Anderson, Matthew Z.;Alvarez-Ponce, David;Smirnova, Ekaterina;Karstens, Lisa;Dorrestein, Pieter C.;Li, Hongzhe;Sen Gupta, Ananya;Cheung, Kevin;Powers, Jennifer Gloeckner;Zhao, Zhengqiao;Rosen, Gail L.",Journal,Frontiers in Microbiology,2020-02-19,"New Mexico State University College of Engineering;Drexel University College of Engineering;Skaggs School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences;Utah State University;University of Iowa;Drexel University College of Medicine;Oregon Health & Science University;Drexel University;Hokkaido University;University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine;J.

A test bench of the oil-sunflower threshing device with variable clearance was developed. The threshing test was completed at the Key Laboratory of Innovation Design Laboratory of Xinjiang Agricultural Engineering Equipment. The test object was oil sunflower No. 31 with the disk diameter of 180-220 mm and the disk thickness of 25-40 mm, the weight of single sunflower disk was 300-380 g, the moisture content of the sunflower disk was 33%-38%. The test was performed according to the GB/T5982-2017 thresher test method and the DB37/T2878.2-2016 technical requirements. The orthogonal experiment of three factors and three levels was carried out, threshing rate and breaking rate were taken as the indexes and the cylinder speed, the threshing clearance as well as feed rate were the factors. The test results showed that during the threshing process, the factors that affect the oil sunflower threshing rate and breaking rate are threshing clearance, drum speed and feed rate. The optimal combination of operating parameters was that the threshing clearance 35 mm, the drum speed 280 r/min and the feed rate 1.8 kg/s. Through the analysis of variance, it was concluded that the threshing clearance had a very significant effect on the oil sunflower threshing rate and breaking rate, the drum speed was significant, and the feed amount was not significant. Multiple repeated tests were performed under a better combination of operating parameters. The test results showed that the average threshing rate of oil sunflower was 99.01%, and the breaking rate was 2.28%, which met the national standards that the threshing rate greater than 98 % and the breaking rate less than 5%. The better operating parameters of this study are only applicable to the material conditions tested in this paper, but the oil sunflower harvesting operations are complicated, and the factors such as oil sunflower varieties, moisture content, and output are also different. Adjusting the diameter of the threshing concave plate sieve, changing the threshing clearance and other working parameters is to meet the requirements of oil sunflower threshing under different conditions. The research results can provide reference for the design of subsequent oil sunflower threshing device.","Zhang, Xuejun;Ma, Shaoteng;Zhu, Xingliang;Yuan, Panpan;Yu, Mengjie;Liu, Yu",Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2020-02-15,Xinjiang Agricultural University;Key Laboratory of Innovation Design laboratory,Agricultural machinery ;  Clearance adjustable ;  Harvesting ;  Multi-bar mechanism ;  Oil sunflower ;  Test ;  Threshing

A Tale of Two Journals,"Earlier we discussed the flawed journal review process and how it stifles innovation and the diffusion of knowledge. Recently we tried to publish a paper describing our LENR experiences working with undergraduate chemical engineering students in an education journal. One journal had a word limit for articles as well as a fairly rigid format which prevented us from telling the story the way we wanted to. Although we addressed all the issues of the reviewers, the paper was rejected, after ten months and multiple revisions, on the grounds that independent research projects were outside the scope of the journal. We eventually published the paper in another education journal. In this journal, we were able to tell the narrative the way we originally wanted to, all the while emphasizing the advantages of involving students in verifying new scientific phenomena. This paper describes the events that transpired.","Mosier-Boss, Pamela A.;Forsley, Lawrence P.",Journal,Journal of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science,2020-02-01,Cockrell School of Engineering;GEC,Mentoring ;  Review process ;  Undergraduate projects
Construction of academic discipline of science and engineering and orientation for their ranking under the new situation,"At present, the key to the innovative development of our country is to improve the ability of independent innovation. The fundamental task of universities is to cultivate innovative talents who can lead the innovative de-velopment. Discipline ranking is the baton of university construction. In fact, all aspects of the work of discipline construction are carried out around discipline ranking and essentially around discipline ranking index system. The existed specific measures of discipline construction can not fully meet the requirements of the state for the construction of universities. As long as set up a reasonable discipline ranking index system, can truly promote the reform of discipline construction in universities, and fully implement the requirements of state to break the “four only” and “five only” phenomenon. Therefore, in view of the connotation of discipline construction with talent cultivating as the core, suggestions for the reform of discipline ranking index system in terms of the level of teachers, the quality of talent cultivating and the level of scientific research were proposed.","Li, Fenghua;Li, Hui",Journal,Chinese Journal of Network and Information Security,2020-02-01,Institute of Information Engineering;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Xidian University,Discipline construction ;  Discipline ranking ;  Index system

Innovation in medical device at glance,"It takes more than just a smart idea and creative engineering to design a new medical device. Innovation and development of new products is the lifeblood of companies in research and development (R&D)-intensive industries, but faulty goods can cause huge damage. It is not just a fresh presentation but it also should be beneficial and viable. Concepts for technology also come from experts who are familiar with the challenges that need to be overcome. Clinicians and health-care professionals receive the number of thoughts to solve their problems by innovating fresh goods. In the design of a medical device, biomedical engineers also play a very important role. The software will also assist in the advancement of medical devices, allowing medical technology manufacturers to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning and ensuring better tracking of applications from pre-market growth to post-market outcomes. The forms of innovation in medical devices are incremental innovation, in which products are easy and the consumer risk level to the patients. The new innovative medical device example is Integra LifeScience Omnigraft Dermal Regeneration Matrix. The creation of medical products is predominantly through the first recognition of the issue and then the development of the theory and then the thorough production of the drug. With better treatments, minimal hospitalization, and increased patient satisfaction, the innovation in medical device improves. The system must fulfill a need, resulting in better performance, and at the same time have to be relatively low cost. The life cycle of medical devices is not an easy, linear progression from basic research to applied research, production, and marketing. Instead, it is a dynamic system of five parallel tracks including administrative, R&D, advertising, production, and legal matters.","Tarun Nag, S.

"Workshop on the development and evaluation of digital therapeutics for health behavior change: Science, methods, and projects","The health care field has integrated advances into digital technology at an accelerating pace to improve health behavior, health care delivery, and cost-effectiveness of care. The realm of behavioral science has embraced this evolution of digital health, allowing for an exciting roadmap for advancing care by addressing the many challenges to the field via technological innovations. Digital therapeutics offer the potential to extend the reach of effective interventions at reduced cost and patient burden and to increase the potency of existing interventions. Intervention models have included the use of digital tools as supplements to standard care models, as tools that can replace a portion of treatment as usual, or as stand-alone tools accessed outside of care settings or direct to the consumer. To advance the potential public health impact of this promising line of research, multiple areas warrant further development and investigation. The Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a P30 Center of Excellence supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, is an interdisciplinary research center at Dartmouth College focused on the goal of harnessing existing and emerging technologies to effectively develop and deliver evidence-based interventions for substance use and co-occurring disorders. The CTBH launched a series of workshops to encourage and expand multidisciplinary collaborations among Dartmouth scientists and international CTBH affiliates engaged in research related to digital technology and behavioral health (eg, addiction science, behavioral health intervention, technology development, computer science and engineering, digital security, health economics, and implementation science). This paper summarizes a workshop conducted on the Development and Evaluation of Digital Therapeutics for Behavior Change, which addressed (1) principles of behavior change, (2) methods of identifying and testing the underlying mechanisms of behavior change, (3) conceptual frameworks for optimizing applications for mental health and addictive behavior, and (4) the diversity of experimental methods and designs that are essential to the successful development and testing of digital therapeutics. Examples were presented of ongoing CTBH projects focused on identifying and improving the measurement of health behavior change mechanisms and the development and evaluation of digital therapeutics. In summary, the workshop showcased the myriad research targets that will be instrumental in promoting and accelerating progress in the field of digital health and health behavior change and illustrated how the CTBH provides a model of multidisciplinary leadership and collaboration that can facilitate innovative, science-based efforts to address the health behavior challenges afflicting our communities.","Budney, Alan J.;Marsch, Lisa A.;Aklin, Will M.;Borodovsky, Jacob T.;Brunette, Mary F.;Campbell, Andrew T.;Dallery, Jesse;Kotz, David;Knapp, Ashley A.;Lord, Sarah E.;Nunes, Edward V.;Scherer, Emily A.;Stanger, Catherine;Torrey, William C.",Journal,JMIR Mental Health,2020-02-01,College of Liberal Arts and Sciences;Department of Computer Science;New York State Psychiatric Institute;Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis;Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine;Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth;National Institutes of Health (NIH),Addiction ;  Behavior change ;  Behavioral health ;  Behavioral science ;  Digital health ;  Digital interventions ;  Mental health ;  mHealth ;  Mobile technology
Curriculum integration of engineering with business to enhance engineer's management competency- a multidisciplinary to interdisciplinary approach,"Curriculum redesign and restructuring is a conduit for developing multidisciplinary competency in engineers which empowers them to use their technical expertise to a problem scenario which requires a sound understanding of various aspects of managing businesses. Therefore it is incumbent upon the Universities and colleges to drive multidisciplinary integration for developing integrated skill sets in students. This paper presents a case of interdisciplinary integration of engineering curriculum that was initiated a year ago in Higher Colleges of Technology, UAE to address the demand for high-skill jobs requiring both technical knowledge and management competency. We aim to explore the level of integration attained in the aforementioned programs through a description of the range of different disciplines integrated into these programs. The learning pedagogies suitable for interdisciplinary education will be discussed with the objective of ensuring the desired outcome of an integrated curriculum. The integration of other relevant disciplines with Engineering needs to be adequately supported with appropriate learning strategies like interdisciplinary research, projects, team based learning and other emerging disruptive innovations in learning approaches. To further improve the level of curriculum integration, inter to transdisciplinary integration is required which will be the next stage in the HCT 4.0 strategic plan of 'Graduating companies'.","Banerjee, Rachna;Zgalai, Walid;Boukareva, Bistra",Conference Proceeding,"2020 Advances in Science and Engineering Technology International Conferences, ASET 2020",2020-02-01,HCT-Dubai Campuses,Business ;  Curriculum integration ;  Engineering education ;  Finance ;  Industrial engineering ;  Interdisciplinary
Developing innovation and entrepreneurship skills in Engineering students: Simulation games in the Desert,"Entrepreneurship abilities spur innovation, which is a necessary requirement for engineers and technology professionals. Engineering education institutions are developing new models of curriculum design to provide a more holistic learning experience which is a combination of technical knowledge and business acumen. Technical leaders need to be able to demonstrate entrepreneurial abilities to be able to assume leadership position in corporations. Besides, there is a dire need for engineers to respond to the demands of the current labor market with dearth of jobs. The aim of the educational institutions should be on creating environments that foster the development of learning; leadership skills and the development enterprising attitudes. Entrepreneurship and innovation are interchangeable and academics have to embrace both in their classrooms. Students have to develop tact and explicit knowledge to understand the concepts of dynamic and changing business environment. Simulation games provide an effective method for student enhancement, learning of technology in addition to entrepreneurial leadership, innovation skills and development of logical skills. Faculty and participants evaluate business simulation games differently. Qualitative research has been used for the purpose of this study to identify student perceptions on variables such as observation of the simulation game, degree of engagement, cognitive learning from participation, social learning from participation and total satisfaction after playing the game.

Luggage and Utility Allocation with Convenience in a University,"Growth of small businesses or firms is fast and the impact they create on the economy cannot be ignored. How to manage the inventory in an effective and efficient manner is often a challenge for the small businesses and firms. Better and convenient locomotive processes of store loads (personal belongings) are possible through implementation of technology and digital services. The present research work is about the digitalization that assists in allocating luggage flexibly through a particular period of time and place. This model includes the confirmed and fixed allotments according to the block recruited by the ward for the year's stay. This model follows the inventory management system present in small business foundations or firms that require a medium level of inventory once per annum. The present method is beneficial to complete the work fast and reduce the time-consuming activities. The main idea to achieve is the improvement in digitalization. The present technique replaces the traditional procedure, i.e, the physical presence of superintendent is not required to deal with the working of framework. This innovation provides a key base to the upcoming business ideas that would be a major push to the company to succeed in the market strategy. Similarly, in case of a university management system, students do not have to wait in queues to pay their fees. The same holds true when it comes to another department. The multi user access makes it easier for everyone to get the required information by reducing the waiting period.","Dhanapal, Karthikeyan;Sivanandam, K.;Moorthy, Akash Sooriya;Cidharth, S.;Mahaan Malesh, S.;Buddala, Raviteja",Conference Proceeding,"International Conference on Emerging Trends in Information Technology and Engineering, ic-ETITE 2020",2020-02-01,Vellore Institute of Technology,flexibility ;  inventory management ;  luggage allocation ;  online end-end service

Insurematic : GGernalized framework for Insurance company to Automate Insurance process,"The insurance industry works on the principle of risk. Customer take out policies based on their assessment of a particularly bad thing happening to them, and insurers offer them cover based on their assessment of the cost of covering any claims. Automobile insurance, also called motor/vehicle insurance, is a contract between the owner or operator of a vehicle and the insurance company, which protects against financial loss incurred through damage to property or persons as the result of an accident or theft. The amount of premium depends on various factors such as insured declared value, type of the vehicle, life of the vehicle, fuel type, age of the insured, and others. Additionally, the type of automotive insurance also depends on the legal principles in effect in each country. Generally, automotive insurance provides coverage for property (damage to or theft of the vehicle), liability (legal responsibility of the owner or operator towards others for body injury or vehicle damage), and medical (cost of treating injuries, rehabilitation, and sometimes lost wages and funeral expenses). Automotive insurance policies are generally issues for the timeframe of six months or one year and are renewable. Therefore, it would benefit everyone if there were a way to more accurately assess risks. In the age of Data Analytics and Data engineering, using vehicle port OBD-II port is being introduced. However, the data which insurers were getting from telematics solution was not meant to be displayed to customers. Whereas with our solution and research each and every detail is supposed to be revealed to its customers and upon performing analysis on that data the behavior of driver can also be determined. The technology is based upon Internet of Things since it involves communication with internet and is a part of Internet of Things domain. Improvement of cutting edge data and correspondence frameworks, huge drop in the innovation cost of possession, and the need for advertise separation in the protection business, encouraged the presence of new charging representation in the engine protection industry. This research work provides a review of the framework engineering of one of the telematics frameworks offered and utilized available, and the information display utilized in the charging procedure.","Shaikh, Muhammad Kashif;Palaniappan, Sellappan;Khodadadi, Touraj;Khurram, Muhammad;Khan, Muhammad Hameez;Juzer, Huzaifa",Conference Proceeding,ICISCT 2020 - 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Communication Technology,2020-02-01,Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology;University of Malaysia,IoT (Internet of Things) ;  OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostic) ;  Telematics ;  UBI (Usage-Based Insurance)
Review of Research on Software Ecosystems,"The innovation of software ecosystems has great influences on the production style of IT industry. It refactors the business ecosystems of IT industry. Academic and industry researchers have paid close attention to software ecosystems since 2003. Some world-wide famous IT companies make efforts towards achieving their own software ecosystems. As has developed to numerous examples of software ecosystems. Currently, emerging information technologies (such as cloud computing, mobile application development, cyber-physical systems, blockchains) are applied deeply and widely in the field of software ecosystems. The application of software ecosystems has become more and more intensive in various industries and domains. The definition of a software ecosystem has changed greatly over time. In order to clarify the context of a software ecosystem, researchers adopt biological ecosystem theories, and propose several different kinds of definitions for software ecosystems. It is not until the year of 2016 that there is consensus on what a software ecosystem is. A software ecosystem refers to a complex system in which the software and its related stakeholders interact intensively within a common technological infrastructure. In the paper, we adopt biological ecosystem theories to the context so as to come out a meta-model of software ecosystems which forms the basis for the discussion of the issues relating to software ecosystems. The meta-model, which is presented in UML class diagram, describes the key building blocks and key characteristics of software ecosystems. Typically, the research results of papers in the field of software ecosystems are compared to traditional classification which was presented in 2003. The traditional classification includes seven categories: (1) procedure or technique; (2) qualitative or descriptive model; (3) analytic model; (4) empirical model; (5) tool or notation; (6) specific solution, prototype, answer, or judgment; (7) report. But, the traditional classification schema has to be revised because that the context and the key characteristics of software ecosystems have changed greatly over time. According to our observations, we find that the combination of quantity and quality analysis is always adopted in the field, and that empirical studies reporting specific solutions for software ecosystems are in fashion. We make minor changes to the traditional classification schema for the papers focusing on software ecosystems, and then propose a five-classification pattern. Our five-classification schema combines ""qualitative or descriptive model"" and ""analytic model"" to produce a new category namely ""analytic method or framework"", and integrate ""specific solution, prototype, answer, or judgment"" into ""empirical study"". The meta-model as well as the five-classification schema forms the basis for the discussions of the issues relating to software ecosystems. Then, we provide a literal review of the research in the filed from 2015 until 2017. In total, the literature counts 196 papers. Our literature review is based on the keywords, the abstract, publication source, research content. We category the research results of papers into our five-category schema, and then identify the recent development and progress in the field. However, there exists a set of challenges for future research. Those challenges includes requirements engineering, architecture modeling, model-driven development, power mechanisms, feature analysis, information content analysis, ecologic network analysis, impact analysis of defect and/or bad smell, tool supports, emerging applications for software ecosystems.","Dong, Rui Zhi;Li, Bi Xin;Wang, Lu Lu;Li, Hong Wei;Chen, Hai Lei;Tan, Jack",Journal,Jisuanji Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Computers,2020-02-01,Changshu Institute of Technology;Jiangxi Normal University;University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire;Southeast University;Cynovo Technology Co.

Combined with the experience and lessons of weathering steel bridge engineering accidents in the United States and Japan, as well as the construction technological innovation achievements of the first batch of long lasting high performance weathering steel bridges in China, the technological innovation direction in this field was discussed. Research result shows that the composition of corrosion-resistant patina contains the outer layer of γ-FeOOH and α-FeOOH, and the inner layer of amorphous FeOOH compound and Fe3O4. The formation and durability of stable corrosion-resistant patina are mainly affected by the factors such as chloride ion, accumulated water and dust. The material selection zoning map of high performance weathering steel bridges in China is suggested to establish, and the configuration design criterion of stable corrosion-resistant patina should be improved. The modern weathering steel bridge has the technical characteristics of high performance and long lasting. The in-plane stress fatigue, out-of-plane deformation fatigue test, numerical fracture mechanics simulation of configuration details with patina and the research on the long-term damage resistance of weathering high-strength bolts should be promoted to lay the foundation for establishing a perfect design criterion of anti-corrosion and anti-fatigue. The application of artificial intelligence technology will promote the significant progress of intelligent management and maintenance technology of long lasting high performance weathering steel bridges. The investment for research and development should be increased, a specification system should be established for the design, construction and maintenance of long lasting high performance weathering steel bridges with independent intellectual property rights in China, the high-quality engineering and technical talents should be cultivated, thus to promot the development of Chinese strong transportation network.","Wang, Chun Sheng;Zhang, Jing Wen;Duan, Lan;Tan, Chen Xin",Journal,Jiaotong Yunshu Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering,2020-02-01,Chang'an University,Bridge engineering ;  Corrosion-resistant configuration ;  Corrosion-resistant patina ;  Design criterion ;  Fatigue ;  High performance weathering steel ;  Intelligent operation and maintenance ;  Long lasting ;  Weathering bolt
Research progress on drug representation learning,"The drug development process is characterized by large capital density, high risk and long cycles; thus, drug development requires much capital, manpower and resources. While traditional machine learning methods can aid drug development some, they require molecular descriptors as inputs. The selection of the molecular descriptors then greatly impacts the performance of the machine learning models. Therefore, most traditional machine learning methods require complex and time-consuming feature engineering. The emerging deep learning methods can directly learn the features from raw representations of the drugs which bypasses the feature engineering and shortens the drug development cycle. In this paper, the drug representation learning methods are divided into simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) expression based drug representation learning methods and molecular graph based representation learning methods. This paper then surveys the innovations and limitations of various drug representation learning methods. This paper then identifies major challenges in current drug representation learning methods and presents possible solutions.","Chen, Xin;Liu, Xien;Wu, Ji",Journal,Qinghua Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Tsinghua University,2020-02-01,Tsinghua University,Drug ;  Molecular graph ;  Representation learning ;  Simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES)
"Polarimetric radar observations of simultaneous tornadoes on 10 May 2010 near Norman, Oklahoma","This study utilizes data collected by the University of Oklahoma Advanced Radar Research Center's Polarimetric Radar for Innovations in Meteorology and Engineering (OU-PRIME) C-band radar as well as the federal KTLX and KOUN WSR-88D S-band radars to study a supercell that simultaneously produced a long-track EF-4 tornado and an EF-2 landspout tornado (EF indicates the enhanced Fujita scale) near Norman, Oklahoma, on 10 May 2010. Contrasting polarimetric characteristics of two tornadoes over similar land cover but with different intensities are documented. Also, the storm-scale sedimentation of debris within the supercell is investigated, which includes observations of rotation and elongation of a tornadic debris signature with height. A dual-wavelength comparison of debris at S and C bands is performed. These analyses indicate that lofted debris within the tornado was larger than debris located outside the damage path of the tornado and that debris size outside the tornado increased with height, likely as the result of centrifuging. Profiles of polarimetric variables were observed to become more vertically homogeneous with time.","Griffin, Casey B.;Bodine, David J.;Palmer, Robert",Journal,Monthly Weather Review,2020-02-01,Gallogly College of Engineering,
The current situation and trends of healthy building development in China,"The development of healthy buildings is an important way to implement the strategy of ""Healthy China"" in the building industry. It is of great significance to promote the development of healthy buildings. In 2016, China's first healthy building technical standard Assessment Standard for Healthy Building was released and implemented in January 2017. Since then, the healthy building has achieved rapid development in China, which is embodied in the following aspects. (1) Set technical standards to lead the development of healthy buildings. To realize the fine construction guidelines, in addition to Assessment Standard for Healthy Building, technical standards for healthy buildings have been compiled for major building types, such as healthy hotels and healthy hospitals. In addition, on the basis of single building, assessment standards such as healthy community and healthy town have considered the healthy influencing factors in different scopes and put forward the corresponding technical requirements. (2) Conduct the scientific research to provide theoretical and technical supports for the development of healthy buildings. The researchers carried out special scientific research from the aspects of building ventilation, indoor air quality, emission of pollutants from building materials, healthy lighting and light environment improvement, sports health and so on. (3) Various organizations provide services for the healthy building industry. First, the healthy living professional group of China association for engineering construction standardization (CECS) was established to promote the standardization of healthy buildings. Second, China Healthy Building Alliance plays the role of link, carrier and platform to establish a diversified channel for sharing healthy building resources. Third, the relevant research institutions were established to conduct special research on the theory and technology of healthy buildings. (4) Carry out project evaluation to drive the implementation of healthy building projects. Chinese Society for Urban Studies (CSUS) has carried out the evaluation and certification of healthy building. By September 2019, a total of 50 projects had obtained the certification of healthy building identification, covering 14 provinces and cities with a total building area of nearly 5 million m2. (5) Promote healthy building technology progress through academic exchange and technical cooperation. Taking 2019 (the first) Healthy Building Conference as an example, academicians, experts, executives and other representatives from different fields exchanged views on healthy environment research, standard certification, scheme supply, case demonstration and industrial value, which gave new momentum to the development of healthy buildings. However, the healthy buildings are still in the initial stage in China. In the future, more comprehensive exploration and innovation should be carried out in the following aspects. (1) The identification of factors affecting physical health, mental health and social health related to healthy buildings and the mechanisms of healthy impact need further exploration. (2) It is necessary to promote the interdisciplinary development of healthy buildings, realize the interdisciplinarity and integration, and solve the scientific problem as a whole. (3) In the design stage, comprehensive pre-evaluation is carried out on the factors affecting human health, and the health is integrated into the design of buildings and communities, and healthy design technology is studied and developed. (4) The research on technical standard system of healthy building should be carried out to establish a standard system covering different types of buildings in different stages of the whole life cycle. (5) It is urgent to strengthen the research and development of the related theories, standards, technologies and supporting products of the existing buildings and communities.","Wang, Qingqin;Deng, Yuechao;Li, Guozhu;Meng, Chong;Xie, Linna;Liu, Maolin;Zeng, Luyao",Journal,Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin,2020-02-01,China Academy of Building Research;National Engineering Research Center of Building Technology,Assessment standard ;  Development background ;  Future prospect ;  Healthy buildings

Cost effectiveness of in vitro fertilisation and preimplantation genetic testing to prevent transmission of BRCA1/2 mutations,"STUDY QUESTION: Is it cost-effective to use in vitro fertilisation and preimplantation genetic testing of monogenic defects (IVT/PGT-M) to prevent transmission of BRCA1/2 mutations to second-generation new births in comparison with naturally conceived births? SUMMARY ANSWER: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that IVF/PGT-M is cost-effective for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers if using a willingness to pay of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have a significantly increased risk of several types of cancer throughout their lifetime. The cost of risk reduction, screening and treatment of cancer in this population is high. In addition, there is a 50% chance of passing on this genetic mutation to each child. One option to avoid transmission of an inherited deleterious gene to one's offspring involves in vitro fertilisation with preimplantation genetic testing. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We implemented a state transition model comparing the healthcare impact of a cohort of healthy children born after IVF/PGT-M, who have a population risk of developing cancer, to a cohort of naturally conceived live-births, half of whom are carriers of the BRCA mutation. Transition probabilities are based on published sources, a lifetime horizon and a perspective of a provincial Ministry of Health in Canada. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The target population is the second-generation new births who have at least one parent with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY, IVF/PGT-M is a cost-effective intervention for carriers of either BRCA mutation. For BRCA1, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for IVF/PGT-M is $14 242/QALY. For BRCA2, the ICER of intervention is $12 893/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results show that IVF/PGT-M has a 98.4 and 97.3% chance of being cost-effective for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively, at the $50 000/QALY threshold. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our model did not include the short-term negative effect of IVF/PGT-M on the woman's quality of life; in addition, our model did not consider any ethical issues related to post-implantation genetic testing. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In countries in which the healthcare of a large segment of the population is covered by a single payer system such as the government, it would be cost-effective for that payer to cover the cost of IVF/PGT-M for couples in which one member has a BRCA mutation, in order to avoid the future costs and disutility of managing offspring with an inherited BRCA mutation.

Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine 2019: The Role of Biofabrication - A Year in Review,"Despite its relative youth, biofabrication is unceasingly expanding by assimilating the contributions from various disciplinary areas and their technological advances. Those developments have spawned the range of available options to produce structures with complex geometries while accurately manipulating and controlling cell behavior. As it evolves, biofabrication impacts other research fields, allowing the fabrication of tissue models of increased complexity that more closely resemble the dynamics of living tissue. The recent blooming and evolutions in biofabrication have opened new windows and perspectives that could aid the translational struggle in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) applications. Based on similar methodologies applied in past years' reviews, we identified the most high-impact publications and reviewed the major concepts, findings, and research outcomes in the context of advancement beyond the state-of-the-art in the field. We first aim to clarify the confusion in terminology and concepts in biofabrication to therefore introduce the striking evolutions in three-dimensional and four-dimensional bioprinting of tissues. We conclude with a short discussion on the future outlooks for innovation that biofabrication could bring to TERM research.","Ramos, Tiago;Moroni, Lorenzo",Journal,Tissue Engineering - Part C: Methods,2020-02-01,Universiteit Maastricht;UCL Institute of Ophthalmology,bioassembly ;  biofabrication ;  bioprinting ;  instructive scaffolds
Briefing: Engineering for the far future: Rethinking the value proposition,"In preparation for a call for proposals, a workshop was held with representatives from the Institution of Civil Engineers' (ICE) Research, Development and Innovation towards Engineering Excellence Panel, academia, Innovate UK, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Highways England and the consulting industry. The overarching theme that emerged was that infrastructure does not adequately take into account the value that could be gained from its long-term service provision. This has therefore been selected as an appropriate cross-cutting theme for the 'Spring 2019 Call for Proposals for the ICE's Research and Development Enabling Fund'. The findings from this research and development initiative are required to be presented at a half-day event, as well as to form the subject of papers and/or briefings to be published in relevant parts of the ICE Proceedings and other forms of dissemination, thus ensuring that they are brought to the attention of ICE's members. This briefing is a summary of challenges that need to be embraced by the profession, as revealed by the workshop discussions and which therefore reflect the collective views of all those at the workshop (who are listed in the Acknowledgements).","Hargreaves, Anthony J.;Rogers, Chris D.F.;Cavada, Marianna",Journal,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Engineering Sustainability,2020-02-01,University of Birmingham,Infrastructure planning ;  Social impact ;  Town & city planning
Toward precision adjuvants: Optimizing science and safety,"Purpose of reviewThe gradual replacement of inactivated whole cell and live attenuated vaccines with subunit vaccines has generally reduced reactogenicity but in many cases also immunogenicity. Although only used when necessary, adjuvants can be key to vaccine dose/antigen-sparing, broadening immune responses to variable antigens, and enhancing immunogenicity in vulnerable populations with distinct immunity. Licensed vaccines contain an increasing variety of adjuvants, with a growing pipeline of adjuvanted vaccines under development.Recent findingsMost adjuvants, including Alum, Toll-like receptor agonists and oil-in-water emulsions, activate innate immunity thereby altering the quantity and quality of an adaptive immune response. Adjuvants activate leukocytes, and induce mediators (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandin-E2) some of which are biomarkers for reactogenicity, that is, induction of local/systemic side effects. Although there have been safety concerns regarding a hypothetical risk of adjuvants inducing auto-immunity, such associations have not been established. As immune responses vary by population (e.g., age and sex), adjuvant research now incorporates principles of precision medicine. Innovations in adjuvant research include use of human in vitro models, immuno-engineering, novel delivery systems, and systems biology to identify biomarkers of safety and adjuvanticity.SummaryAdjuvants enhance vaccine immunogenicity and can be associated with reactogenicity. Novel multidisciplinary approaches hold promise to accelerate and de-risk targeted adjuvant discovery and development.Video abstracthttp://links.lww.com/MOP/A53.","Nanishi, Etsuro;Dowling, David J.;Levy, Ofer",Journal,Current Opinion in Pediatrics,2020-02-01,Boston Children's Hospital;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Harvard Medical School,adjuvant ;  biomarker ;  reactogenicity ;  safety ;  vaccine
Carbon congestion effects in China's industry: Evidence from provincial and sectoral levels,"Investigating carbon congestion effect can help identify congestion in production, which is of great significance for the rational use of resources and the effective promotion of carbon emissions reduction. Under this circumstance, this study uses the dual model of radial DEA to explore both undesirable/desirable congestion, returns to damage and damages to return during 2005–2015 from both provincial and sectoral levels. Combined with window analysis, the technical efficiency and emissions reduction potential of China's industrial sectors are also discussed. The empirical results show that: (1) China's industrial carbon congestion is obvious and the congestion effect witnesses a trend of regional agglomeration and evident regional and sectoral heterogeneity. In particular, undesirable congestion mainly occurs in the eastern region, and desirable congestion mainly occurs in the western region, followed by the eastern region; both undesirable and desirable congestions mainly occur in some sectors in the Manufacturing and Power-Gas-Water industries. (2) If all sectors produce on the production frontier, the average annual potential carbon emissions reduction would reach 722.82 million tons, with the higher potential in western region and Shanxi province of central region, as well as Manufacturing and six high-energy-consuming sectors. (3) To achieve the “win-win” of industrial development and carbon emissions reduction, China's western region should focus on green technology innovation, while the eastern region and Power-Gas-Water industry should focus on both input resources optimisation and green technology innovation.","Zhang, Yue Jun;Liu, Jing Yue;Su, Bin",Journal,Energy Economics,2020-02-01,Hunan University;National University of Singapore,Carbon congestion effect ;  Carbon dioxide emissions ;  China ;  Industry ;  Radial DEA
Silk biomaterials in wound healing and skin regeneration therapeutics: From bench to bedside,"Silk biomaterials are known for biomedical and tissue engineering applications including drug delivery and implantable devices owing to their biocompatible and a wide range of ideal physico-chemical properties. Herein, we present a critical overview of the progress of silk-based matrices in skin regeneration therapeutics with an emphasis on recent innovations and scientific findings. Beginning with a brief description of numerous varieties of silks, the review summarizes our current understanding of the biological properties of silk that help in the wound healing process. Various silk varieties such as silkworm silk fibroin, silk sericin, native spider silk and recombinant silk materials have been explored for cutaneous wound healing applications from the past few decades. With an aim to harness the regenerative properties of silk, numerous strategies have been applied to develop functional bioactive wound dressings and viable bio-artificial skin grafts in recent times. The review examines multiple inherent properties of silk that aid in the critical events of the healing process such as cell migration, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization. A detailed insight into the progress of silk-based cellular skin grafts is also provided that discusses various co-culture strategies and development of bilayer and tri-layer human skin equivalent under in vitro conditions. In addition, functionalized silk matrices loaded with bioactive molecules and antibacterial compounds are discussed, which have shown great potential in treating hard-to-heal wounds. Finally, clinical studies performed using silk-based translational products are reviewed that validate their regenerative properties and future applications in this area. Statement of significance: The review article discusses the recent advances in silk-based technologies for wound healing applications, covering various types of silk biomaterials and their properties suitable for wound repair and regeneration. The article demonstrates the progress of silk-based matrices with an update on the patented technologies and clinical advancements over the years. The rationale behind this review is to highlight numerous properties of silk biomaterials that aid in all the critical events of the wound healing process towards skin regeneration. Functionalization strategies to fabricate silk dressings containing bioactive molecules and antimicrobial compounds for drug delivery to the wound bed are discussed. In addition, a separate section describes the approaches taken to generate living human skin equivalent that have recently contributed in the field of skin tissue engineering.","Chouhan, Dimple;Mandal, Biman B.",Journal,Acta Biomaterialia,2020-02-01,Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati,Fibroin ;  Recombinant silk ;  Sericin ;  Silk ;  Skin tissue engineering ;  Wound healing

Aerodynamic passive stabilization design and flight data analyses for transitional regime satellite LX-1,"The transitional regime satellite LX-1, was designed by the Innovation Academy for Microsatellites Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAMCAS) to conduct research on transitional regime rarefied gas. The LX-1 successfully stabilized attitudes by aerodynamic torque for more than 72 h. It featured the lowest orbit altitude between 110km and 130km of every active spacecraft and firstly confirmed aerodynamic passive stabilization design was feasible for transitional regime satellites. In the paper, the authors revealed the design methods, including stability analyses and design details in LX-1. As well, the presented flight data of LX-1 demonstrated that the design displayed the capability to maintain attitude better than 10∘ and 0.5∘/s for the transitional regime satellite. Further studies suggested that the design could simplify control system design, reduce the propellant requirement for active attitude control and prolong the satellite's lifetime. Therefore, aerodynamic passive stabilization design had considerable potential in aerospace engineering and the study could provide the experience for further research.","Xuegang, Zhang;Zhencai, Zhu;Hongyu, Chen",Journal,Acta Astronautica,2020-02-01,Innovation Academy for Microsatellites of CAS;ShanghaiTech University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences,Aerodynamic passive stability ;  Control system design ;  Flight data ;  Stability margin ;  Transitional regime vehicle
Serious' factor - A relevant starting point for further debate: A response,"In this reply, we wish to defend our original position and address several of the points raised by two excellent responses. The first response (De Miguel Beriain) questions the relevance of the notion of serious' within the context of human germline genome modification (HGGM). We argue that the serious' factor is relevant and that there is a need for medical and social lenses to delineate the limits of acceptability and initial permissible applications of HGGM. In this way, serious' acts as a starting point for further discussions and debates on the acceptability of the potential clinical translation of HGGM. Therefore, there is a pressing need to clarify its scope, from a regulatory perspective, so as to prevent individuals from using HGGM for non-therapeutic or enhancement purposes. The second response (Kalsi) criticizes the narrow interpretation of the objectivist approach and the apparent bias towards material innovations when discussing the right to benefit from scientific advancements. As an in-depth discussion of the objectivist and constructivist approaches was beyond the scope of our original paper, we chose to focus on one specific objectivist account, one which focuses on biological and scientific facts. We agree, however, with the critique that material innovations should not be the sole focus of the right to benefit from scientific advancements, which also incorporates freedom of scientific research and access to scientific knowledge scientific freedom and knowledge, including the influence of these on ethical thinking and cultures.","Kleiderman, Erika;Ravitsky, Vardit;Knoppers, Bartha Maria",Journal,Journal of Medical Ethics,2020-02-01,McGill Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences;University of Montreal,enhancement ;  ethics ;  gene therapy/transfer ;  genetic engineering

"A comprehensive review on recent biological innovations to improve biogas production, Part 2: Mainstream and downstream strategies","This review is aimed at detailing and discussing biological innovations and optimizations including upstream, mainstream, and downstream approaches in biogas production elaborated in the recently published patents and research papers. In the first part of this review, upstream strategies including pretreatments by fungal, microbial consortium, and enzymatic as well as some other biological methods including microaeration, composting, ensiling, and genetic and metabolic engineering were comprehensively presented and duly discussed. Despite the fact that these approaches hold great promise for improving the quantity and quality of the evolved biogas, the need for more processing time and extra equipment are the main drawbacks of such strategies. In the second part of this review, mainstream and downstream strategies are reviewed, and their merits and limitations are outlined. Bioaugmentation, anaerobic co-digestion, and integrated biogas production are evaluated as mainstream strategies. Finally, downstream biological approaches used for removal of CO2, H2S, and other impurities are reviewed and discussed. Among the mainstream biological techniques, bioaugmentation is highly advised to accelerate start-up periods at commercial scale while anaerobic co-digestion is recommended to not only enhance biogas yield throughout the operation but also to take advantage of different waste streams. Such mainstream strategies could contribute to improving the economic facets of biogas plants. Despite their currently underdeveloped status, downstream techniques for biological removal of biogas impurities are expected to replace their physiochemical counterparts at industrial scale in future owing to increasingly stringent environmental regulations.","Tabatabaei, Meisam;Aghbashlo, Mortaza;Valijanian, Elena;Kazemi Shariat Panahi, Hamed;Nizami, Abdul Sattar;Ghanavati, Hossein;Sulaiman, Alawi;Mirmohamadsadeghi, Safoora;Karimi, Keikhosro",Journal,Renewable Energy,2020-02-01,Isfahan University of Technology;University of Tehran;Agricultural Biotechnology Research Institute of Iran;King Abdulaziz University;Universiti Teknologi MARA;Biofuel Research Team (BRTeam),Anaerobic digestion ;  Biogas production ;  Biological innovations ;  Downstream strategies ;  Mainstream strategies
"A comprehensive review on recent biological innovations to improve biogas production, Part 1: Upstream strategies","This study reviews the innovations and optimizations in biogas production from the biological perspective reported by recently published patents and research works. The proposed biological strategies can be categorized into three different groups, i.e., upstream, mainstream, and downstream approaches. In the first part of this review, upstream strategies, including pretreatments by fungal, microbial consortium, and enzymatic as well as some other biological methods including microaeration, composting, ensiling, and genetic and metabolic engineering are discussed in detail. The impacts of upstream strategies on biogas production as well as their potentials in further improving the biogas industry are comprehensively scrutinized. Despite their promising impacts on biogas production, such biological innovations are time-consuming and require extra equipment and facilities that should be addressed in future studies. Overall, most information on biogas production has been generated through lab-scale investigations and not by commercial plants, undermining the commercial value of these data for the right decision-making. Pilot data would be necessary for techno-economic analyses with acceptable accuracies. Therefore, the future efforts should be directed toward providing the missing data for re-engineering designs, calculations, and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the newly designed biogas plants.","Tabatabaei, Meisam;Aghbashlo, Mortaza;Valijanian, Elena;Kazemi Shariat Panahi, Hamed;Nizami, Abdul Sattar;Ghanavati, Hossein;Sulaiman, Alawi;Mirmohamadsadeghi, Safoora;Karimi, Keikhosro",Journal,Renewable Energy,2020-02-01,Isfahan University of Technology;University of Tehran;Agricultural Biotechnology Research Institute of Iran;King Abdulaziz University;Universiti Teknologi MARA;Biofuel Research Team (BRTeam),Anaerobic digestion ;  Biogas production ;  Biological treatment ;  Lignocellulose ;  Pretreatment ;  Upstream strategy
TILOS local scale Technology Innovation enabling low carbon energy transition,"Community renewable energy and citizens' energy needs are crucial issues on the global political agenda. The indispensable legislative and regulatory, while also the necessary technological, societal and behavioral developments in order to support the energy transition will require public understanding and ownership to deliver their full potential. The main discussion is how to enable low-carbon energy transitions based on renewable-energy technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, biogas plants or geothermal plants. Digitalization of energy and distributed storage are shaping the future of electricity use. Micro Grids (MG) on the other hand represent the means by which the purpose will be achieved. In Tilos island Technology Innovation for the Local Scale Optimum Integration of Battery Energy Storage (TILOS) case, it has been identified that the Quadruple Helix's (QH) components are accelerating the transfer of research and innovation results to regional growth while stressing the replicating potentials. Taking into consideration all parameters involved, while learning from pioneers' evidence, low-carbon energy transition and energy supply for isolated areas can be achieved.

Transforming ecology and conservation biology through genome editing,"As the conservation challenges increase, new approaches are needed to help combat losses in biodiversity and slow or reverse the decline of threatened species. Genome-editing technology is changing the face of modern biology, facilitating applications that were unimaginable only a decade ago. The technology has the potential to make significant contributions to the fields of evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation, yet the fear of unintended consequences from designer ecosystems containing engineered organisms has stifled innovation. To overcome this gap in the understanding of what genome editing is and what its capabilities are, more research is needed to translate genome-editing discoveries into tools for ecological research. Emerging and future genome-editing technologies include new clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) targeted sequencing and nucleic acid detection approaches as well as species genetic barcoding and somatic genome-editing technologies. These genome-editing tools have the potential to transform the environmental sciences by providing new noninvasive methods for monitoring threatened species or for enhancing critical adaptive traits. A pioneering effort by the conservation community is required to apply these technologies to real-world conservation problems.","Phelps, Michael P.;Seeb, Lisa W.;Seeb, James E.",Journal,Conservation Biology,2020-02-01,University of Washington,CRISPR ;  de-extinction ;  ecological genomics ;  environmental DNA ;  facilitated adaptation ;  genetic manipulation ;  genetic marking ;  genome editing
Status and perspectives of solid state photon detectors,"Development of solid state photon detectors is a mature field of engineering and technology based on well-established grounds of solid state physics, and, in the same time, a frontier area of research and innovations faced with dramatic challenges. The ultimate challenge for the modern developments is a detection of optical signals at a quantum level – resolving arrival time and spatial location of individual photons – to realize a formula “every photon counts”. To succeed, the developments are focused on improvements in three directions: threshold sensitivity and photon number resolution, fast timing and time resolution, and fine granularity imaging with fast readout. There are many inherent trade-offs to be resolved in each direction. Development of Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) is considered as one of the most promising innovations toward “near ideal” photon detector. SiPMs of various designs have been developed in the 1990s–2000s in Russia, and their unique performance in the photon number and time resolution has been demonstrated and recognized in the mid-2000s. Now SiPMs are widely implemented in nuclear medicine, high energy physics, astrophysics, and Cherenkov light detection. However, developers of Geiger Mode APD or SPAD arrays based on active quenching also found new approaches and opportunities for considerable improvements using modern CMOS technology, namely: reduction of a dead space occupied by electronics, multiplexing readout architecture, backside illumination, and 3D integration of photosensor and electronic layers (3D digital SiPM). Detection of Cherenkov light is one of the most challenging applications for photodetectors. Superior photon number resolution starting from single photons, picosecond-scale time resolution, and large-area imaging are typical requirements, and all these highly demanded capabilities are contradictory.

Marrying the Best of Both Worlds: An Integrated Framework for Matching Technology Transfer Sources and Recipients,"Motivated by the limited research on technology transfer from public research institutions (PRIs) to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and the scant literature on assessing the fit between technology transfer source and recipient, we aim to answer: How do we bridge the knowledge gap between PRIs and SMEs to facilitate the pretransfer matching process? Taking each technology transfer project as the unit of analysis and adopting information processing theory, we equate information processing requirements with technology readiness levels of the technologies intended to be transferred from PRIs, and information processing capacities with demand readiness levels of the capabilities possessed by SMEs, and present an integrated framework that advocates transfer source-recipient matchings to facilitate PRI-SME technology transfer.","Liu, Hung Yao;Subramanian, Annapoornima M.;Hang, Chang Chieh",Journal,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2020-02-01,National University of Singapore,Demand readiness level (DRL) ;  information processing theory ;  public research institution (PRI) ;  small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) ;  technology readiness level (TRL) ;  technology transfer

Innovation and practice of the key technologies for the efficient development of the Supergiant Anyue Gas Field,"In recent years, the Sichuan Basin has been the most potential hydrocarbon-bearing basin in China thanks to the great exploration and development breakthroughs of deep large integral carbonate gas reservoirs and shale gas in this basin. The Anyue Gas Field located in central Sichuan Basin is not only the largest carbonate gas reservoir, but the most important supergiant gas field discovered in China in recent years. However, it faces a series of major difficulties, e.g. low reservoir porosity, low permeability, low gas well productivity, thin and vertically and laterally disperse gas layer, strong heterogeneity, quite low structural amplitude and complicated gas-water relationship, which bring great challenges to the rapid conversion of natural gas reserves to production. In this regard, technical researches have been carried out continuously. As a result, many key technologies have been innovatively integrated and great breakthroughs have been realized in many aspects. First, fine development technologies for supergiant, ancient and complex carbonate gas reservoirs are developed innovatively, ""transparent gas reservoir"" is constructed and the technologies for cultivating high-yield wells are established. By virtue of these technologies, all development wells in the gas reservoir of Lower Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation reach the target of high yield and the single-well gas production rate of the gas reservoir of Lower Sinian Dengying Formation is increased significantly, which provides support for the long-term high production and stable production of Anyue Gas Field. Second, good and fast construction technologies for large-scale gas fields are innovatively integrated. Based on this, the safety of gas wells is under control in the whole life cycle, quality engineering is built up efficiently within 3 years, green mining areas are forged and large-scale safe and clean gas fields are built up efficiently. Third, intelligent control technologies for the development of supergiant gas fields are innovatively integrated. By means of these technologies, internet of everything, depth perception and automatic production are realized. The intelligent technologies of new generation are fused, including AR, VR, robot and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A new intelligent management mode for gas field development is set up, and an intelligent gas field is built up. Fourth, optimization technologies for the overall development of supergiant gas fields are innovatively developed, so as to improve the development effects of strong-heterogeneity gas reservoirs and ensure the long-term stable production of supergiant water-bearing gas reservoirs. The research results can be used as reference for the efficient development of similar domestic and foreign gas fields.","Xie, Jun",Journal,Natural Gas Industry,2020-01-25,China National Petroleum Corporation,Anyue Gas Field ;  Central Sichuan Basin ;  Efficient development ;  Intelligent gas field ;  Intelligent management ;  Strong Heterogeneity ;  Supergiant carbonate gas reservoir ;  Transparent gas reservoir
Transdisciplinary engineering systems,"This chapter focuses on transdisciplinary processes in the engineering domain. It adopts a systems approach for characterizing and describing transdisciplinary engineering research processes. The chapter identifies challenges that need to be overcome. It states that a system view will help to understand the complexity of transdisciplinary processes and to anticipate the challenges that need attention. Transdisciplinary systems themselves consist of subsystems, which may each be transdisciplinary also. These subsystems consist of different processes, which need different people and knowledge for their execution. Implementing the Industry 4.0 concept in a company clearly requires a transdisciplinary engineering research approach. Changing the business is not only a technical task but involves the whole business as well as sponsors, legislators, and financers. The people in the company as well as existing and potential markets play an important role too. The chapter describes two examples of such multilayered transdisciplinary systems to illustrate the concept.","Wognum, Nel;Mo, John P.T.;Stjepandić, Josip",Book,"Systems Engineering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution: Big Data, Novel Technologies, and Modern Systems Engineering",2020-01-24,RMIT University;Delft University of Technology;PROSTEP AG,Business development ;  Industry 4.0 concept ;  Multilayered transdisciplinary systems ;  Open innovation ;  System concept ;  Transdisciplinary engineering systems

Biofixation of atmospheric nitrogen in the context of world staple crop production: Policy perspectives,"The extensive use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers implicates a paradox: while fertilizers ensure the supply of a large amount of food, they cause negative environmental externalities, including reduced biodiversity, and eutrophic streams and lakes. Moreover, such fertilizers may also result in a major public health hazard: increased antibiotic resistance. This article discusses the critical implications of perturbations in N cycle caused by excessive use of fertilizers and resulting policy implications as they relate to ecosystem services. While there are solutions such as cover crops, these solutions are expensive and inconvenient for farmers. We advocate the use of biological fixation (BF) for staple crops—microbiome mediated natural supply of fixed N. This would involve engineering a microbiome that can be grown cheaply and at industrial scale. Fertilizers resulting from such innovation are termed as “biofertilizers” in this article. Following a qualitative cost-benefit analysis broken down by key stakeholders and a quick exploration of policy frameworks as they relate to the advancement of biofertilizers, we propose a practical pathway of where and how research investments should be directed to make such a solution feasible. We make five policy recommendations for decision-makers to facilitate a successful trajectory for this solution: (1) Future agricultural science should seek to understand how BF might be employed as a practical and efficient strategy. This effort would require that industry and the government partner to establish a pre-competitive research laboratory equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technologies that conduct metagenomic experiments to reveal signature microbiomes and form novel symbiotic connections. (2) To have a smooth ride in the market, ag-bio companies should: (i) create awareness among farmers; (ii) impart skills to farmers in testing and using biofertilizers, and (iii) conduct extensive field tests and more research in studying the scalability potential of such fertilizers. (3)The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and state governments should provide research and development (R&D) tax credits to biotech companies specifically geared towards R&D investments aimed at increasing the viability of BF and microbiome engineering. (4) To control agricultural pollution in the biosphere, federal governments should consider passing a Clean Agriculture Act (CAA), including a specific clause that regulate the use of chemical fertilizers. (5) Governments and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) should coordinate Biological Advanced Research in Agriculture (BARA)—a global agricultural innovation initiative for investments and research in biological fixation and ethical, legal, and social implications of such innovation. While biological fixation will be central in BARA, we envision it to conduct research around other agricultural innovations as well, such as increasing photosynthetic efficiency.","Khan, Muhammad Salar;Koizumi, Naoru;Olds, James L.",Journal,Science of the Total Environment,2020-01-20,Mason Square,Biofertilizers ;  Biological fixation ;  Environmental externalities ;  Metagenomics ;  Microbiome engineering ;  Nitrogen
Influence of knowledge management on product innovation by intrapreneurial firms,"Purpose: This paper aims to provide a study on knowledge management, facilitating new product innovation by intrapreneurial companies. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology includes the empirical study which was conducted based on detailed questionnaire and data collection of 319 respondents from heavy engineering auto companies, such as Maruti, Honda and others. The data were analyzed to find the influence of knowledge management on new product development. Structural equation modeling method, critical path analysis and reliability were checked by Cronbach’s alpha. Findings: The findings suggest that the innovation of a new product is critical for the companies. Also, it is very important for the companies to have knowledge management systems such as intelligence generation and dissemination process to facilitate information sharing among the various departments. Responsiveness to the market needs would be based on how authentic the customer data are and to what extent the company is able to share these data with research and product development departments to motivate new products for fulfilling these needs of the customers. This kind of process would enable the company to drive the next level of innovation within the company. Research limitations/implications: The present study has several implications for managers and researchers. The model proposed in the study suggests the adoption and implementation of knowledge management for product innovation. The study findings also suggest that developing better methods to share knowledge and intelligence among the employees about the customers’ data would be a very critical success factor for new product innovation. Practical implications: This paper also suggests that the researchers can study this model with respect to inter-disciplinary and inter-country study to become competitive using new product innovation. Originality/value: The study contributes toward development of theory on creating innovation facilitated by knowledge management for enhancing innovation.","Bhardwaj, Broto Rauth",Journal,"Global Knowledge, Memory and Communication",2020-01-20,Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University),Competitiveness ;  Innovation ;  Intelligence ;  Intrapreneurial firms ;  Knowledge management ;  Product
Inclusive leadership and change-oriented organizational citizenship behavior: Role of psychological safety,"Understanding the current business challenges, research has examined different leadership behaviors in relation with change-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) to enhance the ultimate competitive advantage and long-term success of the organizations. However, a comprehensive form of leadership that is more suitable in current challenges namely inclusive leadership (IL) has not been studied in this context. Addressing this important gap, current research examined IL in relationship with change-oriented OCB directly and via mediating role of psychological safety (PS). Data were collected from 296 supervisor-subordinate dyads within 78 work teams working in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across different industries in Pakistan. Using SPSS and AMOS, the results reveal the positive relationship between IL and change-oriented OCB. The results further confirm the mediating role of PS between IL and change-oriented OCB relationship. We utilized causal attribution theory to support our findings and their inferences; several implications for research and practice are also discussed.","Younas, Amjad;Wang, Daoping;Javed, Basharat;Konte, Aboubacar Garba",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-01-17,"Namal University;School of Economics and Management, USTB",Change-oriented organizational citizenship behavior ;  Inclusive leadership ;  Innovation ;  Psychological safety

Research on the factors influencing the technological innovation of military industry listed companies: Taking Jiangsu Province as an Example,"With the development strategy of civil-military integration being upgraded to national strategy since the 18th National Congress, listed companies of military industry have once again become the focus of attention from all walks of life. It is of great practical significance to explore the factors affecting their technological innovation and the mechanism of action. This paper takes the Jiangsu military industry concept listed company as the research object, and selects the latest annual data of the company from 2014 to 2018 as a sample. The study finds that the concentration of ownership is not significantly negatively correlated with the innovation performance of listed companies in the military concept category. The equity balance is significantly positively correlated with the innovation performance of listed companies in the military concept category. However, there is no significant positive correlation between the same group effect of military industry companies' own innovation activities and the innovation performance of enterprises; there is no significant positive correlation between government subsidies and the innovation performance of military industry concept listed companies. Therefore, in view of the improvement of innovation performance of military conceptual enterprises, the feasible direction is to actively introduce private enterprises into the army and promote capital diversification, and strengthen the analysis of market demand and keep up with the trend of innovation in military industry. At the same time, the government should also increase its support to promote its long-term operation and development, and promote the early realization of the Chinese dream of enriching the country and strengthening the army.","Rao, Chuang;Zhou, Caixia",Conference Proceeding,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-01-17,Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Innovation Performance ;  Military Industry Concept Listed Companies ;  Military-Civil Integration
"Exploring the relationships among tacit knowledge sharing, mentoring and employees’ abilities: The case of Al-Hikma pharmaceutical company in Jordan","Purpose: This study aims to assess the relationships among tacit knowledge sharing, mentoring and employees’ abilities in the areas of solving the work problems, adaptation to environments and creation of new innovative ideas. Design/methodology/approach: This study applied quantitative research methods to examine the causal relationships among the key study variables. A questionnaire-based survey developed to evaluate the research model by drawing a convenience sample includes 123 employees working in the selected company headquarters in Jordan. Surveyed data were examined following the structural equation modeling procedures. Findings: Results revealed that tacit knowledge sharing had a positive effect on employees’ abilities in the areas of adaptation to the work environments and creation of innovative ideas, while there was no an affirmative effect on employees’ abilities in the area of solving the work problems. In addition, the study showed that mentoring had a positive effect on employees’ abilities in terms of solving work problems, adaptation to work environments and creation of new innovative ideas. Furthermore, mentoring had mediated the relationship between tacit knowledge sharing and employees’ abilities. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study lay a basis for future studies pertain to the effect of tacit knowledge sharing and mentoring on the employees’ abilities as preconditions for improving organizational performance. These findings would be supported by future research studies, the examining of larger samples of pharmaceutical companies to give deeper meanings and more understandings of the relationship, among key study variables. The authors argue that it is useful to expand the current research by conducting future studies, examining the mediating role of other social learning methods such as storytelling and community of practices on relationship between tacit knowledge sharing and employees abilities. Practical implications: The current research model will assist knowledge managers and practitioners to take serious decisions pertaining employees’ involvement in the process of tacit knowledge sharing and mentoring as preconditions for superior organizational. As well as, it can be a step forward for conducting further research studies on relationships among tacit knowledge sharing, mentoring and employees abilities. Social implications: This suggested model may act as a catalyst for continuous improvements to the Jordan pharmaceutical industry in terms of producing high-quality medicines that improve health of humans and the society at large. Originality/value: Although academic studies on knowledge management showed a positive relationship between tacit knowledge sharing and organizational performance, few studies examined the relationships between tacit knowledge sharing and employees’ abilities as preconditions for superior organizational performance. Furthermore, they ignored to examine the effect of the crucial mediating role of mentoring on the relationship between the two constructs. Therefore, this research tries to fill these gaps appropriately.","Al-Zoubi, Mohammad Orsan;Alrowwad, Alaaldin;Masadeh, Raed",Journal,VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems,2020-01-17,The University of Jordan,Adaptation ;  Employees’ abilities ;  Innovation ;  Mentoring ;  Solving problems ;  Tacit knowledge sharing
BPM and change management: An ambidextrous perspective,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on the implementation of an ambidexterity strategy in a large Italian Company that works in the energy field. The aim of the study is to understand how contextual ambidexterity has been achieved during a business process management (BPM) approach by describing the main variables that interacted during the project implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors based their study both on primary (direct observation and interviews) and secondary (company manuals, books and procedures) qualitative investigations of BPM approach based on three business process re-engineering (BPR) projects and nine total quality management (TQM) projects, focused on change team behaviors, dynamics and dialogues. Findings: The authors observed that the implementation of simultaneously radical and incremental change projects has been influenced by the exploration and exploitation activities related to every single TQM and BPR project considered. The findings suggest that the overall project has been influenced by four main underlying variables, which are task specialization and systems interoperability (knowledge transfer), identity and leadership (knowledge conversion) and two output variables (ambiguity and feedback to change), that, by interacting, enable ambidexterity. Research limitations/implications: BPM is an important option to consider within the ambidexterity theory, being conceptually conceived as an approach in which TQM and BPR actually complement each other. Moreover, the results contextualize the importance of the change management team (CMT) to manage the connections between knowledge creation and refinement, and vice versa, depending particularly on the knowledge conversion process enabled by a flexible team culture. The focus of the study is mainly at the BPR and TQM project level. The authors consider structural ambidexterity and its enabling mechanisms as the framework in which BPM is implemented. Moreover, research limitations are related both to the specificity of the context, a large, highly specialized and mechanistic company and to the qualitative approach that may reduce the generalization of the empirical results. Practical implications: Managers need to be cognizant and aware both of the BPM techniques, in order to sustain ambidexterity, and of ambiguity and change feedback as variables that enable the effective connection of the different steps of innovation or refinement strategy and, therefore, of ambidexterity. Moreover, the contextual factors such as leadership and people identity should be considered and managed as important variables related to change. Originality/value: The originality of this paper is related to improving the understanding of how to implement the theoretical concept of ambidexterity in a real world organization, by providing new evidence that highlights the importance of contextual ambidexterity within a structural ambidexterity strategy during a BPM project.","Binci, Daniele;Belisari, Sara;Appolloni, Andrea",Journal,Business Process Management Journal,2020-01-16,"Università degli Studi di Roma ""Tor Vergata""",Ambidexterity ;  Ambiguity ;  Business process management ;  Business process re-engineering ;  Change ;  Resistance ;  Total quality management
Research on configuration design and operation effect evaluation for ultra high voltage (UHV) vertical insulator cleaning robot,"Purpose: This study aims to the three major problems of low cleaning efficiency, high labor intensity and difficult to evaluate the cleaning effect for manual insulators cleaning in ultra high voltage (UHV) converter station, the purpose of this paper is to propose a basic configuration of UHV vertical insulator cleaning robot with multi-freedom-degree mechanical arm system on mobile airborne platform and its innovation cleaning operation motion planning. Design/methodology/approach: The main factors affecting the insulators cleaning effect in the operation process have been analyzed. Because of the complex coupling relationship between the influencing factors and the insulators cleaning effect, it is difficult to establish its analytical mathematical model. Combining the non-linear mapping and approximation characteristics of back propagation (BP) neural network, the insulator cleaning effect evaluation can be abstracted as a non-linear approximation process from actual cleaning effect to ideal cleaning effect. An evaluation method of robot insulator cleaning effect based on BP neural network has been proposed. Findings: Through the BP neural network training, the robot cleaning control parameters can be obtained and used in the robot online operation control, so that the better cleaning effect can be also obtained. Finally, a physical prototype of UHV vertical insulator cleaning robot has been developed, and the effectiveness and engineering practicability of the proposed robot configuration, cleaning effect evaluation method are all verified by simulation experiments and field operation experiments. At the same time, this method has the remarkable characteristics of sound versatility, strong adaptability, easy expansion and popularization. Originality/value: An UHV vertical insulator cleaning robot operation system platform with multi-arm system on airborne platform has been proposed. Through the coordinated movement of the manipulator each joint, the manipulator can be positioned to the insulator strings, and the insulator can be cleaned by two pairs high-pressure nozzles located at the double manipulator. The influence factors of robot insulator cleaning effect have been analyzed. The BP neural network model of insulator cleaning effect evaluation has been established. The evaluation method of robot insulator cleaning effect based on BP neural network has also been proposed, and the corresponding evaluation result can be obtained through the network training. Through the system integration design, the robot physical prototype has been developed. For the evaluation of other operation effects of power system, the validity and engineering practicability of the robot mechanism, motion planning and the method for evaluating the effect of robot insulator cleaning have been verified by simulation and field operation experiments.","Yan, Yu;Jiang, Wei;Zhang, An;Li, Qiao Min;Li, Hong Jun;Chen, Wei;Lei, Yun Fei",Journal,Industrial Robot,2020-01-16,Wuhan Textile University;State Grid Corporation of China;Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Live Working Technology and Equipment (Robot);State Grid of Hunan Electric Power Company Maintenance Company,BP neural network ;  Configuration design ;  Effect evaluation ;  Insulator cleaning ;  Robot
Progress and development directions of deep oil and gas exploration and development in China,"It is of great practical and strategic significance to marching deeper into the earth and explore deep oil and gas resources to build up a solid resource base for China energy security, which is also a practical field to strengthen the oil and gas exploration and development for China. Based on a systematic summary of the global deep oil and gas exploration and development situation and the progress in China, the development potential, key research fields and scientific and technological research directions of deep oil and gas in China were thoroughly analyzed. China is rich in deep oil and gas resources, but with low degree of exploration and development. There are a great number of promising exploration and development prospects with great resource potential, such as multiple source-reservoir-cap assemblages in the deep formations of superimposed basins in Central and Western China, deep lithological reservoirs and Pre-Mesozoic-Cenozoic buried-hill reservoirs in rifted basins in Eastern China and deep shale gas, etc. These are the main directions for future exploration and development. It is necessary to strengthen the researches on accumulation mechanism and distribution laws of deep oil and gas, as well as fluids flow mechanism in deep, and carry out key technical researches such as deep target identification and prediction based on geophysics, optimized fast drilling under complex formation conditions and stimulation technologies for complex reservoirs. At the same time, it is also necessary to vigorously promote management innovation, further enhance the cooperation between theory and technology, enterprises and departments, and strengthen the management and operation of exploration-development integration and geology-engineering integration, so as to provide a strong support for efficient exploration and development of deep oil and gas resources.","Li, Yang;Xue, Zhaojie;Cheng, Zhe;Jiang, Haijun;Wang, Ruyue",Journal,China Petroleum Exploration,2020-01-15,Sinopec;China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation,Deep gas ;  Deep oil ;  Development direction ;  Engineering technology ;  Exploration and development ;  Resource potential
Innovation in agricultural engineering and technology to accelerate green development of agriculture,"Green development of agriculture is a profound revolution in the concept of agricultural development and the inevitable course to achieve sustainable development of agriculture in China. This study reviewed the roles and challenges of agricultural engineering and technology on green development of agriculture and proposed the near future directions. The level of protection and utilization of agricultural water and soil resources in China has gradually increased, and the utilization rate of agricultural waste such as crop straws, animal manure, and agricultural membranes has increased greatly. However, problems such as water shortages and arable land degradation are serious. The utilization rate of chemical fertilizers and pesticides for food crops has been increasing year by year. However, the problems of excessive application of pesticides, and external pollution still need to be resolved. In the field of agricultural ecological protection and construction, a series of projects such as soil and water conservation, returning farmland to forests and grasses had been carried out and results were delightful. However, high-intensity and extensive production methods have caused problems such as the structural imbalance in agricultural ecosystems and functional degradation. The level of quality and safety of agricultural products in China has gradually improved. However, issues such as pesticide residues, resistance gene residues, and heavy metal pollution in a few regions are still not optimistic. To resolve these problems, this paper proposed possible technological innovation in agricultural engineering serving green agrarian development: 1) In the field of agricultural resource monitoring, the further research should focus on core technologies of monitoring, evaluation, and early warning analysis of cultivated land quality, biological resources, production environment, non-point source pollution, and land carrying capacity so as to build decision-making systems that could integrate real-time monitoring, remote diagnosis, early warning, emergency prevention and control, and command and dispatch. 2) In the field of utilization of water and soil resources, the future study should enhance the use efficiency of agricultural water resources by developing water-saving equipments, establish efficient water-saving modes, improve the efficiency of land resource utilization by focusing on construction of farmland ecosystems and rehabilitation of farmland pollution. 3) In regard to agricultural inputs, the focus should be on the transformation of fertilization application methods, the application of new fertilizer technologies, as well as high-yield and efficient fertilization technologies for crops. In regard to pesticide reduction and control, the key was to develop in-situ intelligent nutrient detection, enhance fertilizer reduction and efficiency based on fertilizer application limit standards, accelerate the revision of organic fertilizer industry standards, promote the use of new fertilizer products, and develop fertilizer reductions for different crops in different regions. 4) In terms of agricultural mechanization, the main direction of the future research was to focus on fields such as large-scale field planting, facility agriculture, cash crops and aquaculture of livestock and poultry, and resource-saving agricultural machinery, straw return to the field, intelligent agricultural equipment sensors, agricultural machinery navigation, and precision operations. 5) In terms of agrarian waste resource utilization, the next work should explore the theoretical system of agricultural waste resources recycling, biological transformation and pollutant removal mechanisms, and develop equipments related to returning crop straws to the field, maturation of anaerobic fermentation, pyrolysis carbonization, and collection and storage of agricultural waste resources and so on. This paper put forward to policy suggestions from 4 aspects: strengthening the concept of green agricultural development, establishing a technological innovation and extension system, improving the construction of a standard order and strengthening policy support. It is hoped to provide meaningful guidance for further improving China's agricultural engineering technology innovation level and promoting green agrarian development.","Sui, Bin;Dong, Shanshan;Meng, Haibo;Wang, Jiarui;Shen, Yujun;Ding, Jingtao;Zhou, Haibin;Feng, Jing",Journal,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2020-01-15,Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China,Agricultural engineering ;  Agriculture ;  Green development ;  Technological innovation
The energy and ecological performance of the hot water boiler burning linden bark and wood briquettes,"The North-West of Russia possesses huge wood resources reserves, therefore the issues of the most efficient use of wood biomass are relevant for this region. The implication of wood biofuels into fuel and energy budget provides an opportunity to reduce the negative impact of power industry facilities on the environment and preserve the potential of non-renewable fuels for future generations. An effective way of the complex solution of energy and ecological problems, while providing heating loads for consumers, is the use of modern devices operating on solid biofuel. Technical analysis of foreign and domestic high-performance heating units has great importance. The aim of the research is an evaluation of energy and ecological performance of the Firematic 60 hot water boiler burning bark of linden, briquettes from wood sanding dust and sawdust of plywood processing, as well as briquettes obtained by pressing softwood sawdust and shavings.

Plant Synthetic Metabolic Engineering for Enhancing Crop Nutritional Quality,"Nutrient deficiencies in crops are a serious threat to human health, especially for populations in poor areas. To overcome this problem, the development of crops with nutrient-enhanced traits is imperative. Biofortification of crops to improve nutritional quality helps combat nutrient deficiencies by increasing the levels of specific nutrient components. Compared with agronomic practices and conventional plant breeding, plant metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies are more effective and accurate in synthesizing specific micronutrients, phytonutrients, and/or bioactive components in crops. In this review, we discuss recent progress in the field of plant synthetic metabolic engineering, specifically in terms of research strategies of multigene stacking tools and engineering complex metabolic pathways, with a focus on improving traits related to micronutrients, phytonutrients, and bioactive components. Advances and innovations in plant synthetic metabolic engineering would facilitate the development of nutrient-enriched crops to meet the nutritional needs of humans.","Zhu, Qinlong;Wang, Bin;Tan, Jiantao;Liu, Taoli;Li, Li;Liu, Yao Guang",Journal,Plant Communications,2020-01-13,South China Agricultural University;Cornell University;Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture,crop biofortification ;  plant metabolic engineering ;  synthetic biology ;  transgene stacking
"Theoretical Difficulties and Research Progresses of Mechanism Reconfiguration in Mechanisms -Evolution Connotation, Furcation Principle, Design Synthesis and Application of Metamorphic Mechanisms","The development of productivity and the innovation of engineering technology required mechanisms to have the multi-function of self-reorganization and reconfiguration to meet the needs of complex working conditions. Reconfigurable mechanisms had variable mobility and varying configurations to meet the requirements of multiple tasks, multiple working conditions and multiple functions. However, the research history of mechanism evolution and furcation principle, which determined the design method, was still not fully understood by scholars. Herein, from the point of view of the evolution and furcation principle of metamorphic mechanisms, based on screw theory, Lie group, Lie algebra and differential manifold, the mechanism evolution and the interrelationship between the mechanism motions and the constraint spaces were revealed. Then, the furcation principle and the controllable singularity configuration in the evolution of the mechanism were explored. Moreover, the historical relationship between metamorphic mechanisms, origami mechanisms and deployable mechanisms was discussed, and the configuration design, performance synthesis, new design concept of metamorphic mechanisms and their innovative application were reviewed.","Kang, Xi;Dai, Jiansheng",Journal,Zhongguo Jixie Gongcheng/China Mechanical Engineering,2020-01-10,Tianjin University;National University of Singapore;King's College London,Design synthesis ;  Evolution connotation ;  Furcation principle ;  Metamorphic mechanism ;  Origami mechanism

Barriers to circular business model innovation: A multiple-case study,"The concept of circular economy has been suggested as a possible avenue to sustainable development. The adoption of circular business models at a company level, which is a key element in the transition to a circular economy, has nevertheless been slow. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the barriers that hinder adoption of circular business models to facilitate circumvention of the barriers and a faster uptake. The article presents a multiple-case study of the circular business model innovation process in 12 Danish companies that includes a cross-case analysis across start-ups and incumbents and across different company sizes, industries and customer segments. The article furthermore compares the barriers derived from this empirical work to barriers found in the sustainable innovation literature. The research shows that barriers to circular business model innovation are found at all socio-technical levels and, overall, most barriers are encountered by companies at the organisational level, followed by the value chain level, the employee level and, finally, the market and institutional level. However, there are significant variation between the case companies regarding what barriers are encountered and how many in total. The cross-case analysis shows that factors other than company size, industry and customer segment affect what barriers are encountered. The comparison of empirically derived circular business model innovation barriers from the multiple-case study with barriers compiled from the broader literature on sustainable innovation shows a good correspondence between the two lists. The empirical study, nevertheless, identifies additional barriers not previously reported in the literature.","Guldmann, Eva;Huulgaard, Rikke Dorothea",Journal,Journal of Cleaner Production,2020-01-10,Aalborg University,Barriers ;  Circular business model innovation ;  Circular business models ;  Circular economy ;  Multiple-case study
Social science-guided feature engineering: A novel approach to signed link analysis,"Many real-world relations can be represented by signed networks with positive links (e.g., friendships and trust) and negative links (e.g., foes and distrust). Link prediction helps advance tasks in social network analysis such as recommendation systems. Most existing work on link analysis focuses on unsigned social networks. The existence of negative links piques research interests in investigating whether properties and principles of signed networks differ from those of unsigned networks and mandates dedicated efforts on link analysis for signed social networks. Recent findings suggest that properties of signed networks substantially differ from those of unsigned networks and negative links can be of significant help in signed link analysis in complementary ways. In this article,we center our discussion on a challenging problem of signed link analysis. Signed link analysis faces the problem of data sparsity, i.e., only a small percentage of signed links are given. This problem can even getworse when negative links are much sparser than positive ones as users are inclined more toward positive disposition rather than negative. We investigate how we can take advantage of other sources of information for signed link analysis. This research is mainly guided by three social science theories, Emotional Information, Diffusion of Innovations, and Individual Personality. Guided by these, we extract three categories of related features and leverage them for signed link analysis. Experiments showthe significance of the features gleaned from social theories for signed link prediction and addressing the data sparsity challenge.","Beigi, Ghazaleh;Tang, Jiliang;Liu, Huan",Journal,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,2020-01-09,College of Engineering;Arizona State University,Data sparsity ;  Diffusion of innovation ;  Emotional information ;  Feature engineering ;  Individual personality ;  Signed link analysis ;  Social theory

On the Influence of Platform Economy on Transformation and Upgrading of Chinese Traditional Manufacturing Industry - A Case Study of Red Collar Group,"The profitability of the traditional manufacturing industry is sluggish and fails to well adapt to the current trend of economic globalization. In the context of industry 4.0, it is imperative for the traditional manufacturing industry to transform and upgrade in an all-round way in the market-oriented and government-led environment. At this time, platform economy furnishes a good impetus for the transformation and upgrading of traditional manufacturing industry. Traditional manufacturing industry adapts to the needs of the external market environment through platform structure, adjusts factor input premised on dynamic changes in factor endowment, integrates scientific and technological revolution, and gradually cultivates competitiveness through continuous technological innovation, thereby achieving the transformation and upgrading of industry. In the background of conversion of era, this paper explores the innovation of traditional enterprises in the current historical background from the angle of evolution, attempting to reveal that platform economy helps traditional manufacturing enterprises to update their production methods, restructure their management structures and set up supply chain thinking, thereby pushing forward their transformation and upgrading. Taking the transformation and upgrading of Red Collar Group as an example, this paper analyzes the process of rapid learning, resource integration, innovation iteration, self-fission, and continuous evolution of the enterprise premised on platform economy, thereby proving the positive impetus of platform economy to the transformation of traditional manufacturing industry and testing its logical rationality. The research concludes that platform economy will become one of the significant strategic modes of transformation and upgrading of traditional manufacturing industry in China.","Song, Hanyu;Liu, Mengyun",Conference Proceeding,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2020-01-07,China University of Petroleum,

Innovations in electrodermal activity data collection and signal processing: A systematic review,"The electrodermal activity (EDA) signal is an electrical manifestation of the sympathetic innervation of the sweat glands. EDA has a history in psychophysiological (including emotional or cognitive stress) research since 1879, but it was not until recent years that researchers began using EDA for pathophysiological applications like the assessment of fatigue, pain, sleepiness, exercise recovery, diagnosis of epilepsy, neuropathies, depression, and so forth. The advent of new devices and applications for EDA has increased the development of novel signal processing techniques, creating a growing pool of measures derived mathematically from the EDA. For many years, simply computing the mean of EDA values over a period was used to assess arousal. Much later, researchers found that EDA contains information not only in the slow changes (tonic component) that the mean value represents, but also in the rapid or phasic changes of the signal. The techniques that have ensued have intended to provide a more sophisticated analysis of EDA, beyond the traditional tonic/phasic decomposition of the signal. With many researchers from the social sciences, engineering, medicine, and other areas recently working with EDA, it is timely to summarize and review the recent developments and provide an updated and synthesized framework for all researchers interested in incorporating EDA into their research.","Posada-Quintero, Hugo F.;Chon, Ki H.",Journal,Sensors (Switzerland),2020-01-02,Biomedical Engineering Department,EDA data collection ;  EDA data quality assessment ;  EDA signal processing ;  Electrodermal activity ;  Sympathetic function

Ice Research in Norway from an Engineering perspective,"The current paper gives a historical review of research on ice in Norway from an engineering perspective, both covering ice in rivers and lakes, as well as ice in the ocean. Pioneering work is mentioned for both categories. For river and lake ice formation Dr. Olaf Devik was a pioneer developing instrumentation that could measure supercooling of water in rivers and lakes. He was followed by Dr. Edvigs Kanavin and others. This part of the paper is followed by studies of atmospheric icing and sea spray icing. The rest of the paper has a focus on research related to ice in the ocean, both sea ice and glacial ice. Pioneering work on sea ice was done by meteorologist Torgny Vinje at the Norwegian Polar Institute. In the 1980ies the oil and gas industry active on the Norwegian Continental started to pay attention to the Barents Sea. The information for engineering purposes related to design and operation of offshore structures in these icy waters was quite limited. Thus several companies realized that a proper design database on ice in the ocean for these waters should be established. The first well documented sea ice and iceberg study in the Barents Sea became the multi-sensor ice data acquisition programme ICEBASE. This programme was led by Dr. Sveinung Løset and later followed by the programme IDAP. This first wave of studies was followed by more dedicated surveys after the millennium of which the centre for research-based innovation SAMCoT (Sustainable Arctic Marine and Coastal Technology) hosted by NTNU was the major one.","Løset, Sveinung",Conference Proceeding,IAHR International Symposium on Ice,2020-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,

Research for Curricular Innovation in Action in the Mathematics Classroom,"It is difficult for research in Mathematics Education to have any real impact on teaching practice in the classroom. Conscious of this, we have developed a research model for curricular innovation, involving the teachers responsible for its implementation, improving their training, and providing scientific information whilst maintaining the integrity of the phenomena analyzed “where they occur and exactly as they occur”. The model is based on an analysis of the principal existing trends, and is tested in the development of Mathematical subjects at distinct educational levels, chief among them university courses in Engineering, where mixed research methods are used to analyse the effect that carrying out commands in a Computer Algebra System (CAS) has on the performance and attitude of students taking various Mathematics courses. Each teacher leads the study in his/her group and collaborates with the rest of the groups as an observer and assistant. Teaching protocols are employed in experimental and control groups; observation protocols, testing objectives, and individual questionnaires and interviews are also employed. The complete analysis provides data that confirms the fitness of the specific innovations applied (with a notable improvement of more than one point over 10 with α = 0, 05), which enables a direct and solidlybased change to the programmes and the development of their corresponding curriculums.","Galán-García, José Luis;González-Marí, José Luis;Padilla-Domínguez, Yolanda;Rodríguez-Cielos, Pedro",Journal,International Journal for Technology in Mathematics Education,2020-01-01,Universidad de Málaga,
Structural System Based on Robot Assisted Carpentry for Medium-Height Building in Wood: Metamorphosis Building - FENIX 2.0 Prototype,"This study addressed the issue of the reduced application of wood as a predominant structural material in medium-rise buildings in Chile, which for a wood producer nation seems like a contradiction. Besides, being Chile a highly seismic country, timber high-rise construction appears as not a viable solution, mainly due to the little knowledge of engineering wood and its technical potentials, besides, regulations in timber building construction are precarious. Thus, this applies research proposed to advance in this aspect through the development of posts and beams structural system for medium-rise building, based on engineering wood manufactured with robotic processes, which we have denominated Robot Assisted Carpentry (RAC corresponds to CAR, 'Carpinteria de Armar Robotizada', in Spanish), is the process in itself the innovation. The final objective is to build, analyze and test a prototype of a fully equipped housing unit being developed by Team Chile of the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (UTFSM) to compete at Solar Decathlon U.S. 2020 Competition, to be held in Washington D.C. With the correct execution of this project, it is expected not only to demonstrate an innovative, efficient and sustainable way to conceived a structural system; but also to promote and disseminate in Chile, the use of timber as construction and structural building material robot-assisted and industrialized with innovative technologies.","Hormazabal, Nina;Ramirez, Michelle;Sills, Pablo;Quitral, Francisco;Valdes, Francisco",Conference Proceeding,"PLEA 2020 - 35th PLEA Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture Planning Post Carbon Cities, Proceedings",2020-01-01,Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María,Medium-rise timber building ;  Robot Assisted Carpentry ;  Wood Engineering

A TOOL TO MODEL AND SIMULATE DYNAMIC BUSINESS MODELS,"Software tools hold great promise to support the modeling, analyzing, and innovation of business models. Current tools only focus on the design of business models and do not incorporate the complexity of existing interdependencies between business model components. These tools merely allow simulating inherent dynamics within the models or different strategic decision scenarios. In this research, we use design science research to develop a prototype that is capable of modeling and simulating dynamic business models. We use system dynamics as a simulation approach and containers to allow deployment as web applications. This paper represents the first of three design cycles, realizing six out of 59 requirements that are collected from the literature on software tools for business models. We contribute toward the design of novel artifacts for business model innovation as well as their evaluation. Future research can use these results to build tools that consider and address the complexity of business models. Lastly, we present several options for extending the proposed tool in the future.","Schaffer, Norman;Engert, Martin;Leontjevs, Girts;Krcmar, Helmut",Conference Proceeding,"33rd Bled eConference: Enabling Technology for a Sustainable Society, BLED 2020 - Proceedings",2020-01-01,Fortiss GmbH;Technische Universität München,design science ;  dynamic business model ;  simulation ;  system dynamics ;  tool
Approaches to analyzing multi-functional problems,"The acknowledgement of designers' appreciation of conceptualization approaches rooted in functional decomposition and morphological synthesis in addition to the criticism regarding sub functional focus and limited innovation facilitation ability of these approaches, is the theoretical starting point of this article. Inspired by the multi-functionality of fascinating principles found in nature (e.g. 'the skin' of some organisms containing, protecting and camouflaging), this article explores how multi-functionality is handled in engineering design to: Study the way inspiration can be found, thus improving innovation capabilities (1) and improve the way products are analysed, thus removing sub functional focus (2). The topic is explored by interviewing and literature studying as research methods. Using a multi-functional case, a pairwise pattern of function types appeared suggesting searching for multi-functional solution principles should be further investigated. Furthermore, with minor changes to the FM-Tree, designers are guided in assessing a product's degree of complexity, informing decisions on which functions to disscover a multi-functional biological analogy corresonding to.","Svendsen, Nicklas Werge;Lenau, Torben Anker",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the NordDesign 2020 Conference, NordDesign 2020",2020-01-01,Technical University of Denmark,Bio-inspired design ;  Conceptual design ;  Functional analysis ;  Multi-functionality

The depletion of fossil fuel resources and global carbon footprint accumulation are worrying the global countries for the future environmental safety. The clear policies were amended to come out of releasing the global carbon footprint by many countries; even developing countries are making it compulsory for controlling or reducing greenhouse gases releasing in to environment. In this context hydrogen fuel is getting promising significance since it has high energy content per unit mass, and up on combustion it will not release any carbon footprint and considered to be complete green energy.

Emphasis on Role of Technology Sciences in Supply Side Reform of Science and Technology Innovation,"The concept of technology sciences was proposed by Mr. Tsien Hsue-shen. It occupies a middle position in the chain of basic science and engineering technology innovation and plays a bridging role. For a long time, the concept of technology sciences has been rarely mentioned in China’s science and technology policy making process, which to a certain extent has led China’s science and technology policy to either favor the basic research or the engineering and technology, which is not conducive to the output of major scientific and technological innovations. It can also lead to the occurrence of the “neck jam” phenomenon. In response to the above problems, the key role of technology sciences in the supply side of science and technology innovation is expounded through literature review and case study. In addition, we construct a whole chain model of science and technology innovation with basic science as its source and technology sciences as its core. This study puts forward countermeasures and suggestions from three perspectives: knowledge, talents, and policy.

SKILLS BUILDING TOWARDS SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING VIA ACTION RESEARCH REFLECTIONS,"In the fast-paced, changing global economy, it becomes increasingly important to develop self-directed learning (SDL) skills in our students to stay competitive and adaptive to the ever-changing needs. In support of more SDL teaching and innovation activities, Singapore Polytechnic (SP) has developed the SDL framework. However, many practitioners are unfamiliar with it. There is also currently a lack of knowledge of the appropriate ways of simulating and introducing SDL to our students. This paper thus aims to use a feedforward process where some interventions to promote SDL for our students were tested out. In the pilot action research, two instances of SDL strategies were carried out for 96 freshmen engineering students from Oct 2018 to Feb 2019. In addition, students were asked to do a simple self-assessment on SDL to see if they can use this as a tool to assess their SDL behaviours and suggest appropriate changes. To our surprise, 4 out of the 5 classes rated themselves significantly higher compared to their lecturer's rating of themselves. A simple follow up with the students and classroom observations revealed that many of them were seem multitasking during the lessons, and not revising what they have learned as regular as we would expect them to. We see these factors as the contributing factors that could hinder students from being more self-directed. Plans to improve on student's study habits thus become the focus for the next action research. We see that the use of action research methodology help us to kick start this journey. The continued use of this approach is believed to help educators design better lessons that are suited for our engineering student's profile, thus effectively helping them to transit from being too dependent to more self-directed.","Lin, Chia Chew;Hong, Tham Kum",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2020-01-01,Singapore Polytechnic,"action research ;  active learning ;  Arduino ;  debugging ;  growth-mindset ;  inquiry ;  learning strategies ;  meta-learning ;  motivation ;  problem-solving ;  programming ;  Self-directed learning ;  Standards 7, 8"

Optogenetics,"The beginning of scientific innovations usually starts by formulating a fundamental question, “can light be used to control a cell?"" The original story of optogenetics is inundated with multiple investigators’ research whose impacts have crossed whole continents. Fundamentally, optogenetics is the use of light (opto-) to stimulate encoded proteins (-genetic). Its infancy began by manipulating a single cell but has evolved well beyond deciphering neural circuits to even controlling signaling pathways. In this chapter, we first discuss the roots of optogenetics, framing it in the context of current scientific exploration, followed by the biological mechanism of optogenetics used in the context of neural interface engineering. Finally, we discuss the application of optoelectronic interfaces and project current optogenetic research into future applications.","Argall, Aaron;Guo, Liang",Book,Neural Interface Engineering: Linking the Physical World and the Nervous System,2020-01-01,College of Engineering;The Ohio State University,Opsins ;  Optical Neural Interfaces ;  Optogenetics

Small Satellites and Structural Design,"The cost to orbit for 1 kg of mass, using an Atlas launch vehicle, is currently around $20, 000 and represents the high end of the range of launch costs. The latest technology represented by a SpaceX Falcon launcher, an ISRO Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) or a small satellite launcher such as the Electron all are significantly less costly. Nevertheless launch cost even by the most efficient launchers into low Earth orbit (LEO) remains quite expensive. In the case of very large space craft such as a high throughput satellite for telecommunications with mass of 5000-10, 000 kg, the savings that might come from a highly efficient structural frame that reduces the overall mass by 100 kg, or alternatively allows the payload to be 100 kg larger, might be worth something like $2 million dollars per satellite launched. Even for small satellites such as a 3 unit cubesatellite, a very light weight, high strength frame that is thermally stable, and is not adversely affected by high radiation levels, clearly has good value. At this size, however, it is more common to use a lower cost material such as aluminum alloy. Frame designs for small satellite are getting increasingly more sophisticated. It is possible that a primary frame or even a secondary structure such as a solar cell panel to allow the inclusion of an additional heat sensor, star tracker, or other safety feature or capability to be integrated into the harness design. Some designs might even allow the addition of a passive de-orbit device that allows the small satellite to more quickly deorbit. In short, some design features for primary or secondary structures are optimized by determining and adding features that reduce both the mass and available usable volume of a small satellite. The addition of new additive manufacturing capabilities to the arsenal of capabilities available to those who design and manufacture small satellites can increase the performance, cost-effectiveness, or safety of a project. This article addresses all aspects of a small satellite’s design in terms of its mass, strength, volume efficiency, thermal and radiation protective qualities, reliability, and overall structural aspects and efficiency as measured by all of these factors. It analyzes what aspects have been improved over time and what the prospects are for the future to increase structural design and performance. This article analyzes the status and future direction of research related to primary structure related to small satellites. This primary structure is key to a satellite surviving launch and deployment, its operational integrity throughout the spacecraft lifetime up to its end of life. Also considered is the nature and performance of its secondary structures. The structural integrity of these secondary systems are also necessary to support the successful operation of subsystems or components such as solar panels, thermal blankets, radiation shielding, instrument mounts to be properly anchored so as to operate reliably, and so on. Progress is being made on primary and secondary structure design and performance. In many instances, the design of the small satellite and its structural elements are being integrated with essential elements of the spacecraft to reduce mass, increase volume for payload systems, or otherwise increase efficiency. These innovations are sometimes known as multifunctional elements when structures, panels, wiring harnesses, sensors, and other devices are integrated together in the design.","Pelton, Joseph N.",Book,"Handbook of Small Satellites: Technology, Design, Manufacture, Applications, Economics and Regulation: With 476 Figures and 92 Tables",2020-01-01,ISU International Space University;International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety,Additive Manufacturing ;  Carbon/epoxy composites ;  Components ;  Cubesat ;  Integrated components ;  Kits ;  Longitudinal and Transverse Strength ;  Microlattices ;  Multifunctional structures ;  Opportunity costs ;  Primary structure and secondary structure ;  Reliability ;  Resilience ;  Shear strength ;  Small satellite ;  Spacecraft structural units ;  Systems engineering ;  Thermal performance

LEARNING FROM EDUCATION INNOVATION USING THE 4TU.CEE INNOVATION MAP,"Rapid changes in society and student demographics pose major challenges for universities, who are responding by innovating education visions, learning goals, curricula, and courses. These education innovations are often reported in the literature and at conferences on a single-project basis, resulting in a large number of differently structured publications that make it difficult to find interesting examples or learn from a wide variety of education innovation projects. To counteract this, the four technical universities in the Netherlands (in Eindhoven, Wageningen, Twente, and Delft) offer standardized information about their education innovation projects on the innovation map website (4TU.CEE, 2020) of their joint Centre For Engineering Education; 4TU.CEE. University staff around the world can use the innovation map to find interesting examples of education innovation. Our analysis of all projects contained within the innovation map shows that, over the last four years, the innovation priority of the four universities has been on solving present-day challenges in their courses. The main approach has been improving education design and optimizing blended learning. This has been particularly useful for the universities that faced a large growth in the number of students. In the future, however, the priority of the four universities must shift to their longer-term strategies, such as Future Engineering Skills, Interdisciplinary Education, Dealing with Diversity, and Education Excellence. That also means more focus is needed for changes both to the curriculum and beyond. Furthermore, evaluation and dissemination should be more explicitly included. The purpose of the innovation map is to offer input for further university education innovation projects and research.","van Puffelen, Emiel;Vonk, Caroline",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2020-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;Wageningen University & Research,"course ;  curricula ;  education design ;  Education innovation ;  education vision ;  learning goals ;  Standards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12"

"Nanocellulose/Starch Biopolymer Nanocomposites: Processing, Manufacturing, and Applications","Currently, the harmful gas emission, rapid climate change, air and water pollution, and deterioration of earth's land surface are mainly produced by the aggressive utilization of petroleum-based plastic and the unmanaged garbage disposal including dumping and burning of polymeric products and substances. Many experts from throughout the globe revealed that the dumping of petroleum-based plastic and undecomposed materials is the main principle problem of environmental pollution. Hence, in order to overcome these challenging issues, biopolymers, such as starch, cellulosic-based polymer, and other biodegradable materials, are considered the most promising materials and as alternatives to non-biodegradable petroleum-based materials. This is due to their long shelf life properties such as resistance to enzymatic or chemical reaction and as they are biodegradable in nature. Starch is an abundantly available, highly biodegradable, cheap, and renewable biopolymer. However, some studies have found that the properties of starch biopolymer such as mechanical and water barrier are comparatively low than petroleum-based plastic. Therefore, nanofillers such as nanocellulose are introduced in order to overcome this issue. Nanocellulose has attracted huge attention due to its good physical and mechanical behaviors. In recent years, nanocellulose has also attracted the interest among researchers, since the technology capable to cater the environmental issues. This chapter explains the outline of current development in this particular field, including the isolation, characterization, behaviors, and various applications of nanocellulose reinforced starch biopolymer nanocomposites. Followed by explaining the distinctive properties of nanocellulose and its numerous preparation methods, an arranged introduction of various sources of nanocellulose reinforced biodegradable starch polymers is provided. Herein, nanocellulose reinforced starch biopolymer for engineering and interdisciplinary applications, comprising approaches for the transformation of various sources of cellulose to nanocellulose, and the technique of fabrication for their composites have been studied. Furthermore, the results of nanocellulose on the behavior of starch biopolymers are presented. Finally, the chapter summarizes with a new finding and innovation researches on nanocellulose reinforced starch biopolymer composites.

Design Heuristics for Innovative Packaging Ideation,"Concept ideation can be facilitated by using techniques such as design heuristic to stimulate divergent thinking. Heuristics are general design principles extracted from existing solutions that can help designers create novel solutions. While extensive research has been done on design heuristics when applied to product design, there are no reports of their application to innovative packaging design. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of design heuristics on the level of innovation of packaging concepts. Fifty-five undergraduate students were randomly assigned to three groups. Participants in the control group generated ideas without the help of design heuristics (i.e., group A). Participants in group B ideated with the help of existing product design heuristics. Participants in group C created ideas using design heuristics tailored specifically to packaging design. A total of 293 packaging concepts were rated using three 5-point Likert scales for morphological, technological, and functional innovations. An overall level of innovation was calculated by adding the three scores. Participants who used design heuristic cards (i.e., experimental conditions B and C) created on average more than one additional idea than participants who ideated without heuristic help (i.e., control group). Idea generation using packaging-specific design heuristics yielded more innovative ideas than idea generation using product design heuristics. Forty-nine percent of the ideas in group C had significantly higher levels of innovation compared to 35% of the ideas in group B (χ2(1) = 4.023, p = .045) and 32% in the control group (χ2(1) = 5.996, p = .014). Product design heuristics can be extremely useful to make ideation processes more efficient and productive. However, this study provides evidence that there needs to be a match between heuristic description, examples of application of the heuristics, and the target domain (i.e., the type of product being created). Findings suggest a significant and positive effect of using field-specific heuristics for early ideation sessions of novice students with minimal design background.","De La Fuente, Javier;Carbonell, Irene;Lopez, Autumn",Conference Proceeding,"22nd World Conference on Packaging ""Future of Packaging""",2020-01-01,California Polytechnic State University,design heuristics ;  engineering ;  ideation ;  innovation ;  Package design

Cellulose nanofiber is a eco-friendly materials with a potential applications as reinforced filler in various composites, targeted drug delivery, smart materials, 3D printing, and automotive interior parts. The first cellulose nanofiber or micelles was chemically (acid hydrolysis) extracted by Ranby in 1949. Based on fabrication techniques, cellulose nanofibers can be categorized into cellulose nanocrystals, nanofibrillated celulose and TEMPO cellulose nanofibers. Cellulose nanofibers can be extracted by top down and bottom up approaches such as mechanical, enzymatic hydrolysis, TEMPO, acid hydrolysis and production of bacterial cellulose respectively. In recent years, the use of cellulose nanocrystals for different applications have gained much research interest because they are bio-degradable, biocompatible, carbon neutral, and readily available from renewable resources. In the acid hydrolysis process, the cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) amorphous regions are destroyed while the crystalline domains are kept intact. In this review chapter, the recent developments on research and applications of cellulose nanocrystal extracted by acid hydrolysis will be discussed.

Functionalized nanomaterials for chemical sensor applications,"Materials existing in nanoscale dimensions display unique physiochemical properties compared to their bulk counterparts. With a touch of innovation, these unique properties can be used in various applications such as a catalyst for a more effective conversion process in the chemical industry or as a signal transducer for sensing purposes. Despite the encouraging application potential, continuous research is being carried out to further enhance nanomaterial (NM) performance for better efficiency. One method of performing functionalizations of NMs is to add additional features to their existing unique properties. The synergistic effect of added features enables multifunctional operations to occur simultaneously helping to obtain the intended outcomes. Functionalization is particularly important in the case of developing chemical sensors using NMs. NMs, by default, have a large surface area per volume due to their small size, but they must also be able to have a specific interaction with a particular analyte. This interaction is used to trigger the change in the physical property of the NMs, and the degree of change can be correlated to the amount of analyte and adapted as a sensing signal. When the need for interaction with a particular analyte is ignored and the interaction is of a nonspecific type, the change in the signal will not generate any specific analytical information. By performing the functionalization, a specific binding receptor can be introduced to the surface to enhance the specific binding. This offers the option to alter the specificity of the sensing probe, while using the same type of nanomaterial as the core signal transducer. This chapter covers the fundamental characteristics of NMs, the engineering aspect of NMs functionalization, and the major applications of functionalized NMs as sensing receptors.","Ng, Sing Muk",Book,Handbook of Functionalized Nanomaterials for Industrial Applications,2020-01-01,Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus,Analytes ;  Conjugation ;  Detection ;  Engineering ;  Nanomaterials ;  Sensing

CRISPR/Cas9 technologies in epigenetics research,"After its discovery, characterization, and initial use in eukaryotic genome editing, the potential for CRISPR/Cas9 technologies in chromatin biology research was realized quickly. A key innovation was the development of a catalytically inactive Cas9 endonuclease (dCas9) which could serve as an RNA guided platform for other chromatin modifications. This advance produced a rapidly evolving set of methods for epigenetics and chromatin biology research with far-reaching applications. Here, we review the potential uses for CRISPR/dCas9-based technologies in a wide range of research areas including modulation of gene expression, genome-wide screens, characterizing protein composition at genomic loci, visualizing genomic loci, engineering 3D genome domains, and testing the functions of chromatin modifiers. We also highlight current research on the use of CRISPR/dCas9-based therapeutics, and finally, we compare dCas9 to other epigenome editing platforms and discuss its limitations. dCas9-based research methods is an area of rapid technological innovation that continues to be important for epigenetics research.","Schoelz, John M.;Riddle, Nicole C.",Book,Epigenetics Methods,2020-01-01,The University of Alabama at Birmingham,3D genome ;  CRISPR/Cas9 ;  CRISPRa ;  CRISPRi ;  dCas9 ;  Epigenetics ;  Fluorescent imaging ;  Therapeutics

Standardization and regulation of biomaterials,"From the perspective of standardization and regulation, the idea of production of new biomaterials may be studied at internal and external phases. The internal phase is related to a set of recommendations that describe ideal strategies for research methodology and study reporting according to available standards. The external phase is related to criteria and protocols for the translation and application of these biomaterials according to the national, regional, and global/international rules set by regulatory agencies. Today, the available standardizations and regulations are not able to address the complexities of ongoing innovations in the biomaterial field especially the challenges for translation into the clinical fields. As such, cooperation and collaboration of different agents are required aiming to introduce practical solutions to the patient’s problems. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the current challenges in standardization and regulation of biomaterials and to suggest the possible strategies that would bridge the translational gap between laboratory research and real clinical applications.","Ebrahimi, Mehdi",Book,Handbook of Biomaterials Biocompatibility,2020-01-01,Prince Philip Dental Hospital,Biomaterials ;  Experimental design ;  Regulation ;  Research methodology ;  Standardizations ;  Study protocol ;  Tissue engineering ;  Translational studies
Valuation analysis of Chinese and American listed companies based on mathematical model,"With the development of China's economic globalization, the stock market gradually reflects its important position in the development of China's market economy. First of all, this paper selects the average market sales rate as the valuation level, and uses the evaluation model to calculate the valuation level of China's A-share market and the US Nasdaq market in 2018, and calculates the valuation premium or discount level of these two markets. Secondly, a multiple linear regression model is established to quantitatively analyze the relationship among valuation index, fundamental index and liquidity index in China's A-share market and American Nasdaq market. Then, the grey prediction mathematical model is established to forecast and analyze the fundamental index and liquidity index of China's A-share market and American Nasdaq market in 2019; according to the prediction results, the valuation indexes of these two markets in 2019 are calculated. Finally, the paper uses SVM model to predict the valuation level of the first batch of enterprises listed on the science and technology innovation board. The results show that the market sales ratio of the first batch of enterprises on the science and technology innovation board fluctuates about 5 times, which is smaller than that of the United States, indicating that China's stock market has great potential.","Song, Chenguang",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings - 2020 2nd International Conference on Applied Machine Learning, ICAML 2020",2020-01-01,The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China,grey prediction mathematical model ;  Marketing rate ;  multiple linear regression model ;  SVM model
LEARNING GAINS IN TRADITIONAL VERSUS CHALLENGE-BASED HIGHER ENGINEERING EDUCATION,"Engineering education at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) is in the process of changing from instruction and teacher-based education to inquiry- and challenge-based education, where students are challenged to solve open-ended problems in collaboration with stakeholders in the field of science and technology (Eindhoven University of Technology, 2018) and hence the teacher's role becomes that of a coach. To determine students' learning gains in both traditional and innovative education (i.e., challenge-based learning) at TU/e, we formulated the following research question: Which (kinds of) learning gains do engineering students perceive in challenge-based learning versus traditional learning? To answer this question, we interviewed 13 students from “science” studies (e.g., Applied Mathematics), “core engineering” studies (e.g., Mechanical Engineering), and “social engineering” studies (e.g., Sustainable Innovation) about their perceived learning gains in traditional as compared to challenge-based courses. We used a new tool, “pie chart drawing, ” to elicit students' self-reported learning gains. Furthermore, we investigated students' reflections on the learning trajectory “Responsible innovation in a global context” to get deeper insights into learning gains in a challenge-based learning trajectory. The results showed that students perceived learning gains regarding their disciplinary conceptual and procedural knowledge, general cognitive learning, affect and thoughts related to learning, skills on teamwork and communication, and knowledge and skills about enterprise and business. Learning gains that were mostly obtained in traditional courses focused on disciplinary conceptual and procedural knowledge. Learning gains in challenge-based courses stimulated students' teamwork skills and collaboration with outside stakeholders (e.g., companies; institutes). General cognitive learning, communication with other students, and affect and thoughts related to learning were acquired in both traditional and challenge-based courses. The implications for CDIO related principles and engineering education, in general, will be discussed.","van Uum, Martina;Pepin, Birgit",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference,2020-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,"Challenge-based learning ;  Innovative engineering education ;  Learning gains ;  Standards 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8"
The Reuse of Cultural Heritage: A Sustainable Strategy Between Tradition and Innovation,"The paper addresses the theme of the intervention on the existing Cultural Heritage, focusing in particular on the reuse project, intended as a possible design action aimed at the enhancement, functionalization and conservation of existing buildings. The result presented here starts and develops from some ongoing research from several years within the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture (DICAr) of the University of Pavia and the Universitat Politècnica de València. In particular, through reuse actions is possible to respond simultaneously both to the changing regulatory and performance needs and to the requirements for the conservation and enhancement of the monument in a perspective aimed at the sustainability of the proposed design solution. This action, intrinsically characterized by a great complexity, as it must necessarily consider different spheres of knowledge and different technical and scientific skills, will be addressed, more specifically, from the point of view of reading the technological and construction solutions applied for the reuse project, therefore intended as an instrument of control and balance between the needs of conservation and memory and of transformation and innovation of the building.","Besana, Daniela;García-Valldecabres, Jorge;Cortes Meseguer, Luis",Book Series,Springer Series in Design and Innovation,2020-01-01,Università degli Studi di Pavia;Universitat Politècnica de València,Cultural Heritage ;  Enhancement ;  Sustainable reuse
Responsible Innovation in Support of Society 5.0 - Aspects of Audit and Control,"We have developed an innovation model through which the benefits of the transformation of social needs into each other can be exploited. The model manages the planning and implementation processes of innovation in a unified system, approximately in parallel. Responsible innovation, as we have named our approach, minimizes the ""development slack,"" increasing the effectiveness of financial support for innovation. Reviewing the concept of the Japanese Society 5.0 initiative, we came to the conclusion that our model would always have been tailored to the innovation needs of Society 5.0. At the same time, the Society 5.0 culture would be the most favorable medium for the completion and spread of our model. Responsible innovation is based on transformative research, and the ""soul"" of its implementation is modularization. This requires appropriate standards, audit and control support. Thanks to technological development and based on the opportunities inherent in responsible innovation, virtual economic zones, which provide a regulatory and organizational framework for mdular enterpris, have now become feasible and create.

A human-centred systems theory of e-agriculture automation and control systems adoption: An empirical study of the social effects of digital control and automation systems in agricultural communities,"Climate change, biodiversity crises and other challenges impinge upon agricultural communities who must adapt to these pressures. However, in many countries agriculture lags behind other sectors in its uptake of digital automation and control systems on the farm. In spite of decades of research into technological innovation adoption factors we still do not have a good understanding as to why this sector is slower than others to adopt these new systems. This paper is based on a qualitative study of farmers in the south-east of Ireland which explored social effects in technology adoption. It draws out key themes associated with Irish farming as communities of knowledge networks, learning and innovation dynamics and cultural features, as well as tensions in relationships between farmers and institutions. From this analysis new theoretical “RooT” model is offered to reorient control and automation technology adoption theories and better support agricultural technology innovation.","O'Neill Somers, Sinead;Stapleton, Larry",Conference Proceeding,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2020-01-01,South East Technological University,EAgriculture ;  Knowledge networks ;  Multicultural interactions
Foreign direct investment and industry-science R&D cooperation: the case of South Africa,"We use the South African National Innovation Survey to analyse the firm and industry characteristics that determine R&D collaboration with knowledge institutions. Besides examining the complementarity among innovation activities, we particularly focus on the complementarity between R&D collaboration and the internationalization of production. Consistent with the asset exploiting motive for outward FDI, we find that firms that established a subsidiary abroad are more likely to engage in cooperative research agreements with universities or public research organizations. Hence, inducing domestic firms to enter into foreign markets will enhance R&D cooperation with knowledge institutions in the home country. Furthermore, R&D collaboration is a complementary innovation strategy to the use of publicly available information and to engaging in cooperative research agreements with suppliers or customers. We also find that firms providing knowledge-intensive services such as (medical) R&D, ICT, and engineering services and firms in the chemical industry are more likely to engage in cooperative research agreements with knowledge institutions. Finally, in contrast to findings from studies in more advanced countries, we find that appropriability concerns may form a barrier preventing R&D collaboration with scientific organizations. Hence, improvements in the protection of intellectual property rights may foster industry-science R&D partnerships.","Ghebrihiwet, Nahom",Journal,Innovation and Development,2020-01-01,"Ministry of Finance, Netherlands",FDI ;  multinational enterprizes ;  public research institutes ;  R&D collaboration ;  universities
Informal Science Learning Environments and Contextualized Innovation Spaces (Jugaad): Exploring Phronesis and a Virtue-Based Theory of Knowledge,"This chapter focuses on developing a greater understanding of the concept of phronesis and its implications for students’ participation and engagement in science education. Guided by students’ experiences in informal science education settings and empowered by their own voices, the concept of phronesis becomes relevant and accessible for students’ sense-making and knowledge creation. Ongoing research indicates that while formal science learning contexts are important and could be modified to be inclusive of underrepresented minoritys, informal and out-of-school learning environments could provide relevant experiences by being inclusive of students’ backgrounds and experiences. Phronesis remains an abstract construct, especially in the context of science education and for the key actors who participate in the enterprise of science. Science education and Stem science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields continue to be of interest to many students, primarily for post-education economic opportunities.","Verma, Geeta",Book,"Virtues as Integral to Science Education: Understanding the Intellectual, Moral, and Civic Value of Science and Scientific Inquiry",2020-01-01,University of Colorado Denver;Journal of Science Teacher Education,

Requirements analysis for automating product testing in aerospace manufacturing,"The Aerospace Industry has been undertaking strategic changes towards digital manufacturing. One of the challenges is the lack of rationalisation for a cost-benefit analysis of automating certain manufacturing and assembly processes within a customer order. The rigidness and complexity of aerospace lifecycle, and tight industry restrictions does not leave much room for high risk innovations in manufacturing and production lines. This research addressed this problem by investigating an automation adoption scenario with BAE Systems, Electronic Systems, which is a UK based aeronautical systems integrator. This paper reports findings from the general manufacturing industry via an industrial survey. These findings are compared with original findings from an empirical study carried out with BAE Systems within the New Product Introduction team to automate product transportation logistics in an environmental test facility. The paper describes the challenges particularly related to skills, and labour workforce required to manipulate heavy standing products in and out of a production line and how their requirements can be addressed within an automation solution package. The solution includes key design factors related to intricate handling of aeronautic systems via the gripping interface design, and the rest of the operational issues surrounding the testing objectives such as transportation, and test setup. The findings are presented in the form of a requirements analysis for businesses looking to automate manually-intensive tasks in the future, and provide some insights into the lessons learnt in the development of the solution to benefit UK manufacturing tactics to some similar challenges.","Elsouri, Mohammed;Gao, James;Wilson, Alister;Martin, Lancelot;Pyee, Robin",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Manufacturing,2020-01-01,École d’ingénieurs CESI;University of Greenwich;BAE Systems plc,Aerospace Industry ;  Assembly ;  Automation ;  Design for Manufacture ;  Robotics

Many of the solutions to change are technological in nature, drawing together engineering, design and creativity. It is surprising, therefore, that engineering design has not been more closely grounded in psychological creativity research. Engineering designers must think divergently, and are impacted by psychological factors of the person and the environment. Regrettably, there is still a disconnect between creativity research and the practice of engineering design. In an era of digitisation, creativity, and problem solving, are again rising in prominence in engineering design. If engineering is to realise its full potential, there are questions–already answered by the psychology of creativity–that must be addressed. Without this cross-fertilisation, engineering design–which should be the ultimate expression of creativity–will remain anchored in convergence and analysis.","Cropley, David H.",Book,Manual of Evidence-Based Admitting Orders and Therapeutics,2020-01-01,University of South Australia,Change ;  Convergent ;  Creativity ;  Design ;  Divergent ;  Effectiveness ;  Elegance ;  Environment ;  Genesis ;  Incremental ;  Innovation ;  Novelty ;  Person ;  Problem-solving ;  Process ;  Product
From learning mechanics to tabletop mechanisms: Modding steam board game to be a serious game,"Board games are thriving in the post-digital era. Digitalization is present in almost all dimensions of contemporary life and it is expected to be even more prevalent in the future. However, a growing number of players are choosing to play analog games, mainly influenced by modern board games and hobby game designs. These games are different from mass-market games and show that analog platforms still have much to offer in terms of gaming innovation. These new designs have not yet been adequately studied by the serious game research field, and the filling of this research gap can provide new solutions for learning and simulation games of all types. This paper proposes a new framework, relating learning mechanics to the tabletop mechanisms (LM-TM) of the modern board game designs. The case study of the adapted version of Steam board game, tested during a lecture with MBA students, is explained as an example of the application of the LM-TM framework. This case study proved to be useful to unravel future development paths in this field of research.","Sousa, Micael;Dias, Joana",Conference Proceeding,"21st International Conference on Intelligent Games and Simulation, GAME-ON 2020",2020-01-01,"Universidade de Coimbra, Faculdade de Economia;Universidade de Coimbra, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia",Board Games ;  Post-digital ;  Serious Games ;  Simulation
Orienting through the variety of novelty metrics,"Assessing creativity of generated ideas is of crucial importance for both design research and early detection of potential innovations. By the identification of the most acknowledged novelty metrics used for creativity-related assessments in the field of engineering design, this paper aims at providing crucial information to orient through the variety of alternatives. A systematic literature review is performed by relying on the Scopus search engine, and a search strategy based on both practical and quality-related screening procedures. The work is focused on the engineering design literature, and the identified contributions are classified in terms of both creativity and novelty concepts. A set of 140 papers has been reviewed, where a subset of 37 mentioned or proposed novelty metrics has been considered. The metrics have been mapped in terms of creativity types, novelty concepts and metric types. Although it is possible to find comprehensive reviews about creativity concepts and related metrics, contributions focused on novelty metrics are currently lacking. This is the first contribution that focuses on a wide set of novelty concepts and related metrics, by mapping them to support metric selection.","Fiorineschi, Lorenzo;Rotini, Federico",Journal,International Journal of Design Sciences and Technology,2020-01-01,Università degli Studi di Firenze,Creativity ;  Creativity assessment ;  Innovation ;  Newness ;  Novelty ;  Novelty assessment ;  Originality ;  Uncommonness ;  Unexpectedness ;  Unusualness
A view of the new space sector resilience,"Historically, the public awareness of space hazards was limited to the countries, who had operational scientific space missions. The growing volume and variety of data and signals affect the reliable operation of down-stream (ground-based) systems. Though the old space era can be considered as a resilient era the through analysis shows that this assumption is not correct since it does not fulfill all the criteria of a resilient system such as self-reliance, overlap, diversity and ability to learn. The New Space sector's rapid development challenges the concept of resilience for this sector. Risk assessment methods for ground-based or terrestrial systems were traditionally based on vulnerability identification for a specific component to an adverse event followed by its functionality loss. The subsequent risk management was focused on hardening specific components to an acceptable risk level in order to prevent the overall system failure. Though higher risk levels were accepted in old era's space sector, methodology for risk assessment remained the same. The space paradigm shift results in increasing number of uncertainties and the New Space sector's interdependency. This fosters research on new risk assessment methodologies. A large number of risk reports is dedicated to resilience properties in the electricity, nuclear, transportation and other sectors, and space sector is out of focus. This article aims at presenting a New Space resilience framework, describing methodologies for its assessment and adapting quantitative indices. It is especially important in light of new innovation ecosystems development using New Space capabilities.","Sokolova, Olga;Madi, Matteo",Conference Proceeding,"30th European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2020 and 15th Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management Conference, PSAM 2020",2020-01-01,Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University;Sirin Orbital Systems AG,Decision support ;  Innovation ecosystem ;  New space ;  Resilience ;  Risk management ;  Space sector

Design for Digital Fabrication: An Industry needs Analysis of Collaboration Platforms and Integrated Management Processes,"Digital Fabrication is an emerging systemic innovation in the architecture, engineering and construction sector. However, the design process for digital fabrication lacks an integrated management process or digital collaboration platform. One reason may be a lack of industry stakeholder needs for such processes and platforms. To explore and facilitate such solution in the current practice, more information about the socio-technical industry requirements on such solution and its implementation to support and manage the BIM-based design process of digital fabrication is needed. To fill this gap, this work conducts an industry-needs analysis through content analysis and an online survey of 144 project stakeholders. Based on the results, this work identifies the most needed fabrication-related information, tools and roles at different design stages and the requirements of platform-based management, which include a common virtual environment for collaboration and a common data environment for data management. Moreover, this work shows that fabrication-related information and new roles are required by project stakeholders since the early design stage. The paper concludes by proposing a conceptual management framework for BIM-platform-based integration for design for digital fabrication in construction projects and identifying potential future research directions on the topic.","Ng, Ming Shan;Bonanomi, Marcella M.;Hall, Daniel M.;Hackl, Jürgen",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot",2020-01-01,ETH Zürich;University of Liverpool;PoliS-Lombardia,Bim ;  Design process ;  Digital fabrication ;  Platforms ;  Project management ;  Survey
The impact of integrating augmented reality into the production strategy process,"Although execution is generally the phase during which challenges faced by the construction industry become apparent, it only represents the tip of the iceberg. Execution depends on the effectiveness of construction planning and control-A n area identified by researchers as in need of improvement. Production Strategy is a fundamental step and a critical component of production planning and control where decisions are collectively made to properly allocate and deploy resources to achieve project objectives. The Production Strategy Process (PSP) involves a massive information transfer and requires a high level of communication between the project team members. The increased complexity and sophistication of construction projects along with the rapid advances in emerging technologies has fueled construction companies' interest in technology as a source of innovation. One technology that has gained great interest in recent years is Augmented Reality (AR). AR, a pillar of the fourth industrial revolution, offers powerful capabilities to enable the next generation of PSP and provides companies significant opportunities to maintain their vitality and competitive edge. This research investigated the integration of AR with PSP and the impact that AR can have on the process. An ARenabled PSP prototype was developed for the Microsoft HoloLens headset and was validated on an ongoing construction project. The results showed that AR has the highest impact on PSP in three areas, namely analytical, tracking, and informational.","Nassereddine, Hala;Veeramani, Dharmaraj;Hanna, Awad",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot",2020-01-01,UW-Madison College of Engineering;Stanley and Karen Pigman College of Engineering,Augmented reality ;  Production strategy ;  Prototype ;  Re-engineering
Engaging High School Girls in Interdisciplinary STEAM,"Research into Australian students’ science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) engagement has highlighted that there are comparably fewer women enrolling in STEM programs and working in STEM industries. In Australia, males make up 84% of the total population with STEM qualifications, for example, a report in 2015 found only 13% of all engineers in Australia were women. Science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM), an approach to STEM education that encourages interdisciplinarity, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, is a strategy that has the potential to increase girls’ engagement with STEM. This research investigated the impact of the STEAMpunk Girls Program, funded by the Australian Government, on high school girls’ learning and their teachers’ teaching experiences. The program uses project-learning and design thinking strategies to enable the girls to gain confidence in themselves as change-makers with the capacity to generate solutions to real-world problems. Using a mixed method approach, the findings indicated that teachers and students were positive about the STEAMpunk Girls’ experience, with significant increases in confidence and motivation in the girls at the end of the program.","Ng, Wan;Fergusson, Jennifer",Journal,Science Education International,2020-01-01,University of Technology Sydney,"design thinking ;  high school girls ;  interdisciplinary learning ;  problem-based learning ;  science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics/science technology engineering and maths"
"E-participation with social media in science, technology and innovation: Brazilian states research support foundations case","The use of social media has advanced in all social strata with effect on citizen participation in political discussions. In the context of Science, Technology and Innovation (ST&I) policies, bringing citizens closer together is a challenge for scientific and governmental institutions. The Brazilian States Research Support Foundations (RSF) show interest in promoting this approach to legitimize investments in science. Studies on the effects of social media on the relations between science, society and government are scarce. This research analyzed how e-participation, through social media, promotes citizen participation in the ST&I policies and actions of the RSFs. Nine organizations, including at least one Foundation from each Brazilian region, participated in this study. The main contribution of social media was the ability to intensify the interactions between government, researchers and citizens, using an informal and accessible language.","Andrade, Vitor Anacleto Rodarte;Grützmann, André",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2020-01-01,Universidade Federal de Lavras,
One belt one road: An opportunity for chinese engineering education to go global?,"In the context of the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, Chinese engineering education has encountered new opportunities and possible challenges. This chapter starts with a synthesis of the overarching trends in Chinese engineering education, analyzing its overall strengths and weaknesses, particularly highlighting the critical impact of China’s membership in the Washington Accord on its engineering degrees’ international recognition and the relevant ongoing engineering education innovations. The chapter also points out the lack of empirical research in Chinese engineering education to support the development of Chinese engineering education. The chapter further zeroes in on the specific advantages, and drawbacks, in attracting international students, and reviews additional models for Chinese engineering education to “go global.” Specific suggestions for multiple stakeholders are proposed to facilitate Chinese engineering education going global.","Zhu, Jiabin;Zhang, Guoyang;Huang, Yaxin",Book,China and Europe on the New Silk Road: Connecting Universities Across Eurasia,2020-01-01,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Chinese engineering education ;  engineering education innovations ;  engineering education research ;  globalization ;  OBOR
Comparison of manual anthropometry and a mobile digital anthropometric system,"With the progress of technology, new digital shape-analysis tools are being developed for use in several different fields. Innovation and market demand has pushed developers to create a portable 3D scanner. The aim of this research was to perform a comparison of a new portable measuring system for digital measurement of anthropometric dimensions of the body, with the system of manual anthropometry. The results show that the Coefficient of determination (R2) was in 7 measurements over 90%, in 6 measurements over 80%, and in 2 measurements above 74.9%. Cronbach Alpha results of compared variables were all over 90%, which show very strong expected correlations. No significant bias between measurement techniques was shown as Bland-Altman plots showed a good agreement between measurement techniques with a small number of outliers. Results provide high validity and accuracy of the new portable scanner when correctly used. However, methods of 3D body scanning and classical anthropometry should not be regarded as interchangeable as there are differences in initial body positions due to the implementation of measurement protocols. Further work is recommended to make the two methods more interchangeable, with the possible usage of corrective coefficients.","Bušić, Anita;Bušić, Josip;Coleman, John;Šimenko, Jožef",Conference Proceeding,icSPORTS 2020 - Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Sport Sciences Research and Technology Support,2020-01-01,University of Essex;LIVE GOOD d.o.o.,Anthropometry ;  Morphology ;  Portable ;  Protocol

"Nanomaterials application in greenhouse structures, crop processing machinery, packaging materials and agro-biomass conversion","The discovery of nanomaterials has flagged off crucial research and innovations in science and engineering. Its unique properties and diverse applications present it as the material for the future. The aim of this study is to presents the relative applications of nanomaterial in some aspects of agriculture production. The study discussed nanotechnology applicability in climate control and photosynthesis in the greenhouse farming, hydroponic systems, solar drying, fabrication of crop processing machine components, oxygen scavengers in crop packaging, and micro-organism stimulant in anaerobic digestion for agro biomass conversion. Some highlights from the review revealed that Nanotechnology can be applied to increase water surface area to volume ratio and heat transfer in the air moving into a greenhouse farming. Water cluster can be changed when treated with nanoparticles through ultraviolet absorption spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy resulting in lower micelles to manipulate water delivery in green house farming. Nano-fluids or Nano-composites can be used to recombine the reactive parts of thermal storage materials after broken at elevated temperature to recover the stored heat for drying purpose during the off-sunshine periods in solar drying of crops. Nanomaterials can be a source of electroluminescence light in hydroponic system and act as coatings and surface hardener in crop processing machinery for post-harvest machines. The reviewed work showed that nanotechnologies has good prospect in adding value in agricultural production in the aspects discussed.","Ndukwu, M. C.;Ikechukwu-Edeh, C. E.;Nwakuba, N.

Socio-technical perspectives on cyber security and definitions of digital transformation – a literature review,"Most definitions of cyber security, or information security, refer to the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information; and focus has traditionally been on technical solutions. However, the argument that information security occurrences are best viewed as socio-technical problems has gained increasing support in recent years. Another current development relates to the increasing use of the term digital transformation. Consequently, there is a need for a broadened use of the term cyber security; one that includes management of risks related to human and organizational behavior in the development, implementation, and use of digital technology. This paper reports on the findings from a literature review on digital transformation and socio-technical perspectives on cyber security. It shows that the term digital transformation is often used as a general notion without any associated definition. When defined, it points to a process, driven by digital innovations, that relies on and affects several aspects and actors within and outside the organization. The literature on socio-technical perspectives on cyber security was structured according to six categories: 1) strategy; 2) risk management; 3) incident response and investigation; 4) governance; 5) training and education; and 6) practices and behavior. There is a need for more research on (especially informal) aspects of cyber security in the context of digital transformation; research that takes into consideration challenges related to complexity and organizational change.","Kilskar, Stine Skaufel",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the 30th European Safety and Reliability Conference and the 15th Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management Conference,2020-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Cyber security ;  Digital transformation ;  Information security ;  Socio-technical perspectives

Remote laboratories in engineering education. Deriving guidelines for their implementation and operation,"Exploratory laboratories are fundamental to engineering education, since they enable students to apply theoretical subjects to practical situations. The ongoing technical innovations are rendering remote laboratories possible. However, their implementation and operation encounter several challenges. This contribution gives an overview about the experiences gained throughout the project ELLI over a time period of 8 years. In 2012, a whole variety of remote laboratories was set up. At Ruhr-University Bochum, they are associated with Civil and Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. At TU Dortmund University, they are related to manufacturing processes, especially forming technology. To avoid individual software solutions, LabVIEW was set as standard tool throughout all applications. To summarize the experiences made, a final evaluation study was conducted in 2018 and 2019. The research design of this evaluation comprised a non-standardized survey method: From October 2018 to September 2019, a total of 11 expert interviews was under-taken with research assistants and professors. The interviews followed a semi-structured guideline which had previously been developed in a focus group discussion, containing five categories of leading questions. The transcribed interviews were analyzed via qualitative content analysis. This contribution presents challenges as well as potential for the use of remote laboratories in engineering education, in order to make the experiences gained available to the scientific community and to encourage further exchange about the use of digital innovations.","Kleinschnittger, O.;Strenger, N.;Petermann, M.;Frerich, S.

The project focused on strengthening the collaboration between HEIs (High Education Institutions) and companies by developing and testing new, smart and innovative cooperation models for HEI-company cooperation and methods for teaching. The project brought together HEIs and companies from five European countries with strong expertise and experience in different fields. These models and methods facilitated the involvement of students, HEI educators and company experts in international and multidisciplinary Research & Development & Innovation (R&D&I) projects proposed by companies. During HEIBus project all HEI and company partners worked hard and took part intensively in all their own project activities. All goals of the project were achieved very well and some of them were even exceeded, for example one extra Multidisciplinary Real Life Problem Solving project was carried out. After the project all partners are really satisfy for the outcomes and want to continue, deepen and widen cooperation.

"The senior university teaching qualification: Engaging in research, design and building community in engineering education","For a high standard of educational quality and success rates, teaching quality is key. Teachers need to be supported in their professional development aimed at achieving the ambitious goals of student-driven engineering education. Moreover, educational excellence is often confined to 'pockets': good practices are confined to one program or department and not shared beyond. Creating opportunities for teachers to collaboratively reflect on, further develop and share knowledge and practice-based research to promote educational innovation is very important. The Senior University Teaching Qualification (SUTQ) is focused on a scholarly approach of teaching and learning (SoTL; Graham, 2018), in which teachers are regarded as researcher and designer of their own educational practice, to collaboratively innovate and improve teaching. SUTQ participants determine their personal learning path and execute their own sub-project (160 hours) to innovate and improve their practice. They are supported by a coach, educational research and design seminars, and peer-feedback from colleagues. After three years of running and adjusting this approach based on the literature, evaluations, experiences and outcomes, this paper shows both the benefits and the challenges of organizing this type of professional development. Although participants feel inspired, appreciate the clarity, usefulness and feedback during SUTQ sessions, some challenges remain both in terms of facilitation (e.g., time) and the approach (e.g., the steps from clear problem statement to innovation design). Additionally, community-building needs more attention, to promote further continuous development in the university as a whole. In this concept paper we set out an agenda for doing so.","Poortman, C.

Interdisciplinary teamwork as a basis for innovation competences development,"Experts such as engineers in contemporary, global context often work in teams with members from various areas of expertise and professional backgrounds in order to develop new innovative products and services. That is why new training methods with an interdisciplinary approach are increasingly needed and developed. Our paper presents how we developed an interdisciplinary, work-oriented learning project over the years 2014-2017 and what results we got. We aim to provide pedagogical insights on how to support the development of innovation competences. The learning project was originally implemented in the degree programs of engineering and international business at Vamk in Finland. In addition, we compare these results with current experiences received during years 2018-2020, when a similar cross-disciplinary, work-oriented learning project has been implemented at Seamk in Finland. An interdisciplinary approach means that people work together as a team, presenting their own field of expertise and integrating each other's professional perspectives. Interdisciplinary teams develop individual and collective decision-making and help team members to understand and appreciate other disciplines. Findings of these qualitative learning experiments will be presented. Conclusions as to integrate diversity management at the university level and suggestions for the development of the engineering curriculum will be provided. Practical tips for teachers organizing interdisciplinary learning projects will be given.","Lautamäki, S.;Saarikoski, L.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 48th Annual Conference Engaging Engineering Education, Proceedings",2020-01-01,Seinäjoen Ammattikorkeakoulu;VAMK University of Applied Sciences,Innovation ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Pedagogy ;  Work-oriented learning
Social innovations in technical universities: Community-building - An approach,"There is unanimous agreement within the technical sciences on the importance of engineering for societal development. Sensitizing engineers to the challenges of our society and to inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration is important for modern engineering education. The paradigm of Responsible Research and Innovation is ubiquitous in funding agencies and research institutions as well as universities. Social responsibility is understood as the foundation for excellent research and teaching. Based on this, RWTH Aachen University understands the potential of innovative, socially responsible engineering education to meet new challenges. Therefore, the ""Responsible Research and Innovation Hub"" (RRI Hub) was founded in 2019, based on the concept of the integrated and interdisciplinary university.2 The aim is to establish an extensive collaboration between science and society to find solutions to complex problems through collaboration and co-creation with and for society. The RRI Hub has therefore developed a structured community-building concept for regional and supra-regional ecosystems, which will be subject of the conference presentation. Our approach is that social innovations for complex problems can only emerge in lectures if the results are connectable. This can be achieved by involving qualified actors in the research, development and teaching process. In a multi-stage community-building process, actors were identified, contacted and systematically integrated. Frequent communication with partners inside and outside the city has led to trustful collaborations from which both science and society benefit. We show how a successful community-building approach can look like and which challenges universities have to face in such processes.","Berg, J.;Wirtz, J.;Leicht-Scholten, C.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 48th Annual Conference Engaging Engineering Education, Proceedings",2020-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Community-building ;  Science & society ;  Service-learning ;  Social innovation
Issues influencing assessment practices of inter-program Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) in engineering education: The case of ISBEP at TU/E innovation space,"This paper reports on 11 issues influencing the assessment practices of ISBEP, an inter-program Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) project facilitated by TU/e innovation Space. To this end, we first identified four characteristics of inter-program CBL guided by the existing literature. Building on an exploratory, qualitative research study conducted over a period of seven months with students and coaches of the TU/e innovation Space Bachelor End Project (ISBEP), we identified the issues arising from those characteristics that had an influence on assessment. Our results and discussion are framed around the theory of constructive alignment, and suggest the need for more time to navigate a challenge; clarity on roles and expectations across the multiple stakeholders involved in the learning process; agreement on learning goals that foster the development of disciplinary knowledge and broad skills; and design and evaluation of assessment practices that are uniform across departments in the institution.","Valencia, A.;Bruns, M.;Reymen, I.;Pepin, B.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 48th Annual Conference Engaging Engineering Education, Proceedings",2020-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Assessment practices ;  Challenge-based learning ;  Inter-program education ;  Interdisciplinary education
The influence of the sustainability agenda on learning objectives in innovation courses for engineering students?,"Sustainability is an increasingly important topic all over the world and engineers have an important role. This calls for a new generation of innovative engineers who contribute to solutions with sustainability awareness. But how can we educate for this? With this contribution, we wish to contribute to an emerging dialog about how to formulate learning objectives that incorporate sustainability in innovation courses. In theory, sustainability is a capacious term that can be discovered through numerous lenses. In our study we examine how the phenomenon of sustainability is described in theory and in practice. We aim to unfold the multiple dimensions of sustainability rather than identifying the dominant discourse. Our research is based on insights from literature and empirical data from course descriptions that incorporate sustainability in learning objectives for innovation courses in engineering education. Our results show that despite study programs ambition to incorporate sustainability into educations the translation from an overarching ideology into concrete assemble learning objectives is not completed. Learning objectives most often are centered “about” and “for” and only few on “how-to”/ “through” . We also see a focus on management and strategy rather than on finding solutions. Basic knowledge about higher level decision making, stategizing and business modeling in organisations is relevant, however the ability to create new solutions, i.e. entreprepreneurial competences, is paramount.","Løje, Hanne;Thomassen, Mette Lindahl",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 48th Annual Conference Engaging Engineering Education, Proceedings",2020-01-01,Aarhus Universitet;Technical University of Denmark,

"Smart specialization, a strategy really thought out for all regions of the EU?","The ""Europe 2020"" strategy for ""smart, sustainable and inclusive"" growth aims to implement what the EU calls an ""Smart Specialisation Strategy"" (Research and Innovation strategy for Smart Specialisation RIS3), taking into account institutional, cultural and social characteristics to better adapt to local specificities. Based on semi-directive interviews conducted with heads of departments in charge of managing the European Structural and Investment Funds, we show that lagging regions have a greater need to implement catch-up strategies rather than a ""brutal"" conversion to a knowledge-based economy for which they are not ready, both in terms of European project engineering, quality of governance and R&D potential to create regions geared towards innovation and entrepreneurship. Consequently, it seems necessary to propose a more individualised approach to cohesion policy so that it can respond to the real needs of European regions by taking their specificities into account.","Bourdin, Sébastien;Lefèvre, Olivier;Saint, Fabrice",Journal,Geocarrefour,2020-01-01,EM Normandie,European Union ;  Innovation ;  Smart specialisation ;  Territorial cohesion
Joint (academic – industry) zeolitic catalyst and process development – How healthy is the model?,"Driven by efforts to leverage research budgets, introduce more innovation, and improve productivity, many companieshave moved to initiate joint catalyst and process development with external organizations. The preferred partners aremajor research universities, although government laboratories are increasingly engaged. In the US, National ScienceFoundation (NSF) and funded programs such as NSF’s Engineering Research Center ERC) and Industry–UniversityCooperative Research Centers Program (IUCRC) programs provide incentives for university researchers tocollaborate with their industry counterparts. The US Department of Energy (DOE) through its Office of Basic EnergySciences (BES) Catalysis Science Program has also been an effective facilitator of such relationships. In Europe aswell as in China, joint catalyst development programs have been a common practice for many years. There areseveral recent examples of successful joint university – industry zeolite catalyst and zeolitic catalytic processdevelopment. Using information in the public domain, this presentation examines some of the key attributes that havemade these joint development programs successful. The presentation also points to practices that may improve theproductivity of such relationships. A key question is whether such programs have succeeded too well? Has theintensifying focus on impactful, short term research distorted the mission of academic research to produce thefundamental knowledge and the freedom of academics to pursue research directions that look “interesting” rather thancommercially impactful?.","Degnan, T.

Sustainable processing: Examples in process intensification & commercial catalysis,"Today, businesses are much more accountable for the environmental impact of their operations then ever before.Stakeholders involved are increasingly well-informed and expect higher standards of performance to meet widerenvironmental and social objectives. Sustainability is thus becoming a sound business practice as major businessbenefits can occur through the application and adaptation of principles based on sustainable processing. Despitemuch hype and market demand sustainability is still a style with little or no substance. Here, I will provide twocommercial examples of sustainable engineering. These real-life examples are based on cutting-edge processintensification innovations at molecular, equipment and process design levels. These examples from design andcatalysis will show how to meet environmental & safety goals such as avoiding pollution, minimizing hazardousprocessing, minimizing waste of raw materials, maximizing process efficiencies, minimizing emissions and efficient useof energy while delivering the economically sound process & plant design. First example, is related to Oil & Gas and isaddressing a global and large-scale environmental issue which is not only wasting valuable hydrocarbon resources butis also contributing to global carbon emissions. I have led the development & deployment of novel solutions to addressthis problem thus not only reducing the emissions but creating value from waste resources. This commercial solutioninvolves designs based on process intensification at all levels. Modular, movable, and compact plant designs of theseprocesses are commercially competitive even at small scale and lower crude price. The second example is related to apetrochemical product and involves commercializing a best in class catalyst and process for a 300-KTA sizepetrochemical process. Both these examples are geared towards practical aspects of sustainable engineering. I willalso explain the business, political, and legal drivers behind the commercialization of these novel sustainableengineering concepts. Furthermore, I will also address the significance of sustainability from the perspective of theAmericas, EMEA and APAC regions. I will address how the global air, water, and land resources are threatened withaltering climate dynamics and what practical solutions at large-scale could help in short and medium terms. I will alsoshow how some of the innovations described above could contribute not only in growing local economy but may alsoprovide opportunities for implementing sustainability-based solutions in other parts of the world. Teaching Interests: I believe that teaching is a central part of an academic career. I derive my teaching philosophy from my experience as a teaching assistant, design lecturer and senior project supervisor at University of South Florida. This experience was further enhanced when I developed and taught several new graduate courses in systems biology of disease during my postdoctoral fellowship at University of Texas. Experience During first two years (2000-2002) of my graduate studies, I have served as a teaching assistant Search Meeting At-A-Glance Browse... for several courses in chemical and biomedical engineering, including capstone course of process and product design, introduction to biomedical engineering, process engineering, chemical reaction engineering and graduate course of computer-aided process engineering (CAPE). Based on my student evaluations and prior industrial experience, faculty at chemical and biomedical engineering department decided to appoint me as a lecturer and senior project supervisor for the capstone course of process and product design. For next three years (2002-2005), I independently taught this course and also supervised the senior design projects for almost two hundred students. This experience has helped me deepening my knowledge in these areas. By assisting and supervising individual students in their assignments and projects, I gained experience in what the common challenges are for most students acquiring knowledge. As an instructor in-charge for the process and product design course at the University of South Florida, I relished the opportunity to work with students one-on-one in order to assess what they understood well and what they did not understand based on lectures alone. This experience made it clear to me that different students learn differently, and sometimes simply expressing a concept in an alternative fashion was enough to make the concept clear. It also motivated me to develop different types of instruction in order to give the students the best opportunity to learn. I therefore, incorporated several different instructional mechanisms, including traditional lectures, active learning discussions,student-led presentations, discussions in small groups, interaction with industry experts, plant visits along with traditional problem sets. Seniors in the design course are also required to complete a design project. This was a great opportunity for me to expose students to more practical aspects of the profession. I developed and assigned the design projects based on the complex process research challenges of local industries in South Florida. That way not only the students could learn in a more realistic setting but also has the opportunity to find employment based on their work. During my stay at South Florida, I took the initiative to develop partnerships with local process industries so that my students can taste the flavor of reality in their design education. These projects also provided an opportunity for students to plan, manage, execute and evaluate themselves as individuals and team players. I used to meet with each design group once a week for one hour and have also asked them to develop a work plan for their project with self-imposed deadlines. I administered these projects according to industry protocols like reporting the man-hours, writing the memos, compiling the report, etc. As a postdoctoral fellow (2005-2010), I have been fortunate enough to be asked to develop and teach graduate-level courses related to my research in systems biology. During this period, I taught courses like systems biology of cardiac disease and computational neuroscience. These courses were intended for students who have diversified backgrounds in medicine, biology, engineering (such as medical doctors, molecular biologists and biomedical engineers) and are interested in scientific computation. The number of students enrolling in these courses was usually between 8/9. In these courses, I taught students the concepts and structures of computer programming (matlab), some non-numerical and numerical algorithms; concepts of cell signaling and how to formulate signaling models with minimum availability of data. Teaching these courses gave me lots of experience in how to teach an introductory course in systems biology. I also learned how to tutor students one-to-one or how to give a lecture in a graduate course with only a few students. Personal Philosophy I believe that learning is a complex process that is individual, content and context specific. As an instructor I am always attentive to these factors and adapt my instructional strategy according to the needs of learners, subject matter and setting. I believe it is important to develop a learning partnership with students such that they have no hesitation in communicating or approaching instructor. In my classes, I encourage students to participate actively. For example, I encourage them to ask questions. According to my years’ experience as a student, I think many students refrains from asking questions because they are afraid of appearing stupid in front of their peers. Hence, sometimes I ask some very easy questions on purpose to build their confidence. I always highly comment their questions as good questions. My goals of teaching can be summarized as: Firstly, the student should have learned how to solve the fundamental problem in question with the basic techniques taught in the course. Secondly, the student should have gained an overview of the subjects covered by the course. Thirdly, the student should have gained enough methodology to be able to learn advanced and complex topics independently if necessary. In the classes I taught, I have always tried to meet the goals as mentioned above. For example, in the capstone course of process and product design, I spent considerable time to introduce them the design concepts and algorithms along with basic understanding of economic and feasibility models. Each theory lecture is followed by a computer lab session in which related problems are solved through active learning mode. As students understand the basic components of product and process design, it is not difficult for them to transit from simple to complex problems in design. I also show students a systematic approach to complex design problem and how to apply simulation techniques to real-life chemical and biomedical engineering problems by examples. This requires sophisticated simulation skills, which are little advanced for undergraduate students. However, students like these types of problems because they are convinced that learning how to simulate and design a complex process/product design challenge does matter to their future professional activities. I really enjoy seeing that students in my classes are very willing to learn. When my lectures went well, students asked the right questions at the right time. This really stimulates the desire of my teaching, and I feel rewarded. In addition to the core chemical engineering courses, I look forward to teaching the systems biology course, which provide opportunities for understanding the complexity in cellular signaling cascades and identification of new drug targets. I am also interested in developing new courses or contributing to existing offerings in the areas of biochemical engineering, and synthetic biology.","Aslam, Naveed",Conference Proceeding,"AIChE Annual Meeting, Conference Proceedings",2020-01-01,,
Nanomaterial synthesis,"Synthesis of well-defined nanoparticles of controlled sizes and shapes is critical for the development of novel biotechnological innovations. Inorganic nanoparticles are interesting due to their high stability and unique optical and electronic properties. Owing to this high stability of inorganic materials, synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes can be obtained by different methods such as by reduction of metal salts, hydrothermal approach, polyol method, pyrolysis method, preformed seed-mediated method, templated synthesis, and by electron beam lithography. The synthesis of organic nanoparticles, on the other hand, is mainly achieved by bottom-up approaches and spherical and spherical shape-derived materials are generally obtained due to self-assembly of polymer chains in the solvents. However, with the advances in the field of engineering and nanotechnology, new methods for the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles by top-down methods are developed. These methods include lithographic approaches, particles stretching methods, and microfluidic techniques for the synthesis of organic nanoparticles. This chapter provides an overview on the mechanism of synthesis of inorganic and organic nanoparticles and on the synthetic approaches, which are being utilized in research and industry to develop nanomaterials of precise shapes and sizes.","Ahmed, Marya",Book,Polymer Science and Nanotechnology: Fundamentals and Applications,2020-01-01,University of Prince Edward Island,Bottom-down method ;  Nanoparticle synthesis ;  Polymersome ;  Role of surfactant ;  Self-assembly ;  Size control ;  Top-down approach
Frameworks for productivity science of machine effort and human effort,"Industrial engineering as a discipline emerged out of the efforts of engineers to take active part in managing engineering organizations and in reducing cost of production. Studying management and methods of production using scientific method was practiced and advocated to the community of engineers by F.W. Taylor. Taylor did considerable work on the productivity of machine tools and machine shop and made results of his scientific experiments public after 30 years of research. Frank Gilbreth followed Taylor in developing the initial model for study of motions of men. From the published works of Taylor and Gilbreth, the frameworks for scientific study of machine effort and human effort can be described and some studies that follow those frameworks and develop the science further can also be identified. Developments in productivity science will accelerate innovation in productivity engineering. Productivity engineering is a core function of industrial engineering and its augmented version industrial and systems engineering. In the paper, the frameworks used by Taylor and Gilbreth are described in detail and some further studies following the tradition are identified and the contents of the papers are briefly reviewed to present the roadmap for further development of productivity science in the area of machine effort and human effort. Machine effort includes all engineering aspects of an engineering system and human effort includes all human factors and its interface with engineering factors. The variables that can increase productivity are likely to be different in machines and devices of each specific branch of engineering. Therefore, development of productivity science of machine effort has to be initiated in each branch of engineering.","Rao, Kambhampati Venkata Satya Surya Narayana",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the 2020 IISE Annual Conference,2020-01-01,Indian Institute of Management Mumbai,Human effort ;  Industrial engineering ;  Machine effort ;  Productivity ;  Productivity science

"Synthesising lean construction and building information modelling to improve the south african architecture, construction and engineering industries","The South African Architecture, Engineering and the Construction (AEC) industry falls victim to fragmentation of processes and lack of coordination amongst professionals. Therefore an urgent need to explore and embrace techniques, technologies and innovations reduces building cost, materials and time, while collaboration amongst professionals is enhanced. Building Information Modelling has shown promise to solve some of the problems associated with building design’s ineffectiveness and facilitates a more collaborative approach to project delivery. While Lean Construction can reduce waste and non-value added activities in a process. However, it is unclear how the two concepts straddled together can further improve efficiency in construction. Therefore, it is critical to determine the barriers and opportunities of combined systems. Various sources of literature reveal that several barriers affect the synergy between lean construction and building information modelling. This research uses a comprehensive literature review to gather data for analysis. Furthermore, the authors use their autoethnographic experience to synthesise factors contributing to the systems’ successes and failures in South Africa. Finally, a framework of strategies to synthesise lean construction and building information is created. This research will be necessary for researchers, practitioners, and other professionals to add to the body of knowledge in construction and information technology.","Olaniran, Temitope;Pillay, Nischolan",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,2020-01-01,Cape Peninsula University of Technology,AEC ;  Building Information Modelling ;  Construction ;  Design ;  Lean Construction
Innovation in a MOOC: Project-Based Learning in the International Context,"A current trend in STEM education is to harness the power and reach of massive open online courses (MOOCs) to impart to students the skill of innovation. Innovation is a major driver of economic growth and development and a required skill for engineering students. The literature advocates the use of project-based learning (PBL) for promoting innovation; yet, we lack the understanding of how innovation takes shape and how to evaluate it. The current study addresses this gap by analyzing engineering students’ team projects and characterizing their quality and level of innovation. The study was conducted in the context of a PBL course in nanotechnology, while comparing three research groups: face-to-face (F2F) university students, online university students, and online world learners. Applying a mixed methods approach, the study included interviews with six experts in nanotechnology and the analysis of team projects (N = 296). Findings identified four categories of team project innovation: product necessity, STEM interdisciplinarity, market readiness, and innovation type. The online world learners group, which included students from different countries and academic backgrounds, exhibited relatively low performance. Their projects were mainly identified as offering incremental innovation, recognized as the lowest type of innovation. To advance project innovation of online learners, our study raises the need for regular and structured real-time synchronous meetings (through F2F and/or video), enabling online learners to be exposed to nonverbal expressions of their team members.","Barak, Miri;Usher, Maya",Book,Active Learning in College Science: The Case for Evidence-Based Practice,2020-01-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,
Two-dimensional materials for photocatalytic water splitting and CO<inf>2</inf> reduction,"Considering the increased energy consumption with tremendously growing population and industrialization, incorporation of abundant and clean energy systems in the energy mix is an absolute and prime requisite for sustainability of the emergent civilization. Currently 90% of the energy used globally is generated from carbon-based highly polluting fuels. However, fossil fuels like oil, coal, and gas reservoirs are a limited resource and will eventually become extinct. Moreover, combustion of fossil fuels is a major source of CO2 emission and greenhouse effect which are a major environmental threat. Therefore alternative clean, rich, and sustainable energy conversion, conservation, and storage strategies are required to be implemented on a rather urgent basis.

China’s Cultivated Land Balance Policy Implementation Dilemma and Direction of Scientifific and Technological Innovation,"The cultivated land balance policy, which is a remedial measure for the expansion of cultivated land occupied by industrialization and urbanization, is an important part of the cultivated land protection system in China. At present, the cultivated land balance is confronted with the dilemma of the exhaustion of cultivated land reserve resources, the high demand for cultivated land occupied by construction land and ecological land. The alienated behaviors of local government, such as supplementing cultivated land with insufficient quantity and poor quality, has threaten the national food security and ecological security. Under the background of cultivated land protection system transformation, it is necessary to deeply understand the long-term, extreme and complex nature of the contradiction between people and land in China. It is necessary to clarify the irreplaceable role of land balance policy in protecting land resources, optimizing land space, and promoting balanced development between urban and rural areas. We propose that the key solution is to use scientific and technological innovation to systematically recognize arable land and improve the technical support of management. We suggest that: (1) accelerate the formation of a new balance system with cultivated land quality and production capacity as the core; (2) using differential method to manage the balance of cultivated land; (3) research and develop regional engineering technology system of land ecological improvement; (4) improve the monitoring and supervision capacity of key elements of cultivated land resources. In conclusion, China should carry out national cultivated land resources security science and technology projects as soon as possible, that will comprehensively improve the scientific decision-making and intelligent management level of China’s cultivated land protection supervision, and support the development of cultivated land protection in the comprehensive direction of quantity, quality, and ecology.","Tang, Huaizhi;Sang, Lingling;Yun, Wenju",Journal,Bulletin of Chinese Academy of Sciences,2020-01-01,Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China;China Agricultural University,countermeasures and suggestions ;  cultivated land balance ;  cultivated land protection ;  cultivated land resources security ;  scientific and technological innovation
A Perspective Overview on Machine Learning Algorithms,"The latest innovations of technology now a days, avails the massive collection of information from various sources which leads to solve many real life challenges. The key challenge is to design the right model by handling the massive data. From past researches, there were so many misinterpretations made due to wrong choice of models. The lack of skill lies in handling the conservative data, designing the effective reasoning capabilities and handling missing data has triggered an increase in the number of studies using non-conventional methods like machine learning techniques. The study of machine learning which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence focusses on efficient and accurate prediction process by automating the knowledge engineering process avoiding the human intervention. In this research, the focus is made on the popularly used machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Trees (DT) along with their suitability, advantages and disadvantages with performance accuracy.","Nalini Durga, S.;Usha Rani, K.",Book Series,Learning and Analytics in Intelligent Systems,2020-01-01,Sri Padmavati Mahila Visvavidyalayam,Artificial Intelligence ;  Decision Trees ;  KNN ;  Machine Learning ;  Naive Bayes ;  Performance Accuracy ;  SVM
Blockchain: A new building block for the built environment?,"This paper explores the innovations that are presented to the architecture, engineering and construction sector through blockchain. The authors consider blockchain, as a technology and methodology that allows us to rethink the fundamental building blocks and principles on which the sector is based. First, we provide some historical context, returning to and discussing the hypothesis that brought blockchain technology into being. Second, we review specific use cases that represent key differentiators between conventional approaches and the opportunities made possible through blockchain. Our analysis reveals how blockchain challenges the traditional structures of industry. It offers a new distributed methodology for replacing centralised and decentralised structures of organisation and is disrupting notions of trust and authority that have been the default for industry—and indeed civilisation—for centuries. Finally, we report on original research where blockchain design workshops are held with industry stakeholders to map these opportunities into the architecture, engineering and construction sector.","McMeel, Dermott;Sims, Alex",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference of Architectural Science Association,2020-01-01,The University of Auckland,Blockchain ;  Built environment ;  Construction ;  Design ;  Distributed ledger technology ;  Innovation
A study of the implementation of BIM in the AEC industry in New Zealand,"In the most recent two decades, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been considered one of the most significant global technological innovations in the context of the Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) industry. Notably, several developed countries such as Finland, Singapore, Denmark, and Norway have successfully implemented BIM in both the government and private sectors. Modern research shows wider use and acceptance of BIM would benefit the AEC industry in New Zealand, with gains such as more effective processes, better cost-control and significant quality improvement of buildings and infrastructure. Even though there is a support mechanism to advocate the employment of BIM into the AEC industry in New Zealand, there are numerous barriers for its successful implementation. Past literature shows that only a few studies have analysed the reasons for lack of BIM use in New Zealand despite its well-recognised benefits and the available support mechanism. Therefore, this study aims to explore the barriers of BIM implementation in New Zealand. The study employed a qualitative approach. Selected subject matter experts from academia and the AEC industry in New Zealand were interviewed. The study found that the BIM adoption support mechanism in New Zealand is inefficient due to a lack of government leadership for supporting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry. An inconsistency of standards and classifications has also resulted in loose collaboration and a lack of coordination between members in the AEC industry. It is expected that the research findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the barriers for BIM application in New Zealand.","Thanh Pham, Thi Nhat;Skelton, Lorraine;Samarasinghe, Don Amila Sajeevan",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference of Architectural Science Association,2020-01-01,Otago Polytechnic,Architecture ;  BIM implementation ;  Engineering & construction (ACE) ;  New Zealand
Innovation and application of airborne geophysical exploration technology,"This paper briefly reviews the development of China’ s airborne geophysical exploration technology, focuses on the main technological innovations and application achievements of airborne geophysical exploration in China since the 21st century, especially since the “Eleventh Five-Year Plan”, and analyzes and forecasts the future development trend. In order to meet the needs of the state and society, since the “Eleventh Five-Year Plan”, China’s airborne geophysical exploration technologies, especially the aeromagnetic multi parameter survey, airborne vector magnetic survey, airborne gravity survey and time domain airborne electromagnetic survey, have been developed rapidly. In the process of airborne geophysical exploration technology innovation, the comprehensive research and application of airborne geophysical data have been strengthened. Important achievements have been made in many fields, including geology, solid mineral exploration and energy exploration and evaluation. Airborne geophysical exploration also has shown a good application prospect in groundwater resources survey, engineering geological exploration and environmental geological survey. To meet the demands for national resources and environmental survey, the resolution, stability and practicability of China’ s airborne geophysical survey system will be further improved in the future. On the basis of strengthening the application in traditional fields such as geology, solid mineral exploration and energy exploration, airborne geophysical exploration will expand and strengthen its application in deep-earth exploration, deep-sea exploration, deep geothermal exploration, water resources investigation, geological disaster investigation, surveying and mapping, military and other fields.","Xiong, Shengqing",Journal,Journal of Geomechanics,2020-01-01,Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China;China Aero Geophysical Survey and Remote Sensing Center for Natural Resources,airborne geophysical exploration ;  airborne geophysical exploration technology ;  application ;  innovation
STEM validation among underrepresented students: Leveraging insights from a STEM diversity program to broaden participation.,"Despite significant efforts to broaden participation in postsecondary science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, students from historically minoritized populations continue to face systemic barriers related to access, departmental climate, and institutional practices. Previous research suggests that campus-level STEM diversity programs often serve as a valuable resource for persistence and completion among students from underrepresented populations. However, more knowledge is needed to better understand how students experience STEM diversity programs and identify with their specific practices and activities, how those practices and activities shape students’ experiences, and how the practices, activities, and participation influence how students view themselves as members of the STEM community. Increases in the number of underrepresented students completing STEM degrees would result in new innovations to address world problems, more varied representations of scientists, and more individuals who could mentor future generations of learners. This study of 20 underrepresented students, all of whom participated in the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, describes the programmatic influences of LSAMP that support students’ successful progress within STEM disciplines. Data reveal that: (a) students entered the LSAMP program with self-defined strengths; (b) the LSAMP program provided formal academic support; and (c) students experienced evolving forms of scientific and identity development. This study centers students’ voices to inform educational practices, policies, and future research focused on the persistent need to broaden participation in STEM careers.

Research on solving method of product ergonomics problem based on virtual simulation and TRIZ,"In order to quickly and accurately solve the ergonomics problems and improve the humanmachine performance of products, a solving method of product ergonomics problem based on the virtual simulation and TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadatch) is proposed. Firstly, the evaluation of human-machine performance for the product was carried out by the virtual simulation tool, and the product area correlation was performed based on the obtained human body data to determine product areas with ergonomics problems. The root causes of product ergonomics problems were found by using the functional model and causal analysis. Then, according to the product ergonomics design cases and expert questionnaire survey results, a correlation table of TRIZ standard engineering parameters and ergonomics design criteria was constructed, and design schemes that could solve the product ergonomics problems were obtained through the correlation table and conflict analysis tool of TRIZ; based on the concept of ideality, the ideality evaluation method of product human-machine performance was proposed and the evaluation for obtained design schemes was carried out to determine the best design scheme. The proposed method was applied to solve the ergonomics problem of electric jig saw, which not only solved the problem quickly，but also improved the usability of electric jig saw. The results show that the proposed method can improve the innovation design efficiency and the ergonomics performamce of products, which provides a new idea for solving product ergonomics problems.","Zhong-hang, Bai;Xian-xian, Song;Mei, Li;Peng, Zhang",Journal,Chinese Journal of Engineering Design,2020-01-01,Hebei University of Technology,ergonomics ;  ideality ;  standard engineering parameter ;  TRIZ（Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadatch） ;  virtual simulation
Learning and teaching in the ruins: Reassembling innovation debris after grants expire,"This paper draws on an ethnography of a civic journalism unit in an urban high school, originally designed as part of a larger technology integration intervention sponsored by several education innovation grants. While the research design aimed to document civic learning outcomes of the digitally-mediated curriculum, the data collection occurred after the external grants expired, leaving the teacher to conduct the unit without additional support. I describe the school as a liminal educational landscape, transitioning between contradictory trajectories of urban de-industrialization and market-based interventions, and characterized by a pervasive culture of precarity, negotiability, and vulnerability. I explore how these conditions interacted with technological innovation debris-digital devices and infrastructural remains of the intervention-to form shifting learning assemblages that occasionally cohered with the unit's curricular virtualities, but often reassembled into other technology-based activities relevant to the new cohort of students.","Smirnov, Natalia",Conference Proceeding,"Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Conference, CSCL",2020-01-01,,
On innovation performance of low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation network in manufacturing industry under the global value chain: A case study based on Chinese manufacturing industries,"The strengthening scientific and reasonable quantitative evaluation of innovation performance of low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation network in manufacturing industry under the background of economic globalization is of important significance, which can enrich relevant theoretical system of low-carbon technology breakthrough and improve the core competitiveness of Chinese manufacturing industries. In this paper, the scientific and reasonable quantitative evaluation of the innovation performance of low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation network is firstly determined as a dynamic (time-varying) evaluation problem, which involves multi-source influencing factors. Note that many evaluation objects in the innovation performance of an innovation network are gray, ambiguous and dynamic variables, which are difficult to be quantified and the collected industrial data has certain discreteness and fluctuation. Hence, a fuzzy clustering analysis on influencing variables of innovation performance of low-carbon technology innovation network is carried out via the sampling data from 28 manufacturing industries during 2011-2016. Moreover, an innovation performance evaluation model for low-carbon technology innovation network is constructed through analytic hierarchy process (AHP), grey theory and fuzzy clustering analysis. Based on this model, the qualitative and quantitative evaluations of innovation performances of the innovation network before and after low-carbon technology breakthrough are realized. The results show that the low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation has a positive effect on improving the development level of manufacturing industry. In addition, the construction performance evaluation model not only decreases the influences of subjective factors by combining qualitative analysis with quantitative analysis, but also applies the grey theory innovatively to determine the membership matrix. It realizes accurate, systematic and scientific evaluation of the innovation performance of the low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation network in the manufacturing industries. Finally, the research conclusions provide the theoretical and practical references to the strategic arrangement of the low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation in Chinese manufacturing industries.","Dong, Chaoqun;Bi, Kexin",Journal,IEEE Access,2020-01-01,Harbin University of Science and Technology;Harbin Engineering University,AHP ;  Chinese manufacturing industries ;  Innovation network ;  Innovation performance ;  Low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation

The relationship between team dynamics and innovation effectiveness in an engineering thermal science course: An entrepreneurial,"Teamwork is essential in engineering. Yet research exploring the relationship between Team Dynamics and Innovation Outcomes is scant. This exploratory, mixed-methods study investigates the relationship between Team Dynamics and Innovation Effectiveness. Fourteen student teams were assigned to design a biomass pellet burner. At the end of the term, a “board of investors” that comprised actual entrepreneurs rated the Innovation Effectiveness of each team. Team Dynamics were assessed through a survey and interviews. The relationship between Team Dynamics and Innovation Effectiveness was not linear. Some teams achieved high Innovation Effectiveness despite poor Team Dynamics. Key factors and implications are explored.","Ta, Thien;Lichtenstein, Gary;Milcarek, Ryan J.",Journal,Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice,2020-01-01,Arizona State University,Engineering thermal science course ;  Entrepreneurial mindset ;  Innovation effectiveness ;  Team dynamics
The sequential nature of engineering problem solving,"Iron Range Engineering is an innovative, problem-based-learning program. Part of its innovation comes from the program’s strong emphasis on developing metacognitive skills. In our research, we have been investigating the cognitive processes involved in engineering problem solving, focusing specifically on the role of metacognition. To this end, we have collected think-aloud data as students solved open-ended design problems. The think-aloud data were gathered using verbal protocols and analyzed using sequential analysis. These analyses show positive growth in both students’ engineering knowledge and in their metacognitive use of that knowledge.","Hacker, Douglas J.;Plumb, Carolyn S.;Marra, Rose M.",Journal,Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice,2020-01-01,The University of Utah;Montana State University;University of Missouri,Engineering design process ;  Metacognition ;  Problem-based learning ;  Self-directed learning ;  Self-regulated learning ;  Sequential analysis

Nanotechnologies and advanced smart materials: The case of architecture and civil engineering,"In recent years, the innovations produced in the field of materials have radically changed the way of conceiving and realizing the building sector. New products and systems appear on the market, expanding the assets of knowledge necessary for the correct use of innovative technologies. We can define as “advanced” those materials having mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical properties that are clearly higher than traditional ones or with high performance levels. Advanced materials used in the building sector often derive from technological transfer processes of other industrial sectors such as the aeronautical, automotive, biomedical ones. Advanced materials seem to be able to contribute in the realization of more efficient solutions in terms of saving energy resources and materials in the whole life cycle, using lower quantities of raw materials, reducing the necessary maintenance operations, producing clean energy and absorbing polluting agents. But the new equilibrium that these materials establish with the environment, if not fully controlled, can also have negative impacts on the environment and people’s health. Experimentation on new materials for architecture and civil engineering is a research area in which researchers, designers, manufacturers and construction companies converge. The proliferation of advanced materials also reflects a change in the relation between man and the possibility of transforming matter for a different development. The interaction of several technological fields (biotechnology, nanotechnology, information and communication technologies) is revolutionizing the world of chemistry and materials technology, multiplying their potential and perspectives.","Di Sia, Paolo",Book,"The ELSI Handbook of Nanotechnology: Risk, Safety, ELSI and Commercialization",2020-01-01,Università degli Studi di Padova,Advanced materials ;  Architecture ;  Civil engineering ;  Environment ;  Health ;  Innovative technologies ;  Material properties ;  Nanotechnologies
Higher education research in Mongolia during the transition period of development,"The first higher education institution (HEI) in Mongolia was established in 1942. During the transition period from a centralized economy to a market economy, which began in the early 1990s, there was a marked increase in the number of HEIs. Mining, construction, transport, and communication have become the fastest-growing sectors; they have potential absorptive capacity for the younger population and demand technical, vocational, and engineering skills. The changing socioeconomic context has introduced progress and innovation in higher education; however, we have also faced some emerging problems and challenges. This has stimulated increased demand for higher educational research, and we here outline the current landscape of higher education as a research field in Mongolia on the basis of the quantity and themes of published journal articles and monographs. We reviewed the Mongolian Foundation for Science and Technology (MFST) database, which was established in 1993, as well as some academic journals that publish peer-reviewed, research-based, discipline-specific articles. The journals do not focus specifically on higher education, but they occasionally include articles related to higher education research. State-owned universities play a key role in such research; therefore, the summary of annual academic publications by faculty members and researchers of those universities is a reasonable source of information to find relevant articles. We reviewed 380 publications, most of which were related to common problems of higher education in Mongolia, such as educational policy, capacity building, faculty development, etc. In their conclusions and recommendations, the authors of the studies primarily stated that education management and human resource development, training methods, and content must be improved. We concluded that higher education research is in its initial stage of development and that its role as a field of science, in planning for future actions, in evaluating the results and outcomes of interventions and changes in higher education, and in providing policy developers and decision-makers with scientific evidence, is increasing.","Sumberzul, Nyamjav;Oyunbileg, Shagdarsuren",Book Series,Higher Education in Asia,2020-01-01,Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences,
From services to smart services: Can service engineering methods get smarter as well?,"Progress in technologies such as cloud computing or artificial intelligence currently paves the way for services that rely on the exploitation of data. The resulting smart services, however, are only gradually finding their way into practical application. A reason for this delay has been identified in the limited applicability of existing service engineering methods for smart services. In this paper, we identify critical perspectives to address in smart service engineering. Subsequently, we conduct a literature review to identify the extent to which these perspectives are covered by current smart service engineering methods. Our results indicate that even though there is a significant number of smart service engineering methods, some perspectives are rarely considered. We offer practitioners and researchers an overview of the status quo of smart service engineering, thus supporting the former in the selection of methods and pointing out avenues for future research to the latter.","Marx, Emanuel;Pauli, Tobias;Fielt, Erwin;Matzner, Martin",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Business Information Systems 2020 ""Developments, Opportunities and Challenges of Digitization"", WIRTSCHAFTSINFORMATIK 2020",2020-01-01,Queensland University of Technology;Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Service development ;  Service innovation ;  Smart service ;  Smart service engineering ;  Systematic literature review
"Diversifying MIR: Knowledge and Real-World Challenges, and New Interdisciplinary Futures","Challenges of diversity are being raised around the world, for example in response to #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. Against this background, this article, adapted from a keynote lecture to the 20th ISMIR conference, asks how MIR can refresh itself and its endeavours, scholarly and real world, by addressing diversity. It is written by an outsider, yet one who, as a music anthropologist, is intensely concerned with MIR and its influence. The focus is on elaborating auto-critiques that have emerged within the MIR community: social, cultural, epistemological and ethical matters to do with the diversity of the profession, of the music with which MIR engages, and of the kinds of knowledge produced. One theme is interdisciplinarity: how MIR would gain from closer dialogues with contemporary musicology, music anthropology and sociology. The article also considers how the 'refresh' might address MIR's pursuit of research oriented to technological innovation, often linked to the drive for economic growth; concerns about sustainable economies, it argues, suggest the need for other values to guide future science and engineering. In this light, the article asks what computational music genre recognition or recommendation would look like if, under public-cultural or non-profit imperatives, the incentives driving them aimed to optimise imaginative self- or group development, pursuing not a logic of 'similarity' but diversity, or took human musical flourishing as their goals. The article closes by suggesting that the time is ripe in MIR for sustained interdisciplinary engagements in ways previously unseen.","Born, Georgina",Journal,Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval,2020-01-01,University of Oxford,diversity ;  interdisciplinarity ;  MIR ;  music anthropology ;  music sociology ;  ontology
Engineering management principles for improving quality and efficiency in patient centred care,"Engineering Management (EM) combines management and engineering practices. The topics addressed within EM include professional ethics and legal issues, management and leadership theory, intellectual property, operations research, modelling and simulation, decision analysis, engineering economics, risk management, quality management, innovation and entrepreneurship, among others. Each of these topics can be brought to bear on present problems arising in healthcare, particularly concerning the implementation of patient centred care (PCC). The optimal delivery of healthcare is an area of contention in the literature. Various problems include perceptions of depersonalisation and a lack of continuity in care. Patient centredness has been the focus of much literature and encourages the empowerment of patients and replacement of the reductionist view of healthcare delivery, when components are delivered in a silo fashion, with a more holistic and integrated approach. While definitions and interpretations of PCC vary, there is widespread support for the adoption of this patient centred approach. Literature suggests that both quality and cost efficiency will be improved through care coordination and a focus on the patient. Not only is much of modern healthcare delivered in a siloed fashion, PCC is still not clearly developed in its application. The benefits of adapting EM principles with the discipline’s scientific process-oriented approach and the implementation of new technology, together with the focus on management, is a promising approach to today’s challenges experienced in the delivery of PCC. The arrival of Healthcare 4.0 powered by the technologies seen with the arrival of Industry 4.0 make this integration even more relevant and timely.","Hallo, Leonie;Gorod, Alex",Conference Proceeding,"ASEM 41st International Annual Conference Proceedings ""Leading Organizations through Uncertain Times""",2020-01-01,The University of Adelaide,Engineering management ;  Healthcare 4.0 ;  Patient centred care ;  Patient empowerment
Emerging topics in engineering technology and management programs,"Experienced professionals in engineering and construction often struggle to advance their careers without additional training or adequate skills in leadership and management. The lack of such skills inspired individuals to seek a master’s degree in business management. However, many expressed unique needs of a master’s degree in engineering technology and management. The authors investigated emerging and contemporary topics from previous literature, peer programs and institutions, current students and alumni, and industrial professionals in engineering (e.g., mechanical and electrical engineering) and construction (e.g., heavy civil and commercial) industries. A mixed-method approach is used to collect surveys and interviews from research participants. The quantitative data is analyzed using descriptive statistics. The qualitative data is coded in narratives. The results of the data analysis revealed core contemporary topics including managerial leadership, organizational performance management, project management, and risk management. The authors further reviewed two special fields: engineering technology and construction management. The top emerging engineering technology topics are finite element analysis, robotics, and innovation. The top emerging construction management topics are sustainability, construction finance and business management, innovative contracting, and virtual design and construction.","Dang, Hongtao;Choi, Jeunghwan John;Rajendran, Sathyanarayanan",Conference Proceeding,"ASEM 41st International Annual Conference Proceedings ""Leading Organizations through Uncertain Times""",2020-01-01,Central Washington University,Construction management ;  Emerging and contemporary topics ;  Engineering technology ;  Engineering technology and management
EPC 4.0: The quest for reducing CAPEX in EPC projects,"Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business in Europa is increasingly under pressure. Lack of productivity, low or negative profit margins for investors, and the lack of adopting necessary innovations and digitalization—from engineering activities through operations and maintenance to decommissioning—have caused significant deprivation of business and competitiveness compared to emerging providers in Asia. The quest for reducing capital expenditures (CAPEX) in EPC projects is intensifying. In May 2018, a research project was started to analyze the situation and key trends through desk research, to research how the challenges of the business could be tackled and to derive practical guidance for EPC contractors as well as for investors, owners, and operators (O/O). The project aimed to propose innovative ways of improving the EPC business model to reach the next level (“EPC 4.0”). In doing so, lessons learned from the automotive and aviation industry were considered. A key objective of the research project was to challenge statements of international EPC experts to cut CAPEX by 40–50% in EPC projects. With this statement in mind, the research focused on identifying measures with potential in six areas: (1) digitalization, (2) partnering, (3) flat supply chains, (4) flexible organizations, (5) core competences, and (6) the human factor. Summarizing the findings in these areas, the EPC 4.0 project came to a savings potential of up to 50% of the total budgeted project costs.","Wagner, Reinhard F.",Journal,"Organization, Technology and Management in Construction",2020-01-01,METRUM Managementberatung GmbH,CAPEX ;  Competitiveness ;  Digitalization ;  EPC ;  Human factor ;  Partnering ;  Productivity
Laboratory and Field Experimental Study on the Vacuum Preloading Method with Pumping and Discharging,"Negative vacuum pressure hardly reaches deep soils due to the drain board bending and serious blockage with the existing vacuum preloading methods (VPMs), thus resulting in poor reinforcement relative to practical engineering applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vacuum preloading method with pumping and discharging (a new dredger filling foundation processing technique based on vacuum preloading). This new VPM is developed through technological improvement and plastic drain board innovations in traditional VPMs. The new VPM uses a plastic vertical drainage board with double drainage channels, and the core board is in a ""tic-tac-toe""shape with a hollow centre and square pipeline channels. It can execute air and water drainage. Vacuum transfer holes were set at two grooves, every 2-3 m from the central pipeline of the core board. Grooves at two sides of the core board and filter membrane were rolled together to improve drainage. In addition, the vacuum pipe, tube connector, and core board centre of the vertical plastic drainage board were connected directly and securely. A stereoscopic vacuum transmission system composed of a horizontal and vertical drainage system was built. In this vacuum transmission system, the transfer route was shortened, and the loss of vacuum along the route was decreased. The negative vacuum pressure was transferred to different soil depths through the central pipeline of the core board to accelerate the dissipation of pore pressure in soil mass and prevent vacuum pressure loss caused by drainage board bending, thus improving the reinforcement effect. Dredger filling silt foundation reinforcement by VPM and VPM with pumping and drainage were compared in laboratory simulations and field tests with different drainage boards. Test results show that the loss of vacuum pressure along the drainage path was relatively smaller in the new physical vapor deposition (PVD), and the pressure transfer efficiency was increased. Deep soil mass was reinforced effectively by using the new PVD. After reinforcement, the physical and mechanical properties of soil layers were improved. Moreover, soil strengths were remarkably improved, with sharp reductions in natural moisture content and porosity. Then, the transfer law of vacuum on different drainage boards and the reinforcement mechanism of VPM with pumping and drainage were analysed. Research conclusions show the superiority of VPM with pumping and drainage in terms of effectiveness and soft foundation reinforcement. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application and development of the new VPM.","Zhang, Fuhai;Chen, Yu;Liu, Zhengrong;Chen, Lei;Bai, Yanhui;Chen, Liang",Journal,Advances in Civil Engineering,2020-01-01,Hohai University;Tianjin Research Institute for Water Transport Engineering,

DESIGN INNOVATION INCORPORATING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: CREATION and ASSESSMENT of a DESIGN TOOL,"Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers design engineers new and advanced manufacturing processes to consider when developing new products or redesigning and evolving current products. AM includes 3D printing processes to quickly produce complex parts and prototypes, that were previously uneconomical or impossible to fabricate. Engineers and organizations have an increasing need to incorporate AM as part of product development; however, design heuristics, design methodologies, and design tools to support AM are nascent and only recently emerging. To enhance Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM), this research seeks to develop an accessible, computer-based design assistant that will aid designers in incorporating AM into their design processes. The design assistant implements a distinctive and user-centered Design Innovation (DI) process, set of methods, and set of principles based on a 4D design framework. This 4D framework encompasses the UK Design Council s double diamond model and includes the phases of Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. The Discover phase entails user studies and a deep understanding and empathy for the user. The Define phase considers the reframing of design opportunities based on derived insights from the modeling users interactions. The Develop phase uses a variety of methods to create a large quantity of innovative ideas and concepts, and the Deliver phase implements a set of methods to prototype, test, pitch, and ultimately produce deliverables for a market or community. We demonstrate the design assistant tool for AM through the development of high-end bracket design for space applications. The design considers the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process for productions and incorporated topology optimization approaches. This demonstrative case study shows how the tool includes design heuristics and approaches for each of the 4-Ds that assist designers in implementing AM capabilities as part of repeatable design processes. Assessment of the tool is carried out through systematic assessments performed by practicing design engineers that have knowledge of AM. Initial results show that the design assessment tool is very helpful when designers consider using AM and also in helping them use AM in effective and efficient manners.","Menefee, Mark;Pokharel, Mahesh;Kaplun, Brian;Jensen, Daniel;Yakacki, Christopher;Wood, Kristin",Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2020-01-01,University of Colorado Denver;Lockheed Martin Corporation,
"PHYSIOLOGICAL VALIDATION of the 360 PANORAMA in HMD, for RESEARCH and DESIGN of ENGINEERING CLASSROOMS","Classroom design has a significant impact on curriculum development and student motivation. To study the impact of classroom space on students, environmental simulations are often. Due to its relative accessibility, the set-up of 360 panoramas formats shown through head-mounted displays (HMD) stands out. However, this set-up does not have a physiological validation (a physical-simulated comparison) for the specific case of educational spaces. A laboratory fieldwork was developed to address this lack. Participants performed tasks in a classroom or in its virtual replica, in a counterbalanced way. The sample was made up of 40 university students. While the participants performed these tasks, their heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) were recorded. Four physiological metrics were extracted from these records, which quantified the participants experience in both the virtual and physical classrooms. Complementarily, the sense of presence was quantified, according to the SUS questionnaire. Regarding the level of presence, the average level generated by the virtual simulation of the classroom was relatively high. Regarding the physiological response, no differences were found in any of the metrics studied. In conclusion, this supports the findings obtained through studies that use this set-up and the development of educational applications based on these technologies.","Higuera-Trujillo, Juan Luis;Llinares, Carmen;Rojas, Juan Carlos;Muniz, Gerardo",Conference Proceeding,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2020-01-01,Universitat Politècnica de València;Tecnológico de Monterrey,360 Panorama ;  Classrooms ;  Educational Innovation ;  Higher Education ;  Physiological Responses ;  Validity
4.2 Collaborating in a research and development project: Knowledge protection practices applied in a co-opetitive setting,"Organisations participate in collaborative projects that include competitors for a number of strategic reasons, even whilst knowing that this requires them to consider both knowledge sharing and knowledge protection throughout collaboration. In this paper, we investigated which knowledge protection practices representatives of organizations employ in a collaborative research and innovation project that can be characterized as a co-opetitive setting. We conducted a series of 30 interviews and report the following seven practices in structured form: restrictive partner selection in operative project tasks, communication through a gatekeeper, to limit access to a central platform, to hide details of machine data dumps, to have data not leave a factory for analysis, a generic model enabling to hide usage parameters, and to apply legal measures. When connecting each practice to a priori literature, we find three practices focussing on collaborative data analytics tasks had not yet been covered so far.","Kaiser, Rene;Thalmann, Stefan;Pammer-Schindler, Viktoria;Fessl, Angela",Conference Proceeding,"Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI), Proceedings - Series of the Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI)",2020-01-01,"Know-Center, Graz;Universität Graz;Technische Universitat Graz",Collaboration ;  Knowledge protection ;  Knowledge sharing ;  Protection practices
"Towards ""design for Interoperability"" in the context of Systems Engineering","In product development, early decisions made within the requirements specification and design phase have significant impact on overall functionality, quality and lifecycle cost of the product. In Systems Engineering, these oftentimes iterative design phases are steered by underlying development models, providing processes, guidelines and best practices. One family of guidelines are the ""Design for X"" (DfX) tools or principles. In the development of mechatronic systems e.g. production systems, traditionally the mechanical, electric and software domain are to be distinguished. Over time, driven by trends of digitalization, communication and interconnection of systems, the product innovation and thus the required development effort has been shifting from the mechanical domain towards the software domain. The question of system interoperability thereby is of a fundamental nature. This is especially relevant within the current paradigms of Industry 4.0 and the Digital Twin. To reflect the growing importance of interoperability (i.e. the ability of systems to purposefully interchange interpretable information) as a requirement for the product within the design phase of technical systems, this paper introduces ""Design for Interoperability"" (DfIOp) as a new DfX principle. First, this is motivated by the ever-growing importance of information technology for current and future products. Then, the main contribution of the paper is the combination of the state of the art in the research domains of DfX, interoperability, Systems Engineering and Industry 4.0. Consequently, DfIOp will be presented, including a systematization model as well as a first method for its implementation. Further contemplation on DfIOp shows, that it enables derivative principles such as ""Design for Data Analytics"" and ""Design for Digital Twin"". In future research, the underlying models as well as methods of DfIOp are to be further detailed and integrated into the research context.","Sjarov, Martin;Kißkalt, Dominik;Lechler, Tobias;Selmaier, Andreas;Franke, Jörg",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2020-01-01,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Design for Interoperability ;  Design for X ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Interoperability ;  MBSE
Analysis of the environmental impact of e-scooter sharing services considering product reliability characteristics and durability,"Electric stand-up scooters become increasingly popular for both private and shared use. They are a mass product but need to be adapted to different use cases or the local conditions of different cities. However, the sustainability of electric scooters is a matter of public debate, especially because of their short lifetime. Studies show that the reliability of e-scooters is one of the main factors influencing their environmental impact during their life cycle. This paper addresses the research question of the potential advantages and disadvantages of a reliable electric scooter from the perspective of ecological sustainability. It shows how reliability characteristics, especially durability, can affect product sustainability of mass customized products like e-scooters. The paper uses life cycle assessment (LCA) as a methodology. It suggests approaches to include reliability characteristics into LCA and life cycle engineering. Using the three case studies of electric scooters as an example, it outlines the influence of innovation cycles and modular design of batteries, of component durability and scooter lifetime as well as different maintenance strategies on the environmental impact of e-scooter sharing. Altogether the paper discusses possible trade-off between the advantages and disadvantages of improved reliability on the life cycle performance of e-scooters.","Severengiz, Semih;Schelte, Nora;Bracke, Stefan",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2020-01-01,Bergische Universität Wuppertal;Ruhr-Universitat Bochum,E-Scooter ;  Life Cycle Assessment ;  Life Cycle Engineering ;  Mass Customisation ;  Product Reliability ;  Sustainability
A Novel Recommendation Algorithm Based on Time-aware,"The primary key in novel recommendation is to judge whether an item is “new” for target users. The novelty of recommended items to users changes with time. Therefore, the effects of time factors on user preference, as well as the novelty and accuracy of the recommended items, have become key to novelty recommendation research. To increase novelty based on recommendation accuracy, a novel recommendation algorithm based on time-aware was proposed. First, a time attenuation parameter was introduced into a traditional algorithm to strengthen the weights of recently adopted items. Next, the calculation of innovation adoption activism was adjusted through time information. Differences among recommended items were calculated by combining the time of items that have been adopted by users and the quantity of relevant categories. Lastly, the novelty of recommended items was calculated by the result fusion strategy for Top-N recommendation. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was verified by conducting an offline experiment. Results demonstrate that the novelty of the recommendation list by the proposed algorithm is significantly higher than that of traditional algorithms. Novelty when the number of items in the candidate set reaches 300-400 reaches the peak. The recall rate of unknown items increases by 25%, whereas the recall rate of known items decreases by 60%. The average popularity of the recommendation list decreases by 50%, and the coverage rate increases by 200%. The proposed algorithm improves the ability of the recommendation system (RS) to explore novel items.

"University Support, Teaching Competencies And Entrepreneurial Competencies In Software Engineering And Graphic Design Students","The objective of this research was to evaluate how university support and teaching entrepreneurial competencies affect students' entrepreneurial competencies. As an empirical test, a sample of 201 software engineering and graphic design students from a university in Northwest Mexico was taken, where it was possible to corroborate three hypotheses. The results suggest that entrepreneurial competencies are influenced by external aspects, where the university can be understood as an open system, but also, as a part of a wider system within the triple helix. This shows that the joint work between the contextual and individual part can benefit the generation of innovation and development for society, especially in a country where there is a lack of R&D, although the practice of entrepreneurship is high. As a result, the university can play a relevant role when developing entrepreneurial competencies to train students to become entrepreneurs through innovation and technology.","Moreno, Oswaldo Alberto Madrid;Ramírez, Marco Alberto Núñez",Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2020-01-01,Instituto Tecnológico de Sonora,Entrepreneurial competencies ;  entrepreneurial university ;  teaching competencies ;  university support
The space medical centre,"The outer space is an unquestionable resource for improving life on Earth. Advances of space technologies (such as telecommunications and earth observation data) are known for benefiting services of Communities and Society. Applications in public health practice arise by leveraging such technologies in prevention, preparedness, response and recovery of health-related hazards and issues. It has benefits in public health management, but it also has limitations when looking at practical ways to implement such information in local health practice readily. Then, advances in space medicine and space medical technology are being translated for use in terrestrial fields, including private consumers, use in remote locations and use in natural disasters. Such a scenario has more benefits in local health practice than at the global level. The Space Medical Centre (SMC) built on the idea of using existing space infrastructure for providing practical solutions on health and health management at the global level and in clinical practice. The SMC is thought as a Part connecting services and addressing limitations of ongoing works on global health and translation science. Indeed, the space environment has the potential of becoming the perfect place for boosting medical research for producing alternative medications and pharmaceutical drugs. Shortly, space travelers may travel to space for exploration or may travel to find a cure to medical conditions by taking the advantages of space and its resources. Also, the SMC has the potential to become the only Entity assigned to elaborate big data for redirecting health information from space to Earth. This work is designed to bring disruptive innovation within the field of health, suggesting a practical solution with a multiscale impact on Society.

Possibilities for new space hubs in Brazil,"According to an Euroconsult ranking of investments in the aerospace sector, Brazil ranks thirtieth. It invested 122 million USD in the sector in 2018, A large part of it destined to public administration and processes, while the rest is applied in the space sector. From the applied funds, most of it revolves around the State of São Paulo. There, is located Brazil's only space industry hub, composed by the headquarters of the National Institute for Space Research, Department of Space Sciences of Aeronautics and space related companies. Most of the aerospace supply chain is located in the city of São José dos Campos - SP. The state of São Paulo is responsible for approximately 94% of the country's aerospace and defense production, having a large impact on other sectors in the region. The aerospace hub was created around the 1960s with the foundation of companies such as Embraer and Avibras, as well as the national space research institute (INPE) and ITA (Aeronautics Institute of technology). The coalition of such players brought great technological development to the region, impulsing the city to the third in the country in developing high-level technologies and the third highest GDP per capita in the state.

Interdisciplinary space lab (Phase 3 Australia - USA Partnership): Undergraduate curriculum innovation utilising astronaut health and wellbeing requirements for long duration space missions (LDMs),"This paper presents the third annual iterative outcomes of an innovative university-based space program creating design ideas for astronaut health support and wellbeing during a long duration mission (LDM) for a future inhabited lunar moon base or Mars Mission astronaut transit. University faculties including Built Environment, Industrial Design, Engineering, Science, Health, and Medicine are brought together to develop a new understanding of discipline capabilities with the prospect to co-creatively provide new opportunities and inspiration for team-work across fields. This is of key interest to employers of new graduates in space or innovation-based industries where human factors and designing for high quality human-centered outcomes supports career resilience through currency, agility, and focus. The importance of an interdisciplinary approach through positive mindset, cross-field knowledge, and co-creative team actions is integral for continuing space exploration success as evidenced by past and ongoing terrestrial space habitat analog missions and extraordinary International Space Station (ISS) achievements. The altruistic nature of interactions that make the ISS a success on multiple levels across cultural, scientific and humanitarian foundations provide the template for cross-disciplinary inspiration, that leverage synergies, and shared goals unattainable by single fields alone. It is not traditional for disciplines to work so closely together though industry has an expectation for this knowledge. Previously teams of three (2018); five (2019), and now ten undergraduates in 2020 represent team formation. Student numbers across the design for space theme have grown from fifteen, to twenty-five, to forty students in 2020. Now opportunities to respond to the complexities of the project in more detail are presented in addressing the overarching research domains in spatial design, human factors and design for health for LDMs with a new diverse team mass not previously experienced. Team supervisory staff has grown from 1-to-3 and provides further skill sets for team guidance and discipline specialisation to inform three iterative project phases across the twelve activity weeks that focus on human spaceflight, exercise, related design performance and materials, and selected UNSDGs principles. Periodic project collaborations with sports and health science, engineering, neuroscience, telehealth, health informatics, and industrial design academics (project host discipline and non-traditional space area) provide the environment for discussion, development, and co-creative processes that have led to new discoveries and stimulus for new collaboration, international understanding and advancing humankind.","Alexander, Sasha;Bannova, Olga",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2020-01-01,Western Sydney University;University of Houston;Cullen College of Engineering,Design ;  Experiential learning ;  Future work ;  Interdisciplinary ;  Spaceflight
"Building information modeling (BIM) in enhancing the applying of knowledge areas in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry","Background: The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry is one of the sectors that contribute the most to the Palestinian economy. However, it now suffers from many problems, one of which is not adopting new innovations, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM). BIM recently achieved far reaching consideration in the AEC industry. Aim: This research aimed to understand the contribution of BIM to the enhancement and application of Knowledge Areas (KAs) in the AEC industry in Palestine. Methods: A quantitative survey was utilized in the pilot study. Thirty copies of the questionnaire were dispersed to respondents from the target group. The completed questionnaires were analyzed to test for statistical validity and reliability. After the pilot study, the questionnaire was validated and dispersed to the entire sample, comprising respondents from the target group who were selected by convenience sampling. Eighty copies of the questionnaire were dispersed, and 71 copies of the questionnaire were obtained from the respondents with a response rate of 88.8%. Results: To draw meaningful results, the gathered information was analyzed by utilizing quantitative data analysis techniques, including the RII, Pearson correlation analysis, and Factor analysis. Conclusion: The results illustrated the extent of enhancing the application of KAs in the AEC industry using BIM technology from the highest to lowest as follows: Cost Management (CM), Time Management (TM), Resource Management (REM), Procurement Management (PROM), Scope Management (SCM), Stakeholder Management (STM), Integration Management (IM), Quality Management (QM), Communication Management (COM), Risk Management (RM), and Safety Management (SM). As an example, BIM is effectively applied to each KA, and high efficiency is achieved when BIM is applied to TM by 4D modeling; to CM by 5D modeling; to REM by collaboration; to PROM by quantity takeoff; to SCM by element-base; to STM and IM by using integrated project delivery; to QM by using clash detection; to COM by centralized, structured data management, and information flow; to RM by constructability; and to SM by automated safety code checking.","Maliha, Mohammed N.;Tayeh, Bassam A.;Aisheh, Yazan I.Abu",Journal,Open Civil Engineering Journal,2020-01-01,Middle East University Jordan;Islamic University of Gaza,BIM ;  Communication management ;  Integration management ;  Procurement management ;  Quality management ;  Resource management ;  Risk management ;  Safety management ;  Scope management ;  Stakeholder management ;  Time management
Gravitygames 2.0,"Expeditions to Mars will present many challenges that will need to be overcome. Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS) - the largest student-led STEM organization globally - partnered with Made In Space, Inc. (MIS) believes that additive manufacturing provides a solution to some of the challenges that astronauts may face: the additive manufacturing of tools, utensils, spare parts, a “swiss army knife”, and other innovative objects that explorers may need to help them adapt to the extreme conditions of Mars or in potentially hazardous circumstances that could threaten their welfare and the mission. SEDS and MIS see the Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF) aboard the ISS as an essential proof point that can help teach and train future Mars explorers about the possibilities and vast use cases of additive manufacturing. A STEM education challenge will help the next generation of space leaders and innovators imagine the challenges and learn the technologies to successfully explore space. University and high school students from more than 30 countries are challenged to design a product that will be selected for print on the ISS Made in Space AMF that can be demonstrated by the astronauts. The Mars Challenge, using the MIS printer, is offered to inspire students' imagination, innovation, and experimentation. The original (pilot) challenge project, called GravityGames, was created to provide a unique educational experience to encourage STEM students (high-school to college) to develop authentic, hypothesis-based research. GravityGames used the 0G-3D space-based technology on the ISS to make a product for astronauts to play while on a long-duration space flight and was on ISS Mission 50/51. Mars Challenge, or GravityGames 2.0, takes this idea a step further: to challenge more students to design a 0G-3D product needed on a future spaceflight to Mars, perhaps a mission students will be working on one day as professionals in aerospace or as astronauts.","Viswaroopan, Gautham",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",2020-01-01,Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS),
D-mars habitat prototype 2.0,"The Desert Mars Analog Ramon Station (D-MARS) is a non-profit organization, dedicated to developing and operating an international planetary research analog center in the Negev desert of Israel. An advanced D-MARS habitat that will host the analog Mars mission AMADEE-20 on October 2021, is being established at the Ramon crater. This habitat, defined as prototype 2, is designed to be a platform for international analog missions, aimed also for astronauts training, scientific analog research, and an innovation laboratory for combining existing technologies in future space missions. Nearby this habitat an artificial underground cave will simulate a lava tube on Mars. The combination of the habitat and this compound will allow operational and scientific investigation of various scenarios involving habitat and lava tube complex. The Mars habitat prototype 2, simulating a building located up to 400 million kilometers away from Earth, is an architectural-engineering adventure, integrating the most advanced high-tech technologies with almost ancient building materials like mud and soil. The D-MARS habitat prototype 2 design tackle many of the Mars mission challenges; The constraints in shipping materials from Earth, the inevitable limited living space and storage volume, the requirement to be sustainable and energy and waste sufficient, along with the need to protect the astronauts, resulted in a set of constraints and requirements. The new design implements innovative solutions to these problems.

Emerging technologies for invasive insects: The role of engagement,"Emerging technologies have the potential to offer new applications for managing invasive insects. While scientific and technological advancements are vital to realizing this potential, the successful development and use of these applications will also largely depend on community and stakeholder engagement.To contribute to a relevant and rigorous envisioning of engagement for emerging technologies for invasive insects (ETII), we begin by reviewing key insights on engagement from three scholarly fields: invasive species management, responsible research and innovation, and ecological risk assessment. Across these fields we glean best practices for engagement for ETII: 1) pursue engagement across decision phases and sectors; 2) select context-appropriate participants and methods; and 3) recognize and navigate engagement-related tensions. We illustrate these best practices by describing an ongoing project that uses engagement to inform risk assessment and broader decision making on biotechnologies being developed to address the Spotted-wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) invasive fruit fly. We describe completed and planned engagement activities designed to identify and prioritize potential adverse effects, benefits, management actions, and research actions of the proposed genetically engineered sterile male, gene drive, and RNAi biotechnologies. In the face of broadening calls for engagement on emerging technologies, this article provides theoretical and empirical insights that can guide future engagement for ETII.","Kokotovich, Adam E.;Delborne, Jason A.;Elsensohn, Johanna;Burrack, Hannah",Journal,Annals of the Entomological Society of America,2020-01-01,NC State University,Community and stakeholder engagement ;  Drosophila suzukii ;  Ecological risk assessment ;  Invasive species management ;  Responsible research and innovation
Student's Perception of Web 2.0 Tools and Educational Applications,"The information technology used to acquire the skills determined as 21st-century competencies in the education-training process to individuals is increasing rapidly. Nowadays, Web 2.0 tools are increasingly used. Effective use of Web 2.0 tools, which are widely used in daily life, by students and teachers in education are also on the list. Effective use of assistive technologies by teachers depends on their attitudes towards assistive technologies. To increase their success, they use these technologies in activities held in the classroom. In the study, it was aimed to determine the attitudes of teachers and student candidates towards the use of assistive technology. A case study approach constituted the methodological framework of this study. This study was conducted in the fall semester of 2019-2020 with 42 students. Teachers and student’s obligation to take ""instructional technology and material design course"" was hence initiated as a result. Numerous Web 2.0 tools were reminded to the students for the results of the research. The data of this study were collected through open-ended questions developed by the researchers to define the opinions of the students regarding Web 2.0 tools and educational practices that they will encounter in their future professional lives. Content analysis, frequency and percentage was applied in the analysis of data. The analysis of data was sought to answer the following questions; (1) How often did teachers and students use web 2.0 tools?; (2) What are Web 2.0 tools that teachers and students use or plan to use in their current and future teaching profession?; (3) What are the reasons for teachers and students to use Web 2.0 tools as teachers in their professional lives?; (4) What are teacher education students' views on Web 3.0 technologies and (5) What are the changes and innovations these technologies will bring in the field of education?","Ozcinar, Zehra;Sakhieva, Regina G.;Pozharskaya, Elena L.;Popova, Olga V.;Melnik, Mariya V.;Matvienko, Valentin V.",Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2020-01-01,Kazan Federal University;Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation;Plekhanov Russian University of Economics;RUDN University;Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University;Ataturk Teacher Training Academy,Applications ;  education ;  Teacher candidate ;  technology ;  WEB 2.0

Investigating students' computational thinking through STEM robot-based learning activities,"Nowadays, robots are an important learning tool in education and are increasingly used inside and outside the classroom to foster the development of students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes connecting to a real-world situation. In past years, using robots in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education has been proposed as one of the strategies to integrate the different fields in order to construct more effective projects and innovations. Especially, engineering is the combination of math and science in solving a problem. Nevertheless, students could not understand and appreciate how to apply the knowledge of interdisciplinary integration to operate certain tasks by the engineering method. This research article presents STEM robot-based learning activities (STEM-RoLA) with sixty high-school students who were studying science and engineering. The obtained results show that the proposed STEM-RoLA is beneficial for students, especially when compared with high and low robotics performance students. The results found that high robotics performance students have higher computational thinking than low robot performance students, and they have a positive engagement response in the learning activity.","Chookaew, Sasithorn;Howimanporn, Suppachai;Hutamarn, Santi",Journal,"Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems",2020-01-01,King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok,Computational thinking ;  Educational robotics ;  STEM education
"Synthesis on narrowing the gap between engineering education and industry through science, technology, economics, management and ‘fire fighting’ (STEMF)","India globalized its economy in 1991 and thousands of MNCs have established their design and manufacturing centers in India by fully utilizing the human capital developed by the Indian universities, institutions, manufactured the state-of-the-art technology products and successfully exporting them world-wide markets. Till today no company has closed its design or production center in India for want of high performing, motivated and risk-taking engineers since the availability is ten times the need of the growing industries. However, the global industries have to meet the challenges due to Industry-4 and train their employees through various proven models like ‘learning organization’, ‘just in time learning model’, etc. The accreditation of engineering programs has been undertaken to ensure the high quality in the graduates. Continuous improvements in Teaching-Learning Process are being implemented by the engineering institutions. Certain percentage of faculty members are being continuously trained through Quality Improvement Programs of Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), but the shortage continues due to fresh appointment of raw graduates who were not trained in any area of engineering education. The vacancies arise day by day. Modernization of labs and workshops are being carried out through ‘Modrob’ (Modernization and Removal of Obsolesce) scheme of AICTE and the state Directorates of Technical Education and only in government and assisted engineering colleges. Around 800 colleges were closed as per AICTE order for their deficiencies. World Bank Assisted Technical Quality Improvement (TEQIP) Projects’ capacity development has been implemented in all government, governments assisted colleges and in a few self-financing colleges only. Further, quality improvement of the curriculum and efficiency improvement in decision making, examination reforms, research work, etc. have been completed for the benefit of state technical universities and autonomous government assisted colleges only. Many research studies indicate that the curricula have to be improved and modernized. Centers of Excellence and Innovation have been established in a few institutes of national importance only. Industry-Institute-Government-Society-Partnership Centers have also been established mostly in National Institutes of Technology and institutes of national importance. Industrial training of the engineering students has been implemented in few institutes only. Dual programs have been introduced in the institutes of national importance. Finishing school courses are being introduced only in very few self-financing engineering colleges. The gaps between the curriculum and the industrial needs have been continuously narrowed only in state technical universities, National Institutes of Technology (NIT) and institutes of national importance. However, many disruptions like Industry-4, and digital technology demand for industry ready engineers in emerging technologies but the majority of the output from self-financing engineering colleges do not possess the needed skills and competencies. India is emerging as a Center for Design of Innovative Products and Services. A mega model to improve the skills and competencies of the engineers through a smart five theme approach has been developed which focuses on Science and Arts of Curriculum Development, Educational Technology, Educational Economics, Educational Management and needed ‘Fire-Fighting Model’ to meet the new gaps due to the disruptive digital technology which demands dynamism in all players. An exhaustive list of subthemes for each-major theme has been reviewed, researched and presented.

"A radical and virtual innovation center (RVIC) for human resource development (HRD)-case study on planning, developing and sustaining the human capital development","Under knowledge-based economy, there is a need for developing high-performing and self-managed faculty teams (SMFTs) for undertaking consultancy projects from the states, national and global organizations. In this research work, a case study has been presented on the initiatives of high-performing teams in undertaking diverse global faculty and executive development programs under various ministries and International Development Agencies (IDAs) like Asian Development Bank, UNDP, UNESCO, USAID and World Bank even though there is no formal consultancy center for undertaking Human Resource development Center. This resulted in engaging the faculty creatively, meeting the challenges, focusing on the real-world problems, advancing the personalized learning, developing interdisciplinary master and doctoral programs. This has capitalized in brining Industry-Institute-Government-Society (I-I-G-S) Partnership and improved the competitiveness of the nation. Even though there is Technical Teachers Training Institute (TTTI), Chennai was established in 1964 primarily for developing the polytechnics through faculty development in 1964. Under Quality Improvement Program (QIP) of the Government of India, Curriculum Evaluation, Improvement, and Development of new programs based on the emerging technologies have been undertaken. Further to assist the faculty, Instructional Material Production was undertaken. Long-term Programs like Diploma in Technical Teaching (Dip. T.T.), Diploma in Science Teaching (Dip. Sc.), and Bachelor of Technical Education (B. Tech. Ed.) were established. To meet the needs of many specializations, Certificate courses in Technical Teaching (Cert. T. T.), and Educational Technology (Cert. E.T.) were introduced. Based on the needs of various states, Extension Centers have been established in Kalamassery for Kerala, Hyderabad neither an established Consultancy Center nor a Department for HRD, the Self-Managed and High-Performing Faculty Team established a Radical and Virtual Innovation Center (RVIC) for Human Resource Development with an ultimate global focus and interdisciplinary programs and diverse global human resource development programs.

Torsional strengthening of reinforced concrete beams with externally-bonded fibre reinforced polymer: An energy absorption evaluation,"The impacts of numerous important factors on the Energy Absorption (EA) of torsional Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams strengthened with external FRP is the main purpose and innovation of the current research. A total of 81 datasets were collected from previous studies, focused on the investigation of EA behaviour. The impact of nine different parameters on the Torsional EA of RC-beams was examined and evaluated, namely the concrete compressive strength (f’c), steel yield strength (fy), FRP thickness (tFRP), width-to-depth of the beam section (b/h), horizontal (ρh) and vertical (ρv) steel ratio, angle of twist (θu), ultimate torque (Tu), and FRP ultimate strength (fy-FRP). For the evaluation of the energy absorption capacity at different levels, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was implemented in this study. Also, to fit the measured results, Quadratic and Line models were created. The results show that the RSM technique is a highly significant tool that can be applied not only to energy absorption-related problems examined in this research, but also to other engineering problems. An agreement is observed between Pareto and standardized charts with the literature showing that the EA capacity of the torsional FRP-RC beams is mostly affected by the concrete compressive strength, followed by the vertical reinforcement ratio. The newly suggested model in this article exhibits a satisfactory correlation co-efficient (R), of about 80%, with an adequate level of accuracy. The obtained results also reveal that the EA acts as a safety index for the FRP-strengthened RC beams exposed to torsional loadings to avoid sudden structural damage.","Hason, Mahir M.;Hanoon, Ammar N.;Al Zand, Ahmed W.;Abdulhameed, Ali A.;Al-Sulttani, Ali O.",Journal,Civil Engineering Journal (Iran),2020-01-01,University of Baghdad;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Ministry of Science and Technology,Energy absorption ;  FRP ;  Reinforced concrete beams ;  Response surface method (RSM) ;  Torsional strengthening
Identifying research and development priorities for an in-hospital 3d design engineering facility in India,"Advanced three-dimensional (3D) design and engineering technologies have revolutionized patient-specific implants, prostheses and medical devices, particularly in the cranio-maxillofacial and oral medical fields. Lately, decreasing costs, coupled with the reported benefits of bringing design and production technology closer to the point of healthcare delivery, have encouraged hospitals to implement their own 3D design and engineering services. Most academic literature reports on the factors that influence the sustainable development of such services in high-income countries. But what of low-and middle-income countries where demand for custom craniofacial devices is high? What are the unique challenges to implement in-hospital services in resource-constrained environments? This article reports the findings of a collaborative project, Co-MeDDI (Collaborative Medical Device Design Initiative), that brought together a UK-based team with the experience of setting up and running a hospital-based 3D service in the United Kingdom with the Maxillofacial Department of a public hospital in the Uttar Pradesh region of India, which had recently received funding to establish a similar capability. We describe a structured design research approach consisting of a series of exchange activities taking place during the lifetime of the project that compared different aspects of the healthcare innovation ecosystem for 3D services in India and the United Kingdom. Based on the findings of the different activities, we identify key factors that influence the adoption of such services in India. The findings are of relevance to healthcare policy-makers and public hospital managers in resource-constrained environments, and to academics and practitioners engaging in collaborative export of healthcare initiatives.","Eggbeer, Dominic;Mehrotra, Divya;Beverley, Katie;Hollisey-Mclean, Steven;Evans, Peter",Journal,"Journal of Design, Business and Society",2020-01-01,Cardiff Metropolitan University;Morriston Hospital;King George's Medical University,3D printing ;  Craniofacial ;  Design ;  Facial ;  Healthcare ;  Hospital ;  India ;  Resource-constrained
Exploring industrial PhD students and perceptions of their impact on firm innovation,"This chapter explores industrial PhD students and perceptions of their impact on firm innovation. It relates to the larger question of how academic engagement with industry through collaborative research can influence firm innovation. Specifically, it explores university-industry collaboration from the perspective of industrial PhD students, who in the present case are simultaneously PhD students and firm employees. The empirical context is collaborative research in the engineering field in Sweden. Given the lack of previous relevant research, the chapter first explores the conditions of industrial PhD students, leading to a definition. Next, an existing conceptual framework for academic engagement is presented and elaborated upon, by detailing the micro-level activities of these PhD students in order to understand their perceived contribution to firm innovation during their education. Our results suggest that industrial PhD students are more involved in developing firm capabilities for innovation than directly involved in developing product innovations or patents.","Berg, Karin;McKelvey, Maureen",Book,"Diversity, Innovation and Clusters: Spatial Perspectives",2020-01-01,Göteborgs Universitet,

Social assessment of technology and humanitarization of engineering in the information society,"The article considers definitions of the contemporary technology and its social and moral assessment. In the information society, humanitarization of engineering and technical education in general becomes extremely important together with the social-humanitarian knowledge in the interdisciplinary assessment of the scientific-technological development. Technology Assessment (TA) is a new scientific discipline, a theory of assessing and forecasting the development of technology, and a practice of consulting. Based on the TA, algorithms are developed to identify negative effects of technology and to make scientifically sound decisions. An interdisciplinary dialogue on the social assessment of technology should focus not only on technocratic tasks but also on the social-humanitarian methodological and epistemological foundations of the TA. In recent years, this component of the social assessment of technology has influenced the Western-European academic discourse on Responsible Research and Innovation, which reflects the scientific understanding of the importance of ethical reflection of technical activity. Thus, there is an obvious need for the combination of the socialhumanitarian expertise of innovative technological projects with technical, mathematical and applied methods in the information age. Contemporary radical changes determined by the scientific-technological revolution require new approaches, methods and forms of interaction between people and communities, while their global nature determines universal ethical principles of these relationships. The post-modern information development of Russia will be accompanied not only by implementation of information technologies in all spheres of life, but also by the social-moral assessment of technology, humanization and humanitarization of engineering, strengthening personal professionalism and creative abilities.","Tsvyk, V.

Research and Experiment of Repairable Space Telescope Interface System,"Space technology is the core competitiveness of a powerful country. Space maintenance technology has just started in our country. The biggest innovation of this article is to design a set of interface system, which is suitable for on-orbit maintenance of space science instruments. It represents that this technology from scratch in our country. A new measuring method is proposed. According to the homogeneous coordinate transformation, the mathematical models of the relationships between fit clearances of interface system and the six-degree of freedom change of the maintenance module are derived. According to the index requirements, the corresponding fit clearance and repeat positioning accuracy are determined. Set up an experimental platform, and use autocollimator and laser tracker to measure the repeated positioning accuracy of the module. Based on the theory of small displacement, the least square method is used to deduce the rotation angle and translation amount of the module through the change of the characteristic point coordinates. The experiment proves that the interface meets the requirement of on-orbit maintainable operation, and the experimental data proves that the theoretical equation is correct.

Evaluation of the positional quality through the postprocessing of raw gnss data from a smartphone via different satellite positioning methods,"Since the introduction of the Android 7 in August 2016, it has become possible to use raw data collected by GNSS sensors present in some Android smartphones and tablets. Therefore, it became possible, for the first time, to perform the post-processing of the data, which means to obtain coordinates that are more accurate than usual, from meters to decimeters. In addition, among the technological innovations in the context of positioning via smartphones, it is mentioned the use of modern GNSS sensors, like the one used by Xiaomi Mi 8, which was the first smartphone to integrate a dual-frequency GNSS sensor. In this research, data collection campaigns were carried out in static mode to evaluate the quality of geodetic coordinates obtained from Mi 8. Using freely available applications that store raw data in files in RINEX format, the data was post-processed with different positioning methods and with different software, including the freely available IBGE-PPP online service in Brazil. The results of this research show that it is possible to obtain geodetic coordinates with an accuracy at decimeter order, which indicates that the methodology can be used in some engineering applications.","Gomes, Allan;Krueger, Claudia Pereira",Journal,Boletim de Ciencias Geodesicas,2020-01-01,Universidade Federal do Parana,Android ;  GNSS ;  IBGE-PPP ;  Smartphone
To regulate or not: A social dynamics analysis of an idealised ai race,"Rapid technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as the growing deployment of intelligent technologies in new application domains, have generated serious anxiety and a fear of missing out among different stake-holders, fostering a racing narrative. Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects.","Han, The Anh;Pereira, Luís Moniz;Santos, Francisco C.;Lenaerts, Tom",Journal,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,2020-01-01,Vrije Universiteit Brussel;Teesside University;Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa;Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores: Investigação e Desenvolvimento em Lisboa;Université Libre de Bruxelles,
Research on the application of blockchain technology in intangible cultural heritage creative design and teaching,"Cultural and creative design is one of the powerful ways to innovate cultural development and cultural and economic prosperity. The progress of the times and the change of design trend also affect the innovation of cultural and creative design and teaching. However, at present, the Intangible cultural heritage and creative design and education in Anhui Province are also facing the old teaching mode and the disconnection of the times, the education centralism hindering the cultural and creative design to be popular, lifelong and design teaching management. The system can not meet the problems of cross regional learning and certification, so new technology is needed to change these disadvantages. Blockchain has the technical characteristics of information tamper ability, decentralization and distribution, privacy and supervision, smart contract, etc., which can effectively optimize and solve the problems in the design and teaching of Intangible cultural heritage cultural innovation in Anhui Province. This paper discusses the management of learning resources, tracking learning process, evaluation of learning results, shaping learning path, management and examination in the design and teaching of Intangible cultural heritage cultural innovation by blockchain technology In the application of nuclear teaching, we found that there are still some shortcomings after the application of technology, such as the complexity of operation technology and the easy disclosure of information, the problem of artificial filling and compatibility of information, and the optimization of related technology.

Antecedents of Digital Platform Organising Visions,"Organising vision theory has been increasingly used in Information Systems (IS) scholarship to study how IT innovations are adopted, used, and diffused. Although providing comprehensive social cognitive account on the phenomena, organising vision theory is less adequate to explicate how visions emerge. Bringing in scholarship from Science and Technology Studies (STS) together with IS, our examination of a case study involving the organising vision emergence of an ERP digital platform technology unearthed details of its origin and management. Our findings suggest that organising visions originate from repurposing of other structured frameworks. This research contributes to the organising vision theory by providing a more nuanced comprehension of vision’s antecedents, which more broadly may help better understand digital innovation adoption.","Neves da Rocha, Fábio;Pollock, Neil",Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2020-01-01,University of Edinburgh Business School,Adoption ;  Diffusion ;  Digital platform ;  Enterprise system ;  ERP ;  Organising vision
"Aligning the Concepts of Risk, Security and Privacy Towards the Design of Secure Intelligent Transport Systems","Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) play a key role in our daily activities. ITS development over the last decades has been based on the rapid evolution of information technologies, which include processing capabilities, availability of hardware and communication technologies. Moreover, ITS use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to improve sustainability, efficiency, innovation and safety of transportation networks helping towards better management of transportation networks with the use of advanced technologies, which facilitate monitoring, and management of information. However, as the development of ITS services increases so does the users’ awareness regarding the degree of trust that they show on adopting this kind of services. The later has brought light to several security and privacy concerns that ITS analysts should consider when implementing various IT related services. This paper moves into this direction by identifying how risk analysis can interact with security and privacy requirements engineering world, in order to provide a holistic approach for reasoning about security and privacy in such complex environments like ITS systems. The key contribution of the paper is the conceptual alignment of three well-known methods (EBIOS, Secure Tropos and PriS) as the first step towards the design of a complete assurance framework that will assist analysts in designing safe and trustworthy ITS services.","Diamantopoulou, Vasiliki;Kalloniatis, Christos;Lyvas, Christos;Maliatsos, Konstantinos;Gay, Matthieu;Kanatas, Athanasios;Lambrinoudakis, Costas",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,University of the Aegean;University of Piraeus;Airbus Group SE,Intelligent Transport Systems ;  Privacy requirements engineering methodologies ;  Risk analysis methodologies ;  Security requirements engineering methodologies
Online blended learning in the digital environment,"The article presents the results of a study of the processes of educational activity in the context of the digital revolution. The authors focus on the scale of the spread of digital technologies, the provision of users with electronic means of communication, and the availability of the Internet network for argumentation of the established global information society. It was noted that in the context of the digital revolution, the face of manufacturing industries is changing. Market engagement platforms facilitate the diffusion of innovation and transformation of business models. In the context of the analyzed processes, the requirements for personnel are changing. The demand for professionals trained to work in a digital environment is expected to grow. It is hypothesized that personnel capable of research work, management of the processing of large data arrays and relevant information on the controlled or investigated object will have a high value. It is suggested that within the framework of courses on in-depth study of the use of tools of modern information systems, students should acquire the practice of independent work in the functional areas of information systems of business organizations. These can be separate information subsystems serving individual functions, processes, departments, for example, information systems and technologies of procurement, production, sales, processes for developing and implementing business development goals and strategies. The development and implementation of online blended learning courses aimed at organizing the learning environment can speed up the processes of training personnel to work in a digital environment. The authors express the point of view-network blended learning will be relevant for the training of developers and users of information systems, the development of engineering and technical and humanitarian competencies.","Iskakov, I.

"Higher engineering education: Traditions, regular and forced innovations","This paper focuses on the study of the features of distance learning at a university in light of modern requirements for higher engineering education and the traditions of the education in Russia. Education in Russia has always been understood not only as learning but also as enlightenment when the lecturer's mission was not limited to teaching goals-it involved the moral and intellectual development of students. This research formulates and analyses a contradiction of the need to combine traditions of Russian education with a strengthening of the professional component of engineering education. The concept of intelligence is actualized as a desire for knowledge, humanism, selfless attitude to work and professionalism, high culture and moral qualities, developed sense of duty, social responsibility. Diversified personality development correlates with the concept of intelligence. In this regard, it is natural to turn to the transdisciplinary approach in the educational process in its expanded understanding as integration of not only the content and methods but also the forms of learning organization, as well as obligatory establishment of working contacts between lecturers of different disciplines. The paper formulates proposals for semi-formalized tests in force majeure conditions of distance learning. The authors of the paper conducted a questionnaire survey of students with different majors on the effectiveness of forced full distance learning caused by COVID-19 and analyzed its results. This provides the necessary grounds for predicting the possibilities and prospects of distance learning in the higher education.","Andreev, V. V.;Evdokimova, O. K.;Gorbunov, V. I.;Vasilieva, L.

Transforming requirements for engineering occupations as affected by technological changes,"This article is devoted to studying the influence of technological changes on transforming the necessary set of skills for engineering occupations. The expected changes in qualification requirements for engineers is based on the analysis of industrial revolution. The growing importance of soft skills is acknowledged. The methodological conclusions regarding the need to take into account the level of triple helix awareness, along with the parameters of the labor market when forecasting the directions for qualification requirements transformation for engineers were substantiated. It is noted that being ahead in the formation of new skills may have a positive impact on the growth in innovative activity. It is this aspect of the relationship between technology and qualification development trends that determines the role of educational organizations in the innovation ecosystem. It is shown that the convergence of technologies leads to an expansion of the range of professions referred to as engineering. The use of particular tools for assessing the demand for competencies allows solving only situational research tasks, whereas in the meanwhile scientifically advanced ecosystems require a system for monitoring technological and qualification changes, primarily in relation to engineering qualifications, since they can become a bottleneck of technological development. A methodology for systematizing the influence of technological trends on the qualification requirements is proposed. The mentioned methodology is based on bringing into conformity reciprocal trends on the meso-level within the framework of triple helix cooperation on the regional scale. As the labor market acquires flow characteristics, the need for separate monitoring procedures will decrease, with analysis algorithm simplifying.","Melnikova, E. V.;Melnikova, A. A.;Sergeev, M.

Study on the Regional Differences and Promotion Models of Green Technology Innovation Performance in China: Based on Entropy Weight Method and Fuzzy Set-Qualitative Comparative Analysis,"The coordinated development of green technology innovation performance among regions is of great significance for China's sustainable development. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the evaluation and promotion modes for green technology innovation performance. Based on the data of 30 provinces in China, this paper comprehensively evaluates regional green innovation performance and determines the factor configurations that can achieve high green technology innovation performance. This paper constructs an index system of green technology innovation from four aspects (economy, innovation, environment, and social welfare) and measures the results by the entropy weight method. The results show that green technology innovation performance decreases from the eastern region to the western region. At the province level, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang have lower performance, while Beijing, Zhejiang and Shanghai have higher performance. The fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis method reveals five configurations that achieve high green technology innovation performance. Specifically, regions with high green technology innovation performance tend to be those with high environmental regulation intensity and high innovation input. When environmental regulation and innovation input are both high, regions should fully consider the technology spillover effect of foreign direct investment. When energy prices is high, regions should give full play to the technology spillover effect of FDI and the transformation of market demand to reduce the pressure of production costs.","Li, Panpan;Bi, Peng",Journal,IEEE Access,2020-01-01,Shihezi University;Harbin Engineering University,configuration ;  entropy weigh method ;  fsQCA ;  Green technology innovation performance ;  promotion model ;  regional difference
Analyzing the role of research and technology organizations (RTOs) in national innovation systems (NIS),"This paper conducts an extensive literature review to derive the role and positioning of Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) in National Innovation Systems (NIS). Special attention is paid to the identification of main actors and the structure of a national innovation system in order to define the term ""applied research organizations"" and to analyse research and development, as they enable to describe the structure of innovation systems. The innovative performance of a country depends on the functionality of its national innovation systems, the active interaction of the involved actors and the technological maturity of the NIS (OECD 1997). NIS are defined as networks of institutions in the private and public sector that interact with each other to develop, modify and transform new technologies. They take over different activities and functions between basic research and market maturity. (Freeman 1995) In a NIS, different actors are active in promoting innovation. In general, a corporate sector generates the demand for innovation and a network of organizations consisting of universities, laboratories and political institutions acts as a supporting part. Together, they contribute to advancements in their fields. (Teubal 2002). Thus, the analysis of NIS represents a possible approach for the identification of actors, their field of actuation and especially of the role of RTOs. For these purposes, one of the best-known structuring approaches is the triple helix model of innovation, which focuses on the three main actors: science, industry and government. (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1995; Ranga and Etzkowitz 2013) When analyzing the main actors of this system, it becomes clear that RTOs play a significant role for national innovation systems. RTOs are driving forces of digital transformation and economic growth as they increase innovation-related capabilities in industry and develop state-of-the-art technologies. As intermediaries between universities and private organizations, RTOs act as connecting organizations in the innovation system and pursue innovation for economy, society and governments.","Hecklau, Fabian;Kidschun, Florian;Kohl, Holger;Tominaj, Sokol",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Management Leadership and Governance, ECMLG 2020",2020-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin;Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK,Applied research ;  National innovation system ;  NIS ;  Research and technology organization ;  RTO
Advanced ground truth multimodal imaging using time reversal (TR) based nonlinear elastic wave spectroscopy (NEWS): Medical imaging trends versus non-destructive testing applications,"An innovative pragmatic approach is described using a symbiosis of modern signal processing techniques coming from nonlinear science and multiscale global analysis usually considered for the characterization of nanoscale systems with complex mesoscopic properties. The basis of this systemic approach comes from ultrasound imaging of the complexity with examples coming from the non-destructive testing (NDT) industry and from the medical harmonic imaging research. Modeling uses basic tools derived from the analysis of nonlinear dynamics, such as spectrum representations coming from harmonic analysis and multiscale analysis, in association with advanced signal processing such as similarity and invariance analysis based on group theory. Experimentation is based on multimodal imaging using time reversal (TR) based nonlinear elastic wave spectroscopy (NEWS). Practical implementation in the aeronautic industry and the biomedical imaging field is taken as a demonstration of feasibility of such advanced engineering TR-NEWS methods for imaging complex systems with an advanced ground truth approach including round robin tests. This new class of multiscale materials is studied with phenomenological approaches like the Preisach–Mayergoyz space (PM space), where some physical properties like hysteresis, end-point memory, and odd harmonic generations are extracted from the noise. As a consequence, this approach is proposed for including phenomenological tools to any organizations’ strategies in order to monitor the vulnerability in a societal emergency management context. These results could be applied for the organizational side of innovation, cognition, and practices for novelty and disruption in political organizations, social monitoring, and any system which will involve big data or artificial intelligence.","Dos Santos, Serge",Book Series,Applied and Numerical Harmonic Analysis,2020-01-01,Université de Tours;Groupe INSA,Decision theory ;  Ground truth ;  Hierarchical analysis ;  Integritology ;  Invariance ;  Multiscale ;  Nondestructive testing (NDT) ;  Pragmatic probability law ;  Signal processing ;  Symmetry ;  TR-NEWS ;  Ultrasonic imaging
Dynamic Spatial Analysis of Economic Performance on Comprehensive Carrying Capacity in the Greater Bay Area Considering Mediating Effects,"The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the regions with the strongest economic vitality in China. This study explores the nonlinear effect of economic performance on urban comprehensive carrying capacity (UCC) in the 11 GBA cities for the period 2004–2016. In doing so, we employ static and dynamic spatial panel econometric models to investigate the nonlinear relationship of the economic-UCC nexus and explore the mediating effect of technology innovation and energy consumption. Results confirm the inverted U-shaped relationship of GDP per capita and UCC in the contexts of geographic, economic, and economic-geographic matrices, respectively. External capital shows a promoting effect on UCC while the opposite holds for share of manufacturing sector to the economy. This study verifies that technology innovation and energy consumption are important intermediate variables. Innovation shows a positive spatial spillover effect that helps to improve the UCC level of neighboring cities, while energy consumption has a negative spillover effect. Therefore, this study explores the nonlinear effect of economic growth on environmental pressure in the GBA. The significant roles of technology innovation and energy consumption are illustrated. The spatial spillover effect in GBA cities is confirmed. The final section outlines proposals for policy recommendations to improve UCC, to ensure continuous growth of the economy, and to introduce environmentally friendly technologies.","Shao, Qinglong",Book Series,Environmental Science and Engineering,2020-01-01,Shenzhen University,Economic performance ;  Energy consumption ;  Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao greater bay area (GBA) ;  Static and dynamic spatial econometric models ;  Technology innovation ;  Urban comprehensive carrying capacity (UCC)
Corporate memory processes in project-based organizations: A framework for engineering design firms,"Corporate Memory is associated with the organizational ability to register and retrieve previous knowledge with the purpose of supporting its current application and also decision-making. Within Project-Based Organizations (PBOs), the nature of Corporate Memory is influenced by the temporality, uniqueness and independence of their project portfolio. The research question has driven the investigation of how the memory capture, retention, recovery and application processes occur in PBOs. An empirical and qualitative study was carried out through a multiple case study conducted in three large Brazilian Engineering Design Firms which are organized by projects due to market demands. Document analysis, direct observation and semi structured interviews with engineers, project managers and executives were conducted. Data analysis has given evidences about the peculiarities of the processes that constitute the corporate memory cycle in PBOs. The memory capture process has taken place in five different forms: Direct capture, indirect capture, capture by hiring professionals, experience capture and capture by knowledge transfer. Memory retention has crossed organizational boundaries and established a knowledge network of former employees and third parties. Memory application has emerged not only as a background to organizational learning and decision-making, but also as a platform for innovation and business advantage generation. It was also observed that the PBOs memory can be divided into volatile and perennial memory, where the former can be lost at the end or throughout project execution and the latter is internalized, becoming an inseparable part of the Corporate Memory. It was also found that there is a growing perception among the studied engineering firms that corporate memory is gradually shifting from a documentation burden required by the hiring companies and the Government towards a monetizable knowledge base. Surprisingly, lack of routines and project uniqueness were not considered as barriers to Corporate Memory, but as new knowledge generators. A detailed framework was proposed as a pathway to steer scholars, project managers, and engineers in the development of knowledge practices that promote enhanced Organizational Learning in transitory work contexts.","Barbosa, Leandro Mol;De Carvalho, Rodrigo Baroni;Choo, Chun Wei;Versiani, Ângela França",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organisational Learning, ICICKM",2020-01-01,Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Minas Gerais;Federal Institute of Minas Gerais – IFMG;Faculty of Information,Corporate memory ;  Engineering design firms ;  Knowledge management (KM) ;  Organizational learning (OL) ;  Project-based organizations (PBOs)
PlayMINT - Still playing or already leading? Design of a digital learning game to promote female STEM Students' innovative work behavior and digital leadership,"Although the proportion of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professions has increased significantly in recent years, they are still striking underrepresented in study programs and companies of the STEM area. Moreover, women only occupy 21% of STEM leadership positions in Germany. These numbers underline a serious gender gap in the STEM field. To address this gender gap and benefit from the work and innovation potential of STEM women for companies in times of the digital disruption, we develop the competency-based learning game PlayMINT. PlayMINT intends to stimulate interest in and prepare female students for STEM beyond study programs to encourage women to start STEM careers and to promote them into STEM leadership positions. Based on existing research in leadership and management, we design PlayMINT with the goal of teaching concepts and competencies, which are relevant to leadership, innovation, and digital transformation. Our assumptions underlying PlayMINT are that creative self-efficacy, effective interpersonal communication, and general business knowledge are predictors for higher innovative work behavior in the STEM area and that empowering, envisioning, and general business knowledge promote digital leadership. PlayMINT aims to realize these suggestions for female STEM students, in particular from computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, because these fields show the most pervasive gender gap within the STEM fields. PlayMINT leads participants through the innovation process in a robot company by playing the role of a female engineer. Her mission is to implement a medical robot for spinal surgeries as a new business idea. PlayMINT will provide valuable contributions to STEM study programs, to STEM companies, and society in general.","Hagerer, Ilse;Treffers, Theresa;Hoffmann, Antonia;Richly, Carolin;Baier, Stephan;Welpe, Isabell Melanie",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Game Based Learning, ECGBL 2020",2020-01-01,Privatuniversität Schloss Seeburg;Technische Universität München,Competency-based learning game ;  Digital leadership ;  Gender gap ;  Innovative work behavior ;  Serious game ;  STEM

Impacting mindset and innovation on sustainability via global thematic hackathon,"Innovations related to social, economic and environmental grand challenges are common targets not only for societies as a whole, but also for the universities and business schools in them. This paper studies an example of how an intensive intervention via a local implementation of a global 3-day design hackathon (IFTP= Invent for the Planet) on global needs has impacted participants' understanding and motivation towards sustainability issues and solving them. The paper approaches the research objective by studying via a qualitative research approach the motivation letters that the participants submitted when applying for the event, learning outcome -report immediately after the event and their self-reported orientation to the issue area one month after the event. In addition, the views of the impacts were collected from the local facilitators and coaches to reflect their considerations to the views of the learners. The theory base of the paper discusses the approaches and models of behavioural change (nudging, planned behaviour, functional triad, etc.). The analysis offers insight on whether short-term interventions can have an effect on a sample that is already exposed and interested in the topic, since a course is a non-obligatory element of studies for all participants (from both business and engineering schools).","Saukkonen, Juha;Tarasanski, Pavlos;Hämäläinen, Tapio",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2020-01-01,Jyväskylän ammattikorkeakoulu,Environmental innovation ;  Globality ;  Innovation ;  Social innovation ;  Sustainability
Designing Framework of Constructivist Web-Based Learning Environment Model to Enhance Creative Thinking in Engineering Design Process for Grade 8th,"Creative thinking is one of the most important characteristics of a person that drives innovation. It is a skill that helps countries succeed in the rapidly changing digital economy society in the 21st century [6]. Countries are therefore focused on developing creative populations. Most of today’s innovations are created by the engineering design process. But the engineering design process itself still lacks effectiveness in promoting creativity in cognitive domain [5]. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to synthesize the framework of a web-based constructivist learning environment to enhance creative thinking [2] in engineering design process [3]. The document analysis and model research [1] were employed in this study The target groups used in this study were 1) 3 experts for assessment of the learning contents 2) 3 experts for assessment of the instructional design for theoretical framework 3) 3 experts for assessment of the instructional media design. 4) 3 experts for assessment of the gathering research instruments and 5) 30 eight-grade students of Khon Kean university Demonstration school who enrolled in a course of design and technology II.

Sharing innovation activity models in the context of open innovation,"The study explores the models of sharing economy in open innovation environment that are implemented by companies. On the base of the survey of top managers of innovation companies from North-West of Russia, we identified four key sharing models: The sharing of laboratories and equipment, the sharing of highly qualified engineering teams and individual professionals, and the sharing of research and development based on open innovation systems. These models can be both independent and convergent. Over time, given the potential for digital platforms to advance innovation, sharing models could occupy the research and development niche and gradually displace traditional forms of innovation organization. To understand costs and benefits of using innovative resources sharing, we conducted the model analysis and received the indicator that characterizes the relative level of companies' losses related to innovative resources disintegration. Using the case of low temperature technologies project, we calculated the efficiency of using sharing innovative resources.","Tkachenko, Elena;Rogova, Elena;Bodrunov, Sergey;Karlik, Alexander;Kokh, Vladimir",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2020-01-01,St. Petersburg State University of Economics;HSE University;Institute for New Industrial Development,Open innovation ;  Sharing economy ;  Sharing innovative resources

Innovative entrepreneurial companies in the digital era: The impact of business automation on international development and competitive advantage,"In a global business world and highly competitive business environments, it is important for any industry to innovate continuously and to take advantage of all the new technologies brought by the new industrial revolution for automation and increase efficiency, be it process, people, promotion, technology or to transform the business itself. This objective can be achieved by developing an increase in knowledge and control of the operations, and of the determinants of innovation. This broader vision allows entrepreneurs to understand what products need to be redesigned, where automation should be used, and what technologies make sense for different activities. The major challenges for entrepreneurial companies are summed up by the fear of change and the use of new technologies, the lack of support from information technology, the lack of awareness of the value of digital solutions, and the change brought by these technologies. The author's past research suggests that innovation in technology capabilities, networking, social capabilities, and the capabilities for learning and development should be the priorities for sustainable business development and competitive advantage Entrepreneurs, or pioneers of the new business world, are considered main actors for industrial innovation growth and they contribute to the development of digital entrepreneurship and contribute to the increase of global competitiveness.","Buzatu, Alexandru Ilie;Dinu, Alexandra Cristina;Costache, Cristian Iulian;Tohǎnean, Dragoş",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2020-01-01,Bucharest University of Economic Studies,Business automation ;  Competitive advantage ;  Digital transformation ;  Innovative entrepreneurial businesses ;  International development ;  Sustainability
Literature review: Impact assessment of research and technology organizations,"Due to their ability to bridge the gap between knowledge created by basic research and market requirements, Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) play a major role in countries' innovation systems. Their R&D results should lead to innovations, which in turn generate the economic output of public investment in research and development. Moreover, they should support the foundation of new companies and industrial innovations. Given the continuing pressures of growing challenges, such as the digital transformation with its significant impact on organizations of all sectors, the changing behavior of customers and the rise of new business models, there is a higher demand for evaluating the actual contribution of RTOs in national innovation systems. It becomes essential for policy makers to gain a transparent insight into relevant and comprehensive performance metrics showing the impact of RTOs from a micro- and macroeconomic perspective. This is complemented by the increase of interest and funding in research and innovation in both public and private sectors. Governments and other clients seek to determine the value of their investments in applied R&D. Simply stating assumptions of achieving a positive impact is not enough anymore, RTOs must provide robust evidence that this impact is actually being accomplished by their research and innovation activities. Yet, the definition of impact and its operationalization in specific performance indicators seem to differ across literature. Against this background, this contribution aims to review impact assessment studies to address the challenge of a missing standard of impact assessment methods for RTOs. Therefore, existing impact studies of RTOs are to be analyzed and compared according to their overall approaches, frameworks and metrics. Therewith, possible limitations among the different assessment strands will be identified. Moreover, further methodological development possibilities for the impact assessment of RTOs will be discussed.","Kidschun, Florian;Hecklau, Fabian;Kohl, Holger;Sarikaya, Berrak",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2020-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK,Impact Assessment ;  Innovation Measurement ;  Innovation Performance ;  Performance Measurement ;  Research & Technology Organizations
OMiLAB: A Smart Innovation Environment for Digital Engineers,"This position paper introduces a Smart Innovation Environment for experimentation related to digital transformation projects, for the consolidation of a proposed “Digital Engineer” skill profile (with a business-oriented facet labelled as “Digital Innovator”). In the Internet of Things era, this profile implies the ability to perform both digital design and engineering activities, to semantically bridge multiple layers of abstraction and specificity – from business analysis down to cyber-physical engineering. In the paper’s proposal, this integration is enabled by conceptual modelling methods and interoperable modelling tools, tailored to support the creation of Digital Twins for innovative digital business models. The architecture of the proposed environment is guided by a Design Research perspective – i.e., it is a treatment to an education “design problem” regarding the Digital Engineer skill profile in the IoT era. The proposed environment encompasses workspaces and toolkits are currently evaluated in “innovation corners” deployed across the OMiLAB ecosystem.","Karagiannis, Dimitris;Buchmann, Robert Andrei;Boucher, Xavier;Cavalieri, Sergio;Florea, Adrian;Kiritsis, Dimitris;Lee, Moonkun",Book Series,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2020-01-01,Université Clermont Auvergne;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Universität Wien;Universitatea Babeș-Bolyai;Universitatea Lucian Blaga din Sibiu;Università degli Studi di Bergamo;Jeonbuk National University,Agile Modelling Method Engineering ;  Cyber-Physical systems ;  Digital Engineer ;  Digital Innovator ;  Digital Twin ;  OMiLAB

Student-Centered Graduate STEM Education Integrated by Computing: An Insight into the Experiences and Expectations of Doctoral Students,"Graduate education system is in the process of ongoing changes driven by the employers’ requirements, ongoing demographic changes, changes in students’ career expectations and the new vision of a wider scientific enterprise. There is a need to refocus graduate educational system from the needs of the academic institution and related research towards student-centered paradigm. The purpose of this research is to analyze the practice of STEM doctoral studies from the student-centered perspective by examining a case practice from a doctoral educational event. The paper deals with the questions whether the aims and expectations of graduate students are consistent with the goals and requirements of academics (researchers and teaching staff of higher education) and to what extent; what aspects of academic policy and pedagogical approaches correspond to the needs and requirements of the non-academic and innovative industries; and how the students understand their career prospects in terms of innovation, future job requirements, and knowledge-based entrepreneurship requests. In order to address this problem, a case study was conducted in four dimensions: academia, pedagogy, industry and entrepreneurship. As a result, a qualitative study provided several implications for organizations preparing future researchers and employees. The results show which students’ needs, challenges and problems and relevant requirements for academic institutions are related to the prospects of STEM education with an emphasis on computing (computer science) and software engineering as an integrating part.","Dolgopolovas, Vladimiras;Dagienė, Valentina;Jevsikova, Tatjana",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,Vilniaus Universitetas,Doctoral education ;  STEM education ;  Student-centered education
Research on Multi-disciplinary Museum Lighting Design’s Emotional Response to Visitors: A Case Study of Dalian Modern Museum,"The main research direction of this article is to explore the artificial lighting of the museum emotionally by adopting the innovative thinking and design methods of multidisciplinary cross integration. Three main innovations are proposed. 1. The theory of tourists’ demand and space is analyzed. 2. We use creative thinking to answer the relationship between optical engineering and the time that tourists stay in the exhibition area. 3. Interactive formulas are used to quantify emotions. This experiment takes the Dalian Modern Museum as the research object. Firstly, for the space division of the museum and the tour route, we analyzed and discussed it according to the needs of tourists and the size of the exhibition space. Under a certain space size condition, the illuminance, color temperature and color rendering index were measured and then we collated and analyzed the data obtained. Under different light environment conditions, we obtained the relationship between the R9, Rf and Rg values in the color rendering index and the residence time of visitors in the exhibition area. Finally, the factor analysis method is used to analyze the experimental data. This experiment provides theoretical support for the emotional design of artificial lighting, and has creative thinking and research significance.","Zhu, Dan;Wang, Zhisheng;Nagai, Yukari;Zhang, Cong;Gao, Haiwen;Zou, Nianyu",Book Series,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",2020-01-01,Dalian Polytechnic University;Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,Artificial lighting design ;  Creativity ;  Emotional response level

Cancer T-cell therapy: Building the foundation for a cure,"T-cell cancer therapy is a clinical field flush with opportunity. It is part of the revolution in immuno-oncology, most apparent in the dramatic clinical success of PD-1/CTLA-4 antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts) to cure certain melanomas and lymphomas, respectively. Therapeutics based on T cells ultimately hold more promise because of their capacity to carry out complex behaviors and their ease of modification via genetic engineering. But to overcome the substantial obstacles of effective solid-tumor treatment, T-cell therapy must access novel molecular targets or exploit existing ones in new ways. As always, tumor selectivity is the key. T-cell therapy has the potential to address target opportunities afforded by its own unique capacity for signal integration and high sensitivity. With a history of breathtaking innovation, the scientific foundation for the cellular modality has often been bypassed in favor of rapid advance in the clinic. This situation is changing, as the mechanistic basis for activity of CAR-Ts and TCR-Ts is backfilled by painstaking, systematic experiments-harking back to last century's evolution and maturation of the small-molecule drug discovery field. We believe this trend must continue for T-cell therapy to reach its enormous potential. We support an approach that integrates sound reductionist scientific principles with well-informed, thorough preclinical and translational clinical experiments.","Kamb, Alexander;Go, William Y.",Journal,F1000Research,2020-01-01,A2 Biotherapeutics,Cancer ;  CAR ;  Clinical translation ;  Innovation ;  Mechanism of action ;  TCR
Social entrepreneurship competency: an approach by discipline and gender,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze how university men and women in different disciplines of study in Mexico perceive social entrepreneurship competencies, using a multifactorial analysis to find possible areas of opportunity to reduce the gender gap in social-entrepreneurship-project proposals. Design/methodology/approach: This is a quantitative study with a validated questionnaire that records the perception levels of five social entrepreneurship subcompetencies. The survey, which includes 28 indicators, was applied to 140 university students from different disciplines. Hypothesis testing was applied to identify significant differences between men and women in each subcompetency by disciplinary area. Findings: In the global sample, significant differences by gender were observed only in the social value subcompetency. In the disciplinary analysis, significant differences were found in architecture and design, business, and engineering and science. Research limitations/implications: The questionnaire only gathered data about the students' perceptions. To the extent that perception is triangulated with other instruments, it is possible to increase knowledge regarding how to train in social entrepreneurship. Practical implications: The results can be useful for university training and increasing the envisioning and formulating of government projects by young people who create new businesses. Originality/value: This research contributes to the literature on the role of gender-specific perceptions of social entrepreneurship in Mexico.","Vázquez-Parra, José Carlos;García-González, Abel;Ramírez-Montoya, María Soledad",Journal,Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education,2020-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Competencies ;  Disciplines ;  Educational innovation ;  Gender ;  Higher education ;  Hypothesis testing ;  Social entrepreneurship
Cooperation and novelty innovation: a study for Argentina,"Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the influence of cooperation on the degree of novelty of technological innovations introduced by industrial firms in Argentina. This influence is analysed from three perspectives: cooperation by partner type [business partners or scientific and technological centres (S&T) partners]; cooperation by number of partner types, from no cooperation to cooperation with two partner types; and cooperation by goals pursued by firms. Design/methodology/approach: The data come from one of the last national innovation surveys conducted in Argentina. The study controls for endogeneity, using instrumental variable procedures within the conditional mixed-process (CMP) framework. Findings: The main result is the influence of cooperation with universities and S&T centres on the introduction of more novel innovations, which was found both in estimations with and without endogeneity correction. This influence was verified for more complex goals (R&D, technology transfer and industrial design and engineering) as well as for less complex ones (tests and trials, human resources training, quality management and certification). Business cooperation seems to impact only on a lower degree of novelty for more complex goals. The increase in the number of partners that the firm cooperates with, from no cooperation to joint cooperation with two partner types, influences more novel innovations. Research limitations/implications: Limitations and proposals for future research are discussed at the end of the study. Practical implications: The results of this study contrast with the high propensity to cooperate with business partners shown by firms in Argentina and other Latin American countries. Therefore, this paper may help formulate more effective policies to promote cooperation conducive to firm innovation performance. Limitations and proposals for future research are discussed at the end of the study. Originality/value: Although there is empirical evidence on this topic for developed countries, firm-level studies on cooperation and degree of novelty are scarce for Latin America. In addition, this paper analyses cooperation not only by type of partner but also by type of goal. This study attempted to control for endogeneity by using instrumental variables within the CMP framework.","Pasciaroni, Carolina;Barbero, Andrea",Journal,Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,2020-01-01,Universidad Nacional del Sur;Instituto de Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales del Sur,Argentina ;  Conditional mixed-process framework ;  Cooperation partners and goals ;  Instrumental variables for endogenous regressors ;  Novelty degree ;  Product and process innovation
A Turn to Smart Contracts and Future Applications towards Construction Innovation: A Hybrid-Metric Review,"Research into smart contracts (SC) over the past decade has increased substantially, with colossal efforts stemming from the computer science and engineering domains. As SC remains a relatively new research paradigm for many areas, efforts from the construction management (CM) field has not been noted yet. This study examines the SC research trend right from the publication on the subject matter until 2018. It focuses on the longitudinal examination of SC research in terms of subject area concentration, and countries, contributions towards SC research and the key sources of SC research. The study also attempts to investigate the efforts made by construction management researchers towards the exploration and application of SC in construction management processes. A comprehensive bibliometric search of SC documents generated a search result of 1,002 publications. A total of 182 publications were examined since only peer-reviewed journal papers were considered for this review study. 2018 recorded the highest number of publications (over 400% increase of the previous year, 2017). China, the U.S., and the U.K. have been the leading countries contributing immensely towards SC research. Despite the tremendous efforts over the past decade of SC research, the results show a significant lack of interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers. Moreover, a huge gap of SC research in construction/project management-related domains was identified, revealing the need for critical explorations on SC research and the applicability of SC during the planning, procuring, executing, and managing construction project-related processes. This study is, therefore, intended to incite a deeper engagement in SC research from construction management (CM) researchers, identifying the benefits and challenges of the application of SC systems in CM processes. Thus, contributing to a deepened understanding of SC in CM.","Owusu, Emmanuel Kingsford;Chan, Albert P.C.;Nani, Gabriel;Agymang, Daniel Y.",Conference Proceeding,Construction Research Congress 2020: Computer Applications - Selected Papers from the Construction Research Congress 2020,2020-01-01,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Blockchain Technology ;  Construction Management ;  Innovation ;  Smart Contracts

Synergistic use of private and governmental resources in Science Technology and Innovation to leverage industrial development: A proven model of success with ten years of excellent learning experiences,"This document describes how a group of researchers concerned about financing high impact graduate level engineering projects and attract top talents to work in solving them, founded in 2008 the “Industrial Consortium to Foster Applied Research and Enhance Regional Economic Growth in México”. This program, after running for ten years, was able to graduate 85 Masters and 5 PhDs students who worked in projects provided by twelve industrial companies and were mentored by faculty and leading industrial engineers. Most of these new graduate are now happily working, in Mexico, at the companies that supported their research projects. To make this program sustainable for the school of engineering, the companies were requested to financially support the program. At the end of the first 10th years of running the program the amount of money received from the industrial sector, and eventually from the Mexican Government, was in the order of five million dollars. With this financial support the program was able to convene top Mexican talents, independently of their own economic resources, to pursue graduate studies and provide innovative solutions to the specific engineering projects proposed by the industrial sector. Furthermore, a good percentage of these graduate students were able to publish their research work in international journals and conferences. The program also proved to be an excellent tool for talent retention, enhance industrial research and foster high tech continuous education at the participant industrial companies. With the aim to help other researchers to replicate this experience, this document present the main steps and barriers encountered during the first ten years of experience of this program and leaves opened several aspects that can be improved in any future replication.","Micheloud, Osvaldo;Viramontes, Federico;Llamas, Armando;Montesinos, Alejandro;Escobar, Gerardo;Mayo, Jonathan;Valdez, Jesús;Guillén, Daniel",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the LACCEI international Multi-conference for Engineering, Education and Technology",2020-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,"""Higher Education"" ;  Industrial consortium to foster applied research ;  Innovation to leverage industrial development ;  Talent retention in developing regions ;  “Educational Innovation"""

"Virtual reality, innovation and linking in the training of engineers for the susutainable management of water","Water is at the epicenter of sustainable development, it is fundamental for socioeconomic development, energy, food production, healthy ecosystems and the survival of humans. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 1.8 billion people are supplied by feces-contaminated water sources. In Mexico, inorganic arsenic is present in the vital liquid destined for human consumption, in crops, food, as well as in the groundwater of the national territory. World water demand, due to population indexes, has increased 55% between 2000 and 2050. By then, it calculates that more than 40% of the population may be in conditions of scarcity. According to the World Bank, 50,000 million m3 are lost due to leaks. Water is a matter of rights and one of the great challenges is to guarantee its effective availability (frequency of supply) and quality (potable) in homes in rural and indigenous communities.In order to strengthen the competences and fructify the potential of engineering students, the Tecnológico de Monterrey promotes the use of new technologies for the construction of innovative solutions to this problem, as well as the link with vulnerable communities and the government, through the implementation of these proposals. The results demonstrate the development of disciplinary and transversal competences with the methodology proposed in this research.","Toriz, E. G.;García, A. D.G.;Aparicio, M.

Play MINT - Still playing or already leading? design of a digital learning game to promote female STEM students' innovative work behavior and digital leadership,"Although the proportion of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professions has increased significantly in recent years, they are still striking underrepresented in study programs and companies of the STEM area. Moreover, women only occupy 21% of STEM leadership positions in Germany. These numbers underline a serious gender gap in the STEM field. To address this gender gap and benefit from the work and innovation potential of STEM women for companies in times of the digital disruption, we develop the competency-based learning game PlayMINT. PlayMINT intends to stimulate interest in and prepare female students for STEM beyond study programs to encourage women to start STEM careers and to promote them into STEM leadership positions. Based on existing research in leadership and management, we design PlayMINT with the goal of teaching concepts and competencies, which are relevant to leadership, innovation, and digital transformation. Our assumptions underlying PlayMINT are that creative self-efficacy, effective interpersonal communication, and general business knowledge are predictors for higher innovative work behavior in the STEM area and that empowering, envisioning, and general business knowledge promote digital leadership. PlayMINT aims to realize these suggestions for female STEM students, in particular from computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, because these fields show the most pervasive gender gap within the STEM fields. PlayMINT leads participants through the innovation process in a robot company by playing the role of a female engineer. Her mission is to implement a medical robot for spinal surgeries as a new business idea. PlayMINT will provide valuable contributions to STEM study programs, to STEM companies, and society in general.","Hagerer, Ilse;Treffers, Theresa;Hoffmann, Antonia;Richly, Carolin;Baier, Stephan;Welpe, Isabell Melanie",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning,2020-01-01,Privatuniversität Schloss Seeburg;Technische Universität München,Competency-based learning game ;  Digital leadership ;  Gender gap ;  Innovative work behavior ;  serious game ;  STEM

A Text Mining Approach to Extract and Rank Innovation Insights from Research Projects,"Open innovation is a new paradigm embraced by companies to introduce transformations. It assumes that firms can and should use external and internal ideas to innovate. Recently, commercial and research projects have undergone an exponential growth, leading the open challenge of identifying possible insights on interesting aspects to work on. The existing literature has focused on the identification of goals, topics, and keywords in a single piece of text. However, insights do not have a clear structure and cannot be validated by comparing them with a straightforward ground truth, thus making their identification particularly challenging. Besides the extraction of insights from previously existing initiatives, the issue of how to present them to a company in a ranking also emerges. To overcome these two issues, we present an approach that extracts insights from a large number of projects belonging to distinct domains, by analyzing their abstract. Then, our method is able to rank these results, to support project preparation, by presenting first the most relevant and timely/recent insights. Our evaluation on real data coming from all the Horizon 2020 European projects, shows the effectiveness of our approach in a concrete case study.","Malloci, Francesca Maridina;Penadés, Laura Portell;Boratto, Ludovico;Fenu, Gianni",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,"Eurecat, Technology Centre of Catalonia;Università degli Studi di Cagliari",Information extraction ;  Ranking ;  Text mining

The role of idea fluency and timing on highly innovative design concepts,"Ongoing work within the engineering design research community seeks to develop automated design methods and tools that enhance the natural capabilities of designers in developing highly innovative concepts. Central to this vision is the ability to first obtain a deep understanding of the underlying behavior and process dynamics that predict successful performance in earlystage concept generation. The objective of this research is to better understand the predictive factors that lead to improved performance during concept generation. In particular, this work focuses on the impact of idea fluency and timing of early-stage design concepts, and their effect on overall measures of ideation session success. To accomplish this, we leverage an existing large-scale dataset containing hundreds of early-stage design concepts; each concept contains detailed ratings regarding its overall feasibility, usefulness, and novelty, as well as the completion time of each idea. Surprisingly, results indicate that there is no effect of idea fluency or timing on the quality of the output when using a holistic evaluation mechanism, such as the innovation measure, instead of a single measure such as novelty. Thus, exceptional concepts can be achieved by all generator segments independent of idea fluency. Furthermore, in earlystage concept generation sessions, highest-rated concepts have an equal probability of occurring early and late in a session. Taken together, these findings can be used to improve performance in ideation by effectively determining when and which types of design interventions future design tools might suggest.","Mirabito, Yakira;Goucher-Lambert, Kosa",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2020-01-01,Department of Mechanical Engineering,
Deconstruction of idea generation methods into a framework of creativity mechanisms,"Creative ideas are a central part of solving engineering problems, generating interesting art, as well as developing successful products and innovations. Idea generation methods are a well-researched topic. Specifically, there is significant research that focuses on specific idea generation methods and how they perform. Further, some method classifications have been suggested to help understand the cognitive mechanisms involved in creative ideation as well as the differences between methods. Yet, the discourse is usually on which ideation method outperforms another or how to improve an ideation method rather than the elements, rules, constraints, and activities that comprise ideation methods. In this study 76 well-documented idea generation methods are reviewed and analyzed. We find all analyzed methods consist of 25 mechanisms. The mechanisms are discussed and classified into idea promoting and implementation mechanisms. We suggest that rather than focusing research only on methods, there should be a parallel track of research creating understanding on these mechanisms and their interactions to help increase our understanding of creativity methods, add practitioners understanding on how to get the best advantages out of creativity methods and lastly improve the way practical creativity is approached in education.","Kirjavainen, Senni;Hölttä-Otto, Katja",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference,2020-01-01,Aalto University,Creativity ;  Design methodology ;  Idea generation ;  Problem solving
LI-AR: An integration of technology and ABA methodology to improve communicative behavior in autism,"Previous research on the relative benefits of Speech Generating Device (SGD) as Augmentative and Alternative Communication Systems (AACs) has indicated controversial results regarding the effectiveness on improving communication skills and vocal production and on decreasing problem behaviors for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The Language Interface for AAC Rehabilitation (LI-AR), is a new type of SGD. Its software creates innovations for teaching social interaction skills. Unlike the most popular SGDs, during the training with LI-AR, the vocal output is fully managed by a communication partner/ therapist. The software is based on Applied Behavior Analysis methodology, and it allows to personalize teaching procedure in an automated way. The study presents the changes in communication skills and speech production reached by a child with ASD, after the LI-AR training. Results show a significant increase in communicative behaviors and a statistically significant improvement in the quality of speech production.","Simeoli, Roberta;Iovino, Luigi;Rega, Angelo;Marocco, Davide",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2020-01-01,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II;Neapolisanit S.R.L.

Experience in the use of mobile technologies as a physics learning method,"Swift changes in society, related to sciences technicians' development, technologies, by the increase of general volume of information, pull out new requirements for maintenance, structure, and quality of education. It requires teachers to diversify a tool in the direction of the increase in possibilities of the use of mobile technologies and computer systems. Lately in the world, more attention spared to the use of mobile learning, which in obedience to «Recommendations of UNESCO on the questions of a policy in the area of mobile learning» foresees the use of mobile technology, both separate and together with other by informational computer technologies. [1]. Mobile learning allows using the open informational systems, global educational networks, unique digital resources which belong to different educational establishments and co-operate with each other. The use of existent educational resources and creation of own, based on the academic resources from informative space, allows to promote the interest of students to the study of physics, to take into account the individual features, and also features of region and framework of society of the country. During the last years in Ukraine competency-based approach to the organization of studies certainly one of basic. The new Education Act addresses the key competencies that every modern person needs for a successful life, including mathematical competence; competence in natural sciences, engineering, and technology; innovation; information and communication competence [2]. This further emphasizes the importance of providing students with quality physical education and the problems associated with it. Using mobile technology in professional teaching work, the teacher has the opportunity to implement the basic principles of the competence approach in teaching physics. An analysis of the data provided in the official reports of the Ukrainian Center for Educational Quality Assessment showed that the number of students making an external independent assessment in physics and choosing a future profession related to physics has decreased significantly. This is due to the loss of students' interest in physics and the complexity of the content of the subject, as well as the increase in the amount of information that students need to absorb. In this article, we explore the possibilities of mobile technology as a means of teaching physics students and give our own experience of using mobile technology in the process of teaching physics (for example, the optics section in primary school).","Goncharenko, Tetiana;Yermakova-Cherchenko, Nataliia;Anedchenko, Yelyzaveta",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2020-01-01,Kherson State University,Curriculum ;  Informational computer technologies (ICT) ;  Learning method ;  Mobile applications ;  Mobile learning ;  Mobile technologies ;  Physics
Industry development of derivative functionalized gold nanomaterials and their application in chemiluminescence bioanalysis: Based on the industrial practice of China's central Yunnan urban agglomeration,"Electrochemiluminescence biosensor is an analytical method combining electrochemiluminescence technology with biosensor. Using nanomaterials as electrochemical luminescence sensor platform can not only immobilize a large number of biomolecules but also improve the performance of the sensor to realize the supersensitive detection of biomacromolecules. Although these methods have high sensitivity for bioanalysis, there are still some shortcomings which limit the practical application. Therefore, this paper discusses the development of functional gold nanomaterials industry and its application in chemiluminescence bioanalysis. In this paper, two methods of synthesizing luminescent functional gold nanomaterials at room temperature were studied by using chemiluminescent reagents as reducing agent and protective agent. Based on luminescent functionalized gold nanoparticles, immunoassay and DNA bioanalysis probes were constructed, and their applications in chemiluminescence and electrochemiluminescence bioanalysis were discussed. Finally, the simulation results show that the relative deviation between the experimental results and the existing clinical methods is less than 17%. The sensor has good stability and selectivity and can be used for the determination of CEA in human serum. The gold nanomaterials synthesized by further research have excellent chemiluminescence activity and can be used to label biomolecules and prepare biological probes. This article aims to explore the application of chemical methods in the transformation of new industries, to achieve breakthroughs in new products in industrial innovation, and to achieve the cross-fusion of management science and engineering disciplines and chemical disciplines. The industrial development of derivative functionalized gold nanomaterials has broad application prospects in biological analysis.","Ma, Tengfei;Wu, Hao",Journal,Journal of Chemistry,2020-01-01,Kunming University of Science and Technology,
The impact of transdisciplinarity on solving complex engineering problems in an ethnically diverse classroom,"This paper studies a transdisciplinary (TD) research approach to undergraduate engineering education to examine alternative learning and consequently, to improve STEM learning outcomes. A paradigm shift in engineering education is required in response to job market uncertainties to mitigate unemployment and prepare students to tackle problems requiring TD knowledge, methods, tools, skills, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discoveries and innovations. The expected results of TD research and education are an emphasis on teamwork; collaboration; bringing together diverse science and engineering disciplines; developing and sharing concepts, methodologies, and tools; to solve complex scientific and engineering problems. The objective of this study is twofold, first to assess the impact of the TD pedagogical approach on the learning outcomes of the ethnic minority students, second to implement and practice Collective Intelligence Management Workshop (CIMW) supported by Transdisciplinary Design Studio (TD2S) for Collaborative Research and Education (CORE).","Gulbulak, Utku;Ertas, Atila;Cordell, Mckenzie",Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2020-01-01,Edward E.

Social-driven propagation of active learning and associated scholarship activity in engineering: A case study,"This research describes a pilot program for propagating active learning within engineering education starting with a group of nine interested instructors from two departments. The first and second authors served as the discipline-based coaches for these instructors, and the propagation program involved community discussions, one-on-one coaching, classroom observation, assessment of student perspectives, and feedback to and follow-up with the instructors. This approach aligned with the professional development and coaching literature as well as emergent change strategies identified by Henderson and colleagues. This work is important because STEM education has not generally taken a research-based approach to dissemination of pedagogical innovations, and research on sustained change is only in its early stages. Using a case study approach involving instructor interviews, documentary data (i.e., discussion notes), and classroom observation, the program was assessed based upon instructor participation and accomplishments (including scholarship of teaching and learning activities), plans for continued active-learning use, and valuation. Of the nine initial instructors, seven participated in the one-year program until the end, including three who also engaged in scholarship of teaching and learning. All seven used active learning, as confirmed by observation or interview. Based on their interviews, instructors identified the program's ''people'' focus, in particular one-on-one coaching and community discussions, as strengths of the program, as supported by the coaching literature. A finding of this research is that benefits were achieved despite non-ideal levels of instructor participation in all program aspects. The goal is to share an implementation and assessment approach with other educators considering relationship-driven, emergent strategies for adoption or expansion of active learning.","Clark, Renee M.;Dickerson, Samuel;Bedewy, Mostafa;Chen, Kevin P.;Dallal, Ahmed;Gomez, Andres;Hu, Jingtong;Kerestes, Robert;Luangkesorn, Louis",Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2020-01-01,University of Pittsburgh,Active learning ;  Coach ;  Educational scholarship ;  Engineering education ;  Instructional change ;  Propagation
Recent developments in remote inspections of ship structures,"In recent years robotics has become an important resource in engineering. Adoption of Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) in activities related to ship inspections has obvious potential advantages, but also arises particular challenges, both from technical and legal viewpoints. The ROBINS project (ROBotics technology for INspection of Ships) is a collaborative project co-funded within the H2020 EU Research and Innovation programme call, aimed at filling the gap between current ship inspections approach and available robotic technology, both from technological and regulatory point of view. Main goal of the present work is to highlight how ship inspections are currently carried out by humans, how they could be improved using RAS, even if not completely autonomous for the time being, at least in selected operational scenarios and how the performances of RAS platforms can be tested to assess their effectiveness in carrying out surveys onboard. In such a framework, a testing facility aimed at assessing RAS’ capabilities as well as providing suitable environment for their development has been built and it is still under development along with dedicated testing protocols, able to assess the equivalence between human and RAS inspection of ship and marine structures. The features of a testing facility where RAS can be tested and the testing protocols are presented, showing how technological and regulatory gaps are filled.","Poggi, Laura;Gaggero, Tomaso;Gaiotti, Marco;Ravina, Enrico;Rizzo, Cesare Mario",Journal,International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering,2020-01-01,Università degli Studi di Genova,Robotics and autonomous systems ;  Ship surveys ;  Test protocols ;  Testing facility
Exploring the link between uncertainty and project activities in new product development,"Uncertainty is central to engineering design and new product development (NPD). While there has been substantial focus on dealing with uncertainty in technical systems and design information, how engineering designers react to and manage uncertainty is also critical to performance. However, an important gap remains in understanding what activities NPD teams engage in based on the specific uncertainty types they face. This gap is investigated via a conceptual framework detailing four uncertainty types (technical, organisational, resource and market) and three project activities (information, knowledge sharing and representation). Evidence is presented from two engineering design cases with 45 interviews, observations, and secondary data. Based on this, specific links are described between uncertainty type and project activity as follows: technical uncertainty drove representation activity, organisational uncertainty drove knowledge sharing activity, resource uncertainty drove knowledge sharing activity, and market uncertainty drove information activity. These findings are developed into a number of propositional relationships between the four uncertainty types and specific project activities, which form the basis for a number of implications for engineering design research and practice.","Lasso, Sarah;Kreye, Melanie;Daalhuizen, Jaap;Cash, Philip",Journal,Journal of Engineering Design,2020-01-01,Technical University of Denmark,case study ;  new product development ;  product innovation ;  project activity ;  Uncertainty

Retrospective investigation of flexibility and their factors in additive manufacturing systems,"Additive manufacturing (AM) systems provide extensive flexibility by enabling improved product design, customisation and part printing. There is a need to understand these flexibilities and identify the respective factors of each of them, and further identify the relative importance of these flexibilities and their associated factors. The extensive literature review has helped in identifying the significant flexibilities and their associated factors. This research categorises the AM flexibility into seven significant types. These flexibilities are found to play a significant role in implementing AM in industries for achieving enhanced performance. Ranking of these flexibilities and their factors is accomplished using analytical hierarchical process (AHP) by taking the help of experts opinion. AM provides flexibility which can be appropriately used to support different types of organisations. The limitation of the paper is that the view of experts may not always be free from bias, and the technology is evolving. Industries use these flexibilities in customisation, product design and development, reverse engineering and innovation of products.","Haleem, Abid;Javaid, Mohd;Khan, Shahbaz;Khan, Mohd Imran",Journal,International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering,2020-01-01,Jamia Millia Islamia,3D printing ;  3D scanning ;  Additive manufacturing ;  AHP ;  AM ;  Analytical hierarchical process ;  Flexibility ;  Product design ;  Rapid prototyping ;  RP.
Reforms and innovations in a nuclear engineering course: Nuclear power plant systems and equipment,"The Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan caused a significant impact on the nuclear power industry and public attitudes towards nuclear energy. The decreased public acceptance and the regulatory authorities' stricter requirements of nuclear safety lead to the popularity of advanced safety technologies in scientific research and engineering projects. The demand for highly qualified human resources increases by the gradual recovery of the nuclear power field in China. In order to meet this demand, a series of course innovations are taken at Tsinghua University. Focusing on the course ""Nuclear Power Plant Systems and Equipment,"" the paper discusses the innovations of the course stimulated by the current industry trends and demands. A brief introduction to the special commissioned-student program at Tsinghua University is given. The paper investigates the meaning and function of the course in the frame of the curriculum plan for nuclear engineering students at Tsinghua University. The personal career plan, the industry outlook, and even the public attitudes contribute to senior students' attitudes and demands for the course, which is tied closely to the effect of teaching. The paper addresses that the objective of the innovations is to develop a course fixing different students' demands and help them build their ability to solve practical engineering problems in their future professional careers. The selection of teaching contents and the teaching strategy are discussed. This course takes Westinghouse AP1000 as the major point. And the nuclear power plant systems are taught in a divided way. One is the operation system, and the other is the safety system. This separation is based on the different functions and roles of these two parts and could have advantages in teaching effect. The paper explains the critical points of the systems and innovations of how to deal with course difficulties. There is a corresponding part of the safety system, and this part gets more challenges due to the industry trends. Lectures, group discussions, homework, and presentation projects are discussed. Besides, the paper considers possible efforts for further development of nuclear engineering courses.","Huang, Shanfang;Wang, Jiageng;Hao, Yisheng;Liu, Guodong;Liu, Minyun;Ma, Yugao",Conference Proceeding,"International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, Proceedings, ICONE",2020-01-01,Tsinghua University,Course Innovation ;  NPP Operation System ;  Nuclear Education ;  Safety System ;  Teaching Method
Design as a catalyst: A pedagogical framework,"There is an increasing interest in the design and creative thinking process in the Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and health education disciplines. Many new degree programmes are integrating design thinking into their syllabi. The idea was to bring creative problem-solving culture in these disciplines. The exposure these students get is minimal, and it does not provide enough foundation for them to use the knowledge in a real-life situation. There is an increased awareness for the importance of design thinking in the innovative process and more and more STEM, business and health establishments are embedding trained designers into their research teams. Yet many designers are not equipped to work in interdisciplinary teams. Design students tend to approach problems in a more intuitive and opportunistic manner whereas STEM and health disciplines approaches are often more algorithmic and systematic. In interdisciplinary teams, this often creates tension. In this paper, we share the outcome of a phenomenological study on a high functioning interdisciplinary team working on a health innovation project focused on aging with a disability. The project is used as a case study to illustrate the skill set needed for a designer to make a significant contribution to its overall outcome. Utilising the Belbin team role, we identified key attributes that are essential for a designer to become an effective member in interdisciplinary teams. Based on this study, we propose changes to current design pedagogy framework to better equip design students to work in interdisciplinary teams.","Gudur, Raghavendra;McDONAGH, Deana;Harris, Maurita;Rogers, Wendy",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2020",2020-01-01,University of Canberra;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,design education ;  design research ;  design thinking ;  Interdisciplinary ;  team
Manufacturing and society - A freshman introduction to engineering course with manufacturing and social science partnership,"The curriculum and pedagogy of a freshman introduction to engineering course on manufacturing and society are presented. This course is designed to use the quadcopter drone as an example to teach knowledge in manufacturing processes and systems, illustrate potential impacts of manufacturing to society, and stimulate learning in innovation, teamwork, and communication in a real-world engineering environment. It is also designed to teach students how to best communicate their findings and conclusions. This course is built on two team-based projects. Students practiced and timed the assembly of a state-of-the-art drone, the DJI Spark, and created a mid-term project presentation and report of their plan to setup an assembly plant in Michigan for this drone. Students learned the assembly line design, cycle time balancing, time study, automation, robotics, ergonomics, process capability index, and plant layout. The final project is the design and manufacture of an attachment to a hobby drone, DJI F330, for a mission that will benefit society. Students learned the social-aspects of manufacturing, computer-aided design, additive manufacturing, fabrication skills, and manufacturing processes. Each team identified a societal need, designed an attachment to the DJI F330 drone, reviewed the design with experienced engineers, manufactured components, assembled the attachment, and evaluated them in drone test flights. This course was implemented in close collaboration with a local community college to share the lecture and lab materials as well as pedagogy in manufacturing to benefit the same cohort of high school graduates. This approach of integrated social science, manufacturing, and technical communication to teach manufacturing using drones and connect manufacturing and society were demonstrated to be effective for an introductory freshman engineering course. Freshman engineering students often experience tremendous changes and pressure in their first semester. The lecture, lab, and discussion session for communication were adjusted to help students' transition in their first semester engineering study.","Shih, Albert;Chen, Lei;Webster, Noah;Hogg, Alan",Conference Proceeding,,2020-01-01,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Innovation based pedagogy ;  Manufacturing education ;  Social science
Teaching manufacturing process design as a means for competitive advantage in chemical process industries,"While manufacturing engineering curricula rightly borrows from both industrial engineering and mechanical engineering curricula, there is an increasing awareness in education that manufacturing engineering should be taught as a distinguishable engineering design activity. Doing so recognizes the potential for manufacturing engineering to drive deep sources of competitive advantage in product development through manufacturing innovation. This paper provides details on a pedagogy used to educate chemical engineers, without a background in discrete part manufacturing, about a design-oriented approach to manufacturing process selection, in the context of a four-day educational workshop on advancing chemical process innovations to market. The engineers were taught this manufacturing process design method in the context of designing and innovating chemical reactor components. E-books, in-lab process demonstrations, and spreadsheet cost models were all used as pedagogical tools to teach the method through a sequence of lectures, tutorials/laboratories, and class exercises. Survey results show that the chemical engineering participants scored the segment on selecting manufacturing processes higher than any other innovation segment in the four-day workshop. In-laboratory process demonstrations were scored high suggesting value in exposing chemical engineers to physical manufacturing processes during the workshop.","Summerville, Steven;Coblyn, Matthew;Jovanovic, Goran;Paul, Brian K.",Conference Proceeding,,2020-01-01,Oregon State University;RAPID Institute,Manufacturing engineering pedagogy ;  Manufacturing process design ;  Modular chemical process intensification
"Applications of Graphene and Its Derivatives in Bone Repair: Advantages for Promoting Bone Formation and Providing Real-Time Detection, Challenges and Future Prospects","During continuous innovation in the preparation, characterization and application of various bone repair materials for several decades, nanomaterials have exhibited many unique advantages. As a kind of representative two-dimensional nanomaterials, graphene and its derivatives (GDs) such as graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide have shown promising potential for the application in bone repair based on their excellent mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, large specific surface area (SSA) and atomic structure stability. Herein, we reviewed the updated application of them in bone repair in order to present, as comprehensively, as possible, their specific advantages, challenges and current solutions. Firstly, how their advantages have been utilized in bone repair materials with improved bone formation ability was discussed. Especially, the effects of further functionalization or modification were emphasized. Then, the signaling pathways involved in GDs-induced osteogenic differentiation of stem cells and immunomodulatory mechanism of GDs-induced bone regeneration were discussed. On the other hand, their applications as contrast agents in the field of bone repair were summarized. In addition, we also reviewed the progress and related principles of the effects of GDs parameters on cytotoxicity and residues. At last, the future research was prospected.","Du, Zhipo;Wang, Cunyang;Zhang, Ruihong;Wang, Xiumei;Li, Xiaoming",Journal,International Journal of Nanomedicine,2020-01-01,Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Ministry of Education;Beihang University;Fourth Central Hospital of Baoding City,bone repair ;  graphene ;  graphene oxide ;  real-time detection ;  signaling pathways

Construction in the platform society: New directions for construction management research,"An emerging aspect of digital transformation in industry relates to the rise of digital platforms. While examples such as Uber and Airbnb are well-known, technological platforms that seek to coordinate demand and supply-side actors in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) sector are also developing. Examples include Wikihouse, Sidewalk Labs, and Bosch IoT Suite. Although there is a growing body of scholarship reviewing the concept of 'platforms', far less attention has been paid to reviewing studies of digital platforms in the AEC sector. This systematic review of 18 studies seeks to address this deficiency. The findings show that the focus has hitherto centred on engineering platforms, with researchers adding greater functionality to platforms in order to yield efficiencies in the production process. Current endeavours tend to be laboratory-based, with prototypes still to be tested in the real-world. In contrast to reviews in management and organisational studies, scholars of platforms in construction do not pay as much attention to the power of platforms as a strategic organising principle for coordinating markets. The review thus proposes a number of possible directions for construction management researchers to examine the strategic potential for platforms to drive competitive advantage in the AEC sector.","Chan, Paul W.",Conference Proceeding,"ARCOM 2020 - Association of Researchers in Construction Management, 36th Annual Conference 2020 - Proceedings",2020-01-01,"Afdeling Management in the Built Environment, TU Delft",Digital platforms ;  Disruptive innovation ;  Strategy ;  Systematic review
CEO Media Exposure and Green Technological Innovation Decision: Evidence from Chinese Polluting Firms,"The upper echelons theory is utilized to establish how CEO's attributes affect firm's technological innovation decisions. The extant literature has largely ignored the impacts of CEO media exposure. An unbalanced panel data analysis is used to examine the effects of CEO media exposure on Chinese polluting firm's green technological innovation. It is illustrated that CEO media exposure generally enhances Chinese polluting firms' green technological innovation decisions. In addition, we find that firms with state ownership and environmental regulations all moderate positively the relationship between CEO media exposure and green technological innovation. The research suggests that CEO media exposure appears to be a stimulus to firm's green technological innovation decisions.","Wang, Chen;Hu, Yuanlin;Zhang, Jianhua;Miao, Chenglin",Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2020-01-01,Kunming University of Science and Technology;Northeast Petroleum University;Business University,
Smart Life Cycle Management of Social Housing Assets,"The social housing sector is submitted to increasing challenges, related to the aging of this sector, from poor quality, degraded life environment, high running expenses, tenants’ low income; as well as reduction of the public funding for this sector and increasing sustainability requirement to reduce both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. To meet these challenges this sector has to innovate both management and operation methods in order to optimization effectiveness in this sector together with the improvement of its performances. This strategy should be based on smart management. This paper proposes a smart life cycle management of social housing assets base on the result of the technology innovation in this sector. It contains both the original and the real-time information of assets, in order to build a smart-knowledge strategy for whole life cycle of asset management to improve the social housing efficiency and quality.

The contribution of the EXCELSIOR project for cultural heritage,"The ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment (ECoE) will provide cutting-edge Earth Observation (EO) research in Cyprus, the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa (EMMENA) region, Europe and Internationally for the benefit of the environment and society. One of the main focus areas of the newly established ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence (ECoE) is using remote sensing and space-based techniques for effective, efficient and timely cultural heritage monitoring. Such monitoring can offer tremendous benefits to Cyprus governmental institutions and policy implementation bodies, towards the protection of cultural heritage sites, including cost- and time-effective control of cultural heritage sites/monuments, raising awareness on the preservation and protection of cultural heritage from anthropogenic and environmental pressures, early warning systems and systematic monitoring of cultural heritage. Satellite Earth Observation technologies provide the ideal resource of information to undertake a wide range of effective, cost-efficient and non-invasive activities, which cannot be so easily acquired with other tools. As a result of the Copernicus Program, Sentinel 1 and 2 missions provide free satellite imagery that is accessible, provides global coverage, a high temporal resolution enabling image time series analysis and temporal characteristics, allowing for the consistent and timely monitoring of cultural heritage monuments and landscapes. The efficient exploitation of high resolution dense time-series of multi-spectral and radar imagery for large scale applications introduces new important considerations including cost-effective and systematic monitoring service of cultural landscape sites with archaeological remains, monitoring significant risks that cultural landscapes face, as well as aiding archaeological mapping and interpretation. Further-on exploiting high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e. from other satellites beyond Copernicus) improves modelling and data assimilation solutions and integration of space based remote sensing techniques with advanced ground and aerial based ones. Both data allows to develop more efficient and effective tools of investigation and monitoring, able to ensure mapping and monitoring of buried and exposed archaeological structures. This paper was developed under the auspices of the activities of the 'ERATOSTHENES: Excellence Research Centre for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment'- 'EXCELSIOR' project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 857510 and from the Government of the Republic of Cyprus through the Directorate General for the European Programmes, Coordination and Development. From 1st of October 2019, the ERC group (Department of Civil Engineering and Geomatics) at the Cyprus University of Technology is on the way to be upgraded to ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence (ECoE) through 'EXCELSIOR' H 2020 Widespread Teaming project (www.excelsior2020.eu).","Themistocleous, K.;Hadjimitsis, D.;Schreier, G.;Krauss, T.;Kontoes, H.",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2020-01-01,Cyprus University of Technology;National Observatory of Athens;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR),Copernicus ;  Cultural heritage ;  Earth Observation ;  EXCELSIOR ;  Remote Sensing
Software architecture and software usability: A comparison of data entry form designing configurable platforms,"The objective of the research was to discuss how software architecture shapes the usability of configurable software in data entry-form design. The research process was conducted in three stages. The first stage focused on usability studies for DHIS2 custom form editor from which empirical data was collected from 11 participants. The second phase centred on experimentation with Sketch2Code and Commcare. The final stage focused on solution prototyping and evaluation. The research found out that usability is enhanced in configurable platforms through the availability of interface elements for achieving desired goals with the platform without the need for writing code and meta-design. Constraining factors to usability include lack of functionality to advance the appearance of interfaces beyond the basic outlook and having predefined functions with limited room for innovation outside the predefined range. The research also found out that software architecture enables software usability by providing mechanisms for cross-platform compatibility with similar applications, provision of boundary resources for further customisation and through meta-design.","Byson, Lawrence Fatsani;Manda, Tiwonge Davis",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2020-01-01,University of Malawi,Configurable Platform ;  Design ;  Software Architecture ;  Usability

An integrated MCGP-U and fuzzy-AHP method for enhancing the competitiveness of Taiwan's forklift industry,"The operation of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is smaller in scope and scale of business that they tend to suffer from financial crises or even bankruptcy when facing an economic downturn [1]. Thus, most research for SMEs today focuses on the formulation and practice of strategies, such as exploring the key success factors and innovation research. Taiwan's forklift industry (TFI) belongs to SMEs that it is indispensable from construction engineering, but the related research has always been lacking to improve their competitiveness and sustainability. We refer to the relevant literature and expert opinions and use the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to verify and rank the 18 factors that affect financial factors in TFI. We summarized these factors into four financial facets, including profits, workforce, holding cost, and stock-out cost. Then, the MCGP-U model is used to find the optimal solution for TFI and Komatsu Forklift Taiwan (KFT). In addition, KFT is taken as an example to ensure decision-makers (DMs) remain KFT in a better financial status and competitive advantages under uncertain business environment. As a result, the MCGP-U model optimizes the four financial facets better than by the rule of thumb in KFT, especially in the holding cost section achieving savings as high as 55.9%. Finally, the model runs fast and provides robust results, which is suitable for SMEs, given the characteristics of lacking experts and funds.","Liu, Feng Lang;Chang, Ching Ter",Journal,Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems,2020-01-01,College of Management;Ming Chi University of Technology;Chang Gung Memorial Hospital;Chang Gung University,Forklift ;  Fuzzy-AHP ;  MCGP-U ;  SMEs
Designing Technology-enhanced Learning Research for sustainable impact: The Learning Layers case,"Research in technology-enhanced Learning (TEL) is often criticized for not leading to sufficient and sustainable impact in practice. This is especially so for workplace learning technology where learning and the use of technology needs to be embedded in working practices. We report on Learning Layers, a TEL project on workplace learning that ran between 2012 and 2016. We have identified three cases where impact on practice is still visible today, as learning technology originally developed in the project is still in use, impacts learning, teaching and working practices in healthcare practices, construction training and in the application of e-posters in academic conferences. We use the cases to identify factors during the lifetime of the project that have facilitated sustainable take up of research results, namely a flexible and collaborative project roll out, an open research process, early focus on end-users and an inclusive process of planning for impact and exploitation. Taken together, these factors suggest to look at research projects as providing flexible and networked co-creation platforms for innovation.","Ley, Tobias;Carder, Paul;Dewey, Rose;Elferink, Raymond;Kämäräinen, Pekka;Müller, Werner;Peffer, Gilbert;Treasure-Jones, Tamsin",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2020-01-01,Tallinna Ülikool;Universität Bremen;NHS England;Independent Researcher and Lecturer;Kubify BV,Co-design ;  Impact ;  R&D projects ;  Research ;  Sustainability ;  Technology-enhanced Learning ;  Workplace Learning

Understanding technology transition: A cross-cultural study on the transition from PCs to tablet computers,"The ongoing developments in information technology have resulted in new technologies as a replacement for those already existing. This has led to users resorting to these new technologies, often in parallel to the existing offerings. These users then later decide whether to switch to the new technologies fully, a phenomenon referred to as the 'technology transition'. In this paper, drawing on theories on social psychology, we present a theoretical model for explaining technology transition from an individual's perspective in two geographies (Germany and India). Based on survey responses in the two geographies, we validate the model and demonstrate the country-specific factors influencing an individual's intention to transition to a tablet computer from a conventional computing device. The investigation of technology transition at the individual level is also a contribution to the cross-cultural stream of research and provides a basis for further inquiry in this field.","Thakurta, Rahul;Urbach, Nils;Basu, Anamitra",Journal,International Journal of Technology Management,2020-01-01,XIM University;Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar;Universität Bayreuth,Digital innovation ;  Human behaviour and IT ;  Tablet computer ;  Technology transition ;  Technology usage

Technological innovation in libraries,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify technological innovation in libraries and further examine the knowledge source and their effects during the technology life cycle (TLC). Design/methodology/approach: This paper discusses the technological innovation taking place in libraries. Patent citation analysis was used to capture the trend of technological innovation associated with libraries. Findings: The findings are as follows: (1) library technologies are now in the ascent phase of their life cycles; (2) private companies from the United States, Germany, France, Japan and the United Kingdom are the top-five owners of intellectual property rights associated with library technology and (3) patent data along with knowledge and technology indicators can be interpreted in the light of library development. The knowledge source with the highest degree of scientific and technological orientation was identified as basic material chemistry. The major technological categories that have received the greatest knowledge effect from library-associated technological innovation are chemistry, electrical engineering, instruments, mechanical engineering, with other fields (civil engineering and furniture, games) being subject to less effect. Research limitations/implications: There are two research limitations in this study. First, the results use single informants, patents retrieved from United States Patent and Trademark Office, as the source of data. Second, this study uses patent citation measures for exploring the knowledge source and effect of technological innovation, these measures are only subjective for those new invention highly based technological advances. This study concludes that technological innovation for libraries will be characterized by an increasing role for science-intensive and interdisciplinary areas. This study also suggests that organizational learning facilitates innovation. Therefore, a library hoping to co-evolve with dynamic environment through technological innovation should improve its organizational learning processes. Practical implications: Theories of technology-push and demand-pull were examined in relation to technological innovation taking place in libraries. The TLC analysis indicated that library technology is mainly in the ascent stage, suggesting that libraries have not achieved the strongest technological transformation. The findings suggest that the importance of demand-pull and technology-push vary over the TLC of libraries. Social implications: To survive in a dynamic environment library must be able to cope with increasing complexity and high-speed technological change. It is pivotal to integrate the views of users (as customers), software houses or design companies (as suppliers) as well as other libraries (as communities) into the sustainable development strategy of a library. In these contexts, libraries with the capacity to innovate will be able to respond to new demands faster and to invent and provide new services better than noninnovative libraries. Originality/value: Analysis based on the technological innovation perspective to identify the future development of libraries is still lacking. This paper seeks to identify the technological innovation employed in libraries to accommodate the 21st century model of information-seeking behavior. This study identifies a variety of factors that have influenced the transformation of library services, and these include technology developments and new demands from library users. To illustrate the driving forces of technology-push in libraries, this paper examines holistic-patented technologies invented for libraries.","Lee, Pei Chun",Journal,Library Hi Tech,2020-01-01,National Chengchi University,Library ;  Patent citation analysis ;  Technological innovation

Advanced nuclear engineering to support space exploration,"With a resurgence of the desire to explore space, this time beyond the moon and earth's orbit, means to travel back and forth at increased speeds is becoming a key challenge to overcome. Leveraging nuclear-based propulsion technologies, initially developed in the 1960s, is a very promising route. However, space R&D programs have not yet taken full advantage of the progress made by the nuclear energy R&D programs over the last few decades. Advanced nuclear energy modeling and simulation tools, allowing higher fidelity and confidence, as well as expert knowledge of the various nuclear reactor technologies could be ideally used to support maturation of traditional and high performance nuclear propulsion technologies, whether thermal or electrical systems. A very high-level description of a few approaches having the potential to enhance NTP and NEP viability has been provided in this document. At this time, these are only conceptual ideas, which first need to be confirmed through using the appropriate modeling and simulation tools, and then demonstrated through an adequate testing program. Coordination between space technology experts and nuclear technology experts has the promise to lead to groundbreaking innovation in the domain of space exploration. Activities ongoing at Argonne can enable that needed outcome.","Heidet, Florent;Momozaki, Yoichi",Conference Proceeding,Transactions of the American Nuclear Society,2020-01-01,Argonne National Laboratory,
Co-design of Augmented Reality Storybooks for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Spectrum of autism is one of the most serious disorders that negatively affect the normal development of the brain. Children with autism usually face different levels of difficulties in communication and practicing essential life skills such as reading due to language delays and intellectual disability. The limitations in manipulating written text as well as understanding it make it challenging for them to read and enjoy storybooks, and here where technology-based interventions can take place. Yohka is an Arabic augmented reality storybook application designed for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their caregivers to enhance their reading experience and communication. It shows a more interactive and animated version of the story that helps the child to understand the story and the interactions between its characters, which make it enjoyable and therapeutic at the same time. The design of reading companions is rapidly growing in the interaction design domains. While the promise of interactive learning technologies has widely been demonstrated and relevant research is proliferating, little is known about how augmented reality applications might play a positive role in this development and the effective design process is not necessarily recognized. This paper describes the collective creative co-design process that was followed in Yohka as a user-centered design project for developing augmented reality application for - and with - children on the autism spectrum and its consequences on the finished application. It discusses the design innovation modules for ASD technologies and the effective role of relevant stakeholders and expert evaluation in achieving high standards while designing such technologies. Children, parents, specialists, and caregivers have been actively involved since early stages of the project as co-designers and have contributed hugely through different ways and mediums that are covered in this paper. Designing with the users through several iterations helps in promoting usability especially for this kind of educational and therapeutic technologies. Design implications and future directions for this work are also discussed.","Alkadhi, Bushra;Alnafisi, Ghadah;Aljowair, Layan;Alotaibi, Leena;Alduaifi, Nouf;Alhumood, Raghad",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,King Saud University;Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Design Lab,Augmented reality ;  Autism Spectrum Disorder ;  Children ;  Co-create ;  Co-design ;  User centered design
"Traditonal knowledge system in disaster risk reducton: Exploraton, acknowledgement and propositon","The last 60 years have witnessed advanced technological innovation for disaster risk reduction (DRR) with the invention of high-resolution satellite imagery, digital cartography and modern engineering building techniques to high-yielding agricultural production. However, none have been highly satisfying in lessening the impact of disasters. The signifcant factor for the limited success of modern scientifc society is that it views the world from a temporal perspective where humans are believed to be an active agent in modifying every natural possibility into opportunity. The very composite environmental system is simplified whilst extracting resources, resulting in resource depletion and environmental degradation, consequently opening the door for disaster. Technocratic science must recognise the need for a relational or holistic approach rather than believing in reductionist approaches alone whilst dealing with natural calamities. In this context, the knowledge of traditional societies is important to fill up the existing gaps created by the modern society. Traditional knowledge has different sets of ingredients to foster the development of the relational or holistic approach as it involves, interacts and interconnects humans, non-humans (animals and plants) and nature together, setting a perfect balance for sustainable development and DRR. It has vast undocumented observational data of changing natural phenomena, and in today’s scenario of climate change and uncertainty, it can create a path for reliable adaptation measures from climate-induced disasters. Thus, a holistic approach is needed for comprehensive DRR measures where both scientific and traditional knowledge systems can work together. The main purpose of this article was to explore the effective ingredients of traditional knowledge in DRR and how this age-old wisdom can be offered a hand to its integration into and collaboration with scientific research and management for DRR. To fulfil the objectives, a theoretical desk study approach was followed by identifying relevant studies, highlighting traditional knowledge in DRR from empirical and grey literatures, archive materials, biblical stories and so on. This research highlights some of the good practices of traditional knowledge in DRR and the possible path of collaboration of two knowledge systems in DRR.","Rai, Pribat;Khawas, Vimal",Journal,Jamba: Journal of Disaster Risk Studies,2020-01-01,Sikkim University,disaster risk management ;  disaster risk reduction ;  indigenous knowledge ;  scientific knowledge ;  traditional knowledge

Country size and technology innovation: A comparative study of countries based on different levels of economic development,"By using the panel vector autoregression (PVAR) model and panel data of 40 countries from 2001 to 2016, this paper empirically studies the influence of country size on technology innovation of developing and developed countries from three dimensions: population size, market size and trade size. The research shows that under the conditions of different development levels, country size plays a huge role in technology innovation. Among them, for the developed countries, the market size plays an important role in promoting their technology innovation, followed by the trade size. For the developing countries, the trade size is the key factor for the promotion of their technology innovation. The market size has little effect and the population size has a negative impact. On this basis, this paper puts forward some suggestions for the large developing countries to promote technology innovation based on the country size.","Chen, Qi;Huang, Wilfred Vincent;Mo, Jiao Jiao",Journal,"International Journal of Technology, Policy and Management",2020-01-01,Hunan University of Finance and Economics;Hunan University of Technology and Business;Alfred University,Country size ;  Different levels of economic development ;  PVAR model ;  Technology innovation
Factors influencing effectiveness of testing applications in cloud using regression testing: A statistical analysis,"The innovation in the field of software engineering and allied technologies has lined the way in software development life cycle through different strategies and approaches. Further, it guides the software testing process to improve upon by adopting the same such that, the effectiveness and efficiency of software testing can be enhanced to a greater level. The emergence of cloud computing has led to many changes in the way IT industry are operating in regard to software testing. Since software testing plays a major role in producing good and outstanding software products with enhanced customer satisfaction index (CSI), it is essential to focus more on defects related factors. Despite several testing techniques, it is proven that regression testing is most popular in all software industries. Hence, this research is contributing towards identifying, measuring and analysing influential factors of regression testing with respect to defects. This paper focuses on empirical investigation through a case study comprising of two testing environments with projects taken from two different domains in order to analyse the factors influences/significant effectiveness of testing. Investigation indicates that testing applications in cloud has added benefit of detecting defects of high severity in addition to other proven benefits of cloud.","Narasimha Murthy, M.

Volumetric origami-based deployable modular space structures with tailorable stiffness,"While the artistic craft of paper-folding, or origami, has existed for millennia, the use of origami for scientific and technological innovation has recently become a rich field of research. For example, origami has been studied in the design of space structures, especially planar structures such as solar panels. However, self-deployable, space-filling origami structures have remained relatively unexplored. These could be important in numerous engineering applications, such as deployable structures for Martian housing units. In this direction, we study the unique kinematics of deployable modular structures composed of origami unit cells. We design a bellows-like polyhedral unit cell based on two common origami folds and construct tessellated modular structures with 3D space-filling capabilities. We call this structure the rigid origami bellows. Its geometric structure allows for the use of rigid materials for construction, and our kinematic analysis shows potential for significant volumetric change. Our static analysis shows potential for tailorable stiffness by altering the geometrical parameters and structural configuration. Based on these unique features, the origami-based modular structure has great potential for constructing deployable space habitats in an efficient manner.","Lynch, James H.;Raney, Jordan R.",Conference Proceeding,AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum,2020-01-01,School of Engineering and Applied Science;University of Pennsylvania,
An explorative approach to deriving future scenarios: A first comparison of the consistency matrix-based and the catalog-based approach to generating future scenarios,"The development of robust products, meaning products that are successful regardless of changes in the future, requires an assessment of possible futures. This makes it possible to adapt to negative and unexpected conditions or circumstances. For this reason, future scenarios are developed that reflect possible futures based on influencing factors and their alternative developments on the product or system. For each factor, multidimensional future projections can be found, which are then evaluated for consistency. Up to now, scenarios have been created using the scenario management approach, which is based on consistency assessment of future projections pairs of key factors, or morphological methods (e.g. field anomaly relaxation). Both approaches are based at least in part on a plausibility check. On the one hand this leads to a high expenditure of time in scenario management, and on the other hand morphological methods consider a limited number of factors, which reduces the future space and thus limits informative value of the scenarios. In this research contribution, an explorative approach to deriving future scenarios is proposed that integrates morphological elements into scenario management. This significantly reduces the time required to generate future scenarios without having to reduce the number of considered key factors. First, the proposed approach is described with a process model. Second, the proposed form of scenario generation, the catalog-based scenario generation, is compared with the previously used approach to scenario generation with regard to advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the suitability for PGE-product generation engineering projects is evaluated, in particular regarding replicability, comprehensibility, effort and the completeness of the described future space. This is done by conducting three structured expert interviews and two case studies. Thereby, scenarios are created with both approaches. The criteria to evaluate the approaches are defined by a panel of experts on PGE.","Marthaler, Florian;Gesk, Johannes Willi;Siebe, Andreas;Albers, Albert",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2020-01-01,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Scenario Management International AG,decision making ;  early phase of product engineering ;  foresight ;  future scenarios ;  innovation method ;  innovation support
Industrial design thinking and innovations propelled by the Royal Academy of Engineering in Sub-Saharan Africa for capacity building,"Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from a persistent shortage of engineering skills required to drive industry in this dynamic era of rapid technological changes. This has been exacerbated by the mismatch of skills produced by universities and those required by industry, partly attributed to lack of access to modern equipment and technology by engineering academics to adequately dispatch appropriate skills to future engineers. A recent audit conducted in Zimbabwe revealed a 62% skills deficit, mainly in the engineering and technology sectors. The University of Zimbabwe, in collaboration with six other institutions of higher learning in Southern Africa embarked on and successfully managed the Enriching Engineering Education Program from 2013 to 2015, financially supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering. This project was aimed at enhancing the quality and relevance of engineering graduates and this was accomplished through secondments of engineering academics to industry to improve their skills and access to modern equipment, knowledge sharing workshops and conferences to boost the quality of research as well as continuous professional development training for engineering academics and technicians. This initiative was largely successful, based on student evaluations, buy-in and support from local industries as well as the number of industrial design projects and innovations that were generated, some of which have since been patented and commercialized. These achievements motivated other institutions to join and the initiative has been expanded to the Higher Education Partnerships for Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper outlines the activities and achievements of this initiative and demonstrates how the expanded version will utilize two approaches of design thinking and systems thinking for capacity building and sustainability in engineering education and regional integration.","Nyemba, Wilson R.;Chikuku, Tauyanashe;Chiroodza, Jennifer R.;Dube, Basil;Carter, Keith F.;Ityokumbul, Mku T.;Magombo, Lovemore",Conference Proceeding,Procedia CIRP,2020-01-01,University of Zimbabwe;Rolls-Royce plc;University of Johannesburg,Capacity building ;  design thinking ;  engineering education ;  systems thinking

Current usage patterns of open educational resources in the engineering mechanics classroom and barriers to adoption,"Open Educational Resources (OER) represent a small but growing portion of the educational resources market, but the use of OER in engineering is limited. This study seeks to identify the current adoption patterns of OER in engineering mechanics courses and barriers to adoption. Research questions are examined through the lens of Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation model. A survey of mechanics instructors across the United States, combined with publicly available data from college and university websites, were used to identify instructor practices and opinions regarding OER. During the 2017-2018 academic year, widespread OER usage was found at only a handful of institutions. However, knowledge of OER among mechanics instructors was high, and many instructors reported an interest in OER for their courses. A lack of quality OER content for engineering mechanics courses seems to be the primary barrier to more widespread adoption.","Moore, Jacob P.;Reinsfelder, Thomas L.",Journal,Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship,2020-01-01,Penn State Mont Alto,

New Ceramic Solutions in Sustainable Hotels within the Scope of Sustainable Innovation,"The sustainable performance of hotels which constitute a major part of the tourism industry, gains increasing importance day by day. Sustainability has become mandatory not only for the tourism industry but also for all industries producing goods and services. Reducing the negative impact of development on the environment and environmental innovation which aims to benefit from natural resources and energy effectively and consciously helps hotels to be sustainable. The tourism industry has a complex structure and exists as being intertwined with other branches of science. Tourism, which is a multidisciplinary industry, is nourished by other branches of science as well as supplies other fields of science by providing working space. Some new solutions that are put forward by materials science and engineering take place in the tourism industry as new innovations. Owing to this interaction, the workload of the personnel working in hotels is reduced and the enterprises save material and energy. At the same time, the customers who benefit from the services of the hotels consume the services in more comfortable and safer environments. Ceramic materials are generally used in toilet and bathroom parts of hotels. However, ceramics are observed to be used in lobbies, cafes, restaurants, pools, facades, and similar areas in addition to toilets and baths in hotels. The aim of this study is to identify new ceramic solutions that affect and contribute to the sustainability of the hotels which is a major sector under the roof of the tourism industry and to contribute the literature. In order to actualize this aim, the document analysis method which is one of qualitative research methods was used and the literature search was carried out to identify new ceramic solutions. The result of study includes moisture control tiles with the ability to keep the humidity at normal standards in terms of human health and that can be used in hotels, facade systems that clean themselves and the polluted air, thermal coating systems for heat insulation, antibacterial materials that provide hygiene, and dirt repelling products. Also, it is seen that there are new ceramic solutions such as costless night lighting and security strips as well as materials with a phosphorescence property for aesthetical purposes and also, tiles with heat control which offer different possibilities aesthetically. It is observed that the different benefits obtained from each of identified new ceramic solutions ease off the workload of personnel working in the hotels, enable material and energy saving in hotels and at the same time, provide an accommodation in a more comfortable and safer environment for customers. In addition to this, the use of high-technology ceramics and nanomaterials in the field of tourism creates places where technology and aesthetics combine.","Vatan, Ahmet;Yilmaz, Zuhal",Book,Entrepreneurial Opportunities: Economics and Sustainability for Future Growth,2020-01-01,Bilecik Şeyh Edebali Üniversitesi;Istanbul Medeniyet University,Accommodation ;  Customers ;  Energy ;  Hotels ;  Lighting ;  Security ;  Technology ;  Tourism
Leveraging behavior change theories in program design improves workforce health,"Background: Influencing health behaviors is the primary goal of health and wellness programs. Behaviors, in turn, both shape and are shaped by the social environment. Thus, creating an environment conducive to behavior change is important to effectively enable and encourage healthy behaviors. Creating healthy physical and social environments enhances behavior change programs by addressing change at multiple levels - individual, interpersonal, group and community. Such programs seek to impact knowledge, beliefs, and skills. While enhancing health awareness is important, understanding health behavior change models/theories as part of program design and implementation is critical for effective programming and communication. Objectives/Scope: Using examples from our workforce health programs, we describe how behavior change theories have been used effectively in health promotion programs to improve workforce health. In addition, we identify success factors for health communication, program design and implementation in deploying global health programs. Method: We present assessments of population health programs implemented to impact communicable (HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria) and non-communicable (cardiovascular disease and diabetes) diseases. Program design elements and communication strategies associated with Healthy Heart, diabetes awareness and peer health educator (PHE) programs will be mapped to behavior change theories to demonstrate their alignment with theoretical foundations. We will also describe the impact of implementing data- and theory-based communication best practices on program outcomes by evaluating health risks and aggregate health statistics. Results and Observations: Health communication is most effective when messaging is simple, clear, concise, appropriate, understandable, and aligned with behavior change theories. Targeted programming can be optimized by addressing stages of change, providing cues to action, and promoting self-efficacy and motivation. Health awareness opportunities for communicable and non-communicable diseases increased as demonstrated by growing participation numbers. Health risk factors among participants were also positively impacted. For both communicable and non-communicable diseases, health programming utilizing PHEs supports the importance of social connections in enhancing the delivery of a variety of health messages, by being personally and culturally relevant and building rapport. We describe how learnings from cardiovascular-focused and quarterly programming successes can provide insights for deploying future PHE efforts. Conclusions: Communicating risk at work is not limited to hazardous, occupational, or public health emergencies. Communicating to the workforce about health risk as part of well-designed programming is also critical for enabling workforce health, safety and productivity. Leveraging data and health behavior theory in communications and program design can positively impact health and wellness program participation, engagement and outcomes which in turn, impacts the safety of our workforce Applications: Communication campaigns and wellness programs that are based on sound behavior change theory can successfully impact workforce health. We describe success factors for practical deployment in the energy industry and for enhancing peer to peer support of healthy behaviors. Innovations or Technical Contributions: This paper highlights the value of considering the role of theoretical constructs in how people learn and how health behaviors change and persist.","Davis-Street, Janis;Johnson, Allyson;Steinberg, Michael",Conference Proceeding,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE International Conference and Exhibition on Health, Safety, Environment, and Sustainability 2020, HSE and Sustainability 2020",2020-01-01,Chevron Corporation,
Cognitive issues for safe operations: Addressing bias and mindfulness to decrease human error,"Background: Human performance theory strives to better understand the interactions between individuals and critical systems, and the individual's ability to recognize error-likely situations and to act in real time to mitigate threats likely to lead to error, causing accidents with resulting harm to the individual, workforce and/or environment. Psychological well-being is a critical factor for successful application of human performance principles. Psychological well-being is defined as low levels of fatigue, stress and distractibility and high levels of resilience that can be a positive influence on interactions, critical thinking and decision making within work groups and critical systems. Objectives/Scope: Addressing engineering or mechanical controls alone without addressing the human behavior at the center of operations in the energy industry limits process safety efforts to decrease serious incidents and fatalities. To that end efforts to develop resiliency within the workforce highlight connections to safe operations. Our resilience framework addresses several interpersonal and intrapersonal factors that can enhance mental and emotional well-being. These psychological processes relate to documented impacts on safety, including situational awareness and decision making. In this paper we examine, through case studies, cognitive bias and how the practice of mindfulness (paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally), can positively impact human behavior and function as safeguards for decreasing human error. Method: The goal of these studies is to elucidate how bias and distracted thinking (lack of mindfulness) are addressed in the decision-making process in the energy industry.to enhance mental well-being and human performance. Examples of tools that support decision making in situations where bias and stress may be a factor will be described. We will also describe steps that business unit leaders utilize to create a culture where human performance theory and individual psychological well-being converge, optimizing safe operations in the energy industry. Results and Observations: Well-being data provide aggregate information from across the enterprise. Aggregate data from employee surveys and information from wellness programs and incident reports indicate that individual factors remain as opportunities for targeted focus on mental and emotional well-being in some groups. To that end, some downstream and upstream business units have identified cognitive bias, reactiveness and lack of mindfulness as focus areas for increasing awareness and development. Conclusions: This paper aims to raise awareness about the importance of psychological functioning which can impact well-being and cognition. Cognitive impairment is certainly a detriment and hazard to safe operations. Compromised cognitive agility leads to inferior problem-solving ability and diminished decision-making capability, especially under duress. Humans do not have the ability to always self-monitor or regulate thoughts and actions like machines and are therefore susceptible to human error. Henceforth efforts to make thinking explicit is desirable, as well as efforts to expose deficits in cognitive processes. Decline in cognitive capacity may first be gleaned from changes in behavior including but not limited to absenteeism, presenteeism, and changes in mood, for example, depression, sadness and irritability. Because it is human nature to make mistakes, addressing these factors proactively can make workers and supervisors more aware of when they are most vulnerable to making mistakes, and highlight areas where adequate safeguards are needed. Applications: Tools for supporting the workforce in addressing individual factor error traps are highlighted, including methods for improving focus and attention, heightening awareness of fatigue and personal biases, and taking appropriate action to mitigate the situation and stress in operational settings. Innovations or Technical Contributions: This paper highlights the role of psychological well-being in influencing workforce health and safety and provides insights into proactive measures that can decrease distractibility, by increasing focus on the present, and influence human performance.","Davis-Street, Janis;Stevens, Christina;Grimsley, Michael;Kendrick, Jereline;Boyers, Kathy;Erickson, Heidi",Conference Proceeding,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE International Conference and Exhibition on Health, Safety, Environment, and Sustainability 2020, HSE and Sustainability 2020",2020-01-01,Chevron Corporation,

Human rights’ issues and media/communication theories in the wake of artificial intelligence technologies: The fate of electorates in twenty-first-century american politics,"The ability for individuals to effectively communicate their thoughts, ideas and feelings amongst fellow beings is perceived as one of the greatest features distinguishing man from other living creatures on earth. The freedom to communicate such thoughts—in certain nations of the world—are perceived as one of man’s inalienable rights as a free individual in the society. Consequently, scholars have propounded theories to aid in explaining the trends of thought which modes of communication should follow. The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the twenty-first century into the media industry seems to question the very foundations on which most renowned media and communications theory were founded on. Some scholars argue that political campaign experts have taken advantage of the adoption of innovations in AI technologies in the media to manipulate man’s freedom to communicate and exercise his wishes in the political arena. Consequently, the paper adopts Creswell’s qualitative method for research in the social science since it promotes drawing logical deductions from the analysis of propositions and theorems. The paper observes that the adoption of twenty-first-century AI technologies in the media industries has distorted existing theories of media/communication. Furthermore, the proliferation of AI technologies for politicking tends to adversely violate the inalienable rights individuals have to freely communicate their political opinions during elections. Media/communications scholars are admonished to extend research directed at understanding the degree of influence which AI technology exerts on media/communication theories with a view to addressing rising concerns for mankind and the media industry.","Wogu, I.

Impact of nanotechnology patents on green development of China's building industry,"Background: The sustainable development of the building industry has drawn increasing attention around the world. Nanomaterials and nanotechnology play an important role in the processes of energy saving and reducing consumption in the building industry. Nanotechnology patents provide key technological support for the green development of the building industry. Based on patent data in China, this paper quantitatively analyzed the application of nanotechnology patents in the building industry and the time trend, regional differences, and evolution of China's nano-patent applications in the building field. Methods: In this study, the environmental total factor productivity of the building industry considering carbon constraints was determined and then used as the dependent variable to measure the green development of the building industry. On this basis, a panel data regression model was constructed to de-termine the impact of nano-patents on the green development of the building industry. Results: Nanotechnology patents in the building industry can significantly improve total factor produc-tivity. From the perspective of patent composition, technology-based patents that focus on substantial innovation can significantly promote the green development of the building industry, whereas strategic patents show a significant inhibitory effect. Regionally, the western region of China has the advantage of being less developed and thus more efficient than the central and eastern regions in the application of new nano-products. Finally, the research also showed a significant lag in the application of China's nanotechnology patents and low implementation efficiency. Conclusion: Nano patents can promote green development in the building industry, but there is room for improvement in the speed with which laboratory inventions are transformed into building engineering applications.","Sun, Xialing;Zhang, Rui;Chen, Xue;Li, Pengpeng;Guo, Jin",Journal,Recent Patents on Nanotechnology,2020-01-01,"Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources;China University of Mining & Technology, Beijing;Henan Polytechnic University",Building ;  Energy efficiency ;  Environment ;  Green development ;  Nanomaterials ;  Nanotechnology ;  Patent

Towards an agile innovation capability maturity framework to enhance investments on ICT organizations,"Innovation is a complex process that has been studied from different perspectives. There are numerous studies, standards and reference models in the literature about it. Just a few works have been focused on covering a significant problem: innovation limits caused by public or private funding because of the restrictions imposed on the project in terms of scope and time. These restrictions are usually caused by the lack of trust and understanding of the innovation process by investors. In this Ph.D., the aim is to propose a framework that measures innovation maturity and capacity from ICT organizations. The initial hypothesis is that this Framework will allow improving investment since investor’s risk will decrease and the trust will be increased, both, based on the maturity of the companies. The increasing of trust will eliminate the restrictions caused by financing, making it more adapted to the needs of innovation. Besides, organizations will have a framework that will allow them to compare their innovation maturity. As regards the research strategy is concerned, this Ph.D. will follow the Design Science methodology. A framework will be designed, developed and validated in a real use case in an ICT company. The framework is intended to assist public and private investors in the financing of ICT organizations.","Giménez-Medina, M.",Conference Proceeding,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2020-01-01,Universidad de Sevilla,Agile ;  Business Angel ;  Capability Maturity Framework ;  Innovation ;  Public Funding
A review of university-enterprise-cooperation research in china: A quantitative perspective,"The University-Enterprise-Cooperation (UEC) has been adopted by many universities globally to effectively utilize the high-quality resources of the construction industry, to improve the general competence, problem-solving skills and innovation capability of graduates of an engineering discipline. There are a limited amount of papers published in international journals on UEC, compared to a significant volume of Chinese published literature. However, based on the best knowledge of the authors, no existing literature has conducted a quantitative statistical analysis on UEC research in Chinese and international journals. In order to fill this knowledge gap, 300 high-quality papers on UEC were derived through the Chinese CNKI database from 2010-2019. The general development trend of UEC research in the past 30 years was also mapped and analyzed. The most popular topics under the UEC theme and the most frequently adopted research methods within the UEC field were also identified. It was found that since the first UEC publication in 1990, the number of UEC publications experienced a steady increase during the last decade, aiding by strong promotion from the government and active practice within universities and from educators in China.

Afterward, the status of functional testing methods for unmanned vehicles is reported. A methodology of virtual simulation tests, model-scale tests, and full-scale tests of smart ships are proposed. Accordingly, a virtual-real interaction platform for functional testing of smart ships is designed by the ship type, the navigation environment, the navigation scenario, the man-machine interaction, the data acquisition, the integration platform, and the performance evaluation. Finally, this paper proposes a method that is adapted from the Turing test to evaluate the smart navigation function for smart ships. The proposed method aims to alleviate the difficulty of verifying the intelligence of smart ships.","Yang, Fan;Liu, Jialun;Li, Shijie;Ma, Feng",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference,2020-01-01,State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering;Wuhan University of Technology;National Engineering Research Center for Water Transport Safety,Functional testing ;  Smart ships ;  Test and measurements ;  Testbeds of smart ships ;  Virtual-real interaction test
The CDIO-based Maker Space Framework: Application with Engineering Management Students,"Creating maker spaces is an effective approach to enhancing creativity. Maker spaces, commonly libraries, are often utilized within the science, math, technology, and engineering (STEM) field; their use has not been extensively researched in the context of engineering education. Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) is an already well-established engineering education technique. This paper establishes a Framework of Maker Spaces (FMS) based on CDIO for engineering management students composed of the Innovation Studio Project (ISP) I-IV. A total of 160 students participated in the experiment who were randomly assigned into two groups: Group A, given maker spaces with teacher guides, and Group B, who were taught by teachers in the form of traditional curricula. The results indicate that maker spaces have a positive impact on student performance, especially team innovation and individual innovation indicators. Group A students also reported higher satisfaction than Group B. This study marks the first CDIO-based maker space framework applied to the ISP I-IV for engineering management students. The results presented here may represent workable guidelines for further research on maker spaces.","Jiang, Lei;Gao, Lingxia;Wang, Qingchun;Gao, Yunli;Shi, Feng",Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2020-01-01,Dalian Minzu University,Cdio ;  Engineering education ;  Maker spaces ;  Syllabus

The search for adaptation and resistance: Biological innovations in Mexican wheat cultivation (1909-1941),"This article is centered on the phenomenon of biological innovations in Mexican wheat cultivation during the period between 1909 and 1941, which it considers to represent the first stage of scientific agriculture in the country. Opening with a brief theoretical discussion on what is understood to be biological innovation, as well as its role in the expansion of commercial agriculture, it puts forward a general characterization and periodization of commercial agriculture with a scientific basis in Mexico. The analysis begins with a taxonomic description of Mexico’s commercial wheat varieties and their relationship with both productive-nutritional uses and the primary local agricultural and economic problems. It then analyzes the different government programs that, in various stages and using different strategies, promoted selective breeding. This led to the development of new wheat varieties aimed at increasing and expanding productivity, as well as making the crop plague-resistant and better-adapted to the ecological diversity of the country’s most important agricultural regions. It pays close attention to the “red queen effect” as one of the most important phenomena in terms of the limits of scientific research into agronomics in Mexico and sheds light on aspects that allow us to better understand lesser-known agrobiological phenomena in Mexico in the first half of the 20th Century. The article closes by summarizing the achievements and unresolved problems during this period, which was the initial stage and direct antecessor of the Green Revolution in Mexico’s agricultural sector.","Sada, Eva Rivas",Journal,Historia Mexicana,2020-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,20th Century ;  Agronomic engineering ;  Biological innovation ;  Environmental history ;  Mexico ;  Taxonomy ;  Wheat

Six years operating a real time drilling problem detection software in deepwater environments: Results and challenges,"Given the complexity and high costs associated to ultra deepwater drilling, any effort to avoid unforeseen situations is beneficial. Initiatives to optimize the drilling process in real-time are extremely important. This article details the experience of 6 year operating a real-time software with the focus of anticipating the detection of potential drilling problems in challenging scenarios. Based on transient numerical simulation (hydraulics, cutting transport, torque and drag, etc.), the software automatically identifies operational problems in real-time, providing to the rig crew anticipated information, so that, corrective and/or preventive actions can be taken. The software incorporate relevant experimental and theoretical research developed in multiple Brazilian universities and R&D Centers. It receives surface and downhole data in real-time, as well as, simulates comprehensive models (which considers real data, fluid properties, well and drilling column geometry as inputs) in order to analyze the current drilling status, by comparing real and calculated (expected) data, with quantitative criteria. Dedicated decision trees, validated by a representative group of senior drillers, provide reliable indication for problem alerts. The present paper aims to detail the successes and the difficulties of detecting typical drilling problems in Campos and Santos basins (offshore Brazil). The process of algorithm development, validation and field implementation is detailed. In July 2014, after almost 10 years of development, the use of the application started as a service conducted by a drilling engineering team, on a 24x7 service in Petrobras Real Time Support Center. Since then, it monitored every Petrobras offshore well. According to estimates, the economy by using this real-time program reached almost 150 rig days, which is equivalent to approximately US$ 130 MM. In 2016, The iniciative was granted the Technological Innovation ANP (Brazilian National Petroleum Agency) Award as recognition by its relevant results. This software is in a continuous development process, aiming to acquire new analyses in order to increasingly help the Petrobras drilling operations. The novelty is the usage of numerical simulation in order to withdraw the subjectivity of a qualitative data analysis, avoiding the misinterpretation of a possible operational event. Present challenges include the proposal of hybrid solutions (modeling + machine learning) to tackle the identification of complex problems (such as false kicks, stuck pipe in salt drilling and circulation loss prediction).","da Silva, Fabio Rodrigues G.;de Souza Cruz, Marcelo;Barduchi, Bruno;Bellumat, Ernanda;dos Santos, Maycon Vieira;de Matos, Vinicius Barroso;Gandelman, Roni Abensur;Martins, André Leibsohn",Conference Proceeding,SPE Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference Proceedings,2020-01-01,Petrobras;Engineering Simulation and Scientific Software,
Smart Cities: Who is the Main Observer?,"Abstract This paper is based on the paradigm that a smart city is a part of the intellectual framework of second-order cybernetics and considers social communication in terms of the management and use of different data channels. Planning as a political practice is replaced by environmentally-behavioral control, in which subjectivity is articulated above-individually (permeating the city with sensitive nodes) and infra-individually (transforming citizens into sensitive nodes). This leads us to the research question: how to focus on the social relations and processes of the smart urbanization which are based on the second order cybernetic approach? The smart city is understood as a complex mechanism, where one begins to realize the often-unintended human, environmental, social and economic consequences of a technological and engineering-led approach. The latest thinking and smart urban projects are aimed at comprehending smart and/or sustainable infrastructure as a network between places and people in order to create a more sustainable, healthy and resilient future for different groups of citizens (from young people to seniors). Municipality strategies need to address global socio-economic factors, processes of innovation with new technology, constant adaptation in public and private sector organisations and the diversity of qualified resources.","Petroccia, Sara;Pitasi, Andrea;Cossi, Gianugo M.;Roblek, Vasja",Journal,Comparative Sociology,2020-01-01,Università degli Studi di Udine;University of G. d'Annunzio Chieti and Pescara;Faculty of Information Studies in Novo mesto,cybernetics ;  internet of services ;  internet of things ;  smart city ;  urban innovation ;  urbanisation
Scientific research basics of fire resistance testing for reinforced concrete structures and buildings,"Breakthroughs in the development of science and technology of fire testing and fire resistance tests, their present state are discussed, and ideas about the future development of fire resistance tests are given, furthermore the directions in which deeper studies are necessary, are marked. The first revolution in fire resistance testing began not so long ago, in the nineteenth century, when basic tools were developed to measure temperature and heat fluxes. The second revolution in the measurement and understanding of fire occurred in the early twentieth century with the worldwide recognition that scientifically well-reasoned fire-fighting standards are needed to protect people's lives and their property. At the same time, engineering innovations were developed for electromechanical equipment that could automatically record data obtained during a fire experimentally. This progress in data recording has made it possible to study fire behaviour in details. The third revolution in fire resistance testing took place in the second half of the twentieth century with the development of accessible digital data and computer recording equipment that improved data analysis and the development of evidence-based forecast models. The widespread application of technology and computational methods have opened up a theoretical world that provides nuanced insight of fire dynamics and gives the means for development of more effective fire test methods.","Fomin, Stanislav;Butenko, Serhii;Plakhotnikova, Iryna;Koliesnikov, Serhii",Book Series,Materials Science Forum,2020-01-01,O.M.

A mbse approach to mdao systems for the development of complex products,"The research and innovation AGILE project has developed an approach, the so-called AGILE Paradigm, focusing on the acceleration of the deployment and operation of collaborative Multidisciplinary Design Analysis Optimization systems, which in turns can be exploited to accelerate the development of complex products, such as novel aerospace systems. Although the technologies developed for the implementation of the paradigm, have proved to reduce the deployment and operational time to more than 40% with respect to conventional MDAO approaches, the AGILE Paradigm has not been formalized and model by digital design engineering practices. This work introduces a novel approach leveraging MBSE principles to streamline the development of agile MDAO design systems, and establishing a bridge between MBSE and MDAO. Major outcomes here presented are the MBSE-driven models of the so-called AGILE MDAO system, representing the architecture, the requirements, as well as the organizational aspects, and all the interactions and activities implemented during the life-cycle stages of the MDAO system. The MBSE Architectural Framework, which defines the underlying ontological concepts and perspectives driving the development of the AGILE MDAO system model, are modeled and presented as well. The paper introduces for the first time the overall approach, as well as the high-level elements of the models developed, here represented by making use of SysML standard. The described approach is at the core of the recently launched project AGILE4.0, in which its scope will be expanded to cover the entire life-cycle of the development of complex aeronautical systems.","Ciampa, Pier Davide;Nagel, Björn;Rocca, Gianfranco La",Conference Proceeding,AIAA AVIATION 2020 FORUM,2020-01-01,"Faculteit Luchtvaart- en Ruimtevaarttechniek, TU Delft;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)",
Attitude-based con ict management for resolving disputes over water quality of the Seymareh River in Iran,"A strategic negotiation methodology for managing complex water-related con icts is presented in order to consider the decision makers' attitudes. The developed approach systematically exploits the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) as an analytical and practical technique, and helps decision makers nd the most bene cial outcomes for negotiating their disputes, assuming the competing needs, wants, and attitudes of decision makers. A real case study of a water-related dispute in Iran is used to demonstrate the implementation of the developed methodology and to emphasize the signi cance of decision makers' attitudes in identifying feasible negotiation outcomes for resolving complex disputes. In fact, the developed attitude-oriented methodology proposes an innovative engineering approach to help stakeholders address a wide range of con icts, especially in complex water disputes in developing countries where human factors such as attitude play a signi cant role. The research can also help decision makers with the shortcomings of conventional decision making systems, such as original GMCR, through incorporating attitudes into con ict resolution tools in order to better clarify needs and interests, obtain equilibrium results, and generate more equitable solutions.","Youse, S.;Hipel, K.

Teaching software testing to industrial practitioners using distance and web-based learning,"Software testing is a business-critical process used by private and public organizations and an important source of market competitiveness. Employees of these organizations are facing tough competition and are required to be able to maintain and develop their skills and knowledge in software testing. In the education market, many commercial courses and certifications are available for industrial engineers who wish to improve their skills in software development. Nevertheless, there is a lack of access to world-leading research within the software testing field in these commercial courses that supports the companies’ innovation in software testing. As an alternative, universities are approaching this challenge by developing academic courses on software testing that can suit professionals who need to be able to combine work and studies. This study highlights several good approaches and challenges in developing and teaching three distance web-based software testing courses targeting test practitioners. The proposed approaches for enhancing teaching of software testing in an online setting for industrial practitioners are: active participation at the student’s pace, inclusion of software testing artifacts from the student’s organization as part of assignments, continuous access to online materials, the use of short video materials on testing theory, and setting clear expectations for performing online test design assignments. Finally, several challenges have been identified: poor feedback on assignments, distances between students and teachers, the use of non-realistic assignments and the difficulty for industrial practitioners to complete academic assignments each week. Future work is needed to explore these results in practice, for example on how to shorten distances between students and teachers, as well as how to enhance the inclusion of real-world testing artifacts in course assignments.","Enoiu, Eduard Paul",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,Mälardalen University,Industrial practitioners ;  Online education ;  Software engineering education ;  Software testing education ;  Web-based learning
Spin-Off Strategies of Established Companies Due to Digitalization and Disruption,"Due to digitalization and disruptive innovations, many established companies are faced with the task of adapting their business models and processes to new requirements. To avoid risks and exploit opportunities, spin-offs are founded for this purpose. The research question to be answered is if spin-off strategies can be based on a general form and if measures can be clustered. For this purpose, literature was evaluated and interviews with experts were conducted. In this way a structured approach could be developed, which is based on four result clusters: reasons, arguments, differentiation and success factors. The results are particularly interesting for the management of spin-offs and for companies that want to set up one.","Kretschmar, Dominik;Niemann, Jörg;Müller, Felix",Book Series,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2020-01-01,"Hochschule Düsseldorf, University of Applied Sciences",Business model innovation ;  Digitalization and disruptive innovations ;  Spin-off strategies
Educating Future Engineers – Meeting Challenges at Secondary School and University,"Serious shortages of qualified professionals and technical job-specific skills are hampering Europe’s sustainable growth. Even more so, relatively newer technologies, such as digitalization and Industry 4.0, require a new set of qualifications for future engineers. Deficiencies in these areas can have a negative impact on innovation and, therefore, also for the well-being of the industry and economy. New skills in education as well as new training methods are required in order to train successful engineers that meet the requirements set by industry and society. How does a future engineering education look like? To get a qualified picture of the necessary requirements, as well as possible limitations, different stakeholders, such as teachers, students of engineering studies and pupils in secondary schools or vocational schools have been questioned.

Entrepreneurship-professionalism- leadership: A framework for nurturing and managing the R&D workforce for a national innovation ecosystem,"Today, many developed countries around theworld are embracing science, technology and innovation as an important engine for economic growth. Innovation is fundamentally a human activity and a social one that involves more than any single individual’s efforts. It is thus important not only to study core innovation processes but also the approach to nurturing and managing the people in the innovation system. In this chapter, we highlight four unique challenges of innovation arising from the unique management and development needs of highly specialized scientific/engineering workers for innovation, given the motivational complexity and diversity of this workforce. We propose that Entrepreneurship, Professionalism and Leadership (EPL) can serve as a broad framework to specify the dimensions of talent needed for innovation to succeed at different levels of analysis from individuals to teams, units, organizations and even the national innovation ecosystem.

These RIs are developed as service pillars for intra- and interdisciplinary research; however, comprehension of the complex, interconnected aspects of the Earth’s ecosystem increasingly requires that researchers conduct their experiments across infrastructure boundaries. Consequently, almost all data-related activities within these infrastructures, from data capture to data usage, need to be designed to be broadly interoperable in order to enable real interdisciplinary innovation and to improve service offerings through the development of common services. To address these interoperability challenges as they relate to the design, implementation and operation of environmental RIs, a Reference Model guided engineering approach was proposed and has been used in the context of the ENVRI cluster of RIs. In this chapter, we will discuss how the approach combines the ENVRI Reference Model with the practices of Agile systems development to design common data management services and to tackle the dynamic requirements of research infrastructures.","Zhao, Zhiming;Jeffery, Keith",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,Universiteit van Amsterdam;Keith G Jeffery Consultants,Agile ;  Interoperability ;  Reference Model ;  Research infrastructure
Prerequisites for elementary school teachers before practicing STEM education with students: A case study,"Purpose: Implementing STEM education in the early grades is a more effective way to encourage creativity, problem-solving, and innovation. There is a need for elementary teachers to implement STEM education to integrate and contextualize science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in their teaching. This research aims to examine the prerequisites for elementary teachers before practicing STEM education with students. Research Method: This study is a case study and implementations were undertaken with six teachers over 13 weeks and were delivered in theoretical and practical ways. Open-ended pre-test and post-test, interviews, diaries of both researcher and participants, worksheets, lesson plans, assessment tools and engineering design process (EDP) reports were used as multiple data sources to triangulate findings. Thematic analysis was utilized using open coding and cross coding of data. Results: Several codes emerged from the analysis that were grouped under five salient themes as follows: understanding STEM, instructional gains of STEM education for teachers and benefits of STEM education for students, instructional prerequisites for teachers and conditions of schools to perform effective STEM education. Implications for Research and Practice: Theoretical and practical integrated STEM education can be planned in a long-term manner for the education program of elementary school teachers consisting of problem-based, inquiry-based and project-based learning enriched with content knowledge integrated STEM practices.","Aydin, Ganime",Journal,Eurasian Journal of Educational Research,2020-01-01,Canakkale 18 Mart University Lapseki Meslek Yuksekokulu,Elementary teacher education ;  Engineering design process ;  Life-STEM ;  STEM education ;  Thematic analysis

Ten years of campus LID research and practice in tsinghua university,"In recent decades, many cities in China and across the world have been suffering from the flooding and rainwater waterlog problems. Campus, being regarded as the innovation base and green hub of cities, could play significant role not only for the mitigation of stormwater problems but also for the environmental education. Since 2009, campus of Tsinghua University in Beijing has been used as a lab for stormwater management teaching and research, and it was titled Sponge Campus Initiatives after the concept of Sponge City was widely adopted. During the past 10 years, in total over 30 innovative design case study were proposed in Tsinghua campus and 4 of them were realized. These works demonstrated rich innovative design considerations combining water issues with benefits such as campus history, social life, landscape aesthetic, community regeneration, and environmental education. Before these pioneering and frontier works there was no such way in Chinese universities and education programs. Besides, this decade of teaching in the course of landscape hydrology has borne rich academic fruits, including papers, books, and awards of national and international levels. The most recent one is the 2019 ASLA Students Excellent Award and the 2019 Finalist of the Landscape Innovation Award of Landscape Institute of U.K. with the research of ""Monitoring Design: Stormwater Management Process Visualization and Evaluation"" of Shengyin Yuan. This paper intends to introduce the development of landscape hydrology course and Sponge Campus Initiatives in Tsinghua University showing the way to combine campus stormwater management and landscape planning and design.","Liu, Hailong;Zhou, Huaiyu;Chang, Yi Chang",Conference Proceeding,International Low Impact Development Conference 2020: Setting the Vision for the Next Twenty Years - Proceedings of the International Low Impact Development Conference 2020,2020-01-01,,Campus LID ;  Landscape hydrology ;  Sponge campus ;  Sponge city ;  Tsinghua University
Enablers of workforce agility in engineering educational institutions,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore and encapsulate the enablers that can facilitate agility in faculty members of engineering institutions. The paper also aims to conduct a prelim qualitative validation of the enablers and analyze the interplay between them using the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) approach. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted the TISM approach to comprehend the interactions and transitivity between the enablers. Cross-impact multiplication matrix (MICMAC) analysis was applied to rank the enablers and classify them on the basis of the driving and dependence power into dependent, autonomous, independent and linkage enablers. Findings: Extensive literature review and expert opinion helped identify 16 enablers that can promote workforce agility. The results indicate “management support” as the most crucial enabler. Rewards and recognition and employee empowerment were among the other enablers that have a high driving force. New capabilities, learning and innovation and the expanding role of faculty members were found to have high dependence power, which makes the enablers dependent on other enablers for activation. Practical implications: The results of this study would assist the management of engineering colleges and universities to design, adopt and implement policies and practices that would facilitate agility in faculty members. Faculty members shoulder the responsibility of molding the future generation, and hence, it is important that they are competent enough to impart quality education. The policymakers should focus on policies and practices that leverage human resource potential and support an innovative climate that nurtures entrepreneurial activities in engineering institutions. Originality/value: So far research on workforce agility has predominantly focused on the manufacturing sector. Despite the workforce (refers to faculty members here) being crucial in contributing to the progress of universities and colleges, very little work is done on how faculty members can be made agile. Application of the TISM method in identifying the variables that can facilitate faculty members' agility in engineering institutions in India is a new and original contribution to the literature on workforce agility.","Menon, Shalini;Suresh, M.",Journal,Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education,2020-01-01,Amrita School of Business,Agility ;  Engineering education institutions ;  Faculty members ;  Total interpretive structural modeling
"Innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship in academia: A review","This overview complements our two previous reviews on the future of Arab universities and on quality assurance and relevance in academia published in this Springer book series. It encompasses the concepts of universities and their societal roles, and considers the definitions of innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship. It argues that innovation and entrepreneurship can be taught in the right circumstances. The personal qualities needed to be an entrepreneur are described. An account is given of intellectual property (IP), especially patents and copyright works, together with its regulation in different jurisdictions, registration, defence, and exploitation. Governments have a pivotal role in facilitating start-up companies and the ease of conducting business. Also important is their interaction with international bodies such as the World Trade Organization and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, World Intellectual Property Organization etc., and international indices such as the World Competitiveness Index. Governments can assist this crucial phase of university development, but should not interfere with universities, by a combination of adequate education and research funding together with setting up national technology foresight and related exercises, participating in regional initiatives to establish large-scale research and development facilities, and promoting competition. The combination of quality assurance, societally relevant teaching and research, accreditation, university-based and university-associated business and technology parks, business incubators and similar structures, alongside business schools, represent the main routes to successful delivery of university-derived IP. Even so, much depends on the quality, energy, experience, attitudes, and contact network of those leading these structures, and those of the associated academic staff. The roles of banks, venture capitalists, business angels, IP lawyers, and accountants in establishing a business are described, and the role and design of business plans outlined. Worrisome aspects of IP theft are described although there is little prospect of preventing it at this juncture in international relationships. Opportunities arising from the raft of transformative technologies under development are described, along with opportunities arising from international trends in convenience, fashion, design, entertainment, and diet. Climate change and the problems of water, energy, and food security offer huge opportunities for universitybased innovations in STEMM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, medicine). Challenges come from (a) the level of competition; (b) dominating position of the US and Chinese tech giants absorbing talent and finance; (c) venture capital based mainly in the US and Europe; (d) US Supreme Court ruling on the patentability of software; and (e) problems of doing business in the Arab world and its attitudes to R&D and innovation. The overview ends with guidelines on establishing a business or company, and special features to consider when doing so in the Arab world. An appendix details advice for IP guidance for staff and students, plus supplements to institution-supplied laboratory and other notebooks with instructions for (a) record keeping required for accreditation and IP litigation; (b) code of institutional practice; (c) institutional quality plan; (d) standard operating procedures; and (e) equipment logbooks.","Hillman, John R.;Baydoun, Elias",Book,Higher Education in the Arab World: Building a Culture of Innovation and Entrepreneurship,2020-01-01,The James Hutton Institute;American University of Beirut,Arab world ;  Business park ;  Business school ;  Copyright ;  Creativity ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation ;  Intellectual property ;  New growth theory ;  Novelty ;  Originality ;  Patent ;  Quality assurance ;  Relevance ;  Research institutes ;  State and free-market capitalism ;  Stemm subjects ;  Technology park ;  Transformative technologies ;  Universities
"Linguistic and cultural rights in steam education: Science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics","The premise for this chapter is that the integration of African languages into the teaching of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects is an imperative and will make education more accessible and creative at all levels. This chapter provides tools and strategies for organizing and managing interdisciplinary learning and teaching based on successful collaborations between applied linguists, human rights advocates, STEM researchers, practitioners, and artists in the fields of Arts and STEM subjects, which creates the acronym STEAM. Through a literature review and collaborative works, this chapter will address how the learning of STEM can be improved through acknowledgment of local languages and cultural context by inserting an “A” for Arts in STEM. This will be demonstrated with cases from Africa with a focus on Tanzania, Nigeria, and Malawi. Based on contributions from educators, scientists, scholars, linguists, and artists from these countries and around the world, this chapter will highlight how we can demonstrate teamwork and collaboration for innovation and creativity in the field of STEAM subjects in classrooms and beyond. Drawing language and cultural perspectives into educational models can make Science and Mathematics learning more accessible. For example, recognizing the cultural and historical evidence on the relevance of ethno-mathematical principles is important in establishing an egalitarian connection to STEAM subjects. This can best be accomplished through a model, which accommodates language and Arts as means to demystify Science and Mathematics and to bridge the separation of Mathematics from the contexts of everyday experience. Education should be viewed as the Art of dealing with cultural encounters. This chapter reflects on the core of human rights education using local languages and local knowledge through the Arts as a tool for teaching human rights in school, bringing to light questions on diversity, environmental issues, as well as power relations between non-dominant (minority) and dominant (majority) segments of the society based on a renewed pedagogy. This chapter will be based on cutting-edge research and elaborates on how to approach novel methodologies in the production of curriculum for Linguistic and Cultural Rights through STEAM education. I conclude that for better learning in the twenty-first-century literacies, implementing local languages and local knowledge in education, integrating approaches from the Arts, will improve the learning and teaching of STEM subjects. STEAM should be given the status of a right in education for multilingual, multicultural, and sustainable development in Africa.","Babaci-Wilhite, Zehlia",Book,The Palgrave Handbook of African Education and Indigenous Knowledge,2020-01-01,"University of San Francisco;University of California, Berkeley;San Jose State University",Africa local languages ;  African language education ;  African languages ;  Indigenous knowledge ;  Linguistic and cultural rights curriculum ;  Linguistic rights in education ;  Local knowledge ;  Multicultural education ;  Steam ;  STEM ;  Sustainable development

"Methodological innovation and learning approaches in university students: A case study of the commercial engineering degree at the Universidad Catolica del Norte, Chile","This research aims to analyze the incidence of methodological innovation in the learning approaches of students enrolled in the commercial engineering degree at the Universidad Catolica del Norte (Antofagasta, Chile). The study uses a quasi-experimental methodological design without a pre-test and with a quasi-control group. A design and implementation of the active methodologies in the administration subject is first generated in two consecutive cohorts. Then, an evaluation is performed using an adapted and validated R-SPQ-2 (Study Questionnaire Process). The results showed a significant increase in the adoption of a deep learning approach between the second cohort students. These students benefited from the planning of active methodologies that were adjusted using the diagnosis from their first experiences. It is concluded that the significant increase observed occurs in the subscale of deep strategy.","Pezoa-Fuentes, Claudia A.;Mercado-Guerra, Javier L.",Journal,Formacion Universitaria,2020-01-01,Universidad Católica del Norte,Administration ;  Learning approaches ;  Methodological innovation ;  University teaching
A machine learning approach to predict movie revenue based on pre-released movie metadata,"With the growth of the movie industry, it is becoming increasingly important for the stakeholders to get an idea about the probable profit made by the movie in the box office. In fact, among movies produced between 2000 and 2010 in the United States, only 36% had box office revenues higher than their production budgets, which further highlights the importance of making the right investment decisions. To address this issue, different machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) are used in this study to predict the box office return of a movie based on the data available before the release of the movie. The models use 35 movie parameters from 3200 movies as inputs to predict the profit made by a movie and classify the success of a movie from ""flop"" to ""blockbuster"" based on the generated revenue. An analysis of different machine learning architectures is also presented in this research. Finally, a system is proposed that produces comparable results with existing researches in this field and it can predict the profit generated by a movie with a ""one class away"" accuracy of 85.31% without using any sales information. © 2020 Quazi Ishtiaque Mahmud, Nuren Zabin Shuchi, Fazle Mohammed Tawsif, Asif Mohaimen and Ayesha Tasnim.

When tough times make tough designers: How perplexing experiences shape engineers’ knowledge and identity,"In this paper, we frame design as a learning process where discomfort abounds, and through the process, engineering designers iteratively reconstruct their knowledge and identity. Design and design thinking require very different kinds of cognition and behavior than engineering science. How engineers deal with their cognitive and epistemic biases while navigating sociotechnical complexities in design is a research topic that has been extensively investigated. Yet, much focus is on its know-how, leaving the actual experiences of knowledge development an underexplored domain. To reveal the internal experiences of designers, we conducted a longitudinal qualitative psychology study at a one-academic-year-long engineering design innovation course. Based on the empirical work, we theorize about a psychological phenomenon of designers stretching their mind in discomfort and confusion – perplexity. Each micro-activity of designers’ reshaping of design knowledge and identity is conceptualized as a four-stage ‘‘Death Valley’’ of unlearning and reframing: schema incongruence, cognitive dissonance, pattern recognition, and schema resolution. We unfold how the emotional, cognitive and motivational components of the process are qualitatively different from other processes through which engineers fail to develop design knowledge in schema-incongruent situations. In the end, we discuss the potential value of inducing disturbances for learning, and draw implications for how to better construct engineering students’ learning experiences.","Ge, Xiao;Leifer, Larry",Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2020-01-01,Stanford Engineering,Cognitive growth ;  Design innovation ;  Design knowledge ;  Educational psychology ;  Engineering design ;  Engineering education ;  Identity work
CraCking the culture code: A tri-level model for cultivating inclusion in organizations,"As modern societies become increasingly diverse, organizations have a vested interest in learning how to foster inclusive workplace cultures. The value of inclusion is particularly pronounced in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) where innovation is enhanced when organizations can maximize the intellectual contributions of diverse teams. Despite these strengths of diversity and inclusion, women remain underrepresented in many STEM fields and those who train in STEM often cite workplace culture as a reason they leave. Social psychology is uniquely positioned to understand the key components of workplace culture and to design and test interventions that might foster a more inclusive culture for women in STEM. In this chapter, we consider three-interrelated levels of workplace culture: the institutional, individual, and interpersonal. We review research that examines subtle cues to exclusion that women in STEM experience at each of these levels. We also explore evidence that interventions might successfully target one or more levels to cultivate a more inclusive culture for women and other devalued groups.","Schmader, Toni;Bergsieker, Hilary B.;Hall, William M.",Book,Applications of Social Psychology: How Social Psychology Can Contribute to the Solution of Real-World Problems,2020-01-01,University of Waterloo;The University of British Columbia;Brock University,

Peace engineering consortium: Outcome of the first global peace engineering conference,"The creation of the Peace Engineering Consortium is an outcome of the First Global Peace Engineering Conference, held November 2018 in Albuquerque NM, USA (www.weef-gedc2018.org). A team of conference participants are collaborating to develop the Peace Engineering Consortium. That is, to define and implement its charter, identify initiatives and preliminary activities, and continue to identify definitions of what Peace Engineering (PEng) - or Engineering for Peace - is. PEng is a call for action, in a new mindset not only for engineering, but for all existing and future disciplines to address global challenges. Current activities are: ? Curricula and content - Members are collaborating to define, create and share curricula for undergraduate minors, professional certificate programs and graduate work; Creating experiential laboratories with industry and practitioner partners; Facilitating information exchange and the symmetry of information/knowledge through globally accessible digital libraries; Incorporating engineering diplomacy, diversity and cultural awareness (including the arts, music and language) into the practice for peacebuilding, peacemaking and peacekeeping. ?

Changing paradigms of engineering education - An Indian perspective,"VUCA (Volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) characterize the engineering education scenario. Engineers form the backbone of any country's economy. Around 25% of the world's engineers are in India but it lags behind in research and innovation. At the global level, engineering education is experiencing a paradigm shift from teacher-centric to student-centric teaching- learning process, content based education to outcome based education, knowledge seeking to knowledge sharing classrooms, teachers to facilitators, traditional engineering disciplines to interdisciplinary courses, chalk and board (lecture based) learning to technology driven learning and the list goes on. But in India, still conventional teaching - learning practices with little practical training is adopted in many institutions. This is shown by the fact the Indian institutions still struggle to make a position in world ranking with few exceptions. A country which pioneered in engineering, medicine, arts and music etc. in ancient era, suffers major setbacks in technical education. Hence this study attempts to analyse the perception of stakeholders, viz. students, parents, academic faculty and industry, on engineering education and the future of engineering education. Focus group consultations with select group of respondents were carried out. The results were analysed which showed that the students perceive positively on engineering education but at the same time are apprehensive about the position of engineers in the society. Parents' perception towards engineering is solely on the job opportunities but the faculty members opined changes in the mindset of students and the impact of social media on general attitude. Industries expressed lack of employable engineers and lack of skills in new age technologies. Overall the respondents favoured the introduction of new and multidisciplinary courses to meet future demands.","Pavai Madheswari, S.;Uma Mageswari, S.

An integrated model for improving the performance of engineering institutes under multiple external and internal disruptions,"In the last sixty years many affiliated and autonomous colleges, and national institutes have faced a large number of external and internal disruptions, campus unrest, disputes, court cases and even punishment to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). Many disruptions are due to multiple external controls from central and state governments, affiliating universities, councils (AICTE and Governing Councils), commissions (UGC, and other Commissions) and authoritative politicians. All these disruptions resulted in low performing institutes. This further aggravated due to improper selection of the CEOs of the institutes/ universities, and chairpersons of the Board of Governors. A qualitative research has been undertaken to critically review the state of affairs and suggest strategies, models and solutions to overcome the multiple disruptions through quality circles constituted as a part of faculty development programs on institutional development, leadership and innovation. A four- stage model has been developed. In the first stage the external disruptions have to be minimized, in the second stage the internal disruptions are to be eliminated, in the third stage establishing facilitating centers for rapid transformation, and a fourth stage for implementing transformation initiatives are to be done. Without implementing the three stage reforms, the desired transformations may not be achieved.","Vedhathiri, Thanikachalam",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2020-01-01,,Absence of positive external controls ;  Multiple disruptions ;  Problems in affiliation ;  Shortage of funds ;  Unique model for the growth of Indian engineering education ;  Weak internal controls
The new engineering education in China,"Under the background of accelerating new industrial revolution, China's higher engineering education is in urgent need of cultivating a group of innovative talents in engineering science and technology. In order to improve the quality of engineering education, China proposed the “new engineering research and practice project” in June 2017. This study attempted to adopt systematic review based on 207 projects of engineering superior universities in China's new engineering research and practice project for text analysis, and discovered the common key issues such as mechanism issues, ability issues and discipline issues that are concerned in existing projects. The research findings are as follows: (1) The commonness of construction schemes is emerging. In terms of mechanism construction, the mechanism of collaborative education receives the most attention, while the talent ability pays more attention to the cultivation of soft ability; (2) The overall design of the projects are somewhat lacking innovation and features, and certain construction schemes are similar, failing to effectively combine the advantages of universities and disciplines to serve local industries and truly show its characteristics; (3) Most of the construction plans are aimed at the transformation of traditional disciplines, and there is little construction of corresponding disciplines for certain national key industries.","Shen, Jinlu;Li, Tuoyu;Wu, Mingchuan",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2020-01-01,"School of Public Affairs, Zhejiang University;Zhejiang University",China ;  New Engineering Education ;  Systematic Review
Disrupting engineering education: Beyond peace engineering to educating engineers for justice,"Engineering education outcomes as prescribed by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology comprise technical and scientific student educational outcomes as well as “soft skills”. The scientific and technical outcomes ensure that engineering graduates possess the requisite science, math, engineering and technology skills and capabilities that will enable them to practice competently in their disciplinary engineering profession with technical, scientific and engineering rigor. Soft skills, on the other hand, which are being increasingly emphasized as critically necessary for engineering graduates to be employable and successful in the professional workspace, focus on teamwork, communication, ethics, global awareness (including social, economic, environmental and global impacts of engineering), and lifelong learning. In this essay, we posit that migrating engineering education towards “peace engineering” not only requires that faculty place increased emphasis on these soft skills, but also needs the incorporation of true impact analyses - much like an Environmental Impact Assessment - on the social, environmental and economic impacts of the solutions that students develop to engineering projects and problems. This impact analysis must go beyond an assessment of those areas mentioned in the conference's informal definition of “peace engineering”, which identifies components including “…promotion of prosperity, sustainability, social equality and diversity, culture of equality, ethics, innovation and entrepreneurship.” While these issues are critically important for promoting and supporting an ethos of peace engineering, we suggest that they will have minimal impact unless the thinking and analyses extends to focus on justice, extending the justice paradigm from civil, social and environmental justice to include energy justice, resource justice, information justice and technology justice. Exposing engineering students to these concepts and ideas and incorporating the notion of justice into the impacts of technology research, development and implementation will move us from a “war” based socio-technological configuration to a global peace engineering agenda that might actually move us towards engineers educated to transform their world for peace and justice.","Tharakan, John",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2020-01-01,College of Engineering and Architecture,Engineering Education ;  Justice ;  Peace ;  Technology
Development of diverse global educational leaders through learning organization concepts of faculty engagement,"India is known for conducting global programs in the seventh century through various ancient Institutes like Nalanda University. This due to solving the problems as and when they arise. This is the core of learning organization. The faculty of TTTI Chennai used this concept to plan and offer diverse global faculty development programs without any mandate. Since 1979, Technical Teachers Training Institute (TTTI) Chennai, India [now renamed as National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTTR)] conducts diverse faculty development programs through mastering learning organization concepts and successfully completed Asian Development Bank Program, UNESCO's Asia and Pacific Educational Innovation for Development, UNDP, Government of India's Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC), Special Commonwealth Assistance for African Program (SCAAP), Technical Cooperation Scheme (TCS) under Colombo Plan, and Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). This learning organization method helped the institute to launch radical innovations in human resources development. The programs are evaluated every year based on the feedback from the participants. The life changing program is composed of Need Based Courses, Path to Mastery, Planning High Value Project based on the Research and Presentation of the Outcome to the peers through a Seminar, and improving the programs for implementation. These programs provided needed faculty competence to assist the developing countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Central and South America and Oceania. The disruption due to shortage of trained faculty was overcome to a certain extent. Further innovative postgraduate program in human resource development [ Master of Technology in Human Resource Development [M. Tech. (HRD)], and interdisciplinary doctoral program in Engineering Education, Ph.D., have been established. There is a need to focus on “learning organization model” for decentralization, empowerment and delegation of decision - making authority to the high performing faculty teams.","Vedhathiri, Thanikachalam",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2020-01-01,National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research,Faculty development ;  ICCR ;  Interdisciplinary medium- term programs ;  ITEC ;  Learning organization ;  SCAAP ;  TCS ;  Transformation
Exploring the adoption of digital technology at the different phases of construction projects in South Africa,"The study aimed at having a review of the adoption of digital technologies in the South African construction industry with particular emphasis on the awareness of the various digital technological innovations, their applicability at the different stages of construction processes and the extent of usage at the different stages was equally considered. The research area for the study is Gauteng Province, South Africa, while quantitative approach was deployed with the aid of questionnaire survey. Respondents for the study are construction professionals comprising of Architects, Quantity Surveyors, Builders and Engineers. Analysis was carried out with appropriate statistical tools. Findings from the study revealed that Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensors are the digital technologies mostly deployed in construction processes, while generally there is a low adoption of digital technologies for construction projects. Equally revealed is that the design/engineering phase has the highest level of awareness and usage of digital technologies among the different phases of construction projects. Conclusively, the study emphasized the need for the adoption of digital technology at all the phases of construction projects as the potential benefits to be accrued are immense.","Ikuabe, Matthew;Aghimien, Douglas;Aigbavboa, Clinton;Oke, Ayodeji",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,2020-01-01,University of Johannesburg,Construction industry ;  Construction phases ;  Digital technologies ;  South Africa

Available Technologies: Web Design for Technology Transfer from Public Education and Research Institutions,"Universities and public research centers have been looking for ways to transfer technologies created in their research activities to companies that promote business and innovation. One of the strategies adopted is to provide technology licensing opportunities via the web. There are several studies in the literature that indicate the potential of the web for technology transfer and others that point out limitations, given the complexity of the technology market. This article investigates websites with technologies available for business at universities and public research centers in order to propose a classification of these sites based on design attributes and to identify aspects relevant to the users’ experience. Twenty public institutions of reference that occupy the first places in the international ranking of quality of presence on the web were considered for analysis. Based on this analysis, we propose a classification of websites composed of three types: proactive transactions, interactive search tools, and low interaction. The findings indicate widespread use of the web for the dissemination of technologies - all institutions have at least one website with patents or business inventions. The findings also suggest that proactive functionalities, quality of search engines, transactional resources and technology aggregators are relevant aspects for the users’ experience.","Nascimento Medeiros, Daniel;Tiradentes Souto, Virgínia",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,Universidade de Brasília,Innovation ;  Internet marketplaces for technology ;  Patent portfolio ;  Technology transfer portals ;  Web design
Methodology for Assessing Canadian Oil Sands Recoverable Resources,"Canadian oil sands resources have been developed on a considerable scale, and many oil companies have expanded their business to this new area. How to reasonably evaluate their recoverable resources is the premise for a project success. Taking an oil sands project as an example, recoverable bitumen of a oil sands project was calculated. Firstly, describe the geological characteristics of the area, complete necessary maps. Then prepare basic data for oil sands recoverable resources assessment. Thirdly, determine the distribution model and value of drainage area per well, EUR and drilling success rate, etc, analogized to the surrounding development areas and combined with research of the contract area. Finally, run the Monte Carlo simulation and get recoverable resources in the area. Cognition and conclusion: The geological and sedimentary characteristics of sandstone reservoirs hosted by oil sands are the basis for identifying sweet spots and non-sweet spots. Regional geological study of evaluation area, detailed geological and engineering evaluation of developed areas have a great impact on developable segment identification of oil sands reservoir and the rationality of resources evaluation. On basis of above solid work, it provides a solid foundation, objective parameter selection and reasonable result probability method for evaluating recoverable bitumen in a oil sand project. Innovation: Based on the geological study, combined with the data analysis of developed area, the sweet spots and non-sweet spots are depicted, and recoverable resources of oil sand are calculated by a probability method.","Shao, Xin jun;Yi, Yan jing;Fa, Gui fang;Li, Zhi yu",Book Series,Springer Series in Geomechanics and Geoengineering,2020-01-01,China National Petroleum Corporation,Oil sands ;  Probabilistic methodology ;  Recoverable resources

The effects of the exposure to an aromatic environment on students during university engineering final exam – a pilot study,"During the final exams some students feel some emotional pressure to solve it. The purpose of this study was to make a preliminary comparison in two groups of an engineering exam at the end of the semester that contains numerical procedures and uses Canvas as a Source of Learning Management System. For this study, 59 students participated, 29 constituted the study group, and 30 were the control group. In the study, lavender hydrolate was used as an aromatic environment, which was applied to the tables prior to the exam. Hydrolate has the same activity as essential oil, only it has soft smell. Both exams had the same number of questions, although different contexts. In addition to this study, an evaluation of smell was made in students using the Barcelona Smell Test-24, which is a good and reliable method to determine the detection, recognition and identification of different odors. From the results obtained from the control group, 61% felt stressed. The average time to solve the exam was 110 min. For the group to which hydrolate was applied at the desks, in the middle of the exam, 25% felt stressed. The average time to complete the exam was 93 min. The results of the olfaction test for the students were normal according to the BAST-24: 99% (detection), 78% (recognition/memory) and 72% (identification). Students who were in a lavender odor environment reported significantly an improvement in their well-being, and the time used to solve the exam was less than the control group. This is a pilot study of a didactic experience. The results showed that there is a decrease in the time to solve an exam of the study group compared with the control group for this research work. Future studies of the work environments should continue to be investigated at other activities during the semester as a useful alternative to the wellbeing of the students.","Reyes-Zárate, Gabriela G.;Rodríguez-Paz, Miguel X.;González-Mendívil, Jorge A.",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Tecnológico de Monterrey,Aromatic environment ;  Educational innovation ;  Higher education ;  Olfaction ;  Wellbeing
Product Innovation Redesign Method Based on Kansei Engineering and Customer Personality Type,"Most companies in modern society redesign to create new products. Redesign can improve product quality and shorten cycle time, but most redesign product innovations only modify a relevant reference element of the product, ignoring opportunities for redesign innovation brought about by factors affecting customer personality. This research introduces a product innovation redesign method based on kansei engineering and customer personality types. Based on customer personality types, three research goals were proposed.

Exploring the true motivation of faculty members to promote technological innovation in their courses,"The current study explores the motivation of lecturers to use technology in their teaching. Questionnaires were administered to 111 respondents. Results show that even those who said that they are unfamiliar with the system, also said that they lack the time to learn it. Differences were found between faculty members in the different departments. The research findings showed that faculty members had no interest in learning additional functions of the system. They were aware that they could use the system to perform additional operations but didn’t do so claiming that they lack the time to learn them and how to operate them. If so, it makes no sense to proceed to more advanced processes when no one is learning even those that already exist.","Davidovitch, Nitza;Eckhaus, Eyal",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Ariel University,Education ;  Technology ;  Technology assimilation

Disruptive Technologies - A promising key for Sustainable Future Education,"Modern disruptive technologies have changed almost every aspect of our everyday lives. Education is not an exception to this rule. Excitement about the role of technology in improving education is a good thing. Education is a segment that needs disruptive innovation. Today's global economy requires technologists to take the lead role in innovation and idea generation, although innovation is not a topic that is typically included in the curriculum. Traditional curriculum creates people who are efficient researchers and highly productive, but this approach does not encourage creativity or innovation. A computer inserted between faculty and students forces faculty to think a new about what a course aims to achieve rather than to continue with existing ways of designing and delivering a course. Technology prompts a pause in the usual thought patterns, encouraging reflection. Eventually a new understanding of how learning happens and what a course could be emerges. Research has found that educational technology, when used effectively, can significantly improve teaching and learning. The impact of technology on educational achievement is expected to grow with improvements in software and hardware. The educational resources of the Information Superhighway are growing rapidly. However, many students and teachers particularly those in high-poverty or rural schools and colleges have little access to these resources.","Gejendhiran, S.;Arokia Anicia, S.;Vignesh, S.;Kalaimani, M.",Conference Proceeding,Procedia Computer Science,2020-01-01,Jeppiaar Institute of Technology,Artificial Intelligence ;  Chat-based collaboration ;  Disruptive technologies
Blockchain and Organizational Characteristics: Towards Business Model Innovation,"Blockchain seems to challenge the current business models by providing opportunities for new value creation. However, several research gaps remain in literature in evaluating how firms can leverage new approaches to innovation management and opportunities created by blockchain. Supporting organizational characteristics affecting digital innovation management process also need attention in order to challenge the traditional theories while developing unique fundamental assumptions between innovation processes and outcomes. Thus, blockchain and organizational characteristics need to be understood as an encompassing, overarching and interrelated ecosystem in digital innovation management. Grounding on digitalization and innovation management, this research conceptualizes how blockchain technology and supporting organizational characteristics (i.e., R&D investment, strategic alignment, cultural support, top management knowledge and involvement, insights from customers and end-users) can be integrated for business model innovation. This research develops a conceptual framework involving multi-disciplinary collaborative actions that strengthen and empower business model innovation.","Shahzad, Khuram",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Vaasan Yliopisto,Blockchain technology ;  Business model innovation ;  Digital innovation ;  Digitalization ;  Industrial ecosystem ;  Innovation management process ;  Organizational characteristics
Balancing Innovation and Tangibility Using the Spiraled Agile Design Sprinting Approach,"Whether they seek to conduct scientific research or product development, practitioners of applied human factors and cognitive systems engineering must carefully consider how their resources shall be allocated to both yield innovation while ensuring tangibility to the outcomes of their work. For small businesses, academic teams, and consultants, these two objectives are oftentimes antithetic: Expanding resources towards one is done at the expense of the other. To solve this gap, we propose the Spiraled Agile Design Sprinting Approach (SPADES), an activity and schedule-based framework within which all stakeholders collaboratively optimize what they do and how, while ensuring that neither innovation nor tangibility is sacrificed for the other. We applied SPADES to research efforts in critical domains, ranging from aircraft maintenance and intelligence analysis to missile defense analytics and emergency management. We report here on the lessons learned over the course of these efforts.","Bruni, Sylvain",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,"Aptima, Inc",Agile development ;  Design thinking process ;  Innovation ;  Product design and development ;  Project and program management ;  SAFe ;  Sprints ;  Tangibility

Explorative analysis of AUV-aided cluster-based routing protocols for Internet of intelligent underwater sensors,"Contemporary innovations in underwater acoustic technology (UAT), smart systems (SS), vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET), micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with recent advancements in the field of Internet of underwater things (IoUT) have led to the development of interesting engineering solutions for underwater sensor networks (UWSN). UWSN performs collaborative event observation for adaptive decision-making through a specialized network of submerged sensors, surface sinks, and coastal base station by relying on interactive communication, intelligent computing, and smart sensing. UWSN is obviously a critical and essential asset for smart cities (SC) and because of the explosive potential of UWSN technology; it has been garnering increasing attention from academic researchers and industrial experts in various fields. However, the performance of UWSN applications is limited due to issues closely tied to the underwater environment such as surface noise, narrow bandwidth, long propagation delays, high-temperature gradients, bio-fouling, corrosion, and erratic water current activities. These issues lead to high-energy consumption, high deployment costs, rapid route failures, frequent retransmissions, low reliability, and other challenges that have instigated UWSN researchers to proffer solutions in the form of different routing protocols. Cluster-based routing (CBR) is one of these proposed solutions where the network adopts a dynamic hierarchical process of logically grouping the nodes into cluster heads (CHs) and cluster members (CMs) with respect to well-defined performance indicators. Researchers have also established that CBR protocols are relatively more versatile and capable of yielding better performance in terms of fault tolerance, resource awareness, and route efficiency for large-scale UWSNs. This chapter, therefore, discusses the architecture, network model, and technical features of AUV-aided water quality monitoring (WQM) as a target application for the Internet of intelligent underwater sensors. This research furthermore conducts an explorative analysis of state-of-the-art CBR protocols for UWSNs. This work conducts simulation-based network and statistical analysis to provide useful technical insights on the performance analysis of selected CBR protocols.","Salami, Abdulazeez Femi;Adedokun, Emmanuel Adewale;Al-Turjman, Fadi;Bello-Salau, Habeeb;Sadiq, Bashir Olaniyi;Dogo, Eustace M.",Book,Drones in Smart-Cities: Security and Performance,2020-01-01,Ahmadu Bello University;University of Ilorin;Yakın Doğu Üniversitesi;University of Johannesburg,autonomous underwater vehicle ;  cluster-based routing protocols ;  explorative analysis ;  Internet of intelligent underwater things ;  smart systems ;  underwater sensor network

Research and Construction of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Collaborative Education Pattern of Design Discipline,"Today’s economic development of China is facing changes in the industrial structure adjustment and upgrading. Design innovation has become an important engine to promote the development of the industrial revolution. However, compared with other countries, the Education about design discipline in China set up relatively late. With more than 40 years of development, the evolution speed of Chinese design education is not synchronized with the needs of industrial development. As a significant place of design education, there are many problems in Universities, such as unitary teaching pattern and inadequate students’ innovation and entrepreneurship training. Based on the analysis of several typical cases of innovation and entrepreneurship education in universities located in Shanghai, this paper explores to establish a “Five-in-one cooperative education pattern”, which means university, society, industry, scientific research institutions, and enterprises are supposed to cooperate closely. Moreover, by the construction of the “LCS training model” for innovation and Entrepreneurship talents, this research finds a way to optimize the teaching mode and training mechanism for innovation and entrepreneurship in the design discipline. Ultimately the design innovation will be integrated into the industrial chain which can make the design industry play a more critical role in the national innovation system.","Ding, Wei;Hu, Wenxin;Ye, Junnan",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,East China University of Science and Technology,Collaborative education mode ;  Design discipline ;  Innovation and entrepreneurship ;  LCS education mode

Research and Practice of Whole Process Product Design Innovation Theory System Based on Service Design Thinking,"With the coming of the information age, industrial design has entered the 4.0 era. The circulation of resources among designers, enterprises, suppliers and universities has been accelerating. At the same time, design has gradually developed from a single discipline to a multidisciplinary. The purpose of service design thinking is to mobilize the resources of designers, enterprises, multidisciplinary and all parties to co-create, so that the creativity gradually changes from closed innovation to open innovation. Therefore, under the background of the current era, “design” has gradually changed from simple product design to a full process service design, including demand analysis, product design, product landing, commercial operation and so on. Consequently, a scientific and systematic design service system can help designers and design enterprises to carry out efficient and low-risk design innovation, so as to enhance their competitiveness. Based on the practical cases of MOMA company, the whole process closed-loop service design innovation theoretical system of “four chain integration and seven step innovation” was put forwarded. Four chains include product chain, brand chain, interaction chain and service chain.","Ding, Wei;Chen, Defang;Ye, Junnan",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,East China University of Science and Technology,Four chain integration and seven step innovation ;  Product design ;  Service design
A Comparative Study on the Communication Effect of Stage Performance Promotion Platforms Based on User Experience,"With young people are away from traditional stage theaters, resulting in the loss of media for large stage performances. However, due to the innovation of digital media technology and the prevalence of consumerism, the new generation of users rely more on digital platforms to obtain entertainment information. Therefore, how to promote stage performances with the help of digital promotion platforms has become the key to media and even to enterprise research. At present, most stage performances in China rely on third-party platforms for promotion. However, they have problems including miscellaneous performance business, messy platform construction, etc., and thus hindering the further development of the platform. Therefore, this paper takes user experience as the entrance, uses experimental methods of cognitive neurology, and to establish a set of optimized communication strategies in line with user experience for the platforms.","Ji, Jingyi;Fu, Rongrong;Cheng, Jianxin",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,East China University of Science and Technology,Communication effect ;  Promotion platforms ;  Stage performance ;  User experience

Using AI to Enable Design for Diversity: A Perspective,"Inclusive design focuses on diversity. The contextualized user-sensitive design framework of the interaction system needs to analyze and deal with complex diversity factors, which challenges the traditional design process, tools, and methods. Therefore, new technological progress is needed to provide more innovation potential. The authors point out that the design process of smart products is evolving in response to uncertainty. In the future, diversity-oriented design will tend to allocate design resources and values in an algorithmic way rather than the compromised unity solution. This paper analyzes the limitations and potential of the application of AI technology represented by deep learning in diversity-oriented design practice and design research, puts forward the goal and direction of further research, and discusses the critical links of AI-enabled diversity design in interdisciplinary research environment.","Li, Fang;Dong, Hua;Liu, Long",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Tongji University;Loughborough University,Artificial intelligence ;  Diversity-oriented design ;  Inclusive design

World's first carbon sequestration project in salt caverns built offshore in ultra deep water in Brazil,"In 2006, giant oil fields were discovered in Brazil in a water depth of ~ 2200 m and under a caprock of 2000 m of continues salt rock overlaying the reservoirs, called pre-salt. Currently more than a half of the Brazilian oil and gas production comes from these reservoirs. However, some of these assets have big Oil & Gas ratio with a high level of CO2 contamination, which are currently being reinjected in the reservoirs. This procedure gradually increases the CO2 content associated with the oil extracted, reducing well productivity and leading to high costs of CO2 and CH4 separation by the membrane technology. The Research Center for Gas Innovation (RCGI) located at the State University of São Paulo in Brasil, sponsored by Shell Brazil, is developing a technology that uses the thick layer of salt rock overlying the pre-salt reservoirs to build caverns where the contaminated gas will be injected and decontaminated. After 2 years of extensive research, several studies have been carried out to analyze the main critical aspects of the technology in order to evaluate its feasibility, and now it has been decided to advance to the field proof stage. The salt dome studied can accommodate the construction of 15 caverns, thus providing the confinement of approximately 108 million tons of CO2. Before the system be construct in full scale, it was decided to initially build an experimental cavern with smaller size to obtain field parameters of the final design of the caverns. This paper describes this development denominated Offshore Salt Cavern Ultra-deep Water CCS System, that aims to perform the natural gas storage, a natural gravitational separation between CO2 / CH4 inside the caverns, and the confinement of CO2 (CCS). It presents important results related to structural integrity analysis of the giant and experimental caverns, well design using the same methodology applied in more than 200 projects of the pre-salt oil wells, instrumentation plan of the experimental cavern, storage capacities and other relevant data. If the economics proves feasible, this offshore gas storage station will be the first of its kind and possibly the biggest CCS Project in the world.","da Costa, Pedro Vassalo Maia;da Costa, Alvaro Maia;Meneghini, Julio Romano;Nishimoto, Kazuo;Assi, Gustavo;Ebecken, Nelson Francisco Favilla;Rosa, Luiz Pinguelli;de Oliveira Miranda, Antonio Carlos;Goulart, Mariana Barbero Ribeiro;Bergsten, Andre;Brandão, Camila",Conference Proceeding,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,2020-01-01,Universidade de Brasília;Universidade de São Paulo;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro;MODECOM - TECHNOLOGY IN GEOMECHANICS AND COMPUTING MODELING;Shell Brazil,Carbon dioxide storage ;  Carnalite ;  Creep strain rate ;  Rock salt: Halite ;  Salt caverns ;  Stability analysis ;  Tachyhydrite
A Holistic Approach to Inclusive Mobility Under Resilience and Sustainability Goals: A Pilot Project in Brazil,"Today’s societies are dependent on increasingly complex and interdependent safety-critical systems with often poorly understood vulnerabilities. If their provision of service is cut off or drastically reduced, the dependent activities will either fail or perform at a lower level. Transport systems are a good example of such propensity to natural and man-made disruptions. Due to their complexity, uncertainty, and safety criticality, Mobility offers a high number of opportunities for research and innovation, particularly in the present technological era. Thus, objectives like disaster risk reduction, sustainable development strategies, and sustainable transport, are nowadays included as well. The holistic approach is based on the principle of promoting inclusive mobility without creating any negative impact in other areas of each targeted community, thus requires an integrated perspective of the work towards inclusion under safety, sustainability and resilience conditions.","Romao, Magaly;Simoes, Anabela",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Lusófona University;Prefeitura Municipal de Rio Verde,Inclusion ;  Mobility ;  Resilience ;  Sustainability ;  Transport
Advances in bioresorbable electronics and uses in biomedical sensing,"Modern electronics are fundamental not only to medical diagnostics, data acquisition and storage, and communication in healthcare at large, but are increasingly imperative to next-generation implantable biomedical devices and treatments. The new and expanding class of bioresorbable electronics capable of complete transience, or degradation, in physiological environments promises to enable surgical implantation without subsequent removal of the device. In situ degradation of such devices attenuates or circumvents downfalls of non-resorbable acute implants not limited to costs and complications of surgical device removal in addition to foreign body responses and potential sequelae from tissue obstruction. Transient biomedical electronics thus represent a critical leap toward translatable diagnostic, monitoring, and acute treatment devices. This chapter provides an overview of the developments of the composition and processing methods used to design bioresorbable electronic medical devices since the first fully transient electronic device in 2012. Applications of bioresorbable electronics from biosensing and tissue engineering to controlled drug release, wireless communication, and energy and memory storage are highlighted along with current research in methods enabling on-demand transience for preset device lifetimes and multifunctionality. The authors expect that this chapter will provide an insightful discussion on the progression of bioresorbable electronics for medical applications outlining materials and pertinent novel devices to guide future innovations of transient electronic devices for improving clinical care and patient-specific medicine.","Kuzma, Michelle;Gerhard, Ethan;Shan, Dingying;Yang, Jian",Book,Interfacing Bioelectronics and Biomedical Sensing,2020-01-01,Pennsylvania State University,Bioelectronic ;  Bioresorbable electronics ;  Bioresorbable materials ;  Flexible electronics ;  Implantable devices ;  Medical devices ;  Transient electronics

Institutional co-operation models for enhanced utilization of research infrastructure in the BSR: Case of Latvia,"The aim of this study is to analyse cross institutional co-operation of scientific institutes in the Baltic Sea Region. This is done by assessing the outcomes from eight expert panel discussions at national and the Baltic Sea Region level. This was done for three science areas: material science, life sciences and welfare state. Furthermore, sectorial and consolidated conclusions were validated by international experts. Aggregated analyses were conducted using previous results at standardised five criteria framework and compared to similar research performed by other BSR countries. This study was aimed to analyse and identify main factors determining the development of sustainable and long-term collaboration around existing or new different size research infrastructures, to assess catalysing mechanisms for the growth of local and transnational user base as an efficient new knowledge creation, commercialisation and innovation base around RIs. Differences in short- and medium-term strategic objectives, and funding allocations, dominance of competition factors over collaboration, and motives for joint actions need to be considered in order to increase research performance and facilitate transnational collaboration in the BSR. Collaboration in the use of scientific infrastructure can be productive, if we jointly collect external talent or destructive, if it is limited by brain drain policy and fierce competition for talent implemented by research facility owners or operators. The study identifies the impact of key factors, contradictions and shortcomings, which has led to the development of consolidated conclusions, recommendations for increasing the capability of large-scale science facilities through the improved co-operation models. The last also includes elaborated analysis of the governance models for the research infrastructure.","Timofejevs, Aivars;Avotins, Valdis",Conference Proceeding,Engineering for Rural Development,2020-01-01,RISEBA University of Applied Sciences;Stockholm School of Economics in Riga;Ventspils University of Applied Sciences;Oxford Research Baltics,Co-operation ;  Large-scale research facility ;  Research infrastructure ;  Talent attraction
Determinants of technological innovation capabilities: Using fuzzy-DEMATEL and ANP,"This paper applies Fuzzy-DEMATEL and ANP to analyse the decisive determinants of technological innovation capabilities (TICs) and the weight relation in high-tech and traditional manufacturing industries. Technological innovation capabilities comprise various features that are complex and interrelated. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to clarify the causal relationship of the various features to precisely provide the enterprises with some determinants to maximize the effectiveness of resource utilization. In terms of dimension, the research shows that the innovation management capability is the decisive factor of technological innovation capabilities for high-tech industry and traditional manufacturing industry, which affects the other five dimensions. However, in terms of criteria, learning capabilities are decisive determinants. Therefore, in the face of competitive environment with continuous shortening of the product life cycle and rapidly changing customer demands, overall, in order to enhance innovation capabilities, enterprises must focus on the improvement of innovation management capabilities. In regard to the detail factors, the enterprises must enhance the learning capabilities to recognize, absorb and make use of knowledge from the internal organization in order to strengthen the knowledge management capability, the innovative decisionmaking capability and technology of the enterprise itself.","Huang, Chien Ke;Wu, Chi Hui;Li, Jing;Hsieh, Chih Ling",Conference Proceeding,"FEMIB 2020 - Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Finance, Economics, Management and IT Business",2020-01-01,National Open University;Da-Yeh University;Tainjin Normal University,ANP ;  Fuzzy DEMATEL ;  Technological Innovation Capabilities

Creating a Physical Bridge Between Management and Leadership as a Strategy to Improve Organization Performance Analysis,"Managers are defined by their roles, responsibilities and characteristics aligned with the business goals and objective. In this, regard, the performance of the Organization, largely depend on the quality of management and leadership activities. In many cases, lack of managerial experience, incompetency, lack of leadership skills and inappropriate work experience are the major contributory factor to organizational and business failures. From studies, a major challenge within organizations is associated with restricted channels for innovation in decision-making and process optimization for managers. High emphasis on following the standardized processes, and procedures is another identified challenge. The gap between management and leadership strategies is often phenomenal. Most of the managers use the management functions of controlling, organizing, planning and directing for the applications of principles in connecting resources effectively and achieving the organizational goal without using their own personal strategies. Managers’ are generally trained to follow the policies, processes and procedures handed by their seniors whereas; leaders are there to create solutions to problems encountered in the organization on continuous basis. It is important for managers to equip themselves with both leadership and management skills, in order to be multi-facetted on problem solving without following the standardized processes and procedures. The controlling, planning, organizing and directing role of managers will be highly effective when it is merged with the leadership skills and roles in achieving objectives of that policy. It requires the art of leadership skills to motivate employees towards achieving the common goal set by the organization. Under the inadequate management systems, the members of the organization would pursue their own daily agenda which results in resource and time misuse, causing various failure loops in an organization. The research reviews methods applied in different instances and it communicates the inferences identified based on obvious patterns and correlations that have effectively worked for organizations burdened with similar challenges.","Ramere, Domininc M.;Laseinde, Opeyeolu Timothy",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,University of Johannesburg,Leadership ;  Management ;  Management role ;  Material ;  Organization ;  Performance analysis ;  Planning ;  Problem solving
Emerging trends in inhaled drug delivery,"Ideally, inhaled therapy is driven by the needs of specific disease management. Lung biology interfaces with inhaler performance to allow optimal delivery of therapeutic agent for disease treatment. Inhalation aerosol products consist of the therapeutic agent, formulation, and device. The manufacturing specifications on each of the components, and their combination, allow accurate and reproducible control of measures of quality and in-vitro performance. These product variables in combination with patient variables, including co-ordination skill during inhaler use, intrinsic lung biology, disease and consequent pulmonary function, contribute to drug safety and efficacy outcomes. Due to the complexity of pulmonary drug delivery, predicting biological outcomes from first principles has been challenging. Ongoing research appears to offer new insights that may allow accurate prediction of drug behavior in the lungs. Disruptive innovations were characteristic of research and development in inhaled drug delivery at the end of the last century. Although there were relatively few new inhaled products launched in the first decade of the new millennium it was evident that the earlier years of exploration resulted in maturation of commercially successful technologies. A significant increase in new and generic products has occurred in the last decade and technical, regulatory and disease management trends are emerging. Some of these developments can trace their origins to earlier periods of creativity in the field while others are a reflection of advances in other areas of basic and computer, sciences and engineering. Select biological and technical advances are highlighted with reflections on the potential to impact future clinical and regulatory considerations.","Hickey, Anthony J.",Journal,Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,2020-01-01,RTI International;UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy,Aerosols ;  Biopharmaceutics ;  Inhalers ;  Lungs ;  Particle size ;  Particles

Findings: The review finds innovation education to be an emerging field with multiple concepts and frameworks in need of consolidation. Additionally, there is a marked dominance of this subject in traditional domains such as engineering, business, medicine and little or no presence in nontraditional domains such as humanities or social sciences. Challenges remain in the field for the development of standardized effectiveness measurement techniques. Originality/value: This article puts forward a case for considering scholarship on innovation education as a unique field on its own and examines previous work in this domain to understand the emerging frameworks, pedagogy, evaluations and definitions. By doing so, the article aims to offer guidance for the adoption of innovation education, as well as creating a foundation for further research in this area by highlighting the gaps in the existing literature.","Chandra, Praveena;Tomitsch, Martin;Large, Maryanne",Journal,European Journal of Innovation Management,2020-01-01,The University of Sydney,Education ;  Innovation ;  Programs

Information technology asymmetry and gaps between higher education institutions and industry,"Aim/Purpose This paper investigates the gaps between industry and academia perceptions of information technology fields, such as computer science, software engi-neering, and computer engineering, and it identifies areas of asymmetry be-tween curricula and industry expectations. The study mainly focuses on the skills required of IT professionals (graduated students) and on how higher education institutes equip students for industry. Background Higher education institutes have several IT-related departments. However, it is not clear whether these departments have sufficient content to equip stu-dents with industry-related skills. Rapid advances mean that some curriculum topics are redundant before the end of a standard two-or four-year degree programs. Balancing the technical/non-technical skills and adjusting the cur-ricula to better prepare the students for industry is a constant demand for higher education institutions. Several studies have demonstrated that a ge-neric curriculum is inadequate to address current IT industry needs. Methodology The study involved a comprehensive survey of IT professionals and compa-nies using a Web-based questionnaire sent directly to individual companies, academics, and employers. 64 universities and 38 companies in 24 countries were represented by the 209 participants, of whom 99 were IT professionals, 72 academics, and 38 employers. Contribution This paper is intended to guide academics in preparing dynamic curricula that can be easily adapted to current industry trends and technological develop-ments, with content directly relevant to student's careers. In addition, the re-sults may identify the skills that students need to secure employment and the courses that will provide skills in line with current industry trends. Findings The results indicate a lack of emphasis on personal and non-technical skills in undergraduate education compared to general computer science, software de-velopment, and coding courses. Employers' and software experts' responses emphasize that soft skills should not be ignored, and that, of these, analytical thinking and teamwork are the two most requested. Rather than a theoretical emphasis, courses should include hands-on projects. Rapid developments and innovations in information technologies demand that spiral and waterfall models are replaced with emerging software development models, such as Agile and Scrum development. Recommendations for Practitioners A multidisciplinary approach should be taken to the teaching of soft skills, such as communication, ethics, leadership, and customer relations. Establish-ing multiple learning tracks in IT education would equip students with special-ized knowledge and skills in IT. An effective communication channel should be established between students and industry. It is also important to reduce the distance between academics and students and to provide an interactive en-vironment for technical discussions. Enterprise level computing and Frame-work use provide job market advantages. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers and department heads, particularly those involved in curriculum design and accreditation, could use the results of this exemplary study to identify key topics for attention. Impact on Society Changes of various degrees are required in the current curricula in many higher education institutions to better meet student needs. Societies and tech-nology are dynamic in nature, and information technology-related curricula in higher education institutions should be equally dynamic. Future Research Since technology (especially information technology) transforms and ad-vances itself so rapidly, this study should be replicated t to investigate how these changes affect the gap between revised curricula and current industry expectations.","Sahin, Yasar Guneri;Celikkan, Ufuk",Journal,Journal of Information Technology Education: Research,2020-01-01,Izmir Ekonomi Üniversitesi,Asymmetry in software education ;  Higher education and industry gaps ;  Infor-mation technology education
High skilled workers mobility in spain and europe: Motivations and implications,"Competing today through innovation requires attracting and retaining a high-skilled work-force. Compared to less skilled workers, high-skilled workers have a higher mobility. In order to help businesses and governments to create strategies that leverage or counter this high mobility of workers, this research explores the motivations and implications of regional concentration for high-skilled workers. The study analyses how the characteristics of the labor market and the dynamics of agglomeration of knowledge create incentives for the local concentration of engineers and scientists. The concentration of high-skilled workers is studied in Spain and Europe. At the empirical level the research shows how strong are the flows of workers moving from less-innovative regions to Madrid and Catalonia, since in some of these less-innovative regions more than 40 per cent of science and engineering engineers migrate. In Europe, the results show two coexistent phenomena: islands of innovation in some countries that attract most of the high-skilled workforce from that country and valleys of innovations formed by interconnected innovative regions. These regional concentrations of engineers and scientists are explained by unemployment rates of skills-exporting regions and greater concentrations of innovative activities. In this sense, the results suggest that the prospects for a future professional career rather than wage disparity is the most influencing factor in the regional concentration of high-skilled workers.","Giménez-Fernández, Elena M.;Sandulli, Francesco D.",Journal,UCJC Business and Society Review,2020-01-01,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,Education ;  High-Skills ;  Innovation

From service systems engineering to service innovation - A modeling approach,"Due to the advent of digitization, service innovation has become even more important for both business and service research alike. Current service systems engineering approaches have employed a recombinant perspective that follows innovation mechanisms to leverage existing company resources for new service innovations. Employing these innovation mechanisms is still challenging, since there is little support on how to structure and identify these mechanisms. We propose a model-based service system engineering approach to structure existing resources into one formal model, enabling the formalization of service innovation mechanisms. The formalized service innovation mechanisms allow for a graphical illustration and enable future research to apply functions to analyze how innovation impacts entire or specific parts of service systems. Furthermore, the mathematical model enables an object-oriented value-driven perspective on service systems and is basis for graphical software tools. We contribute to literature by formalizing service innovations and its mechanisms in the context of service systems and by combining concepts of service innovation and service systems engineering. We do so by a) formalizing service innovation mechanisms and b) demonstrating the application of formal service innovations along one specific software implementation case. For practice, the service system model can with simulating the effects of service innovations.","Li, Mahei Manhai;Peters, Christoph",Conference Proceeding,"27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019",2020-01-01,University of St. Gallen;Universität Kassel,Operational service systems ;  Service innovation ;  Service science ;  Service system model ;  Service systems ;  Service systems modelling
Investigation of Schizophrenia with Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe neuropsychiatric condition manifested by cognitive, emotional, affective, perceptual, and behavioral abnormalities. Despite decades of research, the biological substrates driving the signs and symptoms of the disorder remain elusive, thus hampering progress in the development of treatments aimed at disease etiologies. The recent emergence of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models has provided the field with a highly innovative approach to generate, study, and manipulate living neural tissue derived from patients, making possible the exploration of fundamental roles of genes and early-life stressors in disease-relevant cell types. Here, we begin with a brief overview of the clinical, epidemiological, and genetic aspects of the condition, with a focus on schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder. We then highlight relevant technical advancements in hiPSC models and assess novel findings attained using hiPSC-based approaches and their implications for disease biology and treatment innovation. We close with a critical appraisal of the developments necessary for both further expanding knowledge of schizophrenia and the translation of new insights into therapeutic innovations.","Powell, Samuel K.;O’Shea, Callan P.;Shannon, Sara Rose;Akbarian, Schahram;Brennand, Kristen J.",Book Series,Advances in Neurobiology,2020-01-01,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,CRISPR genome engineering ;  Disease modeling ;  Human induced pluripotent stem cells ;  Psychiatric genomics ;  Schizophrenia
"Technological structure for technology integration in the classroom, inspired by the maker culture","Aim/Purpose This paper presented the framework for the integration of digital technolo-gies in education, implemented in InTecEdu Program, developed by Remote Experimentation Laboratory (RExLab), Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil. Background The main objective of the model presented is to arouse interest in science and technology among adolescents. Therefore, it sought to develop STEM competencies (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in chil-dren and adolescents. Understanding learning in STAM areas can favor the development of professionals who can supply the demand in related sectors, especially in the scientific-technological scope. To fulfill the main objective, strategies related to students and teachers were developed. With activities aimed at students, it was hoped to promote vocations to scientific-technolog-ical careers and encourage entrepreneurship. On the other hand, the activities related to teachers aimed at training them to integrate technology into their lesson plans. Inspired by the Maker Culture, the model sought to make it possible for teachers to become the main agents in the process of integrating technology in their lesson plans, since they were in charge of building and producing their digital content and other resources to support their didactic activities. The maker movement is a technological extension of the ""Do It Yourself!"" culture, which encourages ordinary people to build, modify, repair, and manufacture their objects, with their own hands. The training actions were preceded by a diagnosis, inspired by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, as well as the lesson plans prepared and made available by the teachers. Methodology Methodologically, the framework's work plan was composed of five Work Packages (WP), which include management, resource mapping, strategies re-lated to teachers, strategies related to students, and the dissemination and ex-ploitation of results. In the 2014-2018 period, 367 teachers participated in training activities, intending to integrate technologies into lesson plans. At the end of 2018, 27 Basic Education schools, including an indigenous and a rural school, from the public-school system, in the states of Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, and the Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, using the project's Vir-tual Learning Environment (VLE). In these 70 teachers, 230 classes, and 6,766 students accessed didactic content, produced by teachers, at VLE. Also, 20 laboratories were available in 26 instances, for use in practical activi-ties in disciplines in the STEM areas. Specifically, in the STEM areas, 3,360 students from 98 classes from 9 schools had integrated the Remote Labora-tories, in lesson plans in the subjects of Physics and Biology (High School), Science (Elementary School). Contribution The main results of the application of the framework are related to the train-ing of human resources, knowledge production, and educational innovation. About the training of human resources, we sought to contribute to the train-ing of teachers concerning technology in education and, with that, arouse greater interest on the part of students, as well as obtain improvements in their learning from teaching methodologies supported on the use of digital technologies. On the other hand, the production of knowledge, in the pro-gram and the socialization of research, is favored by the model based on open-source resources, both in terms of software and hardware and with open educational resources. This characteristic favor and expands the poten-tial for reapplying research and, consequently, its contribution to educational innovation. Findings The results, about students, indicated an increase in motivation due to the creation of new teaching and learning opportunities. The fact of extending the classroom and school, through remote laboratories, to support practical activities and the use of VLE, was also pointed out as a very positive factor. On the other hand, the realization of the workshops, inspired by practices of the Maker Culture, provided an approximation of these to the skills of the real world, which will certainly favor their employability. Regarding the teach-ers, it is noticed the continuity and expansion in the use of technological re-sources in the classroom; many sought and have participated in new training actions. Recommendations for Practitioners Provision of a repository of practices for sharing and reuse of lesson plans developed by teachers participating in the research. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students. Recommendations for Researchers Technical documents, manuals, and guides for remote laboratories. Data col-lected in the applied questionnaires. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students. Impact on Society The main results of the framework application are related to human re-sources formation, knowledge production, and educational innovation. Re-garding the formation of human resources, we sought to contribute to the formation of teachers concerning technology in education and, about the stu-dents the creation of teaching and learning opportunities, to extend the class-room and also the school, through the remote laboratories, to support the practical activities and the use of the VLE.

An evaluation model of the learning effect of physical education major courses in colleges,"There are several problems with the evaluation of the learning effect of physical education (PE) major courses in colleges, namely, the diversity of constraints and the lack of multiple perspectives. To solve the problems, this paper puts forward a novel model to evaluate the said learning effect. Firstly, the authors identified the problems and principles of learning effect evaluation of PE major courses in colleges, and established an evaluation index system from the perspectives of teachers and students. On this basis, an effective evaluation algorithm was developed to quantify the learning effect through gray clustering analysis. The proposed evaluation model can accurately assess the learning effect of PE major courses. The research findings enjoy great significance in theoretical innovation and engineering application.","Tong, Shimin",Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2020-01-01,Chongqing Technology and Business University,Colleges ;  Evaluation algorithm ;  Evaluation system ;  Physical education (PE)

Sincerity is a dangerous thing: On how appropriability regimes shape innovation strategies,"Since the pioneering work of David J. Teece ('Profiting from technological innovation: Implications for integration, collaboration, licensing and public policy', Research Policy 15, 1986), the concept of 'appropriability regime' - defined as the level of threat stemming from potential imitators in the firm's environment- has been useful in describing specific sectoral patterns at the aggregate level. However, there have been few attempts to formally prove the impact of different regimes on knowledge management strategies at the firm-level. Using firm-level longitudinal data from software and hardware sectors in Spain, we show that differences in appropriability regimes condition the profitability of open innovation strategies, and also induce specific patterns in firms' knowledge management strategies. More specifically, we show that the appearance of diminishing returns from an open innovation strategy is more accelerated in firms immersed in weaker regimes (i.e. firms facing more threats from potential imitators). We also show that this is due to the fact that such firms must resort to more complex (and costly) practices that go far beyond the legal protection of intellectual property, internalizing other management practices related to productive capacity and the commercialization of innovations.","Salazar-Elena, Juan Carlos;López, Asunción;Guimón De Ros, José;Cancino, Christian A.",Journal,Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems,2020-01-01,Universidad Autónoma de Madrid;Universidad de Chile,appropriability regime ;  imitation threat ;  Innovation ;  knowledge management

Building research capacity in BRICS and beyond: Lessons from the international community,"Research capacity building and research productivity are essential to the economic flourishing of any nation. Over the past decade, innovation and investment in research and development in BRICS countries-especially India and China-have strongly contributed to their economic growth. The scholarly literature shows that the five-member states have high numbers of (a) university graduates-especially in the fields of engineering and computer science-and (b) research outputs-mainly quantitative. The issue, however, is that the quality of BRICS graduates is sometimes questionable, and the nations are not considered as relevant global players when it comes to the research impact factor. To that end, it is essential to align quantity with quality in BRICS' higher education institutions. As growing economies, BRICS need to increase their investment in higher education and research capacity building to maximise their economic prosperity. Researchers who are knowledge producers and innovators can be considered the foremost role players in transferring university research to society. Therefore, investing in quality development and support is of the essence. This article is based on the voices of 32 international scholars affiliated with the Comparative Education Society in Europe. The respondents shared their views via an open-ended survey about: (a) the development of globally competent researchers; (b) the expectations placed on present-day researchers; and (c) the demands researchers face in terms of research productivity. The findings indicate that, regardless of the context, researchers are confronted with similar demands, namely: to secure funding; engage in international and interdisciplinary research projects; and produce tangible outputs. It is also evident that research capacity building at respondents' respective institutions needs enhancement in order to align with the current research demands.","Niemczyk, Ewelina Kinga",Journal,"Space and Culture, India",2020-01-01,North-West University,BRICS countries ;  Globally competent researchers ;  International qualitative study ;  Research capacity ;  Research productivity
Forma mentis networks map how nursing and engineering students enhance their mindsets about innovation and health during professional growth,"Reconstructing a ""forma mentis"", a mindset, and its changes, means capturing how individuals perceive topics, trends and experiences over time. To this aim we use forma mentis networks (FMNs), which enable direct, microscopic access to how individuals conceptually perceive knowledge and sentiment around a topic, providing richer contextual information than machine learning. FMNs build cognitive representations of stances through psycholinguistic tools like conceptual associations from semantic memory (free associations, i.e., one concept eliciting another) and affect norms (valence, i.e., how attractive a concept is). We test FMNs by investigating how Norwegian nursing and engineering students perceived innovation and health before and after a 2-month research project in e-health. We built and analysed FMNs by six individuals, based on 75 cues about innovation and health, and leading to 1,000 associations between 730 concepts. We repeated this procedure before and after the project. When investigating changes over time, individual FMNs highlighted drastic improvements in all students' stances towards ``teamwork'', ``collaboration'', ``engineering'' and ``future'', indicating the acquisition and strengthening of a positive belief about innovation. Nursing students improved their perception of `robots'' and ``technology'' and related them to the future of nursing. A group-level analysis related these changes to the emergence, during the project, of conceptual associations about openness towards multidisciplinary collaboration, and a positive, leadershiporiented group dynamics. The whole group identified ``mathematics'' and ``coding'' as highly relevant concepts after the project. When investigating persistent associations, characterising the core of students' mindsets, network distance entropy and closeness identified as pivotal in the students' mindsets concepts related to ``personal well-being'', ``professional growth'' and ``teamwork''. This result aligns with and extends previous studies reporting the relevance of teamwork and personal well-being for Norwegian healthcare professionals, also within the novel e-health sector. Our analysis indicates that forma mentis networks are powerful proxies for detecting individual-and grouplevel mindset changes due to professional growth. FMNs open new scenarios for datainformed, multidisciplinary interventions aimed at professional training in innovation.","Stella, Massimo;Zaytseva, Anna",Journal,PeerJ Computer Science,2020-01-01,Universitetet i Agder;Complex Science Consulting,Attitude ;  Complex networks ;  Education ;  Entropy ;  Healthcare ;  Learning outcomes ;  Mindset modelling ;  Psycholinguistics ;  Stance detection ;  STEM
Prospects for collaborative industrial doctoral education in Russia,"The article proposes recommendations on the development of collaborative industrial doctoral education in Russian conditions considering international experience and provides a justification for the Russian high-tech companies' demand for the competences of graduates of the collaborative doctoral programs. The regression analysis of patent and innovation activity indicators of Russian high-tech companies on the share of employed with academic degrees showed that successful graduates of Russian doctoral schools with specialization in technical sciences have an option to apply their research competences in the real sector of the economy. This determines the need to develop and put into practice specialized doctoral programs aimed at training scientific and engineering personnel for high-tech companies in the form of collaboration with industrial partners. Such programs can be implemented using the industrial PhD model, which is based on a research project in the interests of the employer with dual scientific supervision and funding of the study at the expense of the employer. Collaborative industrial doctoral programs require a longer training duration than traditional academic doctoral programs, as well as a reduced classroom load, especially concerning pedagogical and general disciplines. Grants, tax credits and preferential treatment for procurement by large state-owned companies can be used to encourage Russian high-tech companies with high research and development costs to become industrial partners of doctoral schools.","Teslenko, Valentina A.;Melnikov, Roman M.",Journal,Vysshee Obrazovanie v Rossii,2020-01-01,Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration;Institute of Public Administration and Civil Service;Russian-French Centre for Education and Consulting,Collaboration ;  High-tech companies ;  Industrial doctoral programs ;  Industrial partners ;  Innovative development ;  Practice-oriented doctoral education ;  Research project

A formal basis for business model evaluation with linguistic summaries: (Work-in-progress paper),"Given its essential role in understanding, explaining and structuring digital innovation, we see the increased prevalence of the business model concept as a unit of analysis in IS research. In contemporary, fast-paced markets, business models are volatile in nature and should be continuously innovated to accommodate new customer needs and technology developments. Business model innovation can be considered as an iterative process to guide business models from ideation towards implementation, in which the proper evaluation of business model prototypes is essential. For this evaluation, we need normative guidance, tools and rules to understand the relative performance of a new business model design. In the early design phases, this implies dealing with high levels of uncertainty. A few techniques and methods have been proposed for this purpose, but these lack the formal basis required for systematical application and development of automated evaluation tools. As a novel approach, we have earlier proposed the application of linguistic summarization to support early-phase, soft-quantitative business model evaluation. In this paper, we focus on a structural formalization of this approach as the basis for the development of well-defined user guidelines and automated evaluation tools. In doing so, we bridge the existing gap between qualitative and quantitative business model evaluation. We demonstrate the formalization by means of a running case inspired by a real-world project in the highly dynamic urban mobility domain.","Gilsing, Rick;Wilbik, Anna;Grefen, Paul;Turetken, Oktay;Ozkan, Baris",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2020-01-01,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Business model evaluation ;  Business models ;  Formal model ;  Linguistic summarization
Innovative robot for educational robotics and STEM,"This paper aims to present the design of a low-cost, open-source, robotic platform for use in Educational Robotics and SΤΕΜ as a holistic approach to the curriculum. In alignment with the research presented in [1] the robotic platform’s innovation is based on two axes: (a) its specifications came from the 1st cycle of participatory action research; (b) it is equipped with a visual programming language integrated into the robot’s “brain” itself so that it can be programmed by any device (smartphone, tablet, PC) with Wi-Fi connectivity, without the need for any software or app to be downloaded and installed in the device. The spark for this research arose from an educational robotics survey’s data evaluation handled at the municipality of Agia Varvara in Athens-Greece which, while showing a strong students interest in educational robotics, however few of them got involved because of the robotic platform’s high cost. So, this research’s motivation was to go on designing and developing a robotic platform suitable for the whole educational community that the specifications based on its members’ needs and extracted by quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis tools.","Chatzopoulos, Avraam;Papoutsidakis, Michail;Kalogiannakis, Michail;Psycharis, Sarantos",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,University of West Attica;School of Pedagogical and Technological Education;University of Crete,Action research ;  Educational Robotics ;  Robot ;  STEM ;  VPL
Science and Technic Revolution’s Impact on the Economic Development of Germany in 16<sup>th</sup> – 19<sup>th</sup> Centuries,"The authors consider how the introduction of new equipment and technologies into the German economy of the 16th–19th centuries led to new opportunities in the economy, to direct and side effects in the development of science and technology on the basis of the concept of global history, the theory of the nexus of science and production of N. Rosenberg and L. Beardzell and the concept of global economic history of R. Allen. Engineers of the 19th century used the technical inventions of the 18th century, originally created for one industry, in the widest areas. The introduction of new energy sources led to the appearance of by-products and the development of the corresponding branches of science and economics. The widespread use of technical innovations led to the development of transport infrastructure and a reliable communication system, which had a beneficial effect on the development of trade, labor migration and the supply of industry with raw materials. The introduction of technology required the attraction of large investments, which led to the creation of joint-stock companies and investment banks. This allowed the German Empire to eventually circumvent Great Britain with industrial production and foreign trade. The rapid development of the natural sciences and the introduction of technology in production were caused by the success of polytechnic education in Germany. On the one hand, the key engineering and technical personnel of German companies had a higher education, and on the other hand, university research workers themselves made discoveries that would increase production efficiency and create new products.","Boldyrev, Roman Yu;Boldyreva, Slavyana Yu;Vakhabova, Asiyat A.;Tychina, Olga L.",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,2020-01-01,"Federal State Educational Institution of Higher Education, Volgograd State Agricultural University;Northern (Arctic) Federal University;Nyagan College of Technology",N53 ;  N63 ;  N73 ;  O31 ;  O33

Scientific and technical potential of sustainable development of an oil and gas company: Problems of formation,"Currently, research and technology play a key role in the successful response of oil and gas companies to strategic challenges and economic requirements in the energy field. Technological innovation is the most important factor in the oil and gas industry, from exploration to hydrocarbon processing. It includes the stages of research, improvement and distribution of relevant products, processes and technologies. Using new technological developments, creating and commercializing new products, applying innovative production processes, the domestic oil and gas industry is able to effectively solve problems regarding its competitiveness. The key direction underlying the implementation of all types of strategic technology-oriented activities within the framework of the implementation of the company's sustainable development strategy is the strengthening of the role of innovation in technology management, both at the enterprise level and in the engineering (service) departments of the company. Innovation plays a significant role in supporting long-term R&D activities and is making an increasing contribution to the implementation of engineering functions and activities within specific investment projects. In this regard, the effective integration of experience gained from tactical engineering functions with the definition of long-term R&D functions should contribute to the main contribution to the profit obtained both in the short and long term. Numerous innovative studies have allowed us to obtain deep and ambitious knowledge regarding the innovation process itself. However, a number of complex methodological and practical problems related to the creation of a corporate structure for managing innovative processes have not yet been resolved. The main difficulties are in a comprehensive assessment of innovative proposals and the commercialization of R&D in the face of risk and uncertainty, as part of relevant innovative projects.","Andreev, A.

The Relationship Between Patent Characteristics and Patent Litigation in the Patent Pool of High-Tech Enterprises,"Patent-based competition of high-tech enterprise is becoming more and more fierce, and patent litigation between enterprises comes one after another. As the complexity of technology innovation has increased dramatically, it is difficult for a company to have all advanced technologies, so patent pools spring up and develop rapidly. Patent with what characteristics in the patent pool of high-tech enterprises is more likely to cause patent litigation? Are there any differences between litigated patent and non-litigation patent? It is of great significance for both patent management of patent pools and technology innovation of high-tech enterprises. Based on the 2028 US patents of 12 patent pools of MPEGLA, the paper studies the effects of patent scope, patent lifetime, patent citation, and patent pool effect on the odds of patent litigation. There are different characteristics between litigated patent and non-litigation patent. Technology coverage, number of claims, maintenance time, forward citation, and patent pools have positive effects, while the number of patents in the pool, backward citation of patents, and patent families have negative effects on the odds of patent litigation.","Lai, Liubin;Zhang, Yunsheng",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Hunan International Economics University;Central South University,High-tech enterprise ;  Patent characteristic ;  Patent litigation ;  Patent pool ;  Patent value

Formation of design and research competencies in future teachers in the framework of STEAM education,"In today's digital society and economy, professions associated with high technologies are becoming increasingly in demand: programmers, system engineers, IT specialists, biotechnologists, project leaders, etc. In this regard, school graduates should have not just good knowledge of school subjects, but also interdisciplinary knowledge, the formation of which is a long process, starting already in school, and cannot be achieved by using only traditional methods. One of these innovative technologies is STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics). To implement the concept of STEAM education, the system of pedagogical education is tasked with training the relevant personnel with the necessary competencies, among which the most relevant ones are meta-subject and design and research skills. In the authors' opinion, one of the possible innovations in the preparation of teachers for STEAM education is the inclusion of the ""Robotics"" discipline in the content of training of future teachers of physics, mathematics, technology, visual arts, and others. The authors conducted a survey among future teachers studying at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the Engineering and Technology Faculty of the Yelabuga Institute of Kazan Federal University, which showed that the problem of preparing graduates of general education institutions for the challenges of the new time is more relevant than ever. Only 18% of respondents are aware of the STEM and STEAM education programs existing in the world and the country, 15% of the students surveyed believe that they are ready to implement project activities and only 10% of students believe that they are ready to lead project activities. These data indicate that not only the problem of teachers' readiness to implement new educational programs, but also the problem of preparing future teachers to implement practice-oriented educational activities based on the formation of design and research competencies is coming to the fore.","Anisimova, Tatyana I.;Sabirova, Fairuza M.;Shatunova, Olga V.",Journal,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,2020-01-01,Kazan Federal University,Design and research skills ;  Project method ;  Robotics ;  STEAM ;  STEM
Building of an international network organization of underground research and education facilities: The Baltic Sea Underground innovation Network Project (BSUIN) and the European underground Laboratories Association (EUL),"Europe has a large number of unique underground research facilities for research and education in science and engineering. The extent and type of activities depend on their capabilities and requirements. However, a lack of coordination is limiting the possibilities and leads to the underutilization of research facilities. The Baltic Sea Underground Innovation Network (BSUIN) is a project tackling the underutilization by bundling the possibilities and capabilities of individual and regionally linked underground research facilities, institutions, and their research partners in one network. The BSUIN consists of six underground laboratory facilities, 11 research partners and several associated partners. A planned network, an association, on a common platform will improve the research possibilities in the individual facility by improved cooperation. The aim is to market the possibilities and benefits of underground research facilities, facilitate the acquisition of projects, improve the impact of research, and the exchange/ training of students and researchers. In order to achieve these goals, the characterization of the individual underground facilities is carried out. Based on that, the association and a corresponding web platform will be designed. The article focuses on a description of the project and laboratories and will briefly discuss the structure of the new association.","Müller, T.;Joutsenvaara, J.;Mischo, H.",Conference Proceeding,2020 SME Annual Conference and Expo,2020-01-01,Oulun Yliopisto;Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg,
Technological education and engineering pedagogy,"Introduction. Technological education, being a part of the school curriculum, is presented as a factor and a means of students' socialisation and as ""a process and a result of active learning by schoolchildren the general and professional technological culture, general and special ways of technological transformation of reality, and the development of technological competency and creative abilities of a person""1. However, over the past decade, the goals of this type of education have undergone several changes: in high-technology competitive world, the priority is given to the development of ""universal digital literacy"", which affected the content of teachers' work. The peculiarity of a teacher's work in the considered professional and pedagogical activity is the integration of pedagogical, psychological and technicaltechnological components. Currently, there is increased deficit of qualified techno- logy teachers. The modern system of teacher education does not imply fundamental technical training and the training of technical specialists does not require the formation of psychological and pedagogical competencies. The approaches to solve the problem can be drawn from the theory and practical application of vocational pedagogy. Primarily, engineering pedagogy is intended to ensure the quality of personnel of teaching community in engineering institutions. The aim of the present article is to justify the appropriateness of using the methodology of engineering pedagogy in the training of teachers of technological education and the need for expanding of relevant educational programmes in graduate school and in the continuing education system in technical universities. Methodology and research methods. The research was based on the following methodology: the provisions of professionology; systematic analysis of applied aspects of engineering pedagogy; the principle of convergence, defining interdisciplinary and supra-professional relationships, contributes to the design and promotion of the transprofessional nature of actors; the main principle of operation and development of the system of vocational and pedagogical training and advanced training of teachers (including technology teachers) - synchronised content of teaching with scientific, technical and technological innovations. Results and scientific novelty. The authors show the relationship between engineering and technological education goals, based on shared general activity nature. Scientific grounds for the development of engineering pedagogy in terms of training of teachers of technology are identified. The triplicity of such training is demonstrated: the qualification required to be a technology teacher implies possession of effective educational methods, knowledge of child psychology and competences in the field of modern digital technologies and technological equipment. The constantly growing level of knowledge intensity of the latter and the specific intertwining of humanitarian, natural science and applied components in the work of the technology teacher show that the system of his or her continuing education, retraining and advanced training should be organised. On the basis of the technical specialty received earlier, the opportunities of such an organisation, including technical universities, are presented. One effective option could be the development of a digital cluster - a platform, which integrates the resources of educational institutions of different stages, production structures, as well as enterprises of medium and small business. The operation of this cluster will contribute to the rapid spread of modern technologies and it will provide their accessibility and continuity of technological education in school, as well as in secondary vocational and higher education. The common information space will ensure to provide the coordination of instrumental training elements, to compare methods and develop personality- oriented approaches with the help of distance technologies. In addition, the digital cluster can serve as a mechanism for selection and retraining of teac hers of universities, technical schools and technology teachers through the formation of a database providing information on mentors with unique competencies. Practical significance. The authors believe that the present research could be useful for the development of alternative methods and forms of training of vocational and pedagogical personnel.","Danilaev, D. P.;Malivanov, N.

EEG Signal and Feature Interaction Modeling-Based Eye Behavior Prediction Research,"In recent years, with the development of brain science and biomedical engineering, as well as the rapid development of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis methods, using EEG signals to monitor human health has become a very popular research field. The innovation of this paper is to analyze the EEG signal for the first time by building a depth factorization machine model, so that on the basis of analyzing the characteristics of user interaction, we can use EEG data to predict the binomial state of eyes (open eyes and closed eyes). The significance of the research is that we can diagnose the fatigue and the health of the human body by detecting the state of eyes for a long time. On the basis of this inference, the proposed method can make a further useful auxiliary support for improving the accuracy of the recommendation system recommendation results. In this paper, we first extract the features of EEG data by wavelet transform technology and then build a depth factorization machine model (FM+LSTM) which combines factorization machine (FM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in parallel. Through the test of real data set, the proposed model gets more efficient prediction results than other classifier models. In addition, the model proposed in this paper is suitable not only for the determination of eye features but also for the acquisition of interactive features (user fatigue) in the recommendation system. The conclusion obtained in this paper will be an important factor in the determination of user preferences in the recommendation system, which will be used in the analysis of interactive features by the graph neural network in the future work.","Ma, Pengcheng;Gao, Qian",Journal,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2020-01-01,Qilu University of Technology,

Business Process Modelling to Improve Incident Management Process,"Business process management (BPM) is an approach focused on the continuous improvement of business processes, providing for this a collection of best practices. These best practices enable the redesign of business processes to meet the desired performance. IT service management (ITSM) defines the management of IT operations as a service. There are several ITSM frameworks available, consisting in best practices that propose standardizing these processes for the respective operations. By adopting these frameworks, organisations can align IT with their business objectives. The constant need for change, competitiveness and innovation in organisations compels managers to analyse its business processes and find improvement opportunities. Therefore, the objective of this research is to understand how BPM can be used to improve of ITSM processes. An exploratory case study in a multinational company based in Lisbon, Portugal, is conducted for the improvement of the time performance of an incident management process. Data were gained through documentation, archival records, interviews and focus groups with a team involved in IT support service. The results of this study demonstrate how BPM highlighted the current incident management process incongruences. The preliminary evidences of this research indicate that with the application of the remain BPM lifecycle phases may be possible to improve incident management process. During the next months the authors intend to identify the main problems and simulate the appropriate BPM heuristics to understand the impact in the business organisation.","Pereira, Rúben;Bianchi, Isaías;Martins, Ana Lúcia;de Vasconcelos, José Braga;Rocha, Álvaro",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,"Universidade Europeia;Instituto Superior de Ciências Sociais e Políticas, Universidade de Lisboa;Iscte – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa;Universidade de Coimbra;Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina",Business process management ;  Case study ;  IT service management ;  Process improvement

Russian engineering in the context of philosophical and sociological studies,"This article explores the problems of Russian engineering in the context of the world studies in philosophy of engineering. Firstly, the author highlights the main questions and topics of the modern philosophy of engineering: what engineering is, the ""magic"" and ""human-oriented"" nature of technologies, and models of engineering ethics. Secondly, the article presents a specific mythological narrative of domestic engineers (""the theory of a missed chance"") and shows the inclusion of this ""theory"" in alternate historical fiction. Thirdly, the article identifies the reasons for emergence of such mythology in the engineering environment. The author highlights a historical context of ""missed chances"" for the turning of technical inventions into innovations and claims that the country's engineering potential was not used to a full extent. For greater objectivity, the article uses the works both of foreign and domestic researchers. In addition, the author raised a question about the relatedness of the concepts of engineer and innovation. Finally, the article gives an answer to the question about the essence of the engineer; the author believes that the engineering is primarily an environment, close to the human life world, understanding and maintaining the links between science and technology, providing the necessary channels for transforming inventions into innovations, i.e. commercially realized technologies. The given definition demonstrates the prospects for the development of socio-humanitarian research in the field of engineering.","Chebotareva, Elena E.",Journal,Epistemology and Philosophy of Science,2020-01-01,Saint Petersburg State University,"""Theory of lost chance"" ;  Alternate historical fiction ;  Engineering ethics ;  Innovation ;  Philosophy of engineering ;  Russian modernization ;  Technology"
The Analysis of the Structure and Assessment of the Sources of Financing of Technological Innovations,"Currently, innovation activity in Russia remains low. At the present stage of development in our country, an adequate and effective holistic system that ensures the smooth functioning of the innovation process has been created. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, apologists for a market economy, unfortunately, were unable to create the necessary institutional conditions that would allow the formation of a holistic model of the innovation process at the micro and macro levels. The evidence of this is the sharp reduction in the number of scientific organizations and experimental design bureaus, the lack of demand for trained highly qualified personnel (engineering, technical), which, in turn, has a serious impact on Russia’s innovative and technological lag behind developed countries. The ability and potential of creating and implementing technological innovations depend on the efficiency of the functioning of financing mechanisms and the state of investment sources that create a favorable economic environment for innovation activity. The paper analyzes and evaluates the structure of financing sources of technological innovations. A comparative analysis of research and development funding in developed countries and Russia is conducted. Based on the analysis, the authors identified shortcomings and assessed the effectiveness of existing mechanisms and sources of financing innovation.","Bykovskaya, Ekaterina N.;Kafiyatullina, Yuliya N.;Kharchilava, Gocha P.",Book Series,"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control",2020-01-01,The State University of Management,Financing ;  Innovative activity ;  Problems ;  Research and development ;  Technological innovations

The study focuses on 8 industrialised innovation-active entities located on the territory of the Urals, Volga region and Western Siberia. The administrative centres of these regions rank as promising centres of economic growth and have opportunities to establish world-class Research and Educational Centres. For assessing the level of interaction between the regions in terms of innovation activity, we applied a method of spatial autocorrelation. Drawing on the Moran's test, we assessed the autocorrelation between geographically close territories based on the data for 2007, 2013 and 2018. We took into account possible transformations of dynamic spatial effects caused by external and internal changes. According to the study, in 2007, a trend of regional clustering in terms of innovation activity was identified in certain areas of the Siberian Federal District (Novosibirsk and Tomsk oblasts). By 2013, this trend only increased due to the inclusion of Omsk oblast in this group of territories. Moreover, in the same year the signs of regional clustering in terms of innovation activity caused by spatial effects were discovered in the territories of the Volga Federal District. They appeared due to similar processes occurring in the special industries for these regions, such as petrochemistry and engineering. In 2018, the noted trends continued, while in Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk oblasts the spatial effects (calculated based on a single innovation activity factor) were not discovered. Legislative and executive authorities can use the research findings for shaping and updating drafts of State programs and strategies of spatial development of the entities of the Russian Federation.","Averina, Lidiya Mihaylovna;Sirotin, Dmitry Vladimirovich",Journal,Economy of Regions,2020-01-01,Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Clusters ;  Industry ;  Innovation ;  Interregional cooperation ;  Manufacturing ;  Moran's test ;  Simulation ;  Spatial autocorrelation ;  Spatial development
Applying TRIZ systematic innovative methods to solve semicon-Ductor photo resist remains,"In order to change the electrical property of the semiconductor, the semiconductor manufacturing process adds other atoms in the silicon wafer (such as boron, phosphorus, nitrogen... etc.) during a process called doping. There are some common doping techniques such as high-temperature diffusion doping, high energy ion beam implantation, plasma doping, and so on. This research focuses on the topic of over doping of nitrogen ions in the plasma doping process. The over doping of nitrogen easily causes a reaction between the nitrogen ion and photo-resist. It leads to the photoresist fail to strip on cleaning procedure, which affects the production rate. In our study, we use Function Analysis, Cause-Effect Contradiction Chain Analysis, Contradiction Matrix & 40 Invention Prin-ciples and other analytical tools to solve the engineering contradictions and the physical contradictions of nitrogen doping process based on the Systematic innovation procedure.","Lee, Robin;Hsu, Daniel;Wu, Steven;Sheu, D.

Motivating Civil Engineering Students' Creativity: Actor-Partner Interdependence Approach,"Creativity is an important characteristic for civil engineering professionals and students when facing innovation challenges associated with construction engineering projects. Previous studies have not examined the temporary group context when conducting research on creativity. Drawing on the social cognitive theory and the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) approach, this study explored two questions related to how psychological cognitive factors (i.e., intrinsic motivation and creative self-efficacy) motivate creativity, and whether the motivation process is influenced by others. Using a class experiment and a pre and posttest questionnaire survey completed by civil engineering students that performed an idea generation task, this study applies an APIM approach to distinguish the positive actor effects of students' innovation motivation and task motivation on their own creativity, instead of the negative or nonsignificant influences from a partner. Creative self-efficacy - as a mediator - plays an indirect positive actor role between students' intrinsic motivation and their own creativity, but an indirect negative partner role in affecting partners' creativity. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of the componential model of creativity, including the creative source of intrinsic motivation and the motivational path from interest to belief. The study also provides a broader interdependence perspective to motivate an individual's creativity in engineering and educational practice.","Zheng, Junwei;Wu, Guangdong;Li, Hongyang",Journal,Journal of Civil Engineering Education,2020-01-01,South China University of Technology;Chongqing University;Kunming University of Science and Technology,Actor-partner interdependence model ;  Creative self-efficacy ;  Creativity ;  Intrinsic motivation
Artificial Intelligence in Education: A Review,"The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on education. Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.","Chen, Lijia;Chen, Pingping;Lin, Zhijian",Journal,IEEE Access,2020-01-01,Fuzhou University;Yango University,artificial intelligence ;  Education ;  leaner

Node between firm’s knowledge-intensive activities and their propensity to innovate: Insights from Nigeria’s mining industry,"While studies have examined the nexus between knowledge and innovative performance, the literature from the context of developing countries is very scant. This study thus examines which knowledge-intensive activities influence the propensity of mining firms in Nigeria to implement either product innovation, process innovation or both kinds of innovations. The study explored 106 purposively selected mining firms in Nigeria to check the effect of knowledge on the prevalence of innovation in the industry. Using a questionnaire administered to the chief executive officers/most senior managers of the firms, the study identified six main knowledge indicators for the mining industry which were regressed against indicators of technological innovations. The study found that while R&D activities were important for product innovation, acquisition of machinery, equipment, hardware and software were the principal drivers of process innovation. The knowledge-based activities common to both innovation types were acquisition of external knowledge/technologies, learning, knowledge exchange and training as well as other activities like feasibility studies, market research, continuous improvement, business process re-engineering, tooling-up, routine software upgrades, amongst others. The study concludes that certain knowledge-intensive activities are important for different kinds of innovations in the firms.","Jegede, Oluseye Oladayo",Journal,"African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development",2020-01-01,University of Johannesburg,learning ;  mining firms ;  patents ;  research & development ;  technology ;  training

University relations: University–industrial relations as the main factor in the development of polytechnic education,"The chapter is devoted to the problems of development of university–production relations within the framework of the program “Digital economy of the Russian Federation.” It is shown that against the background of all-Russian changes in the institutional environment, one of the most important issues is the formation of a stable, long-term partnership between universities and industry. New innovative challenges require the strengthening of interaction between scientific, educational, and industrial spheres. In this regard, it is necessary to make a significant emphasis on the variability of higher education, which contributes to its adaptation to the new conditions of academic and economic autonomy of educational institutions. Research and innovation activities should be focused on obtaining new knowledge in the main strategic directions, the purpose of which is to attract young people from the sphere of science and education, to train highly qualified specialists, and to develop a socially oriented and competitive system of higher professional education. An important factor is the creation of new structural subdivisions aimed at organizing interaction between higher education institutions, research institutes, and enterprises in priority areas of research and education. It is shown that the integration of universities is the result of a targeted policy of increasing the competitiveness of higher education and states that use this potential for the development of their economy and social sphere. Stimulation of mutually beneficial partnership, creation of new graduate departments at production; research and innovation activities should contribute to the commercialization of scientific results and provide the Russian economy with qualified specialists with the necessary set of competencies for the generation and practical use of knowledge and skills in the field of information and energy-saving technologies, engineering, automation, new materials, etc.","Zmyzgova, T.;Polyakova, E.;Prokofyev, K.;Chelovechkova, A.;Dmitrieva, O.",Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2020-01-01,Kurgan State University,Digital economy ;  Industry–science linkages ;  Innovation development ;  Modernization ;  Polytechnic education ;  University Relations
Increasing college student engagement with digital media and a dedicated space: An exploratory approach,"Nowadays, college students have spent most—if not all—of their lives seeing the Internet as something natural. They are immersed in a digital environment and can’t conceive of the world without it. But there is a huge difference between making use of these digital technologies in a personal manner and using them in the context of a business. The purpose of this study was to analyse if giving students a dedicated space (laboratory) equipped with appropriate digital media has an impact on their engagement, considering engagement in its multidimensional forms that include behavioural, emotional, and cognitive aspects. A research group of 21 students was used, and participants were assigned to one of six teams that each worked with a different local NGO. To create the appropriate environment, an improvised lab was created in a 13 × 16-foot office using different elements to make the students feel comfortable. After assessment using qualitative and quantitative methods, the results indicated greater engagement in all three components that was sustained for the entire semester. Behavioural engagement involved commitment and dedication to activities; emotional engagement involved energy levels and joy felt in activities; and cognitive engagement encompassed concentration and weekday work hours. the results also showed that engagement in every dimension was greater in this course than in a traditional one. the educational environment was measured as a mixture of physical environment, emotional climate, and intellectual climate, with the last element considered the most important. This research shows that giving college students working with a challenging subject a dedicated space to work in has a strong impact on engagement levels.","Perez-Lozano, Delia;Rocha-Lona, Luis",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Instituto Politécnico Nacional;Tecnológico de Monterrey,Digital media ;  Educational innovation ;  Engagement ;  Higher education ;  Laboratory ;  Learning experience ;  Learning space ;  Social media

Assessing learning gains in teamwork and innovation among engineering student design teams,"The current engineering education system world over encourages the use of collaborative approaches through design coursework and integration of practical hands on team activities in pedagogy. This is in part spurred by a global push for sustainable innovations and solutions to challenging problems of the day, which can only be tackled through concerted team efforts. Engineering teams play a key role in implementing inventions and innovations, and engineers should therefore possess the ability to work and innovate in teams. This study assesses gains in learning for engineering students engaged in pre-capstone and senior design capstone projects as the final phase of their education, in order to explore skill development among the soon-to-be-graduates. A comparative analysis of pre- and post- study data was conducted across student teams.

Developing engineering experts via knowledge collaboration: A pilot study,"Successful knowledge collaboration is key to developing innovations and improving both work quality and productivity in the Engineering field. While sophisticated knowledge management systems do not guarantee effective expertise knowledge transfer to apprentices, their expertise development can be hindered. This study initially examined the relationships between the knowledge collaboration behavior and expertise development of entry-level Structural Engineers within a global engineering and construction company in the refining and petrochemical industries. The main objectives of this pilot study are to (1) develop and test an instrument to measure engineers' extents of knowledge collaboration behavior, expert behavior, work performance, and skills development led by their knowledge collaboration behavior, and (2) explore trends anticipated in the expertise development of entry-level Structural Engineers caused by the evolving knowledge management tools, internal and external collaboration programs of the case study company. Responses from entry-level Structural Engineers and their advisors within the company's Structural Engineering department were collected using a questionnaire. Partial Least Squares (PLS) path modeling was used to analyze the study data. The measurement model was valid and reliable for its initial setting. Future research Recommendations include using larger sample sizes, modifying survey questionnaire, removing non-significant indicators, and using multigroup (PLS-MGA) analysis.","Wong, Silky S.K.;Cross, Jennifer;Nejat, Ali",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016",2020-01-01,Edward E.

Assessing team capabilities for systems thinking and collaborative innovation,"The exponential increase in technology and the emerging complex problem domain characteristic of the 21st century requires a collaborative interdisciplinary approach to problem solving coupled with systems thinking and creative ingenuity. This paper presents systems thinking in relationship to collaborative team innovation. The capacity to engage in systems thinking is considered to be a cornerstone for advancing collaborative team innovation. Our exploration is focused on introducing systems thinking within the context of collaborative team innovation and describing the relationship between a systems thinking paradigm and the organizational, social, and cognitive processes involved in collaborative innovation. The study provides a set of systems thinking profiles and factors-based innovation that define the ranges of an individual's capacity to engage in systems thinking and innovation. Assessing the level of systems thinking capacity for individuals allows identification of characteristics of teams that are more capable of tackling social, technological, economic, and political issues facing society today.","Asio, Sarah M.;Jaradat, Raed M.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016",2020-01-01,Bagley College of Engineering,Collaborative Innovation ;  Complex Systems ;  Creativity ;  Systems Thinking
Extending decision field theory to a multi-agent decision-making with forgetting,"Decision Field Theory (DFT) is a dynamic human decision-making model based on the evolution of preferences on the options over time. The goal of this paper is to extend DFT to examining how long-term decision making processes via the experience of forgetting lead to shifts in preference. Combining the established DFT model with the parameter of forgetting introduces an extended model that shares the mathematical characteristics of DFT. We then examine the choice probability of this DFT model with forgetting (DFT-F) by driving the limiting distribution of preference. This DFT-F is applied to mimic a decision-making process involving two or more people by introducing parameters related to individual powers of influence within various types of human interaction: competition, collaboration, compromise, accommodation, and avoidance. We then use DFT-F to develop a hierarchical network model for analyzing multi-agent decision-making, and discuss its stability under the dynamics of opinion formation. The bottom level of this network represents individual's decision-making behaviors, while they are aggregated to a group decision in the higher level of the network. A simulation model of a social network is used to demonstrate how the changes of parameters in DFT-F have different effects on the stability of the network.","Lee, Seunghan;Son, Young Jun",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016",2020-01-01,The University of Arizona College of Engineering,Decision Field Theory ;  Forgetting ;  Human Interaction ;  Innovation Diffusion ;  Multi-agent Decision Making ;  Social Network
Comparing lean and design thinking: A human systems integration approach,"From lean to design thinking, process-based management techniques are often described primarily by their technical system components, processes, and tools. For example, lean emphasizes value, value stream, flow, pull, and perfection. Design thinking emphasizes define, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement, and learn. These process-based managerial techniques also allude to a set of underlying human system components, but these components tend to be less emphasized or codified than the technical components. Using the human systems integration approach, we review the most commonly cited publications to compare the common technical and human system components across lean and design thinking.","Glover, Wiljeana J.;Bailey, Jennifer",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016",2020-01-01,Babson College,Design thinking ;  Innovation ;  Lean ;  Literature review ;  Process improvement
An identified opportunity to improve the construct of innovation in quality applications: A state-of-the-art-matrix (SAM) study,"Some organizations have been able to accomplish innovation sporadically while others have a consistent pattern of success. In fact, innovation is widely recommended to be part of regular operations for most organizations. However, including the construct of innovation in quality applications has been elusive; this deficiency, when addressed, has been attempted to relate quality management with innovation or criticize the difficulties that quality management faces when including innovation. Some studies go beyond that and state that quality management is a limitation by itself for innovation. In this paper, an in-depth systematic literature review, using the State-of-the-Art-Matrix (SAM) methodology, is performed to elucidate an opportunity area for a solution to this problem. This literature review provides an analysis aiming to understand the reason for poor innovation development as a construct in the field of quality. Innovation is identified as a missing element in the cost of poor quality theoretical framework (COPQ) also known as quality cost and cost of quality (COQ), requiring a future research. Identifying and delimiting this research problem provides a better comprehension of quality and its costs to assist industrial engineers and managers to explore, analyze and design new quality management programs by including this construct with more confidence.","Elizondo-Noriega, Armando;Güemes-Castorena, David;Beruvides, Mario G.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016",2020-01-01,Edward E.

Strategic doing: A tool for curricular evolution,"Today's technology companies demand engineering graduates with career-ready skills who can quickly contribute to the enterprise. Preparing these graduates is challenging and adding additional materials to the existing curriculum is viewed with skepticism. In the past two years, the authors have integrated innovation and entrepreneurship into the engineering curriculum with an agile strategy process called Strategic Doing. This process has brought focus to fragmented initiatives, effectively leveraged resources, enhanced engagement, and promoted distributed leadership. Taken together, these efforts have altered the engineering education pathway to innovation. We have built a collaborative ecosystem that transforms the educational experience. Strategic Doing teaches people how to form collaborations quickly, move them toward measurable outcomes and make adjustments along the way. The Strategic Doing process answers two questions: ""Where are we going?"" and ""How will we get there?"" Designed specifically for loosely connected networks, it is a new strategy discipline that is lean, agile and fast. In this paper, the authors will discuss how the Strategic Doing process was implemented within a Hispanic Serving Institution to create a networked ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship, steps identified to get us there, and progress made to date.","Sullivan, Patricia A.;Pines, Edward;Morrison, Edward",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016",2020-01-01,New Mexico State University College of Engineering;Purdue University,Curricular Change ;  Innovation ;  Strategic Doing
A typology of innovation adoption factors for human factors engineers,"In the current technology landscape, customers, suppliers and employees regularly adopt innovations. Designing systems especially Internet of Things (IoT) systems that incorporate new technology falls in the human factors domain. A large body of innovation adoption research exists in multiple disciplines including psychology, marketing and information studies. This research is not organized in a framework that makes the information accessible to field engineers. To address this gap, the authors searched over 1,000 journals in eight disciplines for papers that explored the factors of innovation adoption or the process of adoption. Using that search's results, a typology that organizes individual-level innovation adoption research in a practical manner is proposed. Three overarching categories of human factors that affect an individual's decision to adopt an innovation are proposed including personal, social connections and micro situational factors. The objective of this paper is to suggest a theoretical framework and examples of applications addressing innovation adoption issues that occur in the field. This paper also serves as an example of applying multidisciplinary research to a human factors situation.","Grego-Nagel, Anne C.;Rys, Malgorzata J.",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016",2020-01-01,Carl R.

Diffusion of patient safety innovations: A systems perspective,"Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) present a major healthcare challenge. Although the solution is well known and has led to significant reduction in CLABSI rates in hospitals that have adopted it, CLABSIs continue to represent a leading source of preventable medical errors. Thus, the problem is not one of creating safety practices but of diffusing them across the healthcare system. While scientific evidence is needed to demonstrate efficacy of an innovation, several other factors influence diffusion. These factors include benefits and costs (compared to existing alternatives), uncertainty about the value of the innovation (increasing perception of risk), network effects (extent to which adoption is affected by others behavior), and aspects of market structure (e.g., competition, standards, regulation). This paper explores how these factors have influenced the implementation of CLABSI prevention practices in medical facilities. The specific healthcare-related issues considered are the costs and benefits of the innovation, provider uncertainty, provider-provider communication, and the litigious nature of CLABSIs (i.e., past malpractice lawsuits). The paper argues that complex interactions among these and many other factors can lead to unpredictable outcomes. For this reason, a systems perspective is needed when designing interventions to ensure widespread diffusion of proven patient safety protocols.","Duncan, Claire;Avnet, Mark S.;Alade, Oluwabusayo",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016",2020-01-01,College of Engineering;Texas A&M University Health Science Center,Central line-associated bloodstream infections ;  Diffusion of innovations ;  Network effects ;  Patient safety ;  S-curve ;  Safety culture
The operator's stake in shore control centre design: A stakeholder analysis for autonomous ships,"Technology driven innovation has been advancing the development of autonomous ships and their Shore Control Center (SCC) counterpart. We plot a stakeholder map focused on the SCC based on data collected in a workshop and semi-structured interviews containing ten (10) Subject Matter Experts. The results identify key stakeholders and their interconnected relationships. Furthermore, insights from the qualitative data highlight important human factor issues of SCC operators that can be put into organizational context using the stakeholder map. The contribution is a tool designers can use to understand of the business model and the needs of the SCC customer, technology developer, and operators. Considering the operator's stake in autonomous shipping and the human factors issues that are expected in the SCC, the case is made for a Human-Centered Design (HCD) process to run concurrently with the technology innovation.","Veitch, E.;Hynnekleiv, A.;Lützhöft, M.",Conference Proceeding,"RINA, Royal Institution of Naval Architects - International Conference on Human Factors 2020, Papers",2020-01-01,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet;HVL,

Innovation Workshop Documentation for Following Software Engineering Activities,"[Context & motivation] Requirements engineering (RE) can be seen as creative problem solving (CPS), overlapping with user experience (UX) and design activities. Creative processes, such as innovation workshops (IWs), are often facilitated group activities. They provide an understanding of challenges and user needs, leading to increased software quality. A large number of results from IWs needs to be documented in a suitable manner for later use, as not all results can be followed up upon immediately. [Question/problem] With current means of IW documentation, it is hard to extract the required information (e.g., photo minutes), or they are inefficient to produce or digest (e.g., audio and video recordings, textual documentation). Documentation of only the results leads to the loss of any discussions, decisions, reasons, and discarded alternatives, as these are usually not written down during an IW. The interpretation of the documentation depends on the viewer’s memory and understanding of the IW and the results, which is prone to misinterpretation and errors unless enriched with context information from the IW planning. [Principal ideas/results] We explored the limitations of IW documentation during a workshop with 29 experts from the usability and UX domain. Problems with using the results in later software engineering (SE), RE, and UX activities arise from misalignment between IW result documentation and activity requirements. The experts created a set of initial solution ideas, but no concrete solutions. [Contributions] We address the need for reasonable methods for documenting the results of IWs so that they can be used efficiently in later activities. The design and preliminary results of the expert workshop are presented. Furthermore, we discuss a research roadmap towards making targeted improvements to IW documentation by understanding subsequent activities.","Mennig, Patrick;Nass, Claudia",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering IESE,Creative problem solving ;  Creativity workshop ;  Documentation ;  Innovation workshop ;  Requirements engineering

On board additive manufacturing of spare parts for the naval sector,"The failure of a component of a ship sometimes requires a fast replacement to avoid delays in its operations. One of the most promising innovations to reduce the time required to replace a failed part and improve logistics is the use of 3D printers to produce spare parts onboard a vessel. Additive manufacturing technologies allow parts to be created anywhere, with almost any shape using a wide range of materials, directly from a digital 3D model. In order to create the digital model, either reverse engineering technologies can be implemented, or a database of optimized 3D components needs to be developed. Navantia, in collaboration with INNANOMAT research group, have studied in detail the change of mechanical properties of parts produced using 3D printers. This study was carried out using platforms that simulate vibrations produced in a ship, and with 3D printers installed onboard a ship. In this paper we present the process of manufacturing spare parts using 3D printers that work on a ship, evaluate the influence of sailing conditions on the quality of the manufactured parts, and review examples of spare parts produced with 3D printers onboard.","Moreno-Sanchez, D.;Rodriguez, J.

Towards an ambient support system for continence management in nursing homes: An exploratory study,"Time consuming and costly, continence care management has become one of the main care demands in nursing homes with potential inadequacy negatively impacting residents' quality of life. While engineering efforts in this area are increasing, these mainly focus on wearable innovations. To support continence care in nursing homes in an unobtrusive manner, we developed an ambient sensor system to continuously monitor incontinence events, e.g., saturated incontinence materials or leakages. In an exploratory study in two nursing homes, we evaluated an early prototype of the sensor system and built annotated data sets. Implemented annotation devices included a smart sensor mat, a toilet timing predicting device, and manual data entry of continence care by care personnel. From our analysis of the preliminary study results based on the first two residents, we learned how challenging the ambient monitoring and annotation of incontinence events is. On the basis of the outcomes, we provide suggestions for further research of ambient sensor systems supporting continence care.","Strauven, Hannelore;D'Haeseleer, Ine;T'Jonck, Kristof;Hallez, Hans;Abeele, Vero Vanden;Crombez, Pieter;Vanrumste, Bart",Conference Proceeding,"HEALTHINF 2020 - 13th International Conference on Health Informatics, Proceedings; Part of 13th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2020",2020-01-01,Televic N.V.;KU Leuven,Ambient monitoring ;  Exploratory study ;  Incontinence ;  Nursing home

"Application Research of ""field"" Theory in the Problem of Colleges and Universities Innovation Team Aggregation","Based on the field theory in physics, the thesis applies model construction and other methods to apply the research on the agglomeration problem of colleges' and universities' innovation teams and constructs the growth field model of colleges' and universities' innovation teams. The conclusions show that the ""growth field"" of the colleges' and universities' innovation team is composed of two elements: ""hidden growth factor"" and ""dominant growth factor,"" which have the directional and force acting; if the growth force is more powerful than the resistance, the team growth will move forward along the growth path; if the resultant force is greater than the power, it will enter the recession or be stagnant in advance. The growth path is different in the magnitude and direction of the force at each stage, and the growth path of the individual members of the team and the team as a whole is also different; there is agglomeration in the growth field, and the excellent academic leaders are particularly important. It is a process in which the field forces overlap each other, which will form a situation of continuous agglomeration and a virtuous cycle of interaction and find out the ways to integrate and enhance the ability of colleges' and universities' innovation teams under the field effect, in order to achieve the goal of attracting talents to join, optimizing and integrating within the team, improving the overall ability of the team, and increasing outputs.","Liang, Hongjing;Liu, Jinsheng;Wang, Rong;Song, Yaqin;Zhou, Yuanyuan",Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2020-01-01,Nanjing Institute of Technology,

Response surface method analysis on electro-enhanced technique for remediation of cadmium contaminated soil,"In view of the problems of long remediation time, high energy consumption and low remediation efficiency in electrokinetic remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil, cadmium (Cd) was used to simulate heavy metals in contaminated soil, and response surface method (RSM) was used to optimize the factors influencing electrokinetic remediation. Central Composite (CCD) experimental design method was taken to study the effects of electric field strength, remediation time and water content on removal rate of Cd in soil. Also, polynomial regression mathematical model and optimal reaction conditions were provided for Cd pollution in electrokinetic soil remediation. The simulated equation F was 15.67, the correlation coefficient R2 was 0.9338, and the adjustment correlation coefficient R2adj was 0.9042, indicating good regression and strong significance of the equation. The model results showed that, for the optimal experimental conditions, electric field strength was 2.25 V·cm-1, the remediation time was 120.79 h, and the water content was 17.06 %. On the basis of such reaction condition, intermittent current flow method was adopted d to further enhance the electrokinetic remediation effect. The cadmium removal rate in the soil was increased by 3.17 %, 2.86 % and 2.43 %, respectively, and the electric energy consumption was decreased by 10.54 %, 11.28 % and 9.97 %, respectively, suggesting that the method could effectively improve the removal rate of Cd and reduce energy consumption. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal trace element with an average content of about 0.2 mg·kg-1 in the earths crust and 0.01 -0.70 mg·kg-1 in normal soil[1]. In recent years, it has been found that the cadmium content in the soil excessively exceeds the standard and the concentration is increasing year by year[2]. These are mainly caused by the large use of phosphate fertilizer and atmospheric deposition. Soil cadmium pollution is highly toxic, greatly mobile, difficult to degrade and harmful to the environment and human body[3]. Effective removal of cadmium pollution in soil is a current research focus. Soil electrokinetic remediation technology, as a new type of green remediation technology, is mainly used to treat various heavy metal pollutions in soil. Lee et al.[4] neutralized electrolytes of the anode and the cathode using a circulation system to change the effect of acid and alkali generated by the electrode on pH of the soil sample. Sum et al.[5] reduced experimental energy consumption by using pulse current instead of DC current when remedying Cu-contaminated soil. Numerous studies have found that single electrokinetic remediation has great limitations in removal of different heavy metals, so most researchers combine electrokinetic technology with other remediation techniques to improve remediation efficiency. Karim et al.[6] combined situ biotechnology with electrokinetic technology in treatment of PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) contaminated soil, so that the degradation efficiency of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil was significantly improved. Rose et al.[7] combined electrokinetic remediation with PRB made of activated carbon to create EK-PRB (Electrokinetic Remediation and Permeable Reactive Barriers) composite technology for treatment of Cu-contaminated soil, finding that the average removal rate was as high as 96.45 %. Xi et al.[8] treated Pb using intermittent current flow method and improved voltage method, finding that the removal rate reached a high level, with power consumption lower than that in equivalent remediation level. Response surface is a method for statistical analysis of data. Its central composite CCD experimental design method is to evaluate the significant effect of the interaction between variables on the response variables based on limited number of experiments. Moreover, the model obtained in this method can optimize the reaction parameters and predict the experimental results. Jeon et al.[9]conducted a 3D remediation exploration into heavy metal (Cu and As) contaminated soil finding that the removal rates of the two heavy metals were increased by 60 % and 30 % in overall. Wang et al.[10] optimized experimental conditions of copper and zinc contaminated soil using response surface BBD experimental design method. With average removal rate at 71.89 % and unit energy consumption at 182.36 W·h/mg, the experimental results basically coincided with the model prediction. Yang et al.[11]designed a five-factor three-level experiment, and analyzed the optimal process of lead removal by activated carbon based on response surface method. It was found that the lead removal rate was 97.55 % under optimization condition. At present, the methods for treating heavy metal contaminated soil are mainly summarized into four main methods: physical repair, chemical repair, bioremediation and joint repair. Each repair method has certain scope and limitations. For example, the phytoremediation process is slow for the absorption and accumulation of heavy metals. Electric repair can make up for these shortcomings and has a series of advantages. It can be used in soils with low permeability. It is fast, efficient and economical to remove heavy metals. This paper proposes to combine electric strengthening technology with intermittent energization method based on model optimization parameters. It has certain practicability and innovation. In this experiment, the experimental scheme was designed by RSM (Response Surface Methodology) central composite method. The quadratic polynomial regression linear analysis model was established by Design Expert 8.0.6.1. The experimental conditions of Cd removal rate in response soil were optimized. On the basis of optimized experimental conditions, intermittent current flow method of electro-enhanced technique was adopted in a view to further enhancing Cd removal rate and reducing energy consumption, thus providing technical support for the optimization of cadmium-contaminated soil remediation conditions.","Wan, Yushan;Zhai, Juan;Wang, Anwei",Book Series,Materials Science Forum,2020-01-01,Changzhou University,Cadmium pollution ;  Intermittent current flow ;  Response surface ;  Soil remediation

The future prospects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in slope ecological restoration,"The rapid development of transportation and urbanization has promoted the continuous innovation of slope ecological restoration technology (SERT). More environmentally friendly and efficient technologies are being developed and perfected to make the restored slopes sustainable and be able to integrate into the natural environment, in which microbial-plant remediation technology was been taken into account. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a microbial material commonly used in ecological restoration, has a symbiotic relationship with the majority of terrestrial plants to provide water and nutrients, and has been successfully used in the field of ecological restoration in recent years. Combining stress tolerance and growth promotion for plants with improvement of soils properties through strengthened associations with AMF would help to increase the efficiency of slope ecological restoration. This review mainly introduces AMF research progress in terms of plant stress tolerance, ecological optimization, and symbiosis with plant species for phytoremediation, summarizes the current challenges faced in the application of AMF in ecological restoration projects, and highlights the future research direction for resolving the mentioned problems. Finally, theoretical study and field applications are combined to provide an overview of the future application prospects in slope ecological restoration.","Yan, Yujie;Zhao, Bingqin;Xu, Wennian;Yu, Fei;Liu, Wenjing;Xia, Dong",Journal,Polish Journal of Environmental Studies,2020-01-01,China Three Gorges University,Arbuscular mycorrhiza ;  Ecological restoration ;  Slope engineering ;  Stress tolerance
Innovation in the assessment of technical subjects in Malaysian secondary schools,"The technical subjects comprised of Fundamentals of Sustainability (AK), Engineering Drawing (LK) and Invention (RC) have been introduced as electives for Form 4 and Form 5 students in Malaysian Secondary School. Examination results for AK, LK and RC in the Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM) Examination were less encouraging and show some declination of students' performance. Data from the Ministry of Education also show a decline in student enrolment in AK, LK and RC, between 10 to 17 percent yearly. Hence, this study evaluated the implementation of AK, GKT and RC as to input, process and product. A CIPP model was used as a conceptual framework. The research design was programme evaluation. Stratified random sampling was used to select 335 respondents from national secondary schools in Peninsular Malaysia, consisting of 159 administrators and 176 teachers. Questionnaires, interview protocols and observation checklists were used as instruments. Cronbach Alpha reliability index for the three sets of questionnaires were between 0.77 to 0.95. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. The empirical data found that staff training aspects need to be improved, especially staff training organised by the Ministry and Department of Education, in terms of teacher knowledge and skills for all three subjects. Interview and observation data were also presented to support the quantitative findings. Implications and recommendations for teaching and learning as well as for future research are presented and discussed.","Taib, Mohd Tafizam Mohd;Mustapha, Ramlee;Yasin, Azlina Amat",Journal,"International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change",2020-01-01,Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris;SMK Dato' Mohd Said,Cipp model ;  Malaysia ;  National schools ;  Staff training ;  Technical subjects
Financial technology efficiency and credit constraints facing the industrial sector: Evidence from China,"There is a close logical correlation between structural reform of the financial sector and the enhancement of financial institutions' economic performance. In the existing research, however, there are disagreements and gaps relating to the efficiency measurement of the financial system's input and output, as well as the impact of financial efficiency on the credit constraints facing the industrial sector. Based on China's provincial panel data from 2008 to 2016, this paper measures and decomposes financial technology efficiency, and selects system equations to comprehensively test the internal and external transmission mechanism of financial technology efficiency. The research finds that: (1) The key to improving the efficiency of input and output of China's financial system lies in the effective absorption and utilization of financial system reform and financial technology innovation, that is, the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology; (2) The key to improving the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology lies in the overall reform of the economic system, including the development of the private economy, the expansion of market opening, the acceleration of service industry development, and the promotion of technological innovation. (3) The improvement of financial technology efficiency is the key to reducing costs, de-leveraging and increasing efficiency in the industrial sector. It can effectively alleviate the credit constraints facing the industrial sector and promote its high-quality development. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the reform and opening up of the economic system with a view to promoting the efficiency of the financial system, rather than simply resorting to financial system reform and financial technology innovation.","Li, Zhiwei;Wang, Ren;Xu, Yingjie;Gao, Yuan",Journal,IEEE Access,2020-01-01,Trinity Business School;Chongqing Technology and Business University,Credit constraint ;  Financial frontier technology ;  Stochastic frontier ;  System equations ;  Technology efficiency
Research on Dynamic Comprehensive Evaluation of Resource Allocation Efficiency of Technology Innovation in the Aerospace Industry,"From the perspective of input and output, this paper constructs an evaluation index system for the status quo of technology innovation resource allocation in China's aerospace industry. Taking the industrial panel data of 20 provincial regions from 2007 to 2016 in China as samples, this paper uses the stochastic frontier method, which is improved by the projection pursuit model based on accelerated genetic algorithm, to analyze the factors influencing the allocation efficiency of technology innovation resource in the aerospace industry and then make a static evaluation for the current situation. In addition, based on the perspective of velocity characteristics, this study uses the dynamic comprehensive evaluation model to evaluate the resource allocation of technology innovation in the aerospace industry. The empirical research shows that the resource allocation efficiency of technology innovation in the aerospace industry is generally at the lower middle level, indicating an unbalanced trend of ""reverse"" allocation with the level of regional economic development. It is also found that the efficiency improvement effect in recent years is not obvious. At last, based on the study's findings, some countermeasures and suggestions are put forward to improve the current situation.","Dongri, Han;Li, Tuochen;Shi, Ziyi;Feng, Shaosong",Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2020-01-01,Harbin Engineering University,
Innovative VR-based research to develop intuitive human computer interaction,"This paper explains the design of a prototype desktop and augmented Virtual Reality (VR) framework as a medium to deliver instructional materials to the students in an introductory computer animation course. To be of use to other instructors or researchers interested in implementing a similar framework like this, the paper provides information on the hardware, software, and the concept inventory components of this framework. This framework was developed as part of a Teaching Innovation Grant at a Midwestern University to propose some cost-effective and innovative instructional frameworks to engage and stimulate students. This paper is an extended version of the paper presented at the CoED division of the ASEE conference and it presents VR modules and assessments with some modified techniques to the earlier version presented at the annual conference. This paper also shows the relevance of the methods used in the context of other STEM curriculum in addition to graphics and modeling courses. PC-based Desktop VR has been chosen as a medium for this study due to the ease-of-access and affordability; this framework can be visualized and accessed with the available computers in PC labs available on university campuses. Besides modeling and animation, various STEM concepts including manufacturing education, nanotechnology, chemistry, and biology are presented in an interactive manner on a desktop display. This framework allows the users to interact with the objects on the display not only via the standard mouse and keyboard, but also using multiple forms of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) such as Touchscreen, Touchpad, and 3D Mouse. Hence, the modules were developed from scratch for access via regular desktop PCs. As the author has been teaching this course for many years now, this framework has been designed with due consideration to structure of the course, 'Introduction to Animation'. Finally, the framework has been tested on a range of VR media to check its accessibility. On the whole, this proposed framework can be used to not only teach basic modeling and animation concepts such as spatial coordinates, coordinate systems, transformation, and parametric curves, but also to teach basic graphics programming concepts.","Magesh, Chandramouli",Journal,Computers in Education Journal,2020-01-01,Purdue University Northwest,Computer Graphics ;  Interactive Instruction ;  STEM Education ;  Virtual Reality
Integrating Formal Technology Assessment into an Integrated Healthcare Delivery System: Smart Innovation,"Objectives: We designed, developed, and implemented a new hospital-based health technology assessment (HB-HTA) program called Smart Innovation. Smart Innovation is a decision framework that reviews and makes technology adoption decisions. Smart Innovation was meant to replace the fragmented and complex process of procurement and adoption decisions at our institution.

Emotional reactions to the perception of risk in the Pompeii Archaeological Park,"The assessment of perceived risk by people is extremely important for safety and security management. Each person is based on the opinion of others to make a choice and the Internet represents the place where these opinions are mostly researched, found and reviewed. Social networks have a decisive impact: 92% of consumers say they have more trust in social media reviews than in any other form of advertising. For this reason, Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis have found interesting applications in the most diverse context, among which the most innovative is certainly represented by public safety and security. Security managers can use the perceptions expressed by people to discover the unexpected and potential weaknesses of a controlled environment or otherwise the risk and security perception of people that sometimes can be very different from real level of risk and security of a given site. Since the perceptions are the result of mostly unconscious elaborations, it is necessary to go deeper and to search for the emotions, triggered by the sensorial stimuli, that determine them. The objective of this paper is to study the perception of risk within the Pompeii Archaeological Park, giving emphasis to the emotional components, using the semantic analysis of the textual contents present in Twitter.","Garzia, Fabio;Borghini, Francesco;Bruni, Alberto;Lombardi, Mara;Mighetto, Paolo;Ramalingam, Soodamani;Russo, Simona B.",Journal,International Journal of Safety and Security Engineering,2020-01-01,Europäische Akademie der Wissenschaften und Künste;University of Hertfordshire;Sapienza Università di Roma;Wessex Institute of Technology;Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism;Archaeological Park of Pompeii,Cultural heritage security ;  Open-Source Intelligent Techniques for security ;  Opinion mining for security ;  OSINT ;  Perceived risk assessment for security ;  Sentiment analysis for security
Tripartite Evolutionary Game Theory Approach for Low-Carbon Power Grid Technology Cooperation with Government Intervention,"Low-carbon technology innovation of power grid is vital for grid enterprises to improve their competitiveness and resource utilization efficiency. In this paper, a novel tripartite evolutionary game theory is proposed to examine the behavioral strategies of government, banks, and the grid enterprises in the low-carbon power grid technology innovation cooperation. The evolutionary replication dynamics equations are presented to study evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) of participants. The meaningful simulation results are as follows: from the subsidy perspective, even if the government subsidies are phasing out, the ESS of the low-carbon grid technology cooperation still converges to the Pareto optimal equilibrium; from the cost perspective, the higher low-carbon technology innovation cost only slows down the evolution rate, while the higher business cost of carbon asset pledge credit and the lower incentive cost not only slow down the evolution rate but also change the evolution results. It shows that the business cost of carbon asset pledge credit has a greater impact on the evolution of the system than the incentive cost; from the benefit perspective, increasing the green revenue and the successful probability of the low-carbon technology innovation can both prompt the ESS to evolve to Pareto optimal state, and the effect of the former is greater than the latter. These results provide a theoretical guidance for government to promote the development of low-carbon technology innovation of power grid.","Zhao, Xin;Bai, Yu;DIng, Lili;Wang, Lei",Journal,IEEE Access,2020-01-01,Ocean University of China;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China,government intervention ;  low-carbon technology innovation ;  Power grid enterprises ;  tripartite evolution game

Toward guiding principles for the design of biologically-integrated electrodes for the central nervous system,"Innovation in electrode design has produced a myriad of new and creative strategies for interfacing the nervous system with softer, less invasive, more broadly distributed sites with high spatial resolution. However, despite rapid growth in the use of implanted electrode arrays in research and clinical applications, there are no broadly accepted guiding principles for the design of biocompatible chronic recording interfaces in the central nervous system (CNS). Studies suggest that the architecture and flexibility of devices play important roles in determining effective tissue integration: device feature dimensions (varying from 'sub'- to 'supra'-cellular scales, <10 µm to >100 µm), Young's modulus, and bending modulus have all been identified as key features of design. However, critical knowledge gaps remain in the field with respect to the underlying motivation for these designs: (1) a systematic study of the relationship between device design features (materials, architecture, flexibility), biointegration, and signal quality needs to be performed, including controls for interaction effects between design features, (2) benchmarks for success need to be determined (biological integration, recording performance, longevity, stability), and (3) user results, particularly those that champion a specific design or electrode modification, need to be replicated across laboratories. Finally, the ancillary effects of factors such as tethering, site impedance and insertion method need to be considered. Here, we briefly review observations to-date of device design effects on tissue integration and performance, and then highlight the need for comprehensive and systematic testing of these effects moving forward.","Thompson, Cort H.;Riggins, Ti'Air E.;Patel, Paras R.;Chestek, Cynthia A.;Li, Wen;Purcell, Erin",Journal,Journal of Neural Engineering,2020-01-01,"College of Engineering;Michigan State University;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",biocompatibility ;  biological integration ;  gliosis ;  microelectrode array ;  neural engineering ;  neural interface design ;  neuroprosthesis
Innovation for the environment: The experience of marche multiservizi S.p.A.,"""Innovation to reach excellence, to reduce environmental impact, to optimize costs and improve efficiency"". Innovation has always had an important role for Marche Multiservizi S.p.A., the biggest multi service provider of the province of Pesaro and Urbino. Our Company has always invested in research and technology to develop the services it manages within its territory. Its activities contribute to the growth of the territory it manages. The study developed by the Engineering and Construction Department of Marche Multiservizi, fits into this context, with the mission of improving the cost-benefit analysis that compares the traditional pipe laying techniques with trenchless technologies, with a focus on Horizontal Directional Drilling technology (HDD). The research concerned three fundamental variables to choose the best method to lay high-density polyethylene water pipes (HDPE) with an external diameter of 110mm, the cost of the intervention, the duration of construction and CO2 emissions. With regards to the first two variables, the results show that it is advantageous to adopt HDD technology for interventions of 100 m or more, as opposed to traditional open-dig excavation techniques. Using trenchless technology, the costs are similar, but the execution times are considerably lower. The most interesting result was obtained in the analytical quantification of CO2 emissions determined for the two different laying techniques (HDD vs open dig) applicable for the construction of a 1,000 m aqueduct in HDPE - with an external diameter of 110mm. It was found that the Horizontal Directional Drilling technology involved a considerable reduction in CO2 emissions equal to 68 tons of CO2, considering Equivalent Tons of Petroleum (TEP) and Embodied Carbon (Kg CO2e/Kg) for each type of material and the various machines used in each construction process. The result corresponds to the emissions produced by the annual electricity needs of about 71 families, an environmentally favorable result.","Bruni, Niko",Conference Proceeding,37th International NO-DIG Conference and Exhibition 2019,2020-01-01,Marche Multiservizi S.p.A.,
Model of commercialization of university’s innovations based on AI,"Purpose: The purpose of the work is to determine the current problems of commercialization of universities’ innovations in modern Russia, to substantiate the perspectives of solving them, and to develop a model of organization of this process based on AI. Design/Methodology/Approach: The authors use the information and analytical materials as a result of monitoring of effectiveness of the activities of educational organizations of higher education in 2018, performed by the Ministry of Science and Education of the Russian Federation. The research is performed by the example of universities of Volgograd Oblast (Russia), which show high research activities and consider commercialization of their innovations as one of the main sources of revenues. The data are processed with the help of comparative analysis, calculation of direct average, and correlation analysis. Findings: It is determined that imperfection of the existing practice of commercialization of universities’ innovations is explained by the negative influence of the “human factor”, which is connected to fragmentary analysis of the market of innovations, reduction of university’s profit during conclusion of an agreement on supply of innovations, and incompleteness of the provided services that are necessary for commercialization of innovations. This influence is overcome in the developed authors’ model of commercialization of university’s innovations based on AI. Originality/Value: The offered model envisages full-scale intellectual decision support during the whole process of commercialization of university’s innovations, from formation of the offer of innovations in the market to automatized engineering at the company that implemented university’s innovations. Thus, the model’s advantages are achieved – reduction of burden on the university’s representative, who is responsible for commercialization of innovations, and maximization of profit (revenue) of the university from it.","Sitnikova, Svetlana E.;Polusmakova, Natalia S.;Golovetsky, Nikolay Y.",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation;Volgograd State University;Volgogradskij Gosudarstvennyj Medicinskij Universitet,AI ;  Commercialization ;  Human factor ;  Innovations ;  Russia ;  University
Magneto-origami structures: Engineering multi-stability and dynamics via magnetic-elastic coupling,"Origami provides a flexible platform for constructing three-dimensional multi-stable mechanical metamaterials and structures. While possessing many interesting features originating from folding, the development of multi-stable origami structures is faced with tremendous demands for acquiring tunability and adaptability. Through an integration of origami folding with magnets, this research proposes a novel approach to synthesize and harness multi-stable magneto-origami structures. Based on the stacked Miura-ori and the Kresling-ori structures, we reveal that the embedded magnets could effectively tune the structure's potential energy landscapes, which includes not only altering the position and the depth of the potential wells but essentially eliminating the intrinsic potential wells or generating new potential wells. Such magnet-induced evolutions of potential energy landscapes would accordingly change the origami structure's stability profiles and the constitutive force-displacement relations. Based on proof-of-concept prototypes with permeant magnets, the theoretically predicted effects of magnets are verified. The exploration is also extended to the dynamics realm. Numerical studies suggest that the incorporated magnets not only could translate the critical frequencies for achieving certain dynamical behaviors but also fundamentally adjust the frequency-amplitude relationship. Overall, this study shows that the proposed approach would provide a novel means to control the stability profile as well as the mechanics and dynamic characteristics of origami structures, and thus, inspire new innovations in designing adaptive mechanical metamaterials and structures.","Fang, Hongbin;Chang, Tse Shao;Wang, K.

Once the research has been carried out, it is concluded that the percentage of women who graduate in relation to the percentage of men, per academic semester 2012-II to 2018-II, is equal to 8.1%. Likewise, the weighted average of the academic performance of women graduated in the professional career of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, is 12.98, this represents a high average for the career; so it can be indicated that the 38 women graduated, have had a good academic performance. Finally, it is concluded that there is a high Spearman ratio of 0.822 between the weighted average by specialty with the field of labor action; These results agree with what has been indicated in relation to the fact that there is a higher qualification in the specialty of Mechanics (AM) with a weighted average range of subjects from 11.73 to 15.42, and according to professional practice reports, of the 38 women graduated from the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering career, 25 are working in the field of Mechanical specialty. With these results it can be said that although the percentage of women linked to this career is still low; Women in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering have a good academic development, which is why women should continue to be encouraged to be included in the area of science, technology and innovation.","Santillan, Dora Yvonne Arce;Atalaya, Omar Freddy Chamorro;Chacón, Yesica Pamela Leandro;Bedriñana, Jorge Isaac Castro;Santillán, Elizabeth Rosario Martínez",Journal,"Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems",2020-01-01,Universidad Nacional Tecnológica De Lima Sur;Universidad Nacional del Centro del Perú;Federico Villarreal National University,Academic performance ;  Development field ;  Electrical subjects ;  Graduated women ;  Mechanical and electrical engineering ;  Mechanics subjects
Motivators and barriers in undergraduate mechanical engineering students’ use of learning resources,"As innovations in instructional methods and educational technology become more prevalent, it becomes increasingly important to understand how research-based learning resources are utilised by students in their education. This qualitative study examines the motivators and barriers impacting students’ choices to engage with their class-provided learning resources. Students from two semesters of a core, undergraduate Dynamics course were interviewed regarding their study habits, use of resources, and perceptions of the course environment. Our results centre on availability and relevance: students were motivated to find immediately available, effective resources, and often encountered barriers due to scheduling concerns and doubts regarding the information their resources provided. Our findings expand on previous literature examining students’ help seeking choices, giving insight into students’ individual needs and concerns within a Blended Learning context. The implications of these findings are discussed, including concrete changes to the existing Dynamics course and insights regarding opportunities for future inquiry.","Evenhouse, David;Kandakatla, Rohit;Berger, Edward;Rhoads, Jeffrey F.;DeBoer, Jennifer",Journal,European Journal of Engineering Education,2020-01-01,Purdue University,active learning ;  blended learning ;  help seeking behaviour ;  mechanical engineering ;  Pedagogy of higher education
"Redefining structural art: Strategies, necessities and opportunities","The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs estimates that by 2050 the world’s population will have increased by over 2.1bn people1. Providing housing and infrastructure for these people would essentially require building an amount equivalent to what currently exists. It is simply not possible to build in the future the way we do today if we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, slow the depletion of natural resources and minimise waste production. These challenges can only be addressed if engineers and architects actively include them at the source of their designs. Through full-scale, built research demonstrators by the Block Research Group at ETH Zurich, this paper presents strategies, based on advances in computational structural design and digital fabrication, to take on these challenges, offering opportunities for a necessary disruptive change. It furthermore calls for a rethinking of how we collaborate, teach engineering and develop building codes to allow for greater flexibility and innovation.","Block, Philippe;Van Mele, Tom;Rippmann, Matthias;Ranaudo, Francesco;Calvo Barentin, Cristián;Paulson, Noelle",Trade Journal,Structural Engineer,2020-01-01,ETH Zürich,
Analysis of physical and microstructural properties on parit nipah peat particles as sustainable asphalt modifier,"Innovations were conducted continuously to create sustainable asphalt modifier. In this research it is focused on the investigation work of the asphalt binder modified properties with different percentages of one different micro material. This material is Parit Nipah Peat. The investigation is about the physical properties of asphalt binders modified with Parit Nipah Peat PNpt.M.A. PNpt leads to make a lot of changes in internal and external of the samples that checked via penetration test, ductility test, and Scanning Electron Microscopic. The Parit Nipah Peat was added to the original binder with a high shear blender then used at 1500 rpm to mix the PNpt with the binder. Three (3) different percentages were mixed by weight of binder to modify the asphalt binder with the binder at 0, 3%, 5% and 7%. This material has a high ability to distribution with asphalt, appears to be plain and homogeneous and different structure after blended with bitumen. The physical property of modified binders enhanced the binder properties, as the results of penetration test, ductility test and distribution inside the binder showed that. Adding a different concentration of PNpt to base binder had significant effects of high resistant changing volume and increased hardness.","Mohd Masirin, Mohd Idrus;Ali, Ahmed Suliman B.;Mustapa, Mohammad Sukri;Abd Rahman, Raha;Wagiman, Abdullah;Aziz, Muhammad Isom",Book Series,Materials Science Forum,2020-01-01,Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia;PRASARANA BERHAD,Asphalt ;  Binder Modifier ;  Peat Particles ;  Point of Homogeneity ;  Road Material
Improving circular economy business models: Opportunities for Business and Innovation A new framework for businesses to create a truly circular economy,"The circular economy (CE) is aimed at closing material loops by reducing and recovering resources in production and consumption processes. Many studies have discussed how CE helps companies create business opportunities while bringing environmental benefits. The business case for CE involves complicated issues such as industrial symbiosis, governmental interventions and the transformation of company culture. It is important to consider the whole context of CE when changing policies or business elements to optimise resource efficiency and avoid unsustainable consumption. By reviewing industry research reports and academic studies, this article summarises important circular business models and strategies and indicates current major barriers to CE. In addition, we explore multiple business cases and point out three important considerations that, if not used correctly, can lead to improper policies and environmental degradation when designing circular business models. These are (a) the use of biodegradable materials, (b) modular design for product life extension and (c) upcycling for new production processes. We then present a framework for companies to clarify vital considerations for resolving these issues based on systems thinking. The implications for business managers and policy makers are also discussed. This article serves to provide a better understanding of CE and explores how companies innovate in line with CE trends.","Chen, Chong Wen",Journal,Johnson Matthey Technology Review,2020-01-01,Yuan Ze University,

Performance-based regulations for safety management systems in the canadian railway industry: An analytical discussion,"The Canadian Railway Safety Act regulations require that railways implement safety management systems (SMS). The intent of this requirement was to promote companies’ safety culture, better management of safety risks, and demonstration of compliance with rules and engineering standards in day-to-day operations, while also reflecting on their processes and becoming more innovative. Yet, the railway disaster at Lac Mégantic in 2013 — which claimed 47 lives — demonstrated that SMS have been applied unevenly by railroads. A Canadian Pacific railroad derailment on 3 February 2019 with strikingly similar circumstances — which claimed 3 lives — demonstrates that these safety issues persist. In this article, we discuss and propose the adaptation of enhanced SMS implementation, within clearer performance-based regulation and risk management methods. We draw from other jurisdictions and research to demonstrate how this would encourage continuous improvement and innovation by railway operators and in concert with partners and relevant stakeholders.","Lefsrud, Lianne;Macciotta, Renato;Nkoro, Anne",Journal,Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering,2020-01-01,University of Alberta,Performance-based regulation ;  Railways ;  Risk ;  Safety management systems
Experiences on developing intuitive thinking among university-level teachers,"This study investigates the impact from two courses focusing on the development of intuition. Intuition is an integral part of human thinking, and its role is essential in all creative processes. Yet the potential of intuition is completely ignored in school education. The data consists of 20 University level teachers who joined a course in intuition development. The teachers represent domains varying from design to architecture, engineering and economics, and the major research goals shared in these domains are production of creative ideas, innovation and complex problem solving skills. The focus of the study is to research how the course affects teachers' opinions on intuitive thinking, their use of intuition, as well as the utility of the methods used to develop intuition. Teachers' opinions and experiences of intuition were asked before and after the course. The follow-up part of the research aims at measuring the actual impact of the course: the change in frequency of utilizing intuitive thinking in their personal life and in teaching, as well as if the teachers were supporting students' intuitive faculties. The outcomes suggest that even a single course encourages participants to pay more attention to intuition and increases the awareness and use of intuitive faculties. Most of the participants felt that they had learned new methods of observing and utilizing their intuition during the course, and most of them had deepened their understanding of their personal intuitive process. An interesting outcome is that after the course the amount of time used for thinking about intuition-related issues had increased remarkably. Furthermore, most of the teachers had found brand new methods of developing their intuition further.","Raami, Asta",Conference Proceeding,"EKSIG 2013: Knowing Inside Out - Experiential Knowledge, Expertise and Connoisseurship - International Conference 2013 of the Design Research Society Special Interest Group on Experiential Knowledge, Conference Proceedings",2020-01-01,Aalto University,Design ;  Higher education ;  Intuition ;  Learning ;  Tacit knowledge

Distributed student team work in challenge-based innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) course,"Challenge-based learning is proposed as an alternative to traditional learning in training engineering graduates with the skills for the future. It puts equal emphasis on academic learning and on competences that students need more for their jobs. Challenge-based leaning is the learning in which students learn through understanding and resolution of a real-world challenge. In this paper we show how such challenge-based course can be implemented in a cross-university setting in which students work on challenges provided by companies: the Universities that implemented the course are University of Trento, UNITN, Italy and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, UPM, Spain and in it students form and work in teams composed of students coming from both of the locations. Both of the locations delivered the course at the same time. The positive feedback from the students shows the importance of such new multi method to train students adequately for remote team-work and training them with skills for 21st century, especially in the era of digital transformation. In addition, our paper draws important leanings on how to set such cross-university teams as well as important future research directions.","Pisoni, Galena;Segovia, Javier;Stoycheva, Milena;Marchese, Maurizio",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020-01-01,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Università di Trento,Challenge-based learning ;  Collaborative learning ;  I&E Education ;  Remote learning ;  Team work

Pathology of R&D management in subsidiary companies of Iran's Energy ministry and planning for the establishment of regional and sectorial innovation system in Khuzestan Water and Power Industry (Case study: Khuzestan water and Power authority Co. (KWPA)),"This article has been deduced from the results of research activities of Khuzestan Water and Power Authority Company (KWPA). This company has always had the first rank among the subsidiary companies of Energy ministry. But its research system has a few issues: - The first issue is the non-functionality of many research projects being done in KWPA during these twenty years. - The second issue, is that the outcomes of most of research works are only booklets. This means that the results were not raw materials and technological products or services. - The third issue is that many of the research projects being contracted with the local universities were eventually the share of within-capital (Ahvaz) universities. Thus, the universities located out of the capital had only one percent of the research contracts to be signed for themselves. In this paper these issues are explained and a solution will be offered to fix them. The applied technologies in Water & Power industry can be divided into six categories: 1-the technology of human sciences and soft technology, 2-the technology of monitoring, control and instrumentation, 3- simulator technology and co-decision making support of water resources, 4-the technology of water manufacturing and engineering, 5-hydraulic structures technology, 6-hydro power plants and renewable technology. These issues have caused that the needed technologies in the water industry are not taught at universities in the province or don't have applicable aspects. For example, Khuzestan produces more than 95 percent of the country's hydropower, but even one master's degree or doctorate in the field of hydroelectric plants is not graduated in the universities of the province. In other disciplines such as law and economics of water, instrumentation and control, automation, water supply, etc. the situation is the same too. To solve these problems, we are trying to implement regional and sectorial innovation systems during the sixth five-year of Iran's development program. At the moment, memorandums of cooperation have been signed with provincial universities so that each university, according to its ability, works out in a certain research area. In addition, the centre of technology development and commercialization exhibition have been set up. The three questions being mentioned at the beginning of the paper are answered by this solution. Firstly, it has been tried that the research projects be more various and include all six required sciences and technologies for subsidiaries. Also, there are a lot of attempts to pursue achieving these technologies and their commercialization until 2025. Secondly, the universities out of the capital have the same opportunity as the universities within the capital to carry out research activities. This situation has created an effective competition between the universities. Also, the cooperation with the universities located outside the province or outside the country will be gained by the discretion of the employer or university.","Orejloo, Mehrdad Heidari;Asef, Fereshteh Pour;Zadeh, Reza Alagheband",Conference Proceeding,"26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017",2020-01-01,KWPA,Iran ;  Khuzestan ;  KWPA ;  Subsidiary companies ;  Water & Power industry
Industry 4.0 - Integration strategies for small and medium-sized enterprises,"Many industrial countries worldwide are confronted with multiple challenges such as globalization, increased volatility of markets, abbreviated innovation cycles, intensified competition and augmented complexity. As a result, the German government has initiated Industry 4.0, the German program for the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things to respond to these challenges and maintain future competitiveness for the German industry. It integrates current technological trends into industrial production, assisting to improve complex systems of value creation. Main elements include horizontal and vertical interconnection within value chains of people, products and machines, using intelligent and self-regulating technologies. Alongside with technical challenges, organizational conversions will be undergone. In contrast to research in technical fields, economical sciences have investigated the topic of Industry 4.0 less so far. Especially the interconnection of the entire value-added chain, also across enterprises, has to be considered in this context. We claim that small and medium-sized enterprises are especially important for investigating the introduction of Industry 4.0 in the industrial value-added chain, as small and medium-sized enterprises represent high importance for the German industry, encompassing 99.6 per cent of enterprises, 59.4 of employees, 54.8 per cent of value added and 35.9 per cent of annual turnover. However, research in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises and Industry 4.0 remains scarce. For the investigation within multiple case studies, small and medium-sized enterprises are especially suitable, as leading personnel has a holistic view on the entire enterprise. Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises have distinct characteristics, such as limited resources, that influence the integration of innovations and technologies. Conclusively, this study addresses the following research question: Which specific characteristics regarding the introduction of Industry 4.0 exist in small and medium-sized enterprises and how can those be addressed with accordingly designed integration strategies? In response to rare research in this field, we use an exploratory and qualitative case study research design based on 68 in-depth expert interviews within the three most important German industry sectors, mechanical and plant engineering, electrical engineering and automotive suppliers. Interviews were conducted with leading personnel of the respective enterprises, including 41 CEOs. We find that small and medium-sized enterprises have several limiting factors concerning the integration of Industry 4.0, such as a low degree of standardization, lack of personnel and financial resources and low levels of trust in digitization. We assign these challenges for the respective business models of the regarded enterprises. Here, we find distinct characteristics between suppliers of Industry 4.0-based solutions, generally more affected, and enterprises applying Industry 4.0 in production. Thereupon, we find integration strategies, such as the cooperation with other small and medium-sized enterprises along the value-added chain in order to find economies of scope and turning to services rather than production, to strengthen one core competency of small and medium-sized enterprises, individual solutions and personal contact.","Müller, Julian Marius;Voigt, Kai Ingo",Conference Proceeding,"26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017",2020-01-01,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Business Model ;  Industrial Internet of Things ;  Industry 4.0 ;  Multiple case study ;  Small and medium-sized enterprises
Proposal of a postgraduate course in the Argentine Northwest (NOA) on management of technology and innovation,"Availability of local people having competencies to visualize and manage the interdisciplinary cross-links of technology is paramount to the development of regions in developing countries. In this paper we analyze the creation of a MoT Master degree offered by a network of five National Universities belonging to the CODINOA Network (Council of Engineering Deans of the Northwest Region in Argentina). Through the financing of the Strategic Program of Training of Human Resources in Research and Development (PERHID) promoted by the National Interuniversity Council (CIN) of Argentina, the proposal for the postgraduate course is elaborated. Through expert panel methodologie and brainstorming, national and international experts hired by the program, together with the stakeholders of the 5 universities, define the career objectives, the profile of graduates and the curriculum. The guidelines of the ""Template for graduate programs in Management of Technology"" are considered in the proposal in view of a future application in the accreditation of the program. The present work reveals the associative dynamics of the Universities, which combine their efforts in order to overcome restrictions and fit their particular context. In this case, networking with other institutions is essential, especially those that allow an efficient transfer of knowledge in the thematic to the productive tissue. This work aims to contribute to enhance the knowledge value chain in the NOA region, through the insertion of graduates in local industries, universities and public institution.","Rey, Julio Rodriguez;Pardo, Mauricio Camargo;Cabrera, Miguel Angel",Conference Proceeding,"26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017",2020-01-01,ERPI (Équipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs);Universidad Nacional de Tucuman (UNT),Local network ;  MOT ;  Postgraduate program ;  Regional development
Technology innovation system analysis of electricity smart metering in the european union,"Between 2018 and 2023 the penetration rate of electricity smart meters in the European Union (EU) is expected to grow from approximately 44% to 71%. The unprecedently rapid development of smart metering (SM) as an ICT-enabled technological novelty is progressing in a complex, multi-actor innovation system, which is strongly driven by EU-level institutions and policies. This paper presents the comprehensive Technology Innovation System (TIS) analysis of electricity SM development in the EU, with a focus placed on regulatory aspects. The article identifies the key elements of the SM innovation system (technologies and infrastructures; actors and networks; institutions and policies) and characterises their interaction based on an in-depth desk research and a critical assessment of regulations, statistics and primary and grey literature sources (e.g., market reports). The main enablers and barriers for EU-level SM TIS development are studied. The major driving force for EU-level SM TIS is the clear, yet evolving vision of EU-level actors for the SM deployment, founded on the grounds of energy conservation and empowerment of customers. On the other hand, the major inhibitor is the insufficient regulatory framework for roll-outs at the level of a Member State, which does not fully ensure interoperability, data protection and security standards or organisational effectiveness .","Kochański, Maksymilian;Korczak, Katarzyna;Skoczkowski, Tadeusz",Journal,Energies,2020-01-01,Research and Innovation Centre Pro-Akademia;Politechnika Warszawska,Electricity metering ;  EU ;  Smart meter ;  Smart metering ;  Technology innovation system

Innovations in round bamboo construction,"At present, existing round bamboo constructions have following limitations: first, the service life of raw bamboo is short, only about 2-3 years, and the corresponding treatment method is difficult to meet the international environmental protection requirements. Secondly, the construction technology is backward, the connection and support methods are simple and weak, cannot meet the requirements of the modern structural design. Finally, traditional round bamboo building products have insufficient innovation in design and low added value. With the purpose of solving the above problems, the bamboo-based product design company of the author focused on the research and development of round bamboo construction in the following aspects: 1) anti-corrosion and anti-mildew treatment of raw bamboo, 2) connection system, and applied for the related patents. At the same time, this research also introduces the actual engineering design cases based on it.","Cai, W.;Li, T.",Conference Proceeding,"Modern Engineered Bamboo Structures - Proceedings of the Sustainable Bamboo Building Materials Symposium of BARC 2018 and 3rd International Conference on Modern Bamboo Structures, ICBS 2018",2020-01-01,Nanjing Tech University;Zhujing Bamboo Company,

Fault Diagnosis Strategy for Wind Turbine Generator Based on the Gaussian Process Metamodel,"To facilitate continuous development of the wind power industry, maintaining technological innovation and reducing cost per kilowatt hour of the electricity generated by the wind turbine generator system (WTGS) are effective measures to facilitate the industrial development. Therefore, the improvement of the system availability for wind farms becomes an important issue which can significantly reduce the operational cost. To improve the system availability, it is necessary to diagnose the system fault for the wind turbine generator so as to find the key factors that influence the system performance and further reduce the maintenance cost. In this paper, a wind farm with 200 MW installed capacity in eastern coastal plain in China is chosen as the research object. A prediction model of wind farm's faults is constructed based on the Gaussian process metamodel. By comparing with actual observation results, the constructed model is proved able to predict failure events of the wind turbine generator accurately. The developed model is further used to analyze the key factors that influence the system failure. These are conducive to increase the running and maintenance efficiency in wind farms, shorten downtime caused by failure, and increase earnings of wind farms.","Zhang, Dongmei;Yuan, Jun;Zhu, Jiang;Ji, Qingchang;Zhang, Xintong;Liu, Hao",Journal,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2020-01-01,"Shanghai Maritime University;Hebei University;Vestas Wind Technology (China) Co., Ltd.;Powerchina Hebei Electric Power Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd.",
On the problem of contouring core values for the future of rock mechanics (Publisher’s view),"The paper is devoted to the problem of conceptual approaches to contouring core values for the future of rock mechanics. A special attention is paid to the historical precedents: discussions and meetings between specialists in mining and geological sciences and academic philosophy in the first half of the 1980s (retrospective collection of the articles and monographs on development problems of these sciences and critics of issues of natural sciences and technical innovations is presented). The role of Gornyi Zhurnal in preserving and maintaining the required level of interdisciplinary synthesis of sciences is emphasized. The problems and challenges arising before the professional rock mechanics community are formulated as: operation in the conditions of lack of remedies, archaic legal and regulatory framework, and sophistication of technical aims. It is noted that the listed challenges are associated with hierarchically more complex problem—gradual destruction of the unipolar world and inevitable fundamental challenges and opportunities, caused by this destruction itself. The key problems suggested to be raised within the discussion sites of the II Technical Council are underlined and stated in the ultimately simplified and universal formulations. The internal and complex cause–effect relationship between the actual rock mechanics issues is emphasized. It expands over the “narrow borders” of the subject towards scale widening of formulation and solution of problems via so-called “resource arrangements” (the practical example of such arrangements is presented). The final part of the article includes explanation of the principally important aspect of interaction between the Technical Council participant and scientific–production periodical media (presented by Gornyi Zhurnal) as the main area for the serious discussions of current rock mechanics problems requiring high-skill solution. The core value measurement of this interaction is underlined. The authors appreciate participation of V. A. Eremenko, Director of Research Center for Applied Geomechanics and Convergent Technologies in Mining, Professor, Doctor of Engineering Sciences in preparation of this article.","Vorobev, S.

Adopting an actor analysis framework to a complex technology innovation project: A case study of an electric road system,"An electric road system (ERS) is a transportation solution that provides electricity for fully electric vehicles while in motion. This solution might contribute to sustainable transportation by overcoming range anxiety problems that fully electric vehicles, especially heavy vehicles, have encountered due to battery technology limitations. However, large-scale ERS implementations are challenging, both technically and socially. An ERS is not only an engineering project, but also a complex technology innovation system composed of multiple subsystems and stakeholders, which requires an interdisciplinary means of aligning relations, problems, and solutions. In the policy analysis domain, researchers have developed actor analysis methods to support policy making processes. Actor analysis methods can provide an analytical reflection in solving complex multi-actor policy making challenges that ERSs are also facing. To uncover the complexity of multiple subsystems and stakeholders involved in an ERS, this paper applied a method to align system characteristics with the stakeholders’ perceptions to understand multi-stakeholder contexts in complex technology innovation projects. Desk research was first conducted to summarise ERS characteristics. Then, the dynamic actor network analysis method framework was adopted to establish an action, factor, goal (AFG) list, which was revised by independent researchers. Next, the AFG list was used to collect the perceptions of the ERS stakeholders, expressed as AFG selections and causal links through stakeholder interviews. The resulting AFG list was iterated through two rounds of interviews and then validated in a Swedish ERS case workshop. The results from this methodology showed that the actor analysis method can not only be applied to policy analysis domains, but can also be applied to technology innovation complex systems, using the electric road system as a case study, to help uncover the ERS complexity from the concerns of stakeholders and to secure a pathway towards sustainable technology implementation.","Wang, Qiuchen;Hauge, Jannicke Baalsrud;Meijer, Sebastiaan",Journal,Sustainability (Switzerland),2020-01-01,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Actor network analysis ;  Electric road system ;  Stakeholder analysis ;  System analysis

The role of innovation labs in advancing the relevance of public service media: The cases of BBC news labs and RTVE LAB,"As part of their social function, Public Service Media (PSM) organizations are devoted to innovation. In this context, a number of European PSM outlets have created laboratories based on the implementation of products, services and formats for multiplatform audiences. Our research focused on two case studies: a) BBC News Labs (UK) and b) RTVE Lab (Spain). We applied both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. We used content analysis techniques to examine products generated by the two laboratories between 2013 and 2017, quantifying and classifying each one according to categories related to the type and nature of the innovation. We carried out ethnographic research using participant observation over five days in each laboratory, both in London and Madrid. We also conducted open-ended interviews with five professionals at the BBC and three at RTVE, as well as with the head of EBU’s Media Strategy & Development department. Our results show that BBC News Labs implements a global innovation strategy through the design and engineering of products that facilitate journalists’ work. Projects include speech-to-text software, prototypes for voice recognition and text analysis, chatbots and object-based media. On the other hand, RTVE Lab focuses on designing and producing interactive formats, multimedia narratives and social media content, with an emphasis on experimentation. The findings reveal the main barriers and incentives to innovation within each lab and show how the transfer of innovation could increase the diversity, universality and quality of their overall output.","Zaragoza Fuster, María Teresa;García Avilés, José Alberto",Journal,Communication and Society,2020-01-01,Universidad Miguel Hernández de Elche,Innovation ;  Media labs ;  Public Service Media ;  Transfer of results ;  Universalism
Trends in biotechnology at the turn of the millennium,"Background: The concept of biotechnology has gained wide popularity by the time. There is, of course, some anecdotal evidence as to what topics are currently considered the most prominent and how they can be compared to the common perception of which research topics were considered “trendy” years ago. Objective: A thorough search of exact time frames can help us quantitatively determine the evolution of prominent biotechnology research topics since the turn of the century. Methods: A text data mining approach has been followed to better identify the emerging trends and perspectives in biotechnology, taking a look back at how the focus of research and innovation in biotechnology has shifted, evolved and impacted the human race over the past three decades. Results: The extent of biotechnology today is vast, however, the most important newly developed research themes and patents largely influence human healthcare, affecting hundreds of millions of people who use grafts, devices, diagnostics, treatment and delivery systems. Even if biotechnology is very much focused on healthcare, there is also focus on other specialized concepts, such as bio-fuel, biocatalyst, food, agriculture and water purification, which have a strong influence on the research topics studied today. Conclusion: We are in the process of developing the practice of medicine through pioneering advances in biotechnology research and innovation. As companies continue to develop emerging treatment strategies (involving gene therapy, stem cells, nanomedicine and new drug delivery sys-tems) that address significant unmet needs, future innovations in biotechnology research will bring exciting new advancements to help millions of more people worldwide.","Mozafari, Masoud;Tariverdian, Tara;Beynaghi, Ali",Journal,Recent Patents on Biotechnology,2020-01-01,School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine (IUMS);Amirkabir University of Technology,Biotechnology ;  Healthcare ;  Innovation ;  Patents ;  Research ;  Trends
Eine qualitative Studie How nurses assess telepresence systems in outpatient care. A qualitative study,"Background: Robotic assistance devices are reviewed as being promising technological developments in healthcare to assist elderly patients and to foster autonomy in their home environment as long as possible. Also, telepresence systems (tps) currently in use to facilitate several nursing tasks are reviewed under the same perspective. Aim: The study aims to describe how nurses estimate the use of a tps in outpatient care. Method: After a presentation of a tps, focus groups of nurses (n = 4) in Saxony-Anhalt discussed freely on possible applications, concerns and potential of the system in outpatient care. The analysis followed the documentary method developed by Bohnsack, Nentwig-Gesemann & Nohl (2007). Results: The tps presented was considered rather unsuitable for practical application in outpatient care. As main reasons nurses voiced theirs and patients' lack of technical competence; limited mobility functions of the device; ethical and financial concerns. The opportunity to intensify contact between patients and relatives was considered very positive. Faster contact in case of emergency as well as nurse supervised intake of medication were considered as important further practical applications of the device. Conclusions: Tps are not suitable yet for practical implementation in outpatient care. Acquiring appropriate technical knowledge during nursing education programs can help nurses to participate in the engineering development process this way increasing the potential of such devices and more in general can help nurses to handle more easily further technical innovations in healthcare.","Geier, Julia;Mauch, Melanie;Patsch, Maximilian;Paulicke, Denny",Journal,Pflege,2020-01-01,Klinikum Stuttgart;Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg;Klinikum St. Elisabeth und St. Barbara Halle (Saale);Evangelische Hochschule Nürnberg,community nurse ;  outpatient care ;  Robotic assistance ;  telepresence system
Interdisciplinary critical and design thinking,"Despite the importance of design thinking, there has been little research on interdisciplinary augmentation and the clear articulation of cognitive domain effects is still missing. The present study explores students' perceptions of and experiences in critical thinking and students' creative design ability in different study disciplines and explores correlations between students' attitudes and beliefs towards critical thinking and their design thinking ability.Asample of 268 students aged 21-23 years was collected. The students' majors include preservice technology and engineering teachers' education, chemical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. For all subjects, critical thinking and design thinking are considered important interdisciplinary capabilities. Our findings suggest that the students' critical thinking might markedly affect their creative design ability. The ways in which each discipline is taught can be transferred across different knowledge and skill domains. We found that the most creative designers are mechanical engineering students, especially in terms of the originality and usefulness of design, while their divergent thinking ability might be improved with methods used in technology and engineering teacher education. Electrical and computer engineering students can benefit when interdisciplinary methods for improving understanding are applied as evidenced by the chemical and mechanical engineering curriculum. We also suggest that female students, who dominate in divergent thinking and critical thinking, might improve team learning and decision-making where transferable skills can be enhanced along with pedagogical content knowledge. These findings have implications for interdisciplinary innovation learning and creative design assessment.","Šuligoj, Veronika;Žavbi, Roman;Avsec, Stanislav",Journal,International Journal of Engineering Education,2020-01-01,Univerza v Ljubljani,Correlation analysis ;  Creative design ability ;  Critical thinking ;  Design thinking ;  Interdisciplinarity

A Delphi-based study on the innovation practices in the Albanian financial sector,"Based on an application of the Delphi technique, this paper aims to analyse the current situation of innovation practices in Albania, based on an application of the Delphi technique to a panel of Albanian financial institutions executives. Despite the short life of most of the financial companies in the Albanian trade market, results show that executives have a relatively good level of knowledge regarding the benefits of the innovation approach to the firm, but there is a lack of some innovation types used by their companies. Furthermore, there is a low level of investment amount to be spent in innovation, indicating a non-possibility to create new products or processes and thus not having the possibility to be a leader and create better promise for the company growth. Government is advised to consider innovation as a mediating factor to achieve better business performance and thus helping and promoting sustainable macroeconomic growth.","Çipi, Amali;Pulaj, Enida",Journal,International Journal of Information Technology and Management,2020-01-01,University “Ismail Qemali” Vlore,Albania ;  Delphi technique ;  Financial companies ;  Innovation ;  Product innovation ;  Technology innovation
Integrating industry seminars into a professional practice module to prepare students for future engineering challenges,"The postgraduate professional practice module at University College London (UCL) has been designed with a range of guest speakers to equip research students for the challenges of the 4th industrial revolution (“Industry 4.0”). This module supports the teaching of software engineering research students within the Department of Computer Science. The focus of the academic lectures are project management skills; providing an understanding of teamwork and leadership, and an appreciation of the importance of ethics, inclusion and diversity. The teaching is aligned with the aims of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) to foster inclusion and sustainability. The industry guest speakers cover a range of topics including: IoT, cloud computing, microservice architecture, security, and cognitive computing. The module currently integrates guest talks from Fujitsu and HSBC covering quantum technologies; microservice architecture and cloud-native development, HPC cloud provision, GDPR, and sustainability from RedHat, Form3, NGINX, and Verne Global. Detailed coverage of: distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) from Digital Asset; team organisation from ThoughtWorks; and cognitive computing, data architectures, and engineering trends from Instana, NetApp, and IBM. It was a considerable challenge to integrate these guest speaker talks with academic lectures, so that the module was delivered in a logical sequence. Without student-generated material and surveys to gauge the extent of understanding before each topic is covered, it would have been far more difficult to deliver this short module. Student feedback indicates that guest lectures help prepare them for their research projects and discussions following talks provide a valuable opportunity for professional-instrumental networking.","Collins, Graham",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

Systemic approach to address complexity in the training of engineers in innovation and creativity: Modelling process of implementing innovative projects,"Innovation has always been considered as a complex and multidisciplinary phenomenon. The understanding and representation of this complexity has been addressed in several works in the field of management sciences from a systemic approach that clarifies the different components of innovation and defines their interrelationships. In this work, the systemic approach to innovation has been addressed in a different complex context, which is the training of mechanical engineers in innovation and creativity. This concept can be regarded as a process involving the interaction of a set of human and material resources managed in order to develop the skills necessary for innovative projects. The main objective of this work is to test the validity of a systemic modelling of the innovation training process for engineers. To this end, the action-research methodology made it possible to experiment with the model proposed during Project-Based Learning (PBL) activities within an engineering school. The analysis of the results confirmed the hypotheses of the effectiveness of the approach adopted in stimulating innovation among engineering students. This approach divides the main process into sub-processes (the implementation process, the support process, and the management process). The contribution of this study lies in the design of a new method that could be applied by professors and students, and which could improve engineering students' ability to innovate while ensuring the professionalization and management of innovative projects.","Zergout, I.;Ajana, S.;Bakkali, S.;Adam, C.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

Herding cats? Reflections on colleagues' perceptions of learning & Teaching in engineering education,"Set at a time of unprecedented uncertainty, this paper presents a critical analysis of one of the themes to emerge out of a phenomenological study in which 48 colleagues from across one of the UK's largest Engineering Education Departments were interviewed about their perceptions of the Department's strategic direction, strengths, challenges and weaknesses. Undertaken with the specific intention of providing a solid basis for the development and launching of an Strategic Organisational Change Strategy, the colloquially termed Herding Cats Project follows an Action Research philosophy embedded within 'Positive Organisational Scholarship'. In critically reflecting upon the early stages of the first part of the Organisational Change Strategy the paper provides an interpretive analysis of one of six themes to emerge out of 48 qualitative, semi-structured interviews conducted with learning and teaching colleagues from a range of engineering programmes and courses. In doing so it deliberately adopts a positive stance, contributing to current debates about managing change in organisations through allowing Engineering Educators individual voices to be heard and reflected on. The paper concludes by acknowledging that whilst on the whole the idea of “managing change in academia” is often viewed as an oxymoron with analogies such as 'herding cats' used to describe the nature of the challenge, the formation and launch of a multi-disciplinary Education Innovation Group (EIG), which has a focus on collegial support, scholarship through empirical investigation and implementation of evidence-based practice, innovation and leadership in learning and teaching, means the time is right to begin to effect organisational change. It is an exciting time to be working with WMG. This paper represents the first of what will be a detailed and empirically grounded account of the issues around effecting change within the UK Engineering Education Sector. Without a doubt, such a debate is both timely and much needed!.","Knowles, G.;Clark, R.;Andrews, J.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

"Application of continuing engineering education talent training model and mixed learning model based on the construction of ""Intelligent Chinese Academy of sciences"" in lifelong education","The training of talents in continuing engineering education should be closely related to the reality of science and technology development, pay attention to the updating of frontier knowledge, strengthen the cultivation of multi-disciplinary integration and innovation ability, and integrate into project-based teaching, so as to construct a new model of engineering education which aims at practicality and effectiveness. Based on the informatization project of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS for short), ""Intelligent CAS "", we explore a new model of continuing engineering education personnel training with cutting-edge features, and it is guided by the frontier scientific research and technology projects, and supported by the ""8+2"" fields of the CAS (frontier crossing, advanced materials, energy, life and health, ocean, resources, ecological environment, information, and photovoltaic space, as well as two public support platforms) and based on the multi-terminal lifelong learning environment integrating open education resources. What's more, we study the mixed learning mode which is based on point, line and surface for scientific and technical engineers and integrate online and offline deeply. We design and practice it from teaching objectives, educational models, the three-level knowledge system, and thematic training, so that we can build a long-term, systematic and practical lifelong education mode, which is centered on learners. So far, the CAS has carried out four years of practice to serve nearly 70,000 scientists. The rapid growth of the learning data shows the effective and practical of this model, which conforms to the law of the development of continuing engineering education itself.","Zhang, Sisi;Zhao, Yixia;Wang, Runqiang;Tao, Yiyuan;Zhang, Qi",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

The creative and transdisciplinary design process: In a Problem Based Learning environment,"In higher education, transdisciplinary master programs have been developed to afford students to combine knowledge and methodologies from different fields and thereby develop an understanding of how to create new innovative solutions. An international and transdisciplinary science and engineering master programme in Lighting Design (LiD) at Aalborg University (AAU) in Copenhagen, bases its teaching on problem-based learning (PBL) and a process model “The Lighting Design Experiment” (LDE), which integrates innovation processes and design research methodologies [1] [2]. Knowledge and methods from the fields of architecture, media technology and lighting engineering are to be synthesized and applied into a problem-based semester project. To investigate to which degree students do consider creativity and innovation as integrated parts of their semester projects, a survey was carried out with 20 students from seven semester project groups, looking for aspects within two creativity components; domain relevant skills and creativity relevant processes [3] [4]. The survey indicates that the transdisciplinary approach seems to create the desired synthesis of knowledge and skills, from each academic field into the semester project despite the different knowledge areas and methodologies represented in the courses of the semester. Whereas the investigation of the creative processes points out three areas of attention for improvement; the framing of the project, the group dynamics, and tools for idea generation. The outcome has provided a better understanding of the inherent potential and barriers for creativity in the transdisciplinary design process, and how to possibly improve these in this PBL project-based design approach.","Hansen, E.

Preferred competences by the labour market in the opinion of higher education students,"A large-scale development of science and technology began in the twentieth century, which has further intensified in the 21st century, reinforcing the role of innovation and technological development both at the individual and organizational level. In the 21st century, not only the ability to develop is a requirement but technological advancement in different areas simultaneously creates competition and the need for co-operation between various actors. Creativity, complexity and innovation can result in novel methods, innovative or different ways of thinking, but at the same time, players in different industries are now forced to cooperate in certain areas of development as it is in their well-recognised state-of-the-art high-tech solution quickly and cost-effectively. We were curious to find out what the Hungarian university students thought about what competencies they needed as career starters and what competencies they wanted to develop. We wanted to assess the proportion of students' expectations in the labour market. We started a research at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences (GTK) and we received students' answers from 21 universities out of 28 state universities in Hungary. The goal was to get the views of students in as many higher education institutions as possible. The online questionnaire was popularized at conferences, professional events and in the social media. University professors and students shared the questionnaire with potential respondents. The response was anonymous and voluntary, in this way, random sampling was performed. Our hypothesis was that students do not know what the labour market expects of them, and therefore they don't develop their skills in the most appropriate direction, either in their choice of elective subjects or in their choice of tasks when fulfilling the subject requirements. As a control question, we asked the students to answer whether the institution of higher education they were attending could meet their prior expectations and whether they trust that their schools would prepare them to face the challenges of the labour market.","Kálmán, A.;Nyéki, E.",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

Innovative methods of teaching sustainable development,"Solutions to problems related to Sustainable Development require a complex, multidisciplinary approach. Experts representing the fields of engineering and natural sciences, as well as social sciences should collaborate in order to achieve meaningful, long term results in the environmental, social and economic domains of sustainability. This requires a shift in how we understand problems and how we develop solutions to them. However, current teaching practices are not able to develop the knowledge and skills required for the solution of our contemporary problems. For this reason, new, innovative methods of teaching are required, especially in higher education. In this article we identify the most important limitations of traditional teaching methods and will also make an effort to provide an overview of available innovative methods currently used around the world. We will share our experiences with three specific innovative teaching methods we used over the last ten years: 1) role plays, which simulate negotiation processes dealing with global environmental and social problems; 2) teaching through consultation projects with the participation of civil sector organisations (NGOs) and 3) social innovation labs, which have been growing all around the world and which promote a better understanding of the environmental and social implications of new technological solutions. Our experiences show that these methods do not only teach invaluable knowledge and skills (e.g. creativity, team decision making, negotiation skills, etc.) to the participating students, but also provide them with a once in a lifetime experience of facing real world problems and inventing solutions to them.","Zilahy, Gyula;Zsóka, Ágnes",Conference Proceeding,"SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

Thus, engaging students in research is a potentially high-impact educational practice. However, previous studies have shown that implementing students' engagement in research faces multiple obstacles that stress on the dimensions culture, resources in higher education institutions, structure of study programmes, academics' qualification and students' competencies. In engineering, however, little attention is spent on what academics and students perceive as barriers and enabling factors. This study highlights conditions for engaging students in research in engineering education. For this, we conducted six semi-structured interviews with students and academics at a German university of technology and analyzed those using thematic analysis. We found that interviewees perceive students' engagement in research differently and associate a wide range of activities. Together, they draw a manifold picture of its constraints. Beside common aspects, they identified the large amount of obligatory basic courses and the lack of practice in undergraduate programmes as hindering; a structure quite typical in German traditional engineering education. They also made various recommendations, such as supporting a culture for engaging students in research, appropriate facilities, and programme-based research skill development. Furthermore, they reported that academics need an open mind for topics of students' interest, while students are required to engage in extracurricular student-academic partnerships in research. Upon those findings, we argue for the need for further research and, subsequently, suggest formulating strategies by involving all stakeholders. This can potentially ensure developing future engineering talents at this university and beyond.","Bulmann, U. B.Ulrike;Bornhöft, S. B.Sara;Ellinger, D.

"Insect-resistant genetically engineered crops in China: Development, application, and prospects for use","With 20% of the world's population but just 7% of the arable land, China has invested heavily in crop biotechnology to increase agricultural productivity. We examine research on insect-resistant genetically engineered (IRGE) crops in China, including strategies to promote their sustainable use. IRGE cotton, rice, and corn lines have been developed and proven efficacious for controlling lepidopteran crop pests. Ecological impact studies have demonstrated conservation of natural enemies of crop pests and halo suppression of crop-pest populations on a local scale. Economic, social, and human health effects are largely positive and, in the case of Bt cotton, have proven sustainable over 20 years of commercial production. Wider adoption of IRGE crops in China is constrained by relatively limited innovation capacity, public misperception, and regulatory inaction, suggesting the need for further financial investment in innovation and greater scientific engagement with the public. The Chinese experience with Bt cotton might inform adoption of other Bt crops in China and other developing countries.","Li, Yunhe;Hallerman, Eric M.;Wu, Kongming;Peng, Yufa",Book Series,Annual Review of Entomology,2020-01-01,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,Bt corn ;  Bt cotton ;  Bt rice ;  ecological impacts ;  insect resistance
Efficient and participatory design of scale-appropriate agricultural machinery workshops in developing countries: A case study in Bangladesh,"Smallholder farmers provide the foundation for food security in South Asia. However, increasing seasonal labor scarcity caused by rural out-migration has resulted in growing agricultural labor costs, presenting challenges to cash-constrained smallholder farmers that hire manual labor for land preparation, sowing, harvest and post-harvest operations. Technological innovations in small-scale agricultural machinery appropriate for the small field sizes and limited resource endowments of South Asia's farmers have been proposed as a potential solution to this problem. An increasing number of development initiatives also promote rural entrepreneurial approaches to mechanization, whereby smallholder farmers can access and use machinery in their own fields on an affordable fee-for-service basis offered by machinery owners. This approach reduces capital constraints for smallholder farmers while enabling entrepreneurs who can afford equipment to enter into business serving stallholder farmers as clients. This approach is now widely practiced in Bangladesh, where machinery entrepreneurs play a crucial role in providing access to productive technologies for smallholder farmers who could not otherwise afford direct purchase of labor- and cost-saving machinery. In order to maintain low machinery purchase costs for emerging yet capital constrained rural entrepreneurs, while also assuring high quality standards, cost-effective domestic production of agricultural machinery is increasingly championed as an important long-term national development objective. With no safety standards or guidelines for best production practices, the few manufacturing workshops that exist within Bangladesh operate inefficiently and without clear rationalization of manufacturing processes. Haphazard copying of prototypes or imported available machinery is common. This leads to inefficient production and poor product quality in an emerging but potentially highly beneficial industry. This paper addresses these problems and presents a case study to increase machinery manufacturers' capacity while improving manufacturing operations and workplace safety through equipment selection, workshop layout, and usability. Janata Engineering (JE) is a small-scale machinery manufacturing enterprise in Bangladesh, specializing in two-wheel tractor attachments such as bed planters, local derivations of power-tiller operated seeders, and other equipment for planting, irrigating, and processing crops. JE was expanding and setting up a second factory for which the authors provided assistance on its design. Our research question was whether participatory action research (PAR) supported by empirical data could provide improved factory design in terms of functionality, safety and human interactions, when compared with conventional approaches driven by technical efficiency concerns alone. Using PAR, we developed a number of alternative process and layout recommendations for JE to increase the efficiency of labor and machinery through improved workflow, throughput, and output. While immediately useful for JE, the process and protocols proposed in this paper are relevant for emerging agricultural machinery manufacturers in Bangladesh and more widely in South Asia.","Gregg, Ellerbe Somers;Colton, Jonathan;Matin, Md Abdul;Krupnik, Timothy J.",Journal,Development Engineering,2020-01-01,College of Engineering;International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center;Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute,Agricultural machinery ;  Fabrication ;  Factory design ;  Participatory action research ;  Two-wheeled tractor
Design of oil and gas well ground manifold connecting aid,"During the construction of drilling engineering, the connection of the blowout line is inconvenient in the well field. Nowadays, there is no effective auxiliary connection tool. In this paper, according to the hydraulic principle and sliding to rolling in the fundamentals of physics so as to reduce friction, we design the production, making the ground manifold to achieve convenient and rapid to make up the connecting pipe system. Being easy to field operation, decreasing the cost of human resources and investment greatly improves the efficiency. Through the innovation of technology, to achieve “dig the potentiality and add the efficiency” is the important step in the era of low oil prices and has the practical value and broad market prospects.","Sun, Yanchao;Chen, Mingxue;Huang, Shengming;Su, Yue;Wang, Qibing;Zhang, Yichang",Book Series,Springer Series in Geomechanics and Geoengineering,2020-01-01,Lanzhou City University,Hydraulic principle ;  Principles of physic ;  Research and development innovation ;  The ground manifold
Requirements for a methodology for the analysis and assessment of technological capability in research and technology organizations,"The advancing globalization and simultaneous liberalization of the markets not only have a tremendous influence on companies in the manufacturing industry but also lead to new challenges for the research sector. Especially Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) as bridges of basic research and the industry favor technological change on the one hand and increase the competitiveness of the industry through innovative solutions on the other. (Arnold, Clark, Jávorka 2010, pp. 9-10; Breznik 2015, pp. 24-25). The resulting high need for technological innovation pushes RTOs to intensify competition for technology leadership to sustain market competitiveness. In this regard, RTOs must be able to develop technological solutions that translate results from research and development activities into state-of-the-art products and services. This can only be achieved when technological resources and competences are efficiently and effectively used to build up competitive advantages. (Kröll 2007, p. 11; Figueiredo 2014, p. 83; Zehnder 1997, p. 20) Therefore, the technological capability of RTOs needs to be defined and analyzed. In this context, the paper aims to contribute to the development of a suitable methodology for systematically analyzing and evaluating the technological capability of RTOs using a standardized approach. Hence, a profound understanding of technological capability of RTOs is to be developed, which will enable the derivation of requirements to be met by an analysis and evaluation methodology which needs to be developed based on the identified requirements of this paper in the future. Subsequently, various methods and approaches for assessing the technological capability will be discussed and evaluated with respect to the specific requirements of RTOs. The outlook is to outline the further procedure for the development of a suitable methodology for the analysis and evaluation of technological performance.","Hecklau, Fabian;Kidschun, Florian;Kohl, Holger;Tominaj, Sokol",Conference Proceeding,"Proceedings of the 15th European Conference on Management, Leadership and Governance, ECMLG 2019",2020-01-01,Technische Universität Berlin;Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK,Assessment Method ;  Requirements ;  Research and Technology Organizations ;  RTO ;  Technological Capability
The impact of digitalization on processes and organizational structures of architecture and engineering firms,"The digitalization of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry leads to new forms of process through which buildings are designed, constructed, and operated, and to new forms of organization through which professionals work and interact. Certain activities of the conventional building process disappear, while others appear, distribution of work is reviewed, and new relationships, roles, and responsibilities emerge. Although many architecture and engineering (A/E) firms claim that they have already undertaken a digital transformation, there is still little awareness of the new forms of process and organization associated with digitalization. This lack of knowledge about the process-oriented and organizational changes makes it difficult to establish a work environment within and between firms that is conducive to digital innovation. Given the above considerations, the main objective of this research project has been to understand the process-oriented and organizational changes that the adoption of digital technologies bring on, as well as the new forms of process and organization associated with the digital transformation of architectural and engineering firms. To achieve this, a case-study analysis of two A/E firms—one in Italy and one in Canada—has been performed.","Talamo, Cinzia;Bonanomi, Marcella M.",Book Series,Research for Development,2020-01-01,ETH Zürich;Politecnico di Milano,
Managing Human Resources Resistance to Organizational Change in the Context of Innovation,"Current global and complex economies demand change and restructuring processes. Besides the usual continuous change in their personal lives, when talking about changes in their working environment, employees offer considerable resistance. Difficulties related to managing this resistance on the part of the company will ultimately lead to organizational failure. Aimed at filling this gap, the present research provides a management model addressing both implicit and explicit resistance. The model comprises six key factors: leadership, communication, valuable HR retention, training, participation, and flexibility. Besides the theoretical model, it has been carried out a case study of a multinational company in the mechanical engineering sector, providing researchers and professionals with a roadmap of actions to manage the identified key factors. Furthermore, results reveal that Human Resources are no longer operational support. Instead, they represent a crucial asset to achieve the expected results in innovation and obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage.","Rodríguez-Sánchez, José Luis;Mercado-Caruso, Nohora;Viloria, Amelec",Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2020-01-01,Universidad de la Costa;Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,Change and restructuring processes ;  Communication ;  Flexibility ;  Leadership ;  Participation ;  Personnel resistance ;  Training ;  Valuable employees
The Strategy of Constructing an Interdisciplinary Knowledge Center,"This paper aims to explain the construction strategy of interdisciplinary knowledge centers from the perspective of expert systems, knowledge management and educational information technology. The method is: Firstly, it explores how to construct the strategy of interdisciplinary knowledge centers sharing, and then makes necessary explorations from computer assisted knowledge management, expert knowledge acquisition and educational autonomous learning. Finally, establish the foundation of natural language understanding in the domain knowledge base which is the basis of the interdisciplinary knowledge center. It is characterized by the application of the wisdom system studied strategy, with machine translation, machine learning and human-computer interaction, starting from the excellent courses in research universities, with the combination of intelligent text analysis and knowledge module finishing, and with the application of “seven-stapes pass” and “eight-persons group” as the education management innovation paradigm. The result is the new paradigm with both standardization and individuality, namely the construction of an interdisciplinary knowledge center that combines large production with small production. The significance lies in the combination of “language, knowledge, software, hardware formal system engineering” and “education, management, learning, application social system engineering”, that help to promote the interdisciplinary knowledge center and its systems engineering talents training. It is more efficient to build the smart systems studied for serving the society.","Zou, Xiaohui;Zou, Shunpeng;Wang, Xiaoqun",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,"Peking University;China University of Geosciences, Beijing;Interdisciplinary Knowledge Center Project Team",Computer assisted knowledge management ;  Expert knowledge acquisition ;  Knowledge centers sharing ;  Natural language understanding ;  Smart systems studied
Managing projects in the public sector: From fragility to agility and innovation,"Innovation for all organisations is the lifeblood that provides them with the strength to adopt market changes by creating innovative business opportunities. For the past decade, service providers in the public sector have faced the impact of the transformations caused by the emerge of “the Fourth Industrial Revolution”, which led to almost make the followed Public Management processes and procedures obsolete. This study intends to provide insights into the relationship between innovation champions empowerment and innovation projects success. The aim of this study is to addresses the question: ‘How does the empowerment of Innovation champions influence the success of the innovation projects within the public sector?’. As a lesson-learned from private sector empowerment, this study applies the adopted empowerment approaches in order to prove a significance of extent the innovation champions’ empowerment in the public sector would encourage their line managers to perceive innovation risk as a viable one and become more innovative. The research method involves surveying 40 innovation champions from several public organisations. The outcomes show empowering innovation champions are contributing to making their organisations more innovative. However, there is a challenge caused by those line managers who are not accepting the innovation risk and just play a single role as supervisors, which grounds the fragility in innovation adoption through creating a resistance for innovation risk acceptance. Based on this study outcomes, it is suggested that public sector management should apply multiple managerial styles of sponsoring and supervising innovation project to facilitate innovation adoption and implementation. On the other hand, empowering innovation champions would support changes in the internal working environments and lead to encourage their line managers to accept innovation risk and play situational leadership (sponsor and supervisor); at the same time, such approach would make innovation champions more committed to the innovation success through a sense of ownership. Overall, innovation champions’ empowerment and management style are both relevant and related to innovation projects success in the public sector. This result also offers an academic value through recognising the direct relation between innovation champions’ empowerment, management role, and innovation project success in the public sector context.","Taqateqah, Morad L.;Al Marri, Khalid",Book Series,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,2020-01-01,British University in Dubai,Empowerment ;  Innovation champions ;  Public sector innovation

China ranked first in the number of published papers, followed by the USA, Australia, UK, and Germany. Especially, China established close collaboration with the USA in joint publication. Analysis of the keywords indicated that biochar production, comparative sorption, soil-applied black carbon, and soil management were the main research hotspots of biochar. The burst detection reflected that the innovation of biochar production and the new application field of biochar was the future research trends. These results can provide insight into the research progress regarding biochar.","Li, Dongyang;Zhao, Rui;Peng, Xing;Ma, Zhifei;Zhao, Ying;Gong, Tiancheng;Sun, Mengyang;Jiao, Yuxin;Yang, Tianxue;Xi, Beidou",Journal,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2020-01-01,Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences;Shanghai University;Central China Normal University;Southwest Jiaotong University;Nanchang University,Bibliometric ;  Biochar ;  Hotspots ;  Research trend
Promoting student problem-identification skills via a Jeopardy-inspired game within the Renaissance Foundry,"As societal challenges grow in complexity, it is important that engineers possess deep disciplinary knowledge, coupled with cross-disciplinary skills, to work within a multidimensional context to both identify and solve problems. The purpose of this paper is to describe an approach to innovation-driven learning that is focused on a Jeopardy®-inspired game embedded within a novel pedagogical framework (i.e., The Renaissance Foundry) and implemented in a senior level chemical engineering course in biotransport phenomena. Though the game is envisioned to serve multiple purposes, a major intention is that it can be used to aid students in identifying problems that might be encountered in the field of biotransport. Thus, the primary research question focuses on the relationship between the pedagogical approach and the problems identified and prototype solutions developed by student teams within the course. Data was collected from survey responses indicating whether projects were indirectly, directly, or not linked to Jeopardy categories. A Spearman correlation coefficient and Fisher's Exact Test were calculated with the analysis indicating a moderate, statistically significant relationship between the game categories and projects. Student reflections were also collected and likewise suggested that a pedagogical approach including the game is useful in helping students identify and solve problems.","Sanders, J.

Critical barriers to safety assurance and regulation of autonomous medical systems,"The use of automation and artificial intelligence is transforming medicine and the way health care is accessed and delivered. The introduction of these new technologies introduces challenges for safety assurance and regulation. The paper describes the aims and first results of a project looking at safety assurance of highly automated and autonomous systems for the management of intravenous drug infusions. The paper introduces a taxonomy of levels of automation, and describes two reference scenarios. These are used to analyse the safety assurance challenges. The identified challenges relate to the handover of control from the autonomous system to the clinician, the problems associated with data quality, and the difficulty of assuring sufficiency of the intended functionality of the autonomous system. The pace of innovation and adoption of automated and autonomous systems in health care is now overtaking other industries, but the research evidence is lagging behind.

Make innovation happen: Scientific and statistic tools to accelerate the way toward technology readiness level TRL 9—a deployed application,"We consider some tools/methodologies, scientific and statistics based, to design and optimize technological processes and the resulting products, by providing finally a robust design. Being implemented in R&D labs, such tools and methodologies could enable a faster skip from lab experiments to real world (i.e. Technology Readiness Level TRL 9) by catalyzing innovation, problem solving and even discovery. At the end of the day to make innovation happen. We present also a successful example of application of such approach, to open also a larger discussion about the opportunity of intensively using such approach for nano scale organized materials and further products, with application also in biomedical engineering. An usual cause for the difficulty of R&D labs to pass over the TRL 4 (=technology validated in lab) is the approach of testing the realized prototypes in the R&D lab, i.e. not taking into account the effective manufacturing conditions and environment, and the further operation conditions for the proposed and developed concept/product/device. To overpass that, the best practice shows the research scientists/engineers need to find from the beginning of the research and the development process the effective future manufacturing conditions/process parameters and the future real-life utilization of the resulting products (operating conditions) and to test their prototypes in such conditions. But more than only testing, it is crucial to provide a so called “robust design” (Taguchi), i.e. to optimize the concepts/products parameters so they perform to expectations under a wide range of operating conditions, meanwhile being possible to be fabricated at lower possible cost and risk.","Varachiu, N.",Conference Proceeding,IFMBE Proceedings,2020-01-01,National Institute for Research and Development in Microtechnologies Romania,Design of experiment ;  Innovation ;  Robust design ;  Six sigma—lean ;  Technology readiness level

Program evaluation of highway access with innovative risk-cost-benefit analysis,"Access management is used to control vehicular ingress and egress to adjacent property, where the main goal is to preserve the safety and capacity of the transportation network. Access management can assist in protecting billions of dollars in current investments in the transportation infrastructure, yet it is common for transportation planners to have limited resources, including budgets, equipment, time, human resources, and others, and thus they need principled approaches for allocating their limited resources across a large network of highways. This research develops a framework that can be used to prioritize competing needs for access management among thousands of access points. A key innovation of this research is the integration of risk analysis and cost-benefit analysis with data uncertainties. This will be accomplished by introducing three risk components—hazard intensity, exposure, and vulnerability—that can be used to evaluate roadway performance and to monetize the potential benefits and costs of access management projects. These components are then presented in a three-dimensional diagram to facilitate tradeoff analysis and to allow for risk-cost-benefit analysis with data uncertainties and tradeoff analysis to complement one another. The developed framework is demonstrated by applying it to four major U.S. highways with a combined length of 321.95 km.","Alsultan, Marwan;Jun, Jungwook;Lambert, James H.",Journal,Reliability Engineering and System Safety,2020-01-01,University of Virginia;King Saud University;Virginia Department of Transportation,Data uncertainty ;  Engineering systems ;  Priority setting ;  Resource allocation ;  Risk-cost-benefit analysis ;  System safety
Reducing delays to diagnosis in ambulatory care settings: A macrocognition perspective,"We aim to use a macrocognition theoretical perspective to characterize contributors to diagnostic delays by physicians that can be mitigated by work system redesign. As experienced with other complex, sociotechnical domains, system redesign is anticipated to be more effective at improving safety than training-based solutions. In the outpatient care setting, complex tasks, conducted by a primary care provider, are provided for five macrocognition functions: sensemaking, re-planning, detecting problems, deciding, and coordinating. Redesigning systems could reduce delays to diagnosis by helping users to avoid missed symptoms, forgotten follow-up activities, and delayed actions. Health information technology could support resilience strategies by offloading documentation burdens, recording working diagnoses, displaying planned follow-up activities at the correct time interval, and supporting recognition of patterns in patient care. These insights suggest a path forward for future research on system design innovations to reduce diagnostic delays, and ultimately, reduce patient harm.","Patterson, Emily S.;Su, George;Sarkar, Urmimala",Journal,Applied Ergonomics,2020-01-01,"University of California, San Francisco;The Ohio State University",Ambulatory care ;  Delayed diagnosis ;  Human factors ;  Medical informatics ;  Patient harm
Team diversity as a predictor of innovation in team projects of face-to-face and online learners,"Team diversity refers to the degree of individual differences among members of a team. It was reported as bearing both positive and negative effects on the innovation capabilities of science and engineering students, learning in a traditional classroom. As web-based technologies are becoming prominent in higher education, there is a need to examine this effect among students working in online learning environments. Hence, this study was set to characterize team diversity of science and engineering students, and identify factors that might predict innovation in team projects conducted in different learning environments. This study was carried out in the settings of a nanotechnology course, delivered both on-campus and as a massive open online course (MOOC). The study compared between three groups of learners: face-to-face (F2F) university students (n = 103), online university students (n = 108), and MOOC learners (n = 109). The number of participants in each group is derived from the number of team projects that were submitted and analyzed. Applying a quasi-experimental research design, data were collected via a survey and analysis of projects' innovation. Findings showed that diversity in ‘academic discipline’ and ‘academic level’ were positive predictors of project innovation, in all three groups. Diversity in ‘mother tongue’ was found as a positive predictor of innovation for the face-to-face university students, but as a negative predictor for both online groups. Potential explanations for the differences observed between face-to-face and online learners are presented.","Usher, Maya;Barak, Miri",Journal,Computers and Education,2020-01-01,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Engineering education ;  Innovation ;  Massive open online courses ;  Online learning ;  Team diversity
Scale-up of extraction processes: Dimensionless modeling and virtualization via lattice Boltzmann method,"While modeling and virtualization pose challenges and opportunities to food engineering, lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a recent computational technique. By relying on existing dynamic one-dimensional models, in-house LBM simulators have been developed toward extraction processes in agitated-batch or continuous-flow equipment. In view of supporting process scale-up, this work aimed at casting the aforesaid extraction models (and related LBM simulators) in dimensionless form. Together with available experimental data for validation, pectin extraction from fruit peels in agitated reactor and essential oil extraction from gorse in fixed bed were taken as case studies. Primitive influencing parameters (e.g., intraparticle diffusivity, solid–fluid partition coefficient, fluid-phase diffusivity, bed length, and interstitial fluid velocity) were fruitfully lumped into fewer dimensionless parameters (e.g., mass-transfer Biot, Péclet and Damköhler numbers). In-house LBM simulators remained operational in their dimensionless versions, with a reduced amount of dimensionless numbers indeed grouping the influence of different process parameters, which may help future sensitivity analyses and scale-up procedures. Practical Applications: Initially used for academic purposes, computational modeling has experienced notable evolution and has become strategic to research, development, and innovation (RD&I) in food processing. Computational modeling can support novel food processes as different parameters and scenarios can be quickly simulated toward scale-up and cost-effectiveness. Accordingly, computational modeling may save valuable material, energy, water, and human resources in RD&I activities at industrial scale.

Entrepreneurship and Innovation Based on the RIEMPEI Model: Inequality of Opportunities in Mexico,"To be able to meet the needs of students and society in general, universities have changed their substantive activity by modifying the way they educate therefore significantly changing their mission (Başçı and Alkan, Procedia—Social and Behavioral Sciences 195:856–861, 2015; Munuera and Gómez, Opción 8:329–348, 2016) and making innovations in education (Olokundun, Ibidunni, Falola, Salau, and Oyafunke-Omoniyi International Journal of Entrepreneurship 22(1), 1–10, 2018). As Martin (El papel de las universidades en la comunidad de emprendimiento, 2017) points out, universities are looking for the generation of entrepreneurs which in turn creates the tendency of universities to include entrepreneurship in the professional training of their students (Din, Anuar, and Usman, Procedia—Social and Behavioral Sciences 224, 117–123, 2016; Palomares and Chisvert, REDU Revista de Docencia Universitaria 12(2), 205–230, 2014). Through the development of these activities, it is possible to offer opportunities to university students to overcome some of the inequalities that occur in the country (Mexico). The objective of this study is to establish a reference model on the influence of the following variables: self-esteem, need for achievement, risk assumption, and creativity in the innovation traits of future entrepreneur engineering students in the Public Institutions of Higher Education in Mexico. In order to respond to the objective posed in this investigation, a questionnaire consisting of two sections using a sample of 368 engineering students from the Public Institutions of Higher Education (IES) in Mexico between the ages of 18 and 34 years was designed. The first section includes the student profile. The variables which influence the innovation traits of future engineering entrepreneurs from the IES in Mexico can be seen in the second section: self-esteem (four items), need for achievement (four items), and risk assumption (eight items)—Íbañez (Actitudes emprendedoras de los estudiantes universitarios de la CAPV, Universidad de Deusto, Bilbao, 2001), creativity (eight items), and the dependent variable: innovation traits (eight items)—Capella, Gil, Martí, and Ruíz (Pedagogía Social 28, 169–188, 2016). This research follows a quantitative approach by means of a descriptive, correlational, and linear regression analysis, creating a proposal called the RIEMPEI model (features of enterprising innovation in engineering students in the IES in Mexico). The statistical analysis shows that the RIEMPEI model meets the requirements of all the tests to which it is submitted, making it an appropriate model to evaluate the objective posed in this investigation.","Ríos-Manríquez, Martha;Pérez-Rendón, Lizbeth;Sánchez-Fernández, María Dolores",Book Series,Contributions to Management Science,2020-01-01,Universidad de Guanajuato;Universidade da Coruña;Higher Technological Institute of Purísima del Rincón,Creativity ;  Engineering students ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Innovation traits ;  Mexico​ ;  Need for achievement ;  Risk assumption ;  Self-esteem
Transition engineering of transport in megacities with case study on commuting in Beijing,"Private automobiles have been wildly popular around the world and have transformed the concept of personal mobility for the affluent. However, automobile-oriented development patterns have demonstrably degraded the quality of the city environment. The economic burden of transport infrastructure asset management, plus air pollution, CO2 emissions and congestion are pressing issues for all cities. City planners struggle with the issues of growth in travel demand and the costs of providing traffic management, parking, policing, and emergency services. The future of personal vehicle mobility and goods movements are particularly challenging, and it is difficult to imagine what the sustainable solutions could be for these wicked problems of transport in megacities. This paper explores urban form, transport activity and quality of life in future cities through the emerging discipline, Transition Engineering. The main methodology is the Interdisciplinary Transition Innovation, Management and Engineering (InTIME) approach, the outcome of which are innovative shift projects that directly step down the negative factors and step up in the quality of life while maintaining the access to social and economic activities. One shift project in Beijing is a new “Work Unit Retrofit” property development enterprise. Integrated land use is a popular idea, but the shift projects in this research answer the questions of “how” the transition to the future city occurs. This research demonstrates the new Transition Engineering approach to sustainable city development that results in actionable property and infrastructure development with financial and social benefits that can be clearly communicated to all stakeholders.","Bai, Ming;Krumdieck, Susan",Journal,Cities,2020-01-01,University of Canterbury,Adaptive capacity ;  Commute model ;  Cycling potential ;  Energy transition ;  Future cities ;  Transition engineering ;  Urban form ;  Work unit
Scientific Data Sharing Platform Using Behavior Study Based on Extended TAM Model,"Scientific data retrieval behavior is a typical human–computer interaction behavior, and users are in the dominant position in the interaction. It is of great significance to improve the scientific data sharing system to study the factors that affect scientific data user data search and retrieval. Based on the extended TAM model, this study used questionnaires to collect data from the competitors of the 6th “sharing cup” university students’ science and technology resources sharing service innovation contest and used structural equation method to analyze the data. The results show that the extended TAM model can explain and predict the using behavior of users’ scientific data sharing platform.

Debunking Limitations Hindering Continuing Professional Development Imperatives in South African Construction Industry,"Continuous Professional Development (CPD) is a universally accepted mechanism that bridges the gap between formal higher education knowledge transfer and work-place competencies. CPD reinforces existing knowledge and facilitates acquisition of new skills, and intricate competencies required for innovation. The study investigates the challenging factors South African Construction Industry (SACI) practitioners encounter which limits participation in CPD rated events and formal trainings. The study significantly contributes to the identification of the barriers to the subject matter and the recommendations that emerged may be explored by SACI practitioners towards becoming globally competitive. The research involved extensive review of existing literature to identify CPD participation challenges, and construction industry practitioner’s competency challenges. It further analyzed secondary data obtained from industry actors as means of benchmarking industry expectations for SACI. The research identified financial cost of CPD, workload of personnel, and lack of suitable CPD activities as prevalent challenging factors in SACI. The study recommends that organizations need to support staff by financing CPD training costs, and consciously creating work-recess for staff to attend CPD trainings.","Babatunde, Idebi Olawale;Laseinde, Timothy;Oluwafemi, Ifetayo",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,University of Johannesburg,Competencies ;  Continuous professional development ;  CPD ;  Participation ;  South African Construction Industry ;  Work place competency
Blueprint for a Priming Study to Identify Customer Needs in Social Media Reviews,"Unbiased customer reviews in social networks may hold the key for innovations in the saturated market of consumer goods. Customer reviews do not only offer information directly about the product, they also provide insights into the user’s environment, customer habits and usage behaviour. These latent needs are stated objectively in reviews. This study aims to overcome the weakness of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that can only extract explicitly stated needs. Key part of the study is the developed method to record and evaluate the reaction time of test subjects to analyse the association between a latent need category and a related word. As a result, we obtain word clusters that express an association with a latent need and a blueprint for upcoming studies that focus on the extraction and utilizing these needs. This knowledge can be used for further research in an automated need identification process and customer driven production.","Briele, Kristof;Krause, Alexander;Ellerich, Max;Schmitt, Robert H.",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Innovation engineering ;  Need identification ;  Priming study

A comparative study on the language expressions of cultural and creative products in the east and west,"The concept of cultural and creative industries was first proposed by the United Kingdom. After that, UNESCO defined the cultural and creative industries. In recent years, China has proposed a series of new ideas and opinions on the innovation and development of cultural and creative industries, more and more experts and scholars have proposed to guide the development of China’s cultural and creative industries by studying the cultural and creative industries of Western countries. However, the difference between China and the Western countries is not only reflected in the differences in the cultural heritage of the two sides, but also in people’s understanding and expression of the respective cultures. For cultural and creative products, the cultural base is the design of the soul, then when how to transfer cultural concepts to product design in a subtle manner, the method is especially important. In the paper, first of all, literature search, field research, expert interviews and other methods are used to find differences in lifestyle and state, cultural understanding and expression between China and Italy, representative of the Western countries. Through the KJ method and cluster analysis method, the cultural design language expressions of the forms, structures, functions, colors, human factors, materials and techniques of cultural and creative products in China and Western countries are summarized and compared. The design thinking and methods that can be used in the development of Chinese cultural products are obtained. Finally, taking China’s Songxi culture and creative products as an example, the design practice has been carried out and has obtained good social and user evaluation. The research results will have important theoretical and practical significance for the design and development of Chinese cultural and creative products.","Cheng, Chen;Ye, Junnan;Gao, Hui;Wu, Guixiang",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,East China University of Science and Technology;Shanghai Institute of Technology,Cultural and creative product ;  East and west ;  Language expression ;  Product design
On Cognitive Biases in Requirements Elicitation,"The purpose of this paper was to identify the cognitive biases most frequently affecting requirements elicitation, as well as to identify how these biases may influence the requirements elicitation and its outcomes. The research was based on an analysis of forty-one student reports prepared during software engineering classes. The analysis was performed using an adaptation of the Angoff Method, which is very popular in the area of psychological research. It demonstrated that, out of the eight analyzed cognitive biases, representativeness, anchoring and confirmation bias most frequently influence the requirements elicitation, while pro-innovation bias, the bandwagon effect and the IKEA effect are the least likely to occur. The research also revealed that cognitive biases may distort the identified requirements in many ways.","Zalewski, Andrzej;Borowa, Klara;Kowalski, Damian",Book Series,Studies in Computational Intelligence,2020-01-01,Politechnika Warszawska,Cognitive biases ;  Requirements ;  Software engineering

The research base sample includes a detailed analysis of 58 consumer product innovations that reached a high market impact over the period 2014–2017, i.e. the consumers purchased them considerably more than other innovations. The study examines the components of these innovations in detail; they are also grouped into 4 basic groups. It is concluded in the study that the high impact to market innovations are made up of recurring 34 components. The study also concludes that the open innovation components only partly overlap with the innovation components that have been studied so far on the level of both micro and macro innovation eco-systems.","Salkovska, Jelena;Batraga, Anda;Braslina, Liga;Skiltere, Daina;Braslins, Girts;Kalkis, Henrijs;Legzdina, Aija",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Latvijas Universitāte,High impact to market innovations ;  Innovation classification ;  Innovation components
The Effect of Macro Environmental and Firm-Level Factors on Open Innovations in Product Development and Their Impact on Firms’ Performance,"Most research on open innovation and product development concentrates on developing effective collaborative models to develop competitive products. Little research considers macro environmental and firm-level factors while developing such models. These factors can possibly affect outsourcing innovations in product development and later overall firm performance. As such, this research investigates how macro environmental and firm-level factors link with open innovations in product development and their relationship with the firm’s overall performance. First, the conceptual framework of outsourcing innovations was synthesized from open innovation and business partnership related literature. A total of 60 intensive R&D-based firms were surveyed in 20 countries concerning the effects of macro environmental and firm-level factors on product development and its performance. Statistical techniques were used to analyse the data. The collected data helped to identify seven important macro environmental and firm-level factors. The results provided support for the conceptual framework and described the impact of all factors on developed product performance and the firm’s overall performance in the given market. An implication for managers is that the provider’s host country environment has no direct impact on a firm’s performance.","Zafar, Afnan;Kantola, Jussi",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Vaasan Yliopisto,Contract research organizations ;  Firm’s performance ;  Innovations ;  Outsourcing

Messaged Multi-agent System as a Tool for Strengthening Innovative Capabilities of Business Models,"Business models raised on popularity in recent years among both researchers and practitioners. However, operational research in the area of business modelling is limited, especially regarding business processes. Greater focus is nowadays put on strategic layer and other perspectives of business models. Thus, the aim of the paper is to implement business model in the form of messaged multi-agent system at the operational layer with process perspective as building block of the model. This approach strengthens the innovative capabilities of business models. In our paper, first, correspondent literature review is presented. The focus is given on investigation of relations of business models and business process management discipline. Process perspective is emphasized because it is naturally capable of integration of other perspectives, e.g. dynamic perspective, revenue model, business logic, resource-based view, etc. Second, it is shown, how can messaged multi-agent system be used as a supporting tool incorporating business model dynamics through innovation, while integrating different business model perspectives. As a result, messaged multi-agent system is introduced. It represents unique implementation of a business model reflecting on a trading company, where interactions between process participants are mediated through messages. The presented results involve comparison of two business models’ implementations, where the redesigned business model incorporates changes in pricing of the product and marketing campaigning. Process mining method and statistics are used to comment on the outcomes. Process mining plays a crucial role as it is used for validation of business logic, discovery of business process model and comparative analysis of both business models.","Halaška, Michal;Šperka, Roman",Book Series,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",2020-01-01,Slezská univerzita v Opave,Business model ;  Business process management ;  Process mining ;  Simulation

Design of Virtual Public Resilience Spaces of Traditional Cultures,"China’s contemporary society is fragile, mainly because of the lack of cohesion within the society or the low level of social resilience. This article is based on the topic of resilience (Manzini 2013), adapted to the design of virtual public space in the context of regional cultures. By analyzing the characteristics of the existing virtual works and resilience design, including the relationships between designers, users and virtual environments, we can explore the design theory of virtual public resilience space of traditional cultures and methods for cultural innovation. My research is based on concepts of local community, cultural resilience, participation in design and active design. It reorganizes and superimposes existing spaces while focusing on the analysis of activities and needs of the participants. With the design of narrative virtual environments and by imagining the possibilities of future design as theoretical and practical foundations, we can drive cultural innovation and achieve educational transformation.","He, Jingjing;Yang, Chaoxiang;Straeubig, Michael",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,University of Plymouth;Shanghai University;East China University of Science and Technology,Digital traditional culture ;  Regional culture ;  Resilience design ;  Virtual cultural space ;  Virtual narrative environments

Is porter hypothesis true or falsea perspective based on environmental strategic orientation,"With increasingly severe environmental regulations(ER), the need to develop efficient strategies towards environmental protection and high performance is a pressing issue for enterprises. However, extant literature on the subject rarely discusses how different environmental strategy orientations mediate the relationships involved in the Porter Hypothesis(PH). Therefore, this study focuses on an environmental strategy response to ER, and sustained high performance, by incorporating the idea of technology innovation(TI). We first divide environmental strategy into two modes: proactive environmental strategy(PES) and reactive environmental strategy(RES). We then contextualize two models to analyze the ER and enterprise performance(EP) correlation; and test the mediating effect of TI on this relationship, adhering to PES. The empirical data on 760 Chinese A-share listed enterprises in 2017 indicates that there is no generality in PH. An enterprises environmental strategic orientation may cause PH and traditional hypothesis disparity. ER is positively correlated with EP, with TI playing an intermediary role, in the PES mode; but in the RES approach, ER and EP exhibit a negative connect. This study holds great significance for enterprises aspiring to reinforce environmental protection, and promote strategic transformation.","Zhang, Liming;Yang, Li;Ye, Fei;Zhou, Guichuan",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Business School of Sichuan University,Enterprise performance ;  Environmental regulation ;  Porter hypothesis ;  Technology innovation

Optimal design of smarter tourism user experience driving by service design,"The rapid development of information technology and the increasing individual demand of consumers have promoted the intelligent development of the tourism market. The service design concept has important research value for the user experience optimization of “smarter tourism”. This article takes Taierzhuang Ancient City as a research sample, focuses on designing and optimizing each contact point in the service blueprint, and sums up the complete scenic tour experience model. The results show that in the process of “smarter tourism”, it mainly involves two aspects: the efficient protection of scenic service and the degree of satisfaction with individual needs. The latter is the key to judging the satisfaction of scenic spot service. It can be seen that the “smarter tourism” user experience service needs to be improved, and more innovations can be launched in the future based on service contact points and service process optimization.","Xu, Qing",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Service design ;  Smarter tourism ;  User experience

Modeling Decision-Making with Intelligent Agents to Aid Rural Commuters in Developing Nations,"More than a billion rural merchants in the developing world depend on hiring on-demand transportation services to commute people or goods to markets. Selecting the optimal fare involves decision-making characterized by multiple alternatives and competing criteria. Decision support systems are used to solve this. However, those systems are based on object-based approaches which lack the high-level abstractions needed to effectively model and scale human-machine communication. This paper introduces AopifyJS, a novel agent-based decision-support tool. We developed a two-agent simulation. One agent makes a request, then another takes a dataset of a stratified sample of 104 Ethiopian commuter criteria preferences and a dataset of fare alternatives. The second agent computes HPA and TOPSIS algorithms to weight, score, rank those alternatives. Once we run the simulation, it returns an interpretable prescription to the first agent, storing all interactions in an architecture that allows developers to program further customization as interactions scale.","Gerpe, Patricio Julián;Markopoulos, Evangelos",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Hult International Business School;Enpov,Agent-based modeling ;  Agent-oriented programming ;  Interpretable artificial intelligence ;  Multi-criteria decision-making ;  Social innovation ;  TOPSIS

Designing Emotional Product Design: When Design Management Combines Engineering and Marketing,"This paper introduces a scope of design management that may take a mediating role to combine knowledge of engineering and marketing in the context of emotional product design. Based on a literature review spanning the three academic disciplines, an integrated perspective for future research of emotional design is presented. In engineering, ergonomics domain seeks to elicit emotions from the consumer whilst Kansei engineering attempts to quantitatively capture human sensory interaction with products. Marketing involves impulse buying and branding that explores how to delight consumers and aims to create emotional engagement between companies and consumers, respectively. Design management regards design as an artificial and creative process that aims to coordinate diverse physical factors in order to embody a conceptual solution to a social need. In this respect, sociological and anthropological knowledge should be also leveraged for a better understanding of socio-cultural structure that alters the way of production and consumption.","Shigemoto, Yuuki",Book Series,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020-01-01,Toyama University of International Studies,Design methodology ;  Design-driven innovation ;  Emotional product ;  Socio-cultural influence ;  Sustainable product development
