Overall, the research on enterprise level is dominant, while the research on spatial scale is relatively less. In this paper, by deriving green patent applications for measuring green technology innovation from the Wanfang Patent Database, the spatial and temporal characteristics and its determinants of green technology innovation in China's city system from 2007 to 2017 are explored. The results indicate that technologies related to buildings has dominated the development of environmental innovation in China's city system, while technologies in the field of greenhouse gases and water adaptation were quite unpopular throughout China. In 2007, China's environmental innovation was dominated by individuals and enterprises. By 2017, enterprises have become the main body of China's environmental innovation, highlighting the essential characteristics of enterprises as the subject of environmental innovation. In space, the geography of environmental innovation in China's city system presents a strong spatial imbalance feature, a tripolar pattern dominated by the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Beijing-Tianjin region has become increasingly prominent. In terms of determinants, spatial Durbin model regression results reflect that there are significant spatial spillover effects and path dependence characteristics in China's environmental innovation.

Around this task, basic scientific questions can be asked, novel functional materials can be synthesized, and efficient system functionality can be established. Poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) have attracted growing interest far beyond polymer science and are now considered an interdisciplinary crossing point between multiple research areas due to their designable chemical structure, intriguing physicochemical properties, and broad and diverse applications. Recently, we discovered that 1,2,4-triazolium-type PILs show enhanced performance profiles, which are due to stronger and more abundant supramolecular interactions ranging from hydrogen bonding to metal coordination, when compared with structurally similar imidazolium counterparts. This phenomenon in our view can be related to the smart hydrogen atoms (SHAs), that is, any proton that binds to the carbon in the N-heterocyclic cations of 1,2,4-triazolium-type PILs. The replacement of one carbon by an electron-withdrawing nitrogen atom in the broadly studied heterocyclic imidazolium ring will further polarize the C-H bond (especially for C5-H) of the resultant 1,2,4-triazolium cation and establish new chemical tools for materials design. For instance, the H-bond-donating strength of the SHA, as well as its Broønsted acidity, is increased. Furthermore, polycarbene complexes can be readily formed even in the presence of weak or medium bases, which is by contrast rather challenging for imidazolium-type PILs. The combination of SHAs with the intrinsic features of heterocyclic cation-functionalized PILs (e.g., N-coordination capability and polymeric multibinding effects) enables new phenomena and therefore innovative materials applications.In this Account, recent progress on SHAs is presented. SHA-related applications in several research branches are highlighted together with the corresponding materials design at size scales ranging from nano- to micro- and macroscopic levels. At a nanoscopic level, it is possible to manipulate the interior and outer shapes and surface properties of PIL nanocolloids by adjusting the hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between SHAs and water. Owing to the interplay of polycarbene structure, N-coordination, and the polymer multidentate binding of 1,2,4-triazolium-type PILs, metal clusters with controllable size at sub-nanometer scale were successfully synthesized and stabilized, which exhibited record-high catalytic performance in H2 generation via methanolysis of ammonia borane. At the microscopic level, SHAs are found to efficiently catalyze single crystal formation of structurally complex organics. Free protons in situ released from the SHAs serve as organocatalysts to activate formation of C-N bonds at room temperature in a series of imine-linked crystalline porous organics, such as organic cages, macrocycles and covalent organic frameworks; meanwhile the concurrent \"salting-out\"effect of PILs as polymers in solution accelerated the crystallization rate of product molecules by at least 1 order of magnitude. At the macroscopic scale, by finely regulating the supramolecular interactions of SHAs, a series of functional supramolecular porous polyelectrolyte membranes (SPPMs) with switchable pores and gradient cross-sectional structures were manufactured. These membranes demonstrate impressive figures of merit, ranging from chiral separation and proton recognition to switchable optical properties and real-time chemical reaction monitoring. Although the concept of SHAs is in the incipient stage of development, our successful examples of applications portend bright prospects for materials chemistry innovation.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=12, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr='VCI', fund_no='FV-2.1.1-005', fund_sponsor='Verband der Chemischen Industrie'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85141453499', doi='10.1002/adom.202201812', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Bi<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>Te Nanosheets Saturable Absorber-Based Passive Mode-Locked Fiber Laser: From Soliton Molecules to Harmonic Soliton', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Hui Z.', afid='60073708;60020650;60000174', affilname=\"Xi'an Institute of Posts and Telecommunications;University of Bristol;Shaanxi Normal University\", affiliation_city=\"Xi'an;Bristol;Xi'an\", affiliation_country='China;United Kingdom;China', author_count='8', author_names='Hui, Zhanqiang;Bu, Xiaofeng;Wang, Yuanhong;Han, Dongdong;Gong, Jiamin;Li, Lu;Li, Xiaohui;Yan, Shuangyi', author_ids='36570566200;57956690800;57323157500;59105735600;7402707797;56100147300;56196020200;56926913200', author_afids='60073708;60073708;60073708;60073708;60073708;60073708;60000174;60020650', coverDate='2022-12-19', coverDisplayDate='19 December 2022', publicationName='Advanced Optical Materials', issn=None, source_id='21100255548', eIssn='21951071', aggregationType='Journal', volume='10', issueIdentifier='24', article_number='2201812', pageRange=None, description='As a recent addition to the emerging 2D bismuth oxychalcogenides (Bi2O2X, where X\\xa0= S, Se, and Te), atomically-thin bismuth oxytellurium (Bi2O2Te) exhibits unique thermoelectric and photoelectric properties.

It reflects on Mike Abbott's original ideas and evaluates their impact from the perspective of water business owners, water consultants, clients, and communities. Mike Abbott promoted a novel concept, combining theoretical and practical aspects of modelling, towards 'industrial modelling systems'. The chapter traces the development of this concept, from its early adoption by government-funded research institutes engaged in scientific support to hydraulic engineering, through establishment of market for water-modelling software products, to its broad adoption by consultants. Mike Abbott also saw a significant opportunity for hydroinformatics in the developing world. New policies and businesses were easier to implement in countries without a mature market of ideas resisting a change. Many of his followers were eager to explore business paths, which were much faster and more agile than those in academic circles. Most large companies that are currently developing commercial applications and tools for water modelling matured during the so-called 'third modelling generation', when generic modelling tools started to be developed. Subsequently, the real growth was observed when the knowledge encapsulation and robustness of the applications expanded their use from specialists to a broad pool of water professionals and practitioners. The social impact of hydroinformatics was significant as it spread through a wide range of organisations impacting decision making, education, innovation and knowledge sharing. As modelling systems became a norm in the water business, the business itself has been transformed. Impacts of current technologies and new data sources on water modelling business are presented (such as the Cloud, High Performance Computing - HPC, virtualisation, internet of things - IoT, remote sensing, and others), and how they impact current needs of software producers and users. Diverse business models have emerged, which need to meet the future challenges of urban and environmental water management under challenges of climate change. With the large and continuously growing community of modelling experts and users, it can be argued that the Mike Abbott's vision of hydroinformatics has been well established.\", authkeywords='Cloud computing | Collaboration | GIS | Hydroinformatics | Simulation models | Water business', citedby_count=0, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85159789029', doi='10.1145/3584202.3584272', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='ECONOMETRIC FORECASTS of the IMPACT of HIGH and MEDIUM-TECH INDUSTRIES on ECONOMIC GROWTH in UZBEKISTAN', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Mamatov A.A.', afid='60071662', affilname='Tashkent State University of Economics', affiliation_city='Tashkent', affiliation_country='Uzbekistan', author_count='2', author_names='Mamatov, Akhmetjon Atajanovich;Mamatov, Mamajan Ahmadjonovich', author_ids='58266169200;58266169300', author_afids='60071662;60071662', coverDate='2022-12-15', coverDisplayDate='15 December 2022', publicationName='ACM International Conference Proceeding Series', issn=None, source_id='21101152705', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='468-476', description='In this article, an econometric analysis of the impact of the growth rate of the product of high and medium-tech and science-teaching sectors of the economy on the growth of total expenditure on science, science capacity, technological innovation on the growth of the gross domestic product of the country has been made and its prospects have been scientifically predicted.', authkeywords='added quantity | competitiveness | economic growth | High and medium technology | innovation | science capacitance | strategy', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85145293940', doi='10.1016/j.checat.2022.09.022', pii='S2667109322005140', pubmed_id=None, title='Investigating porous catalysts with synchrotron X-rays and neutrons', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Mo S.', afid='60026851;60010432', affilname='University of Oxford;Soochow University', affiliation_city='Oxford;Suzhou', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;China', author_count='4', author_names='Mo, Shichao;Wang, Guilian;Ng, Bryan K.Y.;Zhao, Pu', author_ids='58038249800;58037742600;57221863767;57201927645', author_afids='60010432;60010432;60026851;60010432-60026851', coverDate='2022-12-15', coverDisplayDate='15 December 2022', publicationName='Chem Catalysis', issn='26671107', source_id='21101080172', eIssn='26671093', aggregationType='Journal', volume='2', issueIdentifier='12', article_number=None, pageRange='3290-3303', description='Porous catalysts have been widely used in the industry and are among the most promising candidates to facilitate the transformation to a sustainable society.

However, behind this rapid expansion, it is raised a question: what are the driving forces behind the diffusion of wind power? And which policies are more efficient to improve the diffusion rate of wind power? To scientifically answer this question, this paper combines system dynamics and the two-factor learning curve to investigate the dynamic diffusion process of wind power. The results show that: (1) The demand-pull policy through feed-in tariff (FIT) policy can promote the diffusion of wind power; (2) The technology-push policy through R&D policy also promotes the diffusion of wind power; (3) A higher level of FIT is more efficient to expand the installed capacity of wind power, in addition, a higher level of R&D intensity is more efficient for cost reduction; (4) The coefficient of learning by doing of wind power is 0.0274 and the coefficient of learning by research of wind power is 0.2540, which indicates China's wind power industry is transitioning from price subsidies to technology innovation policies.

These opportunities can be offered in junior level (1st and 2nd year) courses by designing projects that match students' skills and knowledge. Opportunities at the junior level reach a larger student population and can increase interest in STEM-based careers. In this article, we introduce a project-based activity for the second-year analytical chemistry laboratory in which students design and conduct experiments to quantify analytes in real-life samples. Analytes selected for this project (acids or bases, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, calcium, oxalate, reducing sugars and starch) can be quantified using techniques familiar to second year students including titration and absorbance spectroscopy. Students first designed experimental procedures and received feedback before conducting the experiments. Each experiment was performed over two laboratory periods, which allowed students to modify procedures between iterations to improve their experimental design.

The authors also validate the combined use of multi-grade fuzzy, Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) and gap analysis in developing the strategy to mitigate turbulence. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a framework using a combination of Dynamic Capabilities and Organizational Agility to develop the strategy. The study uses data gathered from a 60-member engineering project team working on an Aircraft Engine Controller design to identify 50 attributes and the related importance and performance ratings. The research study is designed using a three-tier approach. First, multi-grade fuzzy is utilized to measure the overall firm response agility index. In the second step, the IPA is used to analyze the strength and weaknesses of the firm and to identify the attributes where the firm needs to focus. In the past step, gap analysis is used to prioritize the identified attributes. The findings are validated by panel discussions with a different group of experts from the project team and action points were arrived at. Findings: This research work finds that the firms’ response agility index of 6.97 is comparable to that of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) from previous literature, but still needs a better agility score to effectively counter turbulence from disruptive innovations. It also identifies seven key areas for improvement and their relative priority to effectively improve the response agility by utilizing the least number of resources, the reasons for the gap and the mitigation strategy to close the gap. The findings highlight a few key differences between an engineering services firm in comparison to OEMs and Software Services firms. Practical implications: The findings help the practitioners with a comparative agility score of an engineering services firm, and an effective way of measuring agility, identify key focus areas and prioritize the actions using a simple set of data that could be collected regularly to keep track of the improvements. The provided strategic framework to improve the agility score can be used for continuous improvement.

It is the recognition that specialized knowledge bases are dispersed in the very heterogeneity of reality and that, therefore, only an integrative approach will be able to capture essential features of the context in which the problem is inserted. It is to bring to the scientific framework relevant social problems that need a solution and lead to the relevant problems that need a solution, wherever they are, science. In this context, the involvement of non-academic actors in the disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary continuum advances towards transdisciplinary research, intensifying the cooperation and integration of various fields of knowledge in solving the research problem. Transdisciplinary, in a broad sense, can be described like a movement as the shift from fragmentation to relationality, from unity to the integrative process, from situated homogeneity to heterogeneity, from linearity to non-linearity, from simplicity to complexity, from universality to practices, from isolation to collaboration and cooperation. The appreciation and increase of these forms of interaction in search of the unity of knowledge beckon a new form of articulation between society and academia, especially for conducting scientific research, fostering new partnerships between university and society. This book brings the fundamentals of the changes that have become necessary to transcend and integrate disciplinary paradigms and the theoretical and methodological references for the realization of scientific researches that consider this scenario, including the presentation of a robust new conceptual framework for academic research in the field the integration engineering and knowledge governance.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85142337252', doi='10.1108/AA-07-2022-0183', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The application of robotics and artificial intelligence in embroidery: challenges and benefits', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Chen L.', afid='60014966;60014070;60007711;60001338', affilname='Peking University;Hunan Normal University;Jilin University;Changsha University of Science and Technology', affiliation_city='Beijing;Changsha;Changchun;Changsha', affiliation_country='China;China;China;China', author_count='5', author_names='Chen, Ling;Su, Zhi;He, Xiaotong;Chen, Xiang;Dong, Lin', author_ids='59283715700;57809600100;57929421300;58380988200;57190132857', author_afids='60014070;60001338;60007711;60014070;60014966', coverDate='2022-12-06', coverDisplayDate='6 December 2022', publicationName='Assembly Automation', issn='01445154', source_id='24904', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='42', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='851-868', description=\"Purpose: Embroidery as a textile embellishment technique plays an important role in people's daily life.

To expedite translation, researchers have developed innovative approaches to implementation branded as “rapid” and “agile” implementation. Rapid implementation has roots in precision medicine and agile implementation has roots in systems engineering and software design. Research has shown that innovation often derives from learning and applying ideas that have impacted other fields. Implications for implementation researchers: This commentary examines “rapid” and “agile” approaches to implementation and provides recommendations to implementation researchers stemming from these approaches. Four key ideas are synthesized that may be broadly applicable to implementation research, including (1) adopting a problem orientation, (2) applying lessons from behavioral economics, (3) using adaptive study designs and adaptive interventions, and (4) using multi-level models to guide implementation. Examples are highlighted from the field where researchers are applying these key ideas to illustrate their potential impact.

The development of seeding technology was also summarized from the hot topics in recent years. The agricultural products were introduced from the domestic and foreign advanced agricultural machinery enterprises using frontier seed arrangement technology.

The high-impact journals included the Biosystems Engineering, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Journal of Agricultural Machinery, and Journal of Agricultural Engineering. High-impact scholars and institutions were focused on the seed metering technology for the typical crops in different regions. As such, the seed metering technology was advanced to upgrade the mechanization level. The development trend of seed metering technology was gradually changed from single-topic research on the realization of functions into the in-depth exploration of vertical subdivision topics, such as mechanism optimization, mechanism analysis, and virtual simulation. The current research hotspots of seed metering technology were focused mainly on high-speed simultaneous seeding, seeding uniformity, DEM-CFD coupling simulation, control, and monitoring system.

This novel approach was specifically implemented for an open-ended undergraduate design course within an engineering technology college, similar to many first-year engineering course experiences that emphasize project-based learning, from a large research-intensive public university. For this study, the facilitator model was piloted with five high school teachers as facilitators of an undergraduate design course for dual credit at two innovative, STEM-focused public charter schools. The qualitative research design focused on examining (1) teacher needs while implementing, and perceptions of, the dual credit facilitator model for an undergraduate design course in urban public charter schools and (2) the impact of this model on student learning.

Very few students begin thinking about their future careers and preparing for their lives soon after or before entering college. Most students delay the decision-making process until the year of graduation, at which point they feel helpless when they have to make a career decision; during this period, they start preparing for future employment by processing information related to career development. Compared with these students, preservice teachers have a distinct career prospect. Compared with other students from comprehensive universities, students at science and technology universities must overcome more hurdles to become qualified teachers. The aim of this study was to explore preservice teachers’ perspectives on career development and improvements in their self-identity after participating in a career design course, entitled Design Your Life, at a science and technology university. Literature Review This study reviewed research on the implementation of design thinking in education and on the career development and self-identity of preservice teachers. Design thinking was first introduced by the design company IDEO and the Stanford d.school. Currently, in the field of higher education, design thinking is widely implemented in business management, humanities and social sciences, medicine, and engineering. With the promotion of design thinking, career designing has exceeded its original scope and been developed into a set of basic methodologies for cross-disciplinary cooperation and innovation. However, few studies have focused on the implementation of design thinking in the field of teacher training. Design thinking is a process of continual exploration. In addition to exploring the needs of individuals through investigation and research and developing innovative strategies for solving relevant problems, designers receive feedback from others, develop creative solutions, and construct prototypes in the testing stage, which would subsequently lead to effective results. The creative and specific process of design thinking itself is the key to solving complex problems. Moreover, life is a process of continual exploration and problem-solving. Experiencing different careers helps individuals assess their most suitable career options. By accepting feedback from others, individuals can construct a life prototype to meet their ultimate life expectations. Preservice teachers at science and technology universities are highly likely to become future teachers; through the training process, they must discover their career potentials and educational work-related values. Previous studies have conducted various exploratory investigations regarding the career development of preservice teachers. Through continual selection and trial experiences, future teachers can evaluate themselves and gradually outline the direction of their career development; they must identify a practical and feasible goal and balance their ideal future self, personal ability, and reality. Regarding self-identity, studies have indicated that individuals form an inner structure on the basis of their abilities, experiences, beliefs, and inner drives; this structure represents self-identity, which increases or decreases with time or transfers. Therefore, individuals’ current state of self-identify is not the end point of self-identification. The development of self-identity is an exploratory process. To develop a distinct self-identity, individuals must be introspective and must persevere through a period of decision-making involving conflicts and doubts. Thus, to determine their career goals, preservice teachers must first explore their inner selves and the external environment and then make career decisions and commitments. Methods This study was based on Stanford University’s Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-lived, Joyful Life career planning course and the Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-lived, Joyful Life book (Burnett & Evans, 2016/2016). In an actual setting, career design courses are planned in accordance with the five-stage design thinking model (Stanford University); these stages are empathy, definition, idea, prototype, and test. Through design thinking, students explore their diverse interests and potentials, identify suitable career paths, and work toward future career development. The present study selected preservice teachers from a total of 16 private science and technology universities and subjected them to the aforementioned course (three workshops, each lasting for 6h; total credit hours, 18) between March and July 2019. The study collected the following data for coding and analysis: teaching and reflective journals, class worksheets, homework sheets, student reports, and teaching feedback. Data were analyzed using triangulation correction and continual comparison methods to ensure the validity of the study findings. Results The results revealed that the preservice teachers could objectively view themselves through visual recordings and could discuss with others to increase their self-awareness levels. Convergent and divergent thinking resulting from the process of individual dialogue and teamwork helped strengthen the preservice teachers’ self-identity and career orientation. Finally, they could develop a positive creative mindset — fail early, succeed sooner — and could devise strategies to solve their life problems. Discussion and Recommendations On the basis of the findings, this study suggests that preservice teachers can not only use design thinking to plan their own careers but also learn how to implement this approach in designing courses for others. For example, future teachers may use the five-stage design thinking model to design courses for primary and secondary school students in order to help them discover their life or on-campus problems and to promote problem-oriented learning. Therefore, teacher education centers may include this course in their curricula and support preservice teachers who require career guidance and assistance with career development. Furthermore, although this study focused on preservice teachers at private science and technology universities, the findings may be useful for high school and college students because career indecision is a normal and common phenomenon. Thus, the content of this course may be expanded to include general high school and college students. Future studies are warranted to expand the content of teaching commitment in the current curriculum; moreover, future research should include more evaluation tools, such as career development scales, value scales, and self-identity scales, to offer empirical evidence for teacher education centers.', authkeywords='career development | design thinking | preservice teachers at science and technology universities | self-identity', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85145861479', doi='10.15232/aas.2022-02306', pii='S2590286522001719', pubmed_id=None, title='Invited Review: Genetic decision tools for increasing cow efficiency and sustainability in forage-based beef systems', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Rowan T.N.', afid='60000592', affilname='University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture', affiliation_city='Knoxville', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Rowan, Troy N.', author_ids='57209473153', author_afids='60000592', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='December 2022', publicationName='Applied Animal Science', issn=None, source_id='21100911935', eIssn='25902865', aggregationType='Journal', volume='38', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='660-670', description=\"Purpose: The beef industry is experiencing pressure to increase the efficiency and sustainability of forage-based cow-calf production. Dozens of traits affect a cow's ability to be biologically, economically, and environmentally efficient. Furthermore, in an increasingly volatile climate, an animal's genetic merit must be considered in the context of its environment. This review discusses the complex problem of cow efficiency and how the industry can leverage genetic selection tools to improve these traits. I review currently available selection tools for increasing cow-calf production efficiency and discuss developing technologies and research that will drive future innovation. Sources: This review draws on primary literature from animal breeding, beef production, engineering, and agricultural sustainability to broadly discuss the challenges of genetically improving cow-calf efficiency and adaptability. Synthesis: Decision support tools allow breeders to select sires that will have more efficient daughters. Historically, these tools have focused on moderating mature cow size and milk production. They have recently expanded to include traits that directly measure feed efficiency and other related phenotypes such as longevity and fertility. Genetic selection tools also exist for adaptive traits to help producers select sires that produce offspring that respond better to environmental stressors such as heat stress or high elevation. Conclusions and Applications: Future work to develop genetic selection tools for forage-based beef systems will rely on integrating genomics, animal breeding, and precision livestock technologies. These developing technologies, coupled with existing tools, will enable producers to more directly make breeding decisions focused on cow efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.\", authkeywords='cow-calf | fertility | genomics | methane | novel phenotypes', citedby_count=3, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr='NIFA', fund_no='2022-67015-36214', fund_sponsor='National Institute of Food and Agriculture'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85144989437', doi='10.1029/2022AV000772', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Rethinking Committee Work in the Research Enterprise: The Case of Regenerative Gatekeeping', subtype='no', subtypeDescription='Note', creator='Lewis J.C.', afid='60105843;60033011;60029747;60025038;60019187;60013402;60013346;60006683', affilname='American Geophysical Union;Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory;University of Georgia;University of California, Berkeley;Indiana University of Pennsylvania;Oregon State University;National Science Foundation;California State University, Monterey Bay', affiliation_city='Washington, D.C.;Palisades;Athens;Berkeley;Indiana;Corvallis;Alexandria;Marina', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States', author_count='8', author_names='Lewis, Jonathan C.;Alemán-Díaz, Aixa;Behl, Mona;Kolesar, Sarah;White, Lisa;Jones, Brandon;Garza, Corey;Cooper, Sharon', author_ids='57217754016;58062723100;56699732200;6507468275;7402225814;57679102400;23099573600;57684090400', author_afids='60019187;60105843;60029747;60013402;60025038;60013346;60006683;60033011', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='December 2022', publicationName='AGU Advances', issn=None, source_id='21101090801', eIssn='2576604X', aggregationType='Journal', volume='3', issueIdentifier='6', article_number='e2022AV000772', pageRange=None, description='Committees touch nearly every facet in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics research enterprise.

These new technologies are complex and characterized by electrical or hybrid-electric propulsion systems. Ensuring that these complex architectures are safe is paramount to enabling the certification and entry into service of new aircraft concepts. Emerging techniques in systems architecting, such as using model-based systems engineering (MBSE), help deal with such complexity. However, MBSE techniques are currently not integrated with the overall aircraft conceptual design, using automated multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) techniques. Current MDAO frameworks do not incorporate the various aspects of system safety assessment.

This paper presents a comprehensive framework to introduce various aspects of safety assessment in conceptual design and MDAO, also considering downstream compatibility of the system architecting and safety assessment process. The presented methodology includes specific elements of the SAE ARP4761 safety assessment process and adapts them to the systems architecting process in conceptual design. The proposed framework also introduces a novel safety-based filtering approach for large system architecture design spaces.

The study used triangulation to collect data about engineering educators’ approach, understanding and beliefs about creativity using observational research, a survey and in-depth interviews both with students and with educators. The study used an interpretive approach for data analysis by following the levels of understanding in an organizational culture. Three main results drawn from this work are as follows: (1) Engineering educators should understand the practice of creativity in an educational context. (2) Engineering educators need to value creativity as an important part of engineering design. (3) The discipline needs to value creativity as a core part of the curriculum. The findings suggests that enriching creativity in engineering education is not feasible until engineering instructors comprehend and embrace the use of creativity in the classroom. This article specifically explores ways of integrating creativity in engineering design processes that took place in a mechanical engineering undergraduate programme – with an expectation that the research can be used as an exemplar for other engineering disciplines to learn from. This study is an important step, with a holistic approach, in suggesting creativity and creative thinking be inherent and an integral part of every engineering curriculum.', authkeywords='creative thinking | creativity | education | educator approach | engineering design | teaching and learning', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85144722999', doi='10.3390/sci4040039', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Increasing Firm Performance through Industry 4.0—A Method to Define and Reach Meaningful Goals', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Koldewey C.', afid='60109821;60020238;116661705', affilname='Fraunhofer Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design IEM;Paderborn University;CP Contech Electronic GmbH', affiliation_city='Paderborn;Paderborn;Leopoldshöhe', affiliation_country='Germany;Germany;Germany', author_count='5', author_names='Koldewey, Christian;Hobscheidt, Daniela;Pierenkemper, Christoph;Kühn, Arno;Dumitrescu, Roman', author_ids='57202583691;57201719144;57201730453;56857347600;35101763000', author_afids='60020238;60109821;116661705;60109821;60020238-60109821', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='December 2022', publicationName='Sci', issn=None, source_id='21101126971', eIssn='24134155', aggregationType='Journal', volume='4', issueIdentifier='4', article_number='39', pageRange=None, description='Industry 4.0 is one of the most influential trends in manufacturing as of now. Coined as the fourth industrial revolution it promises to overthrow entrenched structures opening new pathways for innovation and value creation. Like all revolutions, it is accompanied by disruption and uncertainty. Consequently, many manufacturing companies struggle to adopt an Industry 4.0 perspective that benefits their performance. Hence, our goal was to develop a method for increasing firm performance through Industry 4.0. A key factor was to focus on the entire company as a socio-technical system to depict the numerous interactions between people, technology, and business/organization. To realize the method, we combined consortium research, design science, and method engineering. We gathered comprehensive data from workshops, interviews, and five case studies, which we used to develop the method. It consists of four phases: a maturity model to determine the status quo, a procedure to derive a target position, a pattern-based approach to design the socio-technical system, and a procedure to define a transformation setup. Our approach is the first to combine maturity models with foresight and extensive prescriptive knowledge.

In this study, an innovative calculation method of rock mass energy release is proposed, and the calculated release energy is consistent with the monitoring results of field monitoring equipment. The revealed mechanism of rock burst reflected is that under the condition of a large-ratio pre-state stress field (mostly > 2.5), a small trigger stress field will lead to a large amount of energy release under “late butterfly shape” or “final butterfly shape” of the plastic zone.

Using panel data from China's 30 provinces for the 2003–2019 period, the results first reveal that RET innovation does relieve EP. Second, both linear and nonlinear models confirm that climate risk exhibits both a moderating effect and threshold effect on the relationship between them. When the climate risk index is low, RET innovation is conducive to the alleviation of EP; otherwise, the opposite is true. Finally, this moderating effect shows obvious spatial heterogeneity that only exists in western China and is not significant in the central and eastern region.

The aim of the present paper is to report on a pilot study at the intersection of neurodiversity and educational robotics. (2) Methods: The pilot study was part of a larger project, namely Robotics for the Inclusive Development of Atypical and Typical Children (RIDE). A pre-test/post-test design was used to examine the development of different cognitive processes in sixth-grade students, such as computational thinking (CT), spatial relations, visuo-constructive ability, attention, and reading ability, in relation to a robotics development program employed in the classroom. (3) Results: The results suggest a general improvement on nearly all measures. Specifically, participants’ performance improved significantly from pre-test to post-test in the visuo-constructive abilities test, they made significantly fewer reading errors, and improved substantially in their reading comprehension.

Historically, the second clinical trial of gene therapy for patients with haemophilia B was conducted by Chinese scientists in 1991, and China became the first country to approve a commercial gene therapy product in 2003. However, China almost lost its lead in this field, partly due to an early scarcity of clear and cohesive policies regarding cellular therapy. Cellular therapy is not only a novel medical practice but also a medicinal product. The increasing commercialisation of globally approved cell therapy products made the Chinese Government issue a series of relevant policies to promote the canonical development of cell therapy and its standardisation in China. Encouraged by flexible regulatory frameworks that have facilitated the development of cellular therapy since 2017, remarkable progress has been achieved, thereby putting China back at the forefront of the field worldwide. Some policies on cellular therapy launched by the Chinese government in 2019 have contributed to the growth of cellular therapy in China; however, the regulation, governance, and management of commercialised products remain challenging. This Series paper aims to provide an overview of the current regulatory reforms on clinical cellular therapy in China with a historical perspective. We also highlight several important contributors that could promote innovation and industrialisation of cellular therapy in China.

Supply chains for quantum technologies are emerging, some focused on commercially available components for enabling technologies and/or quantum-technologies research infrastructures, others with already higher technology-readiness levels, near to the market. In 2018, the European Commission has launched its large-scale and long-term Quantum Flagship research initiative to support and foster the creation and development of a competitive European quantum technologies industry, as well as the consolidation and expansion of leadership and excellence in European quantum technology research. One of the measures to achieve an accelerated development and uptake has been identified by the Quantum Flagship in its Strategic Research Agenda: The promotion of coordinated, dedicated standardisation and certification efforts. Standardisation is indeed of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products, innovation, and competition, all leading to structuring and hence growth of markets. As quantum technologies mature, the time has come to start thinking about further standardisation needs.

Emerging, commercialised technologies for single EV analysis based on, for example, imaging flow cytometry or imaging after capture on chips generally require dedicated instrumentation and proprietary software not readily accessible to every lab. This limits their implementation for routine EV characterisation in the rapidly growing EV field. We and others have shown that single vesicles can be detected as light diffraction limited fluorescent spots using standard confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopes. Advancing this simple strategy into a process for routine EV quantitation, we developed ‘EVAnalyzer’, an ImageJ/Fiji (Fiji is just ImageJ) plugin for automated, quantitative single vesicle analysis from imaging data. Using EVAnalyzer, we established a robust protocol for capture, (immuno-)labelling and fluorescent imaging of EVs. To exemplify the application scope, the process was optimised and systematically tested for (i) quantification of EV subpopulations, (ii) validation of EV labelling reagents, (iii) in situ determination of antibody specificity, sensitivity and species cross-reactivity for EV markers and (iv) optimisation of genetic EV engineering. Additionally, we show that the process can be applied to synthetic nanoparticles, allowing to determine siRNA encapsulation efficiencies of lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) and protein loading of SiO2 nanoparticles. EVAnalyzer further provides a pipeline for automated quantification of cell uptake at the single cell–single vesicle level, thereby enabling high content EV cell uptake assays and plate-based screens. Notably, the entire procedure from sample preparation to the final data output is entirely based on standard reagents, materials, laboratory equipment and open access software. In summary, we show that EVAnalyzer enables rigorous characterisation of EVs with generally accessible tools. Since we further provide the plugin as open-source code, we expect EVAnalyzer to not only be a resource of immediate impact, but an open innovation platform for the EV and nanoparticle research communities.', authkeywords='cell uptake | EV immunolabelling | exosomes | extracellular vesicles | lipid nanoparticles | liposomes | open innovation | silica nanoparticles | single particle imaging | single vesicle imaging', citedby_count=9, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='H2020', fund_no='P1812596', fund_sponsor='Horizon 2020 Framework Programme'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85142304691', doi='10.1111/caim.12531', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A configurational approach to capabilities of business model innovation: Insights from a project-based firm', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Løbner K.', afid='60029616', affilname='Aarhus Universitet', affiliation_city='Aarhus', affiliation_country='Denmark', author_count='2', author_names='Løbner, Kristian;Goduscheit, René Chester', author_ids='57972158900;23988676000', author_afids='60029616;60029616', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='December 2022', publicationName='Creativity and Innovation Management', issn='09631690', source_id='21100218364', eIssn='14678691', aggregationType='Journal', volume='31', issueIdentifier='4', article_number=None, pageRange='722-739', description=\"The capabilities of business model innovation (BMI) are crucial for the modern firm to remain competitive. This study aims to answer recent calls for a more structured approach to understanding BMI and to researching how the capabilities relate to performance. Furthermore, and despite the rise of the project-based firm, there is still a profound lack of BMI research in the setting of project-based firms – a research stream, which we contribute to developing further. Theoretically, and on the basis of a literature review, we suggest a set of four overall capabilities for BMI with 29 corresponding themes within the areas of strategy, business models, management, and organizations. Empirically, we gained deep access to 15 projects in a major European engineering consultancy, which were marked by BMI. Analytically, we analyzed the results through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and derived three main findings. Firstly, a high degree of skunkworks with little relationship to the firm's strategic and operational logic leads to a fast time to market. Secondly, lack of managerial capabilities leads to increased investment and lower revenues. Finally, lack of managerial capabilities—even with the presence of strategic capabilities of BMI and organizational capabilities of BMI—leads to lower future potential of the business model. In continuation of these findings, we develop three propositions and recommend project-based firms to boost the managerial capabilities of leading BMI by focusing on training of BMI managers, organizational learning through experiments, establishing trust in project employees, ensuring openness in collaborations, minimizing transaction costs and developing appropriate key metrics for the BMI project.\", authkeywords='business model innovation | capabilities | case study | configurations | fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis | project-based firm', citedby_count=5, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85141984598', doi='10.1016/j.cie.2022.108812', pii='S0360835222008002', pubmed_id=None, title='Corrigendum to “A signaling game-optimization algorithm for residential energy communities implemented at the edge-computing side” [Comput.

Saudi Arabia sent its first astronaut to space in 1985 aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle, while the UAE sent its inaugural astronaut to the International Space Station as recently as September 2019. Both countries have ambitious plans for the further development of a local but internationally collaborative space ecosystem with science, technology, engineering, math, innovation, and commercial enterprise as pillars. This article argues that space tourism can play a key role in this space ecosystem. This article analyzes the regional space tourism market and characteristics. This is achieved by a targeted questionnaire-based survey of space tourism attitudes, behaviors, desires, willingness to pay, and stated preferences from a range of socioeconomic and demographic respondent profiles. The results of the surveys carried out in 2020 are compared with identical surveys carried out by the author in 2012. Therefore, key trends in customer behaviors and preferences for space tourism are evaluated since both the 2020 and 2012 sets of surveys are also comparable with previous surveys by other organizations and corresponding comparisons are presented. The research highlights stated preferences by respondents for three space tourism segments: (1) high-speed, high-altitude jetfighter flights, (2) commercial zero-gravity parabolic flights, and (3) future suborbital commercial spaceflights. It concludes that a UAE based zero-gravity parabolic flight venture can be commercially viable. Such a venture would also create opportunity for locally based astronaut training and scientific research in weightlessness and microgravity without having the need to travel to other countries. Furthermore, it is argued that the establishment of a local spaceport for suborbital and eventual point to point suborbital travel has the potential for longer term economic value addition to the country's economy.\", authkeywords='space tourism | suborbital spaceflight | UAE Space Law | zero-gravity parabolic flight', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85141464881', doi='10.1007/s11356-022-21764-z', pii=None, pubmed_id='35789465', title='Green supply chain management/green finance: a bibliometric analysis of the last twenty years by using the Scopus database', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Fahim F.', afid='60216851', affilname='Azman Hashim International Business School', affiliation_city='Kuala Lumpur', affiliation_country='Malaysia', author_count='2', author_names='Fahim, Faryal;Mahadi, Batiah', author_ids='57760374900;55837603900', author_afids='60216851;60216851', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='1 December 2022', publicationName='Environmental science and pollution research international', issn=None, source_id='23918', eIssn='16147499', aggregationType='Journal', volume='29', issueIdentifier='56', article_number=None, pageRange='84714-84740', description='Mostly, the product manufacturer and activities related to transportation have a greater influence on the supply chain and the environment.

However, extant agility research primarily covers the corporate and project levels and is typically located in the information systems and operations management fields. Relatively little quantitative research in innovation management literature exists, and those studies approached the concept solely from an outcome perspective (i.e., increased adaptiveness) instead of elucidating how organizations should organize themselves to be agile (i.e., a capability perspective). This article addresses these shortcomings and adopts a capability perspective since no empirical studies have examined agile R&D units' organization (ARDO). Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, we develop a measure of ARDO, conceptualizing it as a second-order construct, consisting of six dimensions: a culture of agile values, customer integration, autonomy, an iterative work method, cross-functional capabilities, and flat hierarchies. We validated the measurement by conducting three studies to ensure content, structural, and nomological validity. We applied structural equation modeling on a sample of 175 R&D managers and cross validated our findings on different hierarchical levels via a sample of 454 R&D employees. The results confirm the second-order nature of the ARDO measure and provide evidence of its positive relationship with front-end success. We advance scarce quantitative research on agility's neglected capability perspective and contribute to the innovation management field by facilitating further empirical research on agile R&D units' antecedents and outcomes in the context of physical product development.\", authkeywords='Agile RandD units | agility | dynamic capabilities | front end of innovation | scale development', citedby_count=7, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85141290153', doi='10.1109/TEM.2020.3017051', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Learning to be a Platform Owner: How BMW Enhances App Development for Cars', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Weiss N.', afid='60032991;60019722', affilname='Technische Universität Dortmund;Technische Universität München', affiliation_city='Dortmund;Munich', affiliation_country='Germany;Germany', author_count='4', author_names='Weiss, Niklas;Wiesche, Manuel;Schreieck, Maximilian;Krcmar, Helmut', author_ids='57211333690;42962873700;57189630979;6603243872', author_afids='60019722;60032991;60019722;60019722', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='1 December 2022', publicationName='IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management', issn='00189391', source_id='17359', eIssn='15580040', aggregationType='Journal', volume='69', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='4019-4035', description='Platform owners face multiple challenges such as onboarding and orchestrating app developers as well as providing resources to enable the development of complementary apps.

The field of HBI builds on several existing efforts in historically separate research fields/communities and aims to understand how buildings affect human outcomes and experiences, as well as how humans interact with, adapt to, and affect the built environment and its systems, to support buildings that can learn, enable adaptation, and evolve at different scales to improve the quality-of-life of its users while optimizing resource usage and service availability. Questions were developed by a diverse group of researchers with backgrounds in design, engineering, computer science, social science, and health science. Answers to these questions draw conclusions from what has been achieved to date as reported in the available literature and establish a foundation for future HBI research. This paper aims to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations in HBI research to change the way people interact with and perceive technology within the context of buildings and inform the design, construction, and operation of next-generation, intelligent built environments.

Strategies that use a systems approach to optimize these multiple, linked steps simultaneously are critical to close these gaps. Methods: The Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA) was adapted and piloted for the pediatric and adolescent HIV care and treatment cascade (SAIA-PEDS) at 6 facilities in Kenya. SAIA-PEDS includes three tools: continuous quality improvement (CQI), flow mapping, and pediatric cascade analysis (PedCAT). A predominately qualitative evaluation utilizing focus group discussions (N = 6) and in-depth interviews (N = 19) was conducted with healthcare workers after implementation to identify determinants of implementation. Data collection and analysis were grounded in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Results: Overall, the adapted SAIA-PEDS strategy was acceptable, and the three tools complemented one another and provided a relative advantage over existing processes. The flow mapping and CQI tools were compatible with existing workflows and resonated with team priorities and goals while providing a structure for group problem solving that transcended a single department’s focus. The PedCAT was overly complex, making it difficult to use. Leadership and hierarchy were complex determinants. All teams reported supportive leadership, with some describing in detail how their leadership was engaged and enthusiastic about the SAIA-PEDS process, by providing recognition, time, and resources. Hierarchy was similarly complex: in some facilities, leadership stifled rapid innovation by insisting on approving each change, while at other facilities, leadership had strong and supportive oversight of processes, checking on the progress frequently and empowering teams to test innovative ideas. Conclusion: CQI and flow mapping were core components of SAIA-PEDS, with high acceptability and consistent use, but the PedCAT was too complex. Leadership and hierarchy had a nuanced role in implementation. Future SAIA-PEDS testing should address PedCAT complexity and further explore the modifiability of leadership engagement to maximize implementation.', authkeywords='Adolescent | Cascade analysis | Consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) | Continuous quality improvement | Flow mapping | Health systems | HIV | Implementation determinants | Implementation science | Pediatric | Systems Analysis Improvement Approach (SAIA) | Systems engineering', citedby_count=5, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='NIH', fund_no='R34AI129900', fund_sponsor='National Institutes of Health'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85139078679', doi='10.1002/pc.27079', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='An experimentally validated model for predicting the tensile modulus of tubular biaxial and triaxial hybrid braids', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Ghamkhar G.', afid='60007751;60006029', affilname='Amirkabir University of Technology;Nottingham Trent University', affiliation_city='Tehran;Nottingham', affiliation_country='Iran;United Kingdom', author_count='4', author_names='Ghamkhar, Ghazal;Johari, Majid Safar;Toudeshky, Hossein Hosseini;Bodaghi, Mahdi', author_ids='57566092800;35771484500;9639101200;55867556400', author_afids='60006029-60007751;60007751;60007751;60006029', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='December 2022', publicationName='Polymer Composites', issn='02728397', source_id='14433', eIssn='15480569', aggregationType='Journal', volume='43', issueIdentifier='12', article_number=None, pageRange='9000-9011', description='Braiding is a versatile and cost-effective approach to generating various composite structures for mechanical, sports, and biomedical engineering applications, which are different from each other. For example, a stent is a braided structure and blood penetration in it is essential as much as the right function. Predicting the tensile responses is a prerequisite for the success of implementation of braided structures, and it is usually performed via destructive mechanical testing that might be costly and/or time-consuming. Therefore, it is essential to provide a model that can accurately predict the tensile modulus. In this research, a theoretical model is developed using the simplification of a braided structure and is validated via testing of biaxial and triaxial braids composed of polyester, glass, and basalt yarns on a 16-carrier vertical braiding machine. Experimental results not only are used for the model validation but also show the effectiveness of axial yarn presence, hybridization, and the presence of high-performance yarn in the braided structures on the tensile properties. A good correlation between theoretical values and experimental results is observed approving the high accuracy of the proposed model. This paper is likely to fill a gap in the state of the art and provide pertinent results that are instrumental in the design of hybrid-braided structures with minimum computational/experimental effort. The research innovation centers on the use of two different yarns to make hybridization, simplicity of the model to be used for biaxial and triaxial braided structures, and a start to omit destructive tests.', authkeywords='biaxial braid | hybrid braid | tensile modulus | theoretical model | triaxial braid | tubular braid', citedby_count=6, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85138955944', doi='10.1038/s41598-022-20552-6', pii=None, pubmed_id='36167970', title='A study of green roof and impact on the temperature of buildings using integrated IoT system', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Tseng K.H.', afid='60012392;128663710', affilname='National Taipei University of Technology;WSP International LLC.', affiliation_city='Taipei;New Taipei City', affiliation_country='Taiwan;Taiwan', author_count='4', author_names='Tseng, Kuo Hsiung;Chung, Meng Yun;Chen, Li Hsien;Chou, Lu An', author_ids='7102185123;57161890100;14018956200;57909312700', author_afids='60012392;60012392;60012392;128663710', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='December 2022', publicationName='Scientific Reports', issn=None, source_id='21100200805', eIssn='20452322', aggregationType='Journal', volume='12', issueIdentifier='1', article_number='16140', pageRange=None, description='With the rise of environmental consciousness and the evolution of circular cities, the Internet of things (IoT) has been combined with the concept of circular economies to promote the effective control of renewable energy and resources.

This study investigates the validity of the resource curse hypothesis related to financial development by recruiting fiscal decentralization, technology innovation, and economic policy uncertainty in China. The study employed the contemporary and innovative approach of quantile autoregressive distribution lag (QARDL) to evaluate the asymmetric association between variables from 1990 to 2020. Empirical findings validate the resource curse hypothesis in China, which implies that the natural resource rent compressed financial development. Likewise, economic policy uncertainty also adversely affected financial development. In contrast, fiscal decentralization and technological innovation accelerated financial development and neutralized the negative consequences of natural resources. Based on the findings, conductive short-run and long-run business strategies and regulations should be implemented, including the adequate consumption of natural resources, reallocation of funds at regional government levels, and transformation toward sustainable technologies to shift the curse into a blessing.\", authkeywords='Economic policy uncertainty | Fiscal decentralization | Natural resource rent | Resource curse hypothesis | Sustainable development | Technology innovation', citedby_count=29, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='SZJJ201916', fund_sponsor='Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85137623005', doi='10.1016/j.jspr.2022.102028', pii='S0022474X22001023', pubmed_id=None, title='Corrigendum to “Integrated approach on stored grain quality management with CO<inf>2</inf> monitoring - A review” [J.

Hence, in recent years, several efforts have been made to identify reliable and environmentally friendly synthetic strategies for synthesizing nanocomposites (NCs). Amongst, the plant-mediated synthesis has been identified as an alternative as plant extracts are used rather than the industrial chemical agents and harsh operational conditions to reduce metal ions which provide significant benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness, decreased toxicity, and abundancies of raw materials. Further, plant-derived biofunctionalized NCs are currently being used successfully in several applications, including environmental remediation, biomedical applications, agricultural and food industries, and engineering, due to their obvious beneficial properties. The use of plant-derived NCs in the field of nanotechnology has paved the way for sustainable synthesis as well as opened up new opportunities for innovation and commercialization in a wide range of industries. Hence, this review describes the advantages of the plant-derived NCs to the nanotechnology field, as well as an overview of the three types of matrix NCs, their synthesis, properties, and various potential applications.

Further, real-time imaging of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (sO2) can capture fast-paced oxygen delivery dynamics, which is needed to solve pertinent questions in these fields and beyond.

A volumetric imaging rate of 2 Hz has been achieved over a field of view (FOV) of 11 × 7.5 × 1.5 mm3 with a high spatial resolution of ~10 μm.

To diagnose and treat cancer effectively and to overcome these challenges, fundamental innovations in traditional diagnosis and therapy are necessary. Peptides can be very helpful in this regard due to their potential and diversity. To enhance the therapeutic potential of peptides, their limitations must be properly identified and their structures engineered and modified for higher efficiency. Promoting the bioavailability and stability of peptides is one of the main concerns. Peptides can also be effective in different areas of targeting, alone or with the help of other therapeutic agents. There has been a lot of research in this area, and the potential for variability of peptides will continue to improve this process. Another promising area in which peptides can help treat cancer is peptide vaccines, which are undergoing promising research, and high throughput technologies can lead to fundamental changes in this area. Peptides have been effective in almost all areas of cancer treatment, and some have even gone through clinical phases. However, many barriers need to be overcome to reach the desired point.

Working as international communities, GVCs are rich in knowledge and resource interchange. The prior literature has focused on knowledge absorbing or internal knowledge transfer within firms for in-house innovation. However, scant research has focused on promoting innovation across interfirm networks in a GVC context. This article develops a new concept of interfirm transformative capacity as a firm's ability to transfer developed technology knowledge across time, space, and firm networks. In this article, we explore three mechanisms of interfirm transformative capacity in GVCs: 1) choosing knowledge intermediaries, 2) transmitting and maintaining knowledge over time and space, and 3) reactivating and synthesizing knowledge. We predict that engagement in a lead firm's GVC, structural holes, and network centrality will affect a focal firm's innovation impact as a result of interfirm transformative capacity. Integrator suppliers have higher innovation impacts than modular suppliers. To test these three mechanisms, we build a novel dataset from a five-year panel of Apple suppliers and their patent impacts. The results support our hypotheses related to the mechanisms of interfirm transformative capacity. Our theoretical elaboration and empirical findings have significant implications for innovation policy within, and governance of, GVCs.\", authkeywords='Global value chains (GVCs) | innovation impact | interfirm innovation | interfirm transformative capacity | network centrality | structural holes', citedby_count=8, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='CSC', fund_no='201806340132', fund_sponsor='China Scholarship Council'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85096091800', doi='10.1109/TEM.2020.3027973', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A Scientometric Exploration of Crowdsourcing: Research Clusters and Applications', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Ozcan S.', afid='60170203;60116332;60021379;60020513', affilname='Portsmouth Business School;Rennes School of Business;Bahçeşehir Üniversitesi;HSE University', affiliation_city='Portsmouth;Rennes;Istanbul;Moscow', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;France;Turkey;Russian Federation', author_count='4', author_names='Ozcan, Sercan;Boye, David;Arsenyan, Jbid;Trott, Paul', author_ids='55767986400;57219924834;25928978600;56260436300', author_afids='60021379-60020513;60170203;60116332;60170203', coverDate='2022-12-01', coverDisplayDate='1 December 2022', publicationName='IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management', issn='00189391', source_id='17359', eIssn='15580040', aggregationType='Journal', volume='69', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='3023-3037', description='Crowdsourcing is a multidisciplinary research area that represents a rapidly expanding field where new applications are constantly emerging.

EPICA is the update of the SHARE European Earthquake Catalogue (SHEEC) 1000-1899, with which it shares the main principles-mostly transparency, repeatability and continent-wide harmonisation of data-As well as the compilation strategies and methods. Version 1.1 of EPICA contains 5703 earthquakes with either maximum intensity ≥5 or Mw≥4.0, with a spatial coverage from the Atlantic Ocean to the west to 32 E in longitude, and from the Mediterranean Sea to Northern Europe. EPICA relies upon the updated knowledge of the European preinstrumental seismicity provided by the data gathered in the European Archive of Historical Earthquake Data (AHEAD). Such data are both macroseismic intensity data supplied by descriptive historical seismological studies and online macroseismic databases, and parameters contained in regional catalogues. As done for the compilation of SHEEC 1000-1899, these datasets were thoroughly analysed in order to select the most representative of the knowledge of each earthquake, independently from national constraints. Selected intensity distributions are processed with three methods to determine location and magnitude based on the attenuation of macroseismic intensity and are combined with parameters harmonised from modern regional catalogues. This paper describes the compilation procedure of EPICA version 1.1, its input data, the assessment of the earthquake parameters and the resulting catalogue, which is finally compared with its previous version.

First objective is to study differences amongst India's Make-in-India, Germany's Industry 4.0 and China's Made-in-China 2025 on a macro level. Second objective is to identify where does individual industry segment out of the five broad segments (prioritized by Make-in-India initiative) represented by ten firms in India stand in terms of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Third objective is to identify key barriers for each of these five industry segments. Finally, socio-technical interventions are also proposed aimed at faster adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methodological approach is followed to achieve the research objectives. First, for the macro-level comparison of three pertinent countries, extant research and industry literature have been relied upon. Thereafter, at a micro level, inputs from experts belonging to focal sectors are included in this study to ascertain the current level of readiness of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and the barriers to adoption. Finally, the authors argue for and propose some socio-technical interventions that are aimed at mitigation of barriers for adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Findings: It has been ascertained that amongst the ten firms (two each from given focal sectors) considered in the study, the automotive and the software firm are perhaps best placed to adopt the Industry 4.0 technology, while the infrastructure project management firm is least ready for Industry 4.0 technologies. The common barriers to adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, as elaborated by experts belonging to each of the ten firms, are also identified. These three commons barriers are resistance to change, unclear economic benefits and problems related to coordination and collaboration. Research limitations/implications: The study is one of first attempts to understand the nuances related to technology readiness across focal industries pertaining to the Make-in-India initiative and Industry 4.0. The study furthers the extant understanding of common and distinct barriers across industries. Employing the soft-systems methodology, the study advocates for a number of socio-technical interventions pertaining to establishment of e-skill ecosystem, community learning clusters and sector-focussed skill acquisition and augmentation. Since the study considers only two firms corresponding to each of the five focal sectors, including more firms across industries could have resulted in further validation of study as well. Practical implications: Contrasting the initiatives of the three countries results in identification of different thematic focus of the respective initiatives. While India's Make-in-India initiative has a strong social dimension, Germany's Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025 have key objective related to integration of cyber-physical systems and to graduate to innovation-driven country, respectively. Further, analysis on the technology readiness for adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies based on the respective experts' assessment results in understanding of the underlying barriers. Social implications: Adopting the soft-systems perspective linking nuances of stakeholders, socio-technical systems and socio-economic characteristics results in several propositions to further the social objectives of India's Make-in-India initiative. These propositions advocate for pathways in which extant strengths in terms of technology, people and existing socio-technical structures can be brought together to cater to the requirements related to employability and skill augmentation of new as well as existing workforce. Originality/value: Extant research literature is primarily focussed on certain specific topics within Industry 4.0 implementation and is mainly based on conceptual or theoretical basis. From a practitioners' perspective, only a few empirical papers could be found that too are typically focussed on single case studies resulting from pilot applications of Industry 4.0. However, such papers have not examined the broad implications of Industry 4.0 in terms of differences between key countries' manufacturing initiatives, readiness of key sectors, sectoral barriers and accompanying policy-level implications associated with implementation of Industry 4.0. Thus, the objective of this research is to abridge these research gaps.\", authkeywords='Industry 4.0 | Make-in-India | Society | Technological innovation | Technology adoption | Technology readiness', citedby_count=32, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='ICSSR', fund_no='IMPRESS/P898/27/18-19/ICSSR', fund_sponsor='Indian Council of Social Science Research'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85142930566', doi='10.24840/2183-6493_008.006_0006', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Characterizing Academic Engineering Research Groups: A Case Study of the Advanced Joining Processes Unit', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Marques E.A.S.', afid='60013981;60007249', affilname='Instituto de Ciência e Inovação em Engenharia Mecânica e Engenharia Industrial;Universidade do Porto', affiliation_city='Porto;Porto', affiliation_country='Portugal;Portugal', author_count='3', author_names='Marques, Eduardo A.S.;Carbas, Ricardo J.C.;da Silva, Lucas F.M.', author_ids='55393793200;55977169100;7202897763', author_afids='60013981;60013981;60007249', coverDate='2022-11-28', coverDisplayDate='28 November 2022', publicationName='U.Porto Journal of Engineering', issn=None, source_id='21101021578', eIssn='21836493', aggregationType='Journal', volume='8', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='76-89', description='Academic research is a key activity of higher learning institutions, where the knowledge, skills and capabilities of the staff are directed towards scientific activities.

The application of VM on Nigerian construction projects is very minimal due to certain obstacles, namely, lack of VM experts, paucity of knowledge on the techniques, etc., which inhibits the adoption into the construction industry. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual framework of the adoption of VM on construction projects in a typical developing economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study engaged 15 selected VM experts in two rounds of Delphi survey to develop a conceptual framework of VM adoption. The method of data analysis includes mean score, standard deviation, Kendall’s coefficient of concordance, chi-square (χ2) test, interrater agreement analysis and significant level analysis. The developed conceptual framework was sent to a team of local and international VM experts for validation. Findings: This study reveals that the adoption of VM requires the collective effort of relevant stakeholders in the construction industry. The framework developed presents individual and collective activities to be undertaken by the stakeholders. The activities include training, legislation, government-funded research, etc. Thus, the adoption of innovative management methodology like VM requires the collaboration of academics, construction professional bodies and government parastatals. This will assist in the judicious use of limited construction resources and boost the relevance of the Nigerian construction industry among developing nations and in the global construction market. Originality/value: This study used the opinions of few construction professionals that can be regarded as VM experts in Nigeria, as against engaging a pool of construction professionals who may not be knowledgeable in VM process. Engaging the few VM experts in the Nigerian construction industry is important to have a valid basis for drawing conclusion, as large questionnaire survey could be possibly filled by inexperienced or unqualified respondents if stringent criteria are not considered at the outset of this study.', authkeywords='Adoption | Conceptual framework | Construction industry | Innovation | Nigeria | Value management | Value management/engineering', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85144462793', doi='10.13345/j.cjb.220586', pii=None, pubmed_id='37699678', title='Rational design and applications of industrial proteins', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Qu G.', afid='60273043;125105571', affilname='Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology;National Technology Innovation Center of Synthetic Biology', affiliation_city='Tianjin;Tianjin', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='3', author_names='Qu, Ge;Yuan, Bo;Sun, Zhoutong', author_ids='55600098900;57205288197;56597155600', author_afids='60273043-125105571;60273043-125105571;60273043-125105571', coverDate='2022-11-25', coverDisplayDate='25 November 2022', publicationName='Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Biotechnology', issn='10003061', source_id='16144', eIssn='18722075', aggregationType='Journal', volume='38', issueIdentifier='11', article_number=None, pageRange='4068-4080', description='As one of the underlying core technologies in the fields of synthetic biology and green bio-manufacturing, rational protein design is able to effectively solve generic challenges, e.g., improving insufficient performance of natural enzymes, and creating high-performance artificial enzymes.

Scientific knowledge has a significant effect on technology innovation in lithium-ion batteries. Understanding how science contributes to the technology in the lithium-ion battery domain could make better use of scientific knowledge to promote technology innovation. Previous studies about lithium-ion battery innovation have provided valuable suggestions while they did not explore how science contributes to the technology in the lithium-ion battery domain. Moreover, most previous studies about relationships between science and technology ignored multi-step indirect citations, which might have caused information loss. Therefore, this study uncovers the knowledge contribution from science to technology in the lithium-ion battery from a more comprehensive view by proposing a paper-patent knowledge genetic model and related indexes which could measure the knowledge contribution effect of both direct and multi-step indirect citations. The findings are: (1) In the lithium-ion battery domain, the indirect citation relationships from science to technology contain information, and they should be noticed. The total knowledge contribution range of science to technology is twice the direct knowledge contribution range, and the total knowledge contribution strength is five times the direct knowledge contribution strength; (2) In the lithium-ion battery domain, the knowledge contribution of science to technology is mainly concentrated within five steps of the knowledge flow. When consulting relevant materials related to scientific papers, patent applicants or patent examiners can obtain data collections of relevant papers through the five-step snowball sampling method to avoid information redundancy and guarantee relatively sufficient reference materials; (3) This study unearthed the top ten papers ranked by total knowledge contribution strength. Most papers are generally highly recognized by the academic community, and most are easily ignored by the traditional method. The knowledge contribution strength index can be used to evaluate papers and predict significant award winners in the lithium-ion battery domain.\", authkeywords='Citation network | Knowledge contribution | Lithium-ion battery | Science | Technology', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='XK1802-5', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85111908720', doi='10.1108/TQM-03-2021-0069', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Effect of total quality management practices on nonfinancial performance: an empirical analysis of automotive engineering industry in Ethiopia', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Abdi M.', afid='60109511;126201600', affilname='Ambo University;Defense University', affiliation_city='Ambo;Bishoftu', affiliation_country='Ethiopia;Ethiopia', author_count='2', author_names='Abdi, Mohamed;Singh, Ajit Pal', author_ids='57226552117;57199212166', author_afids='126201600;60109511', coverDate='2022-11-24', coverDisplayDate='24 November 2022', publicationName='TQM Journal', issn='17542731', source_id='11600154157', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='34', issueIdentifier='5', article_number=None, pageRange='1116-1144', description='Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the total quality management (TQM) practices and identify their effect on the nonfinancial performance (NFP) in the automotive engineering industry in Ethiopia. Despite many studies investigating the relationship between TQM practices and NFP, rare research has been conducted on TQM in automotive industries, making this a hugely unexplored field. Design/methodology/approach: The data underlying this study was collected using more than 500 self-administered questionnaire survey, distributed to the employees working under different departments and factories under one automotive engineering industry. Extensive data screening and refinement processes for discarding irrelevant items for the questionnaire (Likert five-point scale) were carried out. The data was employed to test the proposed theoretical model, established with the objective of assessing the effect of TQM practices on the NFP in the case industry. Empirical validated relations have been proofed for previously done researches that there were positive relations between the TQM practices and NFP. Different statistical tools applied include descriptive data analysis, correlation analysis, mean scale test, reliability analysis and factor analysis, and finally, two models were developed based on structural equation modeling by using SPSS and AMOS-26 software. Findings: Results found in this study were quite surprising. Initially, there was a total of ten TQM factors. The six independent factors survived from factor analysis only two factors (employee involvement and innovation) were contributing to the NFP. The study was acted as a performance evaluation system to track the industry NFP. Although the study focused on the effect of TQM practices, for more results it is recommended to conduct a 360-degree further research study to reveal the weaknesses, strengths, opportunities and challenges of the case industry performance. Research limitations/implications: Every research has its own limitations. The way the analysis is conducted in this study ensures that the limitations do not compromise the validity of the results obtained. Control variables (industry type, size, age, process type and technology used) are not considered in the research which may affect the results obtained. The study included the automobile industry alone, so the obtained results cannot be generalized to other industries. Practical implications: The positive relationship between the TQM practices and NFP measures indicates the importance of each of these practices in improving the industry. Researchers/managers/practitioners can use this developed model periodically to understand where the industry stands in the quality management journey. They can also analyze the effect of TQM practices on financial as well as operational performance measures. The research findings can also motivate the top management of the industry for better planning of goals, to arrange resources in time, in pursuit of improving quality, employee and industry performance. Originality/value: The Ethiopian manufacturing industry is required to improve their manufacturing and service quality, in order to enhance their productivity and boost their competitiveness in an international market, which is the basis of this study.

The developed educational technologies can lack sufficient detail for replication or be too specific and require extensive reworking to be employable by other instructors. Furthermore, instructors face barriers to adopting interactive techniques within their classroom due to student reception, resources, and awareness. We argue that the advancement of computer science education, in terms of propagation and sustainability of student-centered teaching, requires guided approaches for incremental instructional changes as opposed to revolutionary pedagogy. This requires the prioritization of lightweight techniques that can fit within existing lecture formats to enable instructors to overcome barriers hindering the adoption of interactive techniques.

SCB-based biofuel production through the biochemical route is considered to be an eco-friendly option. However, the sustainability of this green technology is still questionable for some technoeconomic challenges associated with the pretreatment, detoxification, microbial tolerance to inhibitors, and conversion of SCB hydrolysates into biofuels. Researchers have attempted to overcome these issues, particularly by developing cost-effective pretreatment methods and engineered strains capable of tolerating inhibitors and converting SCB-derived components more efficiently. This review aims to present the current status and challenges in the conversion of SCB into biofuels like biohydrogen, biomethane, biomethanol, bioethanol, and biobutanol. The major economic and environmental perspectives are also discussed to assess the economics and eco-friendliness of SCB as the feedstocks for biofuel production.

Taking Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2010 to 2019 as samples, this paper divides environmental regulations into three categories: command-based environmental regulation (ER1), market-based environmental regulation (ER2) and voluntary environmental regulation (ER3), studies their impact on enterprise GTI, and discusses the joint effect of enterprise research and development (R&D) investment and government support from the perspective of internal and external linkage of enterprises. In addition, this paper also analyzes the compound effect and time effect of environmental regulation. The research conclusions are as follows: (1) From the perspective of policy types, both ER1 and ER 2 could stimulate enterprises to carry out GTI, and the promotion effect of green utility model patents is slightly higher than that of green invention patents. ER3 inhibits enterprise GTI. In addition, this paper finds that the effect of three environmental regulations acting at the same time is greater than that of one of them. (2) The mechanism analysis shows that the R&D investment of enterprise positively could moderate the relationship between ER2 and green invention at the significance level of 5%, positively moderate the relationship between ER2 and green utility model patent at the significance level of 1%, and negatively moderate the relationship between ER3 and green utility model patent at the significance level of 5%. The government support could moderate the relationship between environmental regulation and green utility model patents at the significance level of 5% and 10%. (3) The effect analysis shows that the transformation rate of GTI in China needs to be improved. The three environmental regulations could have an effect on enterprise GTI in a short period, and ER1 has the fastest effect. (4) Considering the differences in the level of economic development and resource endowments in various regions of China, this paper classifies the sample enterprises and finds that the impact of environmental regulation on enterprise GTI is heterogeneous in terms of location, ownership nature, factor density and industry type.

The development of micro flow measurement technology plays a driving role in biomedicine, chemical engineering, semiconductor manufacturing and other fields. In this paper, the relationship between the fluid velocity in the pipe and its pressure on the pipe wall is used to sense the pressure wave generated by the fluid flowing through the pipe through the piezoelectric film, and then measure the small flow in the pipe. A pressure sensitive element was made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric film, and a real flow experimental platform was built. By processing the voltage signal with flow information collected from the real flow experiment, the voltage fluctuation amplitudes corresponding to 9 flow measurement points are obtained. The flow voltage amplitude characteristic curve is obtained through curve fitting, and the flow measurement sensitivity, relative error and repeatability are calculated. The real flow experiment results verify the feasibility of the micro flow measurement method based on pressure wave.

Consumers want to bite into a perfectly ripe fruit without having to worry about how to get rid of the hidden pit. That is why consumers and processors both regard the stone to be an annoyance. As fruit trees are propagated vegetatively, and the seeds are not consumed, the pits are considered agricultural waste by the processing industry and must be disposed of, usually by burning. Pitless (without seed and stone) fruit cultivars would be a superior product that would increase consumption of these nutrient-dense foods (fruits) while also providing a higher income to farmers. Luther Burbank, a visionary breeder, sought to produce stoneless plums for the first time in the early 1900s, using a partly stoneless wild-type plum. Through breeding, he was able to produce better fruit quality with the stoneless trait and even discovered lines without seeds, but he was unable to completely eradicate the stone. In Burbank's attempt to improve plum production, he left an important heritage by demonstrating that the stone may be almost eliminated without sacrificing fruit quality or quantity. Considering the prevailing need for convenience foods (seedless fruit like citrus, grapes, etc.), and enhanced understanding of genetics and breeding innovations, breeders should pick up where Mr. Burbank left off in the production of a better than “nearly perfect” stoneless plum. To date, naturally occurring stoneless fruit cultivars in both Ziziphus jujuba and Z. mauritiana have been identified. Recent technology (like multi-omics, molecular markers, genetic engineering, and accelerated breeding cycles) should be applied to achieve a completely stoneless/seedless high-quality fruit in the cultivated species of Ziziphus Mill. Furthermore, the period necessary for endocarp formation should be defined by assessing the gene expression of several transcription factors involved in the formation of endocarp cells. According to new research, fruit stones contain relatively high amounts of lignin therefore the gene should be targeted for genetic engineering to decrease the level of lignification.\", authkeywords='breeding | development | genetic engineering | production | recent technology | stoneless fruit', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='20326811D', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85145653226', doi='10.16339/j.cnki.hdxbzkb.2022114', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research and Application of UHPC-based High Performance Bridge Structures', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Cao J.', afid='60032356', affilname='Hunan University', affiliation_city='Changsha', affiliation_country='China', author_count='6', author_names='Cao, Junhui;Fan, Wei;Li, Lifeng;Shao, Xudong;Zhang, Yang;Zhao, Hua', author_ids='55213023200;36731024800;55540704500;12646877900;56299812200;55652511100', author_afids='60032356;60032356;60032356;60032356;60032356;60032356', coverDate='2022-11-01', coverDisplayDate='November 2022', publicationName='Hunan Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Hunan University Natural Sciences', issn='16742974', source_id='22386', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='49', issueIdentifier='11', article_number=None, pageRange='1-32', description='UHPC is a cement-based material with ultra-high mechanical performance and ultra-long durability, and it provides new possibility for innovation and performance promotion in bridge structures.

The research methods used in this study included literature analysis, TRIZ the method, human factors engineering (HFE), universal design, and IPA. First, the design of the folding chair and the layout of the literature related to the chair are analyzed. The contradiction matrix was used in the TRIZ method to find the principle of invention and analyze it, to provide a reference for the innovative design of folding chairs, and then use the relevant literature on materials to help design and select materials quickly. Next, the chair is assembled and unfolded and universal design is applied to design it into an acceptable product, causing it to be more popular. The human–machine interaction with HFE makes the design of rapid assembly and the design of folding chairs faster and safer. Finally, the IPA method is used to understand the subjective feelings of customers on the products of this research and the satisfaction and importance are used as the basis for evaluation; a two-dimensional matrix graph is drawn. After drawing a simulation using drawing software, it is compared with the traditional folding chair and the research results are as follows: (1) Quick unfolding function: use the pull ring upwards and it naturally unfolds downwards by gravity. (2) Quick folding and storage function: use the foot pedal, single-foot operation, and the folding chair can be quickly stored. (3) Rapid transportation and unfolding function: The chair back can be connected with other chair backs and has the functions of quick unfolding and quick storage, so as to realize the quick placement of the folding chair. This design activity realizes the preliminary design concept and design simulation of the product design through a systematic and innovative method.

We find that the energy quota trading policy can reduce the total energy consumption and energy consumption intensity of pilot cities, and the effect of the policy can gradually strengthen over time. The market-oriented reform of energy factor allocation can effectively promote energy saving and economic growth. These results are convincing through a series of robustness checks. The heterogeneity test shows that the energy quota trading has a significant energy saving effect on economically developed cities, densely populated cities and southern cities, but not in economically underdeveloped cities, sparsely populated cities and northern cities. Further mechanism inspection suggests that the pilot policy of energy quota trading mainly achieves energy conservation through industrial structure upgrading and green technology innovation.

In the past, most of the research on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning focused on specific research in a certain field, scene, and discipline, while a few studies focused on research review or policy analysis, and few studies combined macro and meso research reviews in academia with national policy analysis for comparative analysis. It is necessary and urgent to explore the interaction between scholars’ research and policy deployment, which can bring theoretical contributions and policy references to the top-down design, implementation promotion, and academic research of China’s dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. Based on 608 international research articles on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning published by Chinese scholars from 2000–2021 and 187 national policy documents published during this period, this paper conducts a comparative analysis between the knowledge maps of international research hotspots and the co-occurrence maps of policy keywords on dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning. The research shows that in the stage of initial development (2000–2007), international research articles are few and focused, and research hotspots are somewhat alienated from policy keywords. In the stage of rising development (2008–2015), after the Wenchuan earthquake, research hotspots are closely related to policy keywords, mainly in the fields of geology, engineering disasters, meteorological disasters, natural disasters, etc. Meanwhile, research hotspots also focus on cutting-edge technologies and theories, while national-level policy keywords focus more on overall governance and macro promotion, but the two are gradually closely integrated. In the stage of rapid development (2016–2021), with the continuous attention and policy promotion of the national government, the establishment of the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the gradual establishment and improvement of the disaster early warning and monitoring system, research hotspots and policy keywords are integrated and overlapped with each other, realizing the organic linkage and mutual promotion between academic research and political deployment. The motivation, innovation, integration, and transformation of dynamic disaster monitoring and early warning are promoted by both policy and academic research. The institutions that issue policies at the national level include the State Council and relevant departments, the Ministry of Emergency Management, the Ministry of Water Resources, and other national ministries and commissions. The leading affiliated institutions of scholars’ international research include China University of Mining and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, and other institutions.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the understanding of general and specialist dentists toward different grafts and their resources during surgical procedures. Materials and Methods A questionnaire was disseminated for our survey-based study, emailed the soft copy, and distributed the hard copies among 400 general dental practitioners (GDPs) and specialists throughout Pakistan to evaluate the types of grafts used to cover bone or soft tissue defects. Out of 400 GDPs and dental specialists, 200 participants returned the completed questionnaires. Results Nearly 200 dental surgeons participated from different regions of Pakistan. Most of the GDPs and specialists in Pakistan are not well aware of tissue-engineered grafts and their role in dentistry. The frequency of utilizing a patient's oral fibroblast to generate the collagen is 5.5%. Most of the GDPs are not aware of the resource of bony spicules if utilized which is 49.5%.

As a consequence, this study compared the punishment effect of the carbon tax and the reward effect of carbon subsidy on the performance of green technology innovation in China's provincial industries from 2006 to 2017. We also elucidated that the enterprises’ green technology innovation restricts and stimulates the role of low-carbon regulation on green efficiency in the case of the double threshold effect of carbon dioxide emission. Based on this framework, the integrated tax-subsidy policy for carbon mitigation has a significant differential effect on green efficiency, which changed from an inhibition effect in the high-carbon stage to a promotion effect in the low-carbon stage. And the validity of low-carbon regulations increases with the reduction degree of carbon dioxide emission. But it all depends on whether low-carbon regulations stimulate the enterprises’ willingness to green technology innovation, and whether innovations generate incentives that both increase carbon dioxide emissions and compensate for their innovation cost. Otherwise, enterprise performance should adopt follow strategy more than green technology innovation. Therefore, we further suggested that offsetting the costs of green technology innovation through carbon subsidies would improve the willingness of enterprises to make technological progress and increase the likelihood of carbon reductions which can help the peak in China's carbon emissions.\", authkeywords='Carbon mitigation | Green efficiency | Green technology innovation | Low-carbon regulation', citedby_count=13, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='SK2021ZD0084', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85139728908', doi='10.1016/j.renene.2022.10.015', pii='S0960148122015051', pubmed_id=None, title='How does information and communication technology affect renewable energy technology innovation?

Data on investment in R&D of ATMPs are recognized as scarce, particularly in developing countries. Because of the numerous peculiarities of the Brazilian health system and the science and technology (S&T) system, the country is a good example for the evaluation of public investments in R&D of ATMPs. The aim of this study is to analyze the evolution of investments made by the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Brazil and partners in the ATMP field between 2004 and 2020. Methods: A descriptive analysis was performed based on secondary data. The analysis was based on S&T and innovation research and support for research infrastructure in the field. The database was stratified by year of funding, ATMP type, type of study or research infrastructure project, amount invested in the project, targeted disease for which clinical trials in ATMPs were developed and financing sector (health, education, S&T and economic). Results: The investments coordinated by MoH (61.5%) in partnership with the S&T, education and economic sectors (38.5%) consisted of Int$137.35 million in 282 ATMP projects. Funding included S&T and innovation research (67% of the total amount) and projects to implement or maintain infrastructure in selected research centers (32.98%). With regard to global convergence, cell therapy was the type of ATMP that most benefited from public investment, totaling 82.23% of the total funding in the analyzed period. Cardiology (29%) and neurology (21%) were the main focus of clinical trials. Following the global trend of public sector R&D funding, the number of basic and pre-clinical research projects represented 78.06% of the total number of projects. Conclusions: Despite the need to implement improvements in ATMP R&D financing policy in Brazil, the country has made important steps in the field and can serve as a benchmark for other countries with socioeconomic similarities.

We implemented a data-driven strategy to identify predictors from 366 candidate variables covering a comprehensive range of genetic and environmental factors and developed the ML model to predict incident dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) within five, ten, and much longer years (median 11.9 [Interquartile range 11.2–12.5] years). Findings: During a follow-up of 5,023,337 person-years, 5287 and 2416 participants developed dementia and AD, respectively. A novel UKB dementia risk prediction (UKB-DRP) model comprising ten predictors including age, ApoE ε4, pairs matching time, leg fat percentage, number of medications taken, reaction time, peak expiratory flow, mother's age at death, long-standing illness, and mean corpuscular volume was established. Our prediction model was internally evaluated based on five-fold cross-validation on discrimination and calibration, and it was further compared with existing prediction scales. The UKB-DRP model can achieve high discriminative accuracy in dementia (AUC 0.848 ± 0.007) and even better in AD (AUC 0.862 ± 0.015). The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value = 0.92), and the predictive power was solid in different incidence time groups. More importantly, our model presented an apparent superiority over existing models like Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia Risk Score (AUC 0.705 ± 0.008), the Dementia Risk Score (AUC 0.752 ± 0.007), and the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (AUC 0.584 ± 0.017). The model was internally validated in the general population of European ancestry and White ethnicity; thus, further validation with independent datasets is necessary to confirm these findings. Interpretation: Our ML-based UKB-DRP model incorporated ten easily accessible predictors with solid predictive power for incident dementia and AD within five, ten, and much longer years, which can be used to identify individuals at high risk of dementia and AD in the general population.

Most of the researchers in education theoretically speculate upon blockchain's extraordinary potentials for enterprises, finance, administration, and management of education. Little attention has been paid, however, to the problems of socially inclusive knowledge transformation, sustainability, and equitable access to quality education for marginalised communities. This paper aims to describe an approach and method for leveraging education blockchain as a possible means to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the social inclusion of marginalised communities of teachers and learners. This theoretical paper adopts a reflective research approach to critically analyse the current state of blockchain applications in education, and discuss its prospects for building educational commons for sustainable development. This paper contributes to the field of educational technology by exploring blockchain's prospects to building educational commons through four strategies: (a) network cooperation; (b) diversity of interacting agents; (c) shared resources; and (d) educational logistics. It also contributes to the conceptualisation of knowledge transformation for sustainable education by modelling blockchain-supported educational commons and informing educational practitioners and technological innovation policy makers. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralised, peer-to-peer shared ledger technology that can be adopted across education networks. Blockchain is regarded as a disruptive technology and a key driver of the next socioeconomic mega trend. The extant literature on blockchain in education are technology-centred and limited to applications in financing, administration, and management of education. Blockchain's potential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in education and in favour of marginalised communities remain unexplored. What this paper adds A critique of the mainstream literature and its utilitarian and business-oriented paradigm for leveraging blockchain technology in education. An operational definition of ‘education blockchain’ as a set of affordances of a blockchain technology that empowers educators and learners to achieve sustainability of their education system. Conceptualisation of a ‘sustainable education blockchain’ for the knowledge transformation of marginalised communities. A framework of blockchain for building educational commons through network cooperation, diversity of interactive agents, shared resources and educational logistics. Implications for practice and/or policy This paper calls for re-orienting blockchain technology in education from pro-profit to human-centred adoption. This is to ensure a balance among technological advances, knowledge transformation, and safeguarding of privacy and individual rights of marginalised teachers and learners. Sustainable blockchain technology is for the social inclusion of marginalised teachers and learners by means of secure and trusted peer-to-peer collaboration, autonomous community organisation and fair distribution of resources. This paper contributes to the conceptualisation of knowledge transformation for sustainable education by (a) modelling the key features of blockchain-supported educational commons; and (b) informing educational practitioners and innovation policy makers who are interested in blockchain applications. The model contributes to the understanding of an authentic and humanistic knowledge transformation beyond its dominant notion of an instrumental, linear, purely technological driver of educational systems. The model allows us to envisage a more sustainable transformation in educational practices.\", authkeywords='blockchain technology | education commons | educational inclusion | marginalised communities | SDGs | sustainable education | teaching and learning', citedby_count=35, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85137647752', doi='10.1016/j.techfore.2022.122020', pii='S0040162522005418', pubmed_id=None, title='Green technology innovation, environmental externality, and the cleaner upgrading of industrial structure in China — Considering the moderating effect of environmental regulation', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Xie R.', afid='60017161;60010080;60009860;120299753', affilname='National University of Singapore;Nanjing University of Science and Technology;Fudan University;Decision-Making and Consultation Research Base of Jiangsu Industrial Cluster', affiliation_city='Singapore City;Nanjing;Shanghai;Nanjing', affiliation_country='Singapore;China;China;China', author_count='2', author_names='Xie, Ronghui;Teo, Thompson S.H.', author_ids='55041110900;35613161000', author_afids='60010080-60009860-120299753;60017161', coverDate='2022-11-01', coverDisplayDate='November 2022', publicationName='Technological Forecasting and Social Change', issn='00401625', source_id='14704', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='184', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='122020', pageRange=None, description=\"Under the requirements of high-quality development of China's economy, how to impel the industrial structure towards a cleaner upgrading path becomes a matter of urgency.

This study seeks to fill the gap in research by expanding the traditional measurement of industrial upgrading, and further discovering the internal logic between green technology innovation, environmental regulation and the cleaner upgrading of industrial structure in the context of China. Based on empirical regressions on a panel data from China's 35 industrial sectors during 2002–2019, our results have evidenced that green technology innovation is a valid driving force in facilitating the cleaner upgrading except for the Low value-added & Cleaner (LC) sectors.

The Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau features the most active crustal dynamics on earth, the strongest coupling effects of endogenic and exogenic dynamics, and the environment most sensitive to global climate change. The project area is characterized by extremely cold climate, high elevation and relief, high seismic intensity, high geothermal activity, and high tectonic stress. Consequently, the threat of various disaster risks is ever-present at different stages of the entire life cycle of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway. There is urgent need to systematically study these problems at various levels from the fundamental science to the development of key technologies. This article investigates the different disaster risks recognized during the various stages of construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway project, and summarizes the scientific challenges and technical problems faced in relation to disaster risk prevention and control. This work also introduces the scientific deployment and relevant research progress of the Sichuan–Tibet Fund special project initiated by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Here, we also aim to solve the major fundamental scientific challenges in terms of long-term risk prevention and control during the construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway, and lay a theoretical foundation to promote breakthroughs in the bottleneck of key technologies. The scientific challenges addressed in the study of disaster risk associated with the Sichuan–Tibet Railway include the following: The quantitative assessment of the activity of deep-large faults and strong earthquake prediction, the evolution of physical fields in areas of strong tectonic activity, the development mechanisms of tunnel hazards, the slope evolution processes under coupled endogenic and exogenic dynamics in alpine gorges, the impact of climate change on the formation and evolution of surface hazards, and the evolution of extreme wind fields in deep-cut canyons. The technical problems faced in disaster risk prevention and mitigation in relation to the Sichuan–Tibet Railway are as follows: Advanced identification, monitoring, and early warning of geological disasters in mountainous areas with steep and complex terrain; risk analysis, prevention, and control of railway engineering disasters based on their dynamic processes; tunnel engineering hazard monitoring, early warning, risk analysis, prevention, and control technologies; key technologies for emergency response; and the green and resilient railway system and lifecycle risk management. The Sichuan–Tibet Fund special project will include five key research topics: (1) the interior geological structure and dynamic evolution of the eastern plateau; (2) the hazard-inducing mechanisms of coupled internal and external forces in canyons and gullies within plateaus; (3) the cataclysm mechanics of deeply buried long-distance tunnel engineering; (4) risk identification and projection of major disasters affecting the railway; and (5) the integrated management of scientific innovations and super large-scale railway construction. Systematic research is expected to reveal the evolution of earth surface movements and coupled engineering-disturbance related disasters.

The inadequacies of previous research on plastic strain computation induced by several factors such as anisotropy, dilatancy, hardening law, and hardening parameter are evaluated utilizing the stress–strain chain. Meanwhile, based on the stress–strain chain, innovations of the UH model such as the transformed stress method, the unified normalized compression line, and the unified hardening parameter are introduced and validated. It can be seen with the stress–strain chain that plastic volumetric strain and its assignment criterion are the keys to deformation calculation. Representative innovations of the UH model facilitate the efficiency of plastic strain calculation by accurately determining plastic volumetric strain and appropriate ratio relations.

Drawing on the spatial Durbin model and panel data at the city level, I explored the impacts of GTI and ICT in lowering carbon intensity while considering spatial dependence from 2003 to 2017 in China. My empirical findings indicated that GTI and ICT not only play important roles in lowering local carbon intensity but also imposing positive and negative spatial spillover effects from the local cities to their neighboring cities. My examination of the transmission mechanism illustrates this concept except for the direct carbon mitigation impact. As a general-purpose technology, ICT also exerts an indirect effect in lowering carbon intensity via GTI. Heterogeneity tests reveal that both GTI and ICT have greater impacts on Eastern than Middle-Western regions to lower carbon intensity. Thus, policymakers should enhance the multi-dimensional region collaboration, the diffusion strength of informatization, and the absorptive capacity of technological innovation. The empirical evidence of this study also inspires confidence in accelerating industrial transition and optimizing energy structure toward carbon neutrality by boosting the expansion of ICT-related human capital.', authkeywords='Carbon intensity | ICT employment | Spatial effects | Transmission mechanism', citedby_count=70, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NPOPSS', fund_no='20DSHJ01', fund_sponsor='National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85134732794', doi='10.1007/s10664-022-10184-9', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Testing research software: a survey', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Eisty N.U.', afid='60279430;60119594', affilname='College of Engineering;Department of Computer Science', affiliation_city='Boise;Tuscaloosa', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='2', author_names='Eisty, Nasir U.;Carver, Jeffrey C.', author_ids='57205738954;12446411300', author_afids='60279430;60119594', coverDate='2022-11-01', coverDisplayDate='November 2022', publicationName='Empirical Software Engineering', issn='13823256', source_id='18650', eIssn='15737616', aggregationType='Journal', volume='27', issueIdentifier='6', article_number='138', pageRange=None, description='Background: Research software plays an important role in solving real-life problems, empowering scientific innovations, and handling emergency situations. Therefore, the correctness and trustworthiness of research software are of absolute importance. Software testing is an important activity for identifying problematic code and helping to produce high-quality software. However, testing of research software is difficult due to the complexity of the underlying science, relatively unknown results from scientific algorithms, and the culture of the research software community. Aims: The goal of this paper is to better understand current testing practices, identify challenges, and provide recommendations on how to improve the testing process for research software development. Method: We surveyed members of the research software developer community to collect information regarding their knowledge about and use of software testing in their projects. Results: We analysed 120 responses and identified that even though research software developers report they have an average level of knowledge about software testing, they still find it difficult due to the numerous challenges involved. However, there are a number of ways, such as proper training, that can improve the testing process for research software. Conclusions: Testing can be challenging for any type of software. This difficulty is especially present in the development of research software, where software engineering activities are typically given less attention.

Objective: This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question “How to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?”. Method: We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers published between 2015 and 2020, covering topics related to the certification of ML systems. In total, we identified 217 papers covering topics considered to be the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness, Uncertainty, Explainability, Verification, Safe Reinforcement Learning, and Direct Certification. We analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries of the papers extracted. Results: The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of ML models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between academia and industries to deepen the domain study. Finally, it also illustrated the necessity to build connections between the above mentioned main pillars that are for now mainly studied separately.

Background: Previous research on collaborative learning space in the collaborative computer education context with the focus on the group formation, gender aspect, and analysis of on-task actions. Research Questions: Do different table shapes have different effects on open-ended computer education on-task actions for different groups sizes (two and three participants) and for different genders? Methodology: In order to study a collaborative problem-solving activity that is based on creating a prototype of a responsive toy, two main conditions were examined: table shape (round or rectangular) and how this interacts with group size (two or three participants) and gender. University students were engaged in design tasks conducted in small groups following the Jigsaw pattern. Findings: Results show that students engage more in interaction with physical artifacts when collaboration is conducted in dyads. In terms of gender, the analysis shows a tendency of female students to engage more when the activity is conducted in dyads.

Transdisciplinary Engineering (TE) seeks to integrate knowledge and understanding to reduce the negative effect of engineering innovation on the environment and society, thus there likely exists a natural synergy between Industry 5.0 and TE. Consequently, in this paper we seek to understand what the opportunities and challenges of the emergence of Industry 5.0 might be for the field of TE now and in the future. A workshop involving multidisciplinary experts was convened to brainstorm and then explore perceptions. Opportunities include new research areas and potential access to funding. Challenges center on the extent that TE could, or should, align itself with Industry 5.0, and the lack of consensus around definitions of TE. Conclusions find that to attract funding, the community should clearly articulate how TE differs from complimentary and overlapping fields such as interdisciplinarity and systems engineering.\", authkeywords='Future of engineering | Industry 5.0 | Transdisciplinary Engineering', citedby_count=3, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='EPSRC', fund_no='EP/V062042/1', fund_sponsor='Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85148638313', doi='10.1145/3572549.3572572', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research is formalized curiosity: Use of technology in the classroom is that enough virtual reality project', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Audiffred-Hinojosa A.', afid='60007966', affilname='Tecnológico de Monterrey', affiliation_city='Monterrey', affiliation_country='Mexico', author_count='3', author_names='Audiffred-Hinojosa, Arlette;Pantoja-Bedolla, Fernando Pantoja Bedolla;Miranda-Leal, Sandra', author_ids='57393352600;58112704600;57566525500', author_afids='60007966;60007966;60007966', coverDate='2022-10-28', coverDisplayDate='28 October 2022', publicationName='ACM International Conference Proceeding Series', issn=None, source_id='11600154611', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='139-143', description=\"There is always concern about the way technology is use in the classroom and if it really help the students learning process, some class could still be just learning concepts and remembering information with the use of a learning platform LMS to support teaching, in some cases consistent in using applications like Kahoot, Mentimeter, Quizlet, etc. with the sole porpoise of creating quizzes and exams, there are so many misconception about using technology in the classroom like that the use of it is solely for sciences classes, that a considerable investment in equipment has to be done, and that the teacher implementing it has to be a tech savvy.

One superior mechanism is the spin-orbit torque (SOT) associated with spin currents generated by charge currents in a material with strong spin-orbit coupling. A higher SOT efficiency (i.e., a higher charge-to-spin conversion efficiency) is crucial for low-power SOT device operation. Therefore, materials possessing the merit of a high SOT are urgently desired for the innovation of SOT devices. Among all of the SOT materials, topological materials such as topological insulators and topological semimetals have attracted considerable attention recently because of their nontrivial band structures with strong spin-orbit coupling and expected giant SOT. Therefore, topological materials are regarded as promising candidates for future energy-efficient device applications. However, research in the area of topological material-based spintronics is still in an early stage, and the related physical, material and device issues still need to be addressed. In this Account, we review our recent progress regarding the charge-to-spin conversion and SOT-driven magnetization switching using the emerging topological materials, with an emphasis on topological insulators and Weyl semimetals. First, we introduce the extraordinary physical features of single-layer topological insulators associated with electron transport, charge-spin interconversion, and unique spin textures and subsequently present our SOT results for topological materials mainly for Bi2Se3. This material shows pronounced SOT with the in-plane and out-of-plane component due to the spin momentum locking and hexagonal warping effect, respectively. The SOT can be efficiently modulated by varying the film crystal directions or by interface engineering between Bi2Se3and a ferromagnet. Thereafter, room-temperature magnetization switching by the electron-mediated or magnon-mediated spin torque is demonstrated in topological insulator-based devices, and the switching current density JCis on the order of ∼105A/cm2, which is approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that in heavy metals. Second, we summarize our SOT results in Weyl semimetals. Due to the broken crystal symmetry, Weyl semimetals (e.g., WTe2) can show an additional sizable out-of-plane spin polarization, which can be detected by electrical and optical techniques. Therefore, the Weyl semimetals can possess unconventional out-of-plane damping-like SOT, which will facilitate the field-free magnetization switching. The interface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is observed in Weyl semimetal/ferromagnet heterostructures, which can affect the domain wall motion. We also demonstrate the energy-efficient SOT-induced magnetization switching in Weyl semimetal-based devices. Third, we discuss the advances in SOT devices with wafer-scale topological materials prepared by industry-compatible techniques such as magnetron sputtering and chemical vapor deposition.

Examples of this residue, which obstructs innovation, include sequence, separated poorly interfaced phases, closed windows, premature overspecification, and prioritising procedure over design quality. Creative studio-based practices avoid these by coalescing concurrent unique progressions of design work that deliver unexpected innovations through generous creative confidence. Despite continuous empirical confirmation of the effectiveness of lightly managed creative practices, they remain unattractive within engineering fields that value control, measurement, systematic rigour, certainty, and predictability of outcomes and resources. A reluctance to relax on these values and accept trust, vision, opportunistic confidence, uncertainty, and unpredictability is understandable. Despite the highly creative insights and framings that underpin outstanding science and engineering work, scientific values focus more on validation than on conception and imagination. We need to complement scientific and engineering values with proven studio-based creative practices. This involves accepting multi-perspective concurrent engineering practices that are progressed by strategic vision, continuous connections across perspectives, critical reflection, and systematic tracking of the status of design work.

Hence, it is urgent that the financial system develops and becomes innovative, especially for a developing country like China. Existing literature mainly explores the influencing factors of green innovation from the environmental regulation, economic growth and government subsidies perspective. However, few papers critically study how digital finance influences green innovations. To explore the internal influencing mechanism of digital finance on the quantity and quality of green technology innovation, panel data of 271 prefecture-level cities from 2011 to 2019 in China is used. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical research, we get the following conclusions. First, digital finance can improve the quantity and quality of green technological innovation, which has become a significant driving force for green innovations in China. The results are still robust after the endogeneity tests. Second, the results of heterogeneous analysis indicate that the different dimensions of digital finance can improve green innovations. They include breadth of coverage, depth of use, and degree of digitization. The positive effect of digital finance is most substantial in eastern cities, followed by central cities, and weakest in western cities. Third, digital finance indirectly improves green innovation mainly by alleviating financing constraints.

Is this truly a sustainable solution? Could it be misused or even abused? What will the future be like, with this innovation in it? Or, at a larger scale, what could a world be like, hundreds of years from now, given the speed of technological advance that we have today? What might happen if this technology - computer science, biotech, mechanical engineering, nanotech, medicine, space travel, all of it - goes haywire? Tales from Corrodia is my way of exploring these issues. On the surface it is art; macro photographs of rust and grime combined with short texts describing what I see in the image. Below the surface, it is a discussion on technology and its place in the future, a story about use, misuse and misunderstanding of tech and science. See the full collection on Instagram, #talesfromcorrodia. Together, the fictions about Corrodian life form a compelling speculative fiction. Corrodia is a place full of mystery and wonder, but also danger. Throughout its desolated lands, artifacts from more prosperous times are scattered, some of which are useful, some of which are just alien. Biomodified beings roam the lands as a testament of ancient breeding experiments. Semi-sentient mechanical creatures can be found here and there, albeit most of them have broken down over the ages. Several different people, races and sentient species live side by side and just like in the here-and-now some live rural low-tech lives whereas others have access to very advanced technology. Overseeing it all is the secretive Order, having access to what is seemingly magic ... or? Corrodia is not our world - but our world could become like Corrodia. There are several ways to work with speculative fictions. One can start with a speculative fiction as inspiration and design for it ([1], [2]), and then use the designs to drive discussion or provoke thoughts. Or, one can use speculative fictions in themselves as a discussion tool for participatory design or decision making (e.g. [3], [4], [5]). In my classes, we instead start out with the already existing Corrodian artifacts as inspiration. Then we back-cast them into our near-present, asking ourselves what they were from the beginning, before centuries of abandonment and tinkering skewed them into what they have become in Corrodia. What was the original use, and which underlying motivations or needs might have driven the development of such a thing? Students create these near-future design concepts which then become speculative designs in themselves, asking \"Are we close to designing something similar soon or even now, and if so, what might the consequences be?\"The exercise forms the basis for in-depth discussions on how technology might be used, misused, misunderstood or even abused over time, and it gives students and other designers a thinking tool for considering their own future designs, namely the question: How will this end up in Corrodia?', authkeywords='critical design | critique | design fiction | design teaching | Speculative design | speculative fiction', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85140270305', doi='10.1680/jensu.22.09999', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Briefing: Rethinking urban infrastructure from an ecological perspective in a post-Covid-19 world', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Mell I.', afid='60003771', affilname='The University of Manchester', affiliation_city='Manchester', affiliation_country='United Kingdom', author_count='1', author_names='Mell, Ian', author_ids='36134836500', author_afids='60003771', coverDate='2022-10-08', coverDisplayDate='8 October 2022', publicationName='Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Engineering Sustainability', issn='14784629', source_id='144700', eIssn='17517680', aggregationType='Journal', volume='176', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='57-60', description='Urban areas continue to change in response to climatic, engineering and socio-economic changes.

To achieve this, engineers, planners, architects and the environment sector should work more effectively to exchange knowledge, share best practice and create new practices that align engineered solutions with environmentally focussed design and management. It also requires a more nuanced appreciation of the elemental and thematic understandings of urban nature, which are often absent from development plans.

To cope, engineers produce what I call innovation narratives to describe how obstacles to climate adaptation are created by combinations of neocolonial empire, shapeshifting ecologies, inconsistent maintenance programs, and fiscal debt. At the same time, their efforts signal an emerging global politics of credibility that is reinforced by desires for more inclusive forms of governance rather than brute power or capitalization.\", authkeywords='climate adaptation | cultures of engineering | Guyana | historical time | innovation | knowledge economies | soil erosion', citedby_count=1, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr='EC', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='European Commission'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85139177280', doi='10.1145/3555228.3555272', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title=\"MO-DM Tool: Improving teams' engagement with Motivation-Oriented Decision-Making\", subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Neto A.M.B.', afid='60031482', affilname='Universidade Federal de Pernambuco', affiliation_city='Recife', affiliation_country='Brazil', author_count='3', author_names='Neto, Alvaro Magnum Barbosa;Carvalho, Emmanuel;Bandeira, MarcíLio', author_ids='57913246600;57195315095;57913246700', author_afids='60031482;60031482;60031482', coverDate='2022-10-05', coverDisplayDate='5 October 2022', publicationName='ACM International Conference Proceeding Series', issn=None, source_id='11600154611', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='88-94', description='A significant part of Software Engineering students\\' academic and professional life involves working on projects in collaboration with their peers.

This view makes it possible to identify which students are more susceptible to being demotivated and disengaged in each step, and actions can be performed to mitigate these effects. Teams can make more engaging and motivating choices by picking the ones that will positively affect most of the group, enhancing the chances of successful projects.

Women's support and inspiration were shared, and some men reported being touched by the subject and diligently are deconstructing their prejudice and misconceptions about women in technology. There are also difficulties. It is common to see only one woman in teams or just a few. More than that, no other gender than men and women, so the white, cisgender man is the pattern most of the time.

The test is carried out under construction of Bahar Shiraz station of Tehran Metro Line 6 at the depth of 30 m. The hammer generates a shear wave, and after amplification, the received signals are measured with the software. The shear wave velocity at the test site is obtained at 504 m/s. The result compared to Vs reported geotechnical investigation done by “Darya-Khak-Pey consulting engineers” for Metro line 6 shows a 10% deviation. It is suggested to conduct more comparative tests to check the results and calibrate. Using an 801-S sensor with more life span (of more than 60 million times) and the ability to connect to the internet with an Arduino board is the innovation applied to introduce a new generation of this tool in the engineering world.\", authkeywords='801-S Sensor | Flat Dilatometer | Geo-technics | In-situ Test | Shear Wave Velocity', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85145687876', doi='10.18280/isi.270513', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A Model for Countering the Information and Technical Threats of Intellectual Capital Management of Innovation-Oriented Systems in the Engineering Sector', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Yemelyanov V.', afid='60087519;60080765;60030043;129047634', affilname='Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University;Lviv Polytechnic National University;Ukrainian Academy of Printing;Kyiv Cooperative Institute of Business and Law', affiliation_city='Mykolaiv;Lviv;Lviv;Kiev', affiliation_country='Ukraine;Ukraine;Ukraine;Ukraine', author_count='5', author_names='Yemelyanov, Volodymyr;Nikonenko, Uliana;Sytnyk, Yosyf;Okhrimenko, Ihor;Shulga, Anastasia', author_ids='57210795531;57190253856;36176543000;58043931800;58044299100', author_afids='60087519;60030043;60080765;129047634;60087519', coverDate='2022-10-01', coverDisplayDate='October 2022', publicationName=\"Ingenierie des Systemes d'Information\", issn='16331311', source_id='21100202935', eIssn='21167125', aggregationType='Journal', volume='27', issueIdentifier='5', article_number=None, pageRange='799-806', description='The modern economy is characterized by a sharp increase in the role of non-material factors (information and knowledge) in ensuring the competitiveness of individual enterprises and institutions, as well as national economies as a whole.

The main purpose of the study is to model the counteraction to the main threats of intellectual capital for innovation-oriented systems in the engineering sector of the economy. The relevance of the study is given by the fact that the formation and use of technical, economic, industrial, and other types of knowledge, the totality of which forms intellectual capital, is becoming an urgent problem for modern systems tuned to innovative development. The threats to managing the intellectual capital of innovation-oriented systems are now the most significant, since the achievement of the ultimate goals of the system itself depends on the efficiency of the use of intellectual capital. Taking this into account, intellectual capital is becoming a real and valuable target of criminal encroachments today, which requires scientists to form a clear model for countering these goals. The research methodology involves the use of mathematical methods of information support for the process of counteracting the negative impact of threats. According to the results of the study, we presented the modeling process. As a result, a model was built to counteract the main threats of intellectual capital for innovation-oriented systems in the engineering sector of the economy.

This scoping review investigated what is known about STEM, STEAM and makerspace experiences and opportunities for children aged birth to eight. The review found that early childhood experience with STEM, STEAM and makerspaces is an emerging field of research. Findings suggest that STEAM holds more relevance to learning and experiences in the early childhood years, and perhaps across the lifespan. The review also highlights the need to shift the starting point to the earliest of years and create greater intentionality in STEAM experiences with infants, toddlers and preschool aged children, recognizing the relevance of STEAM and maker mindsets in the lives of young children. Additionally, the scoping review identified the value of informal and community contexts as a means to invite broader participation.

Inspired by the current two main research directions of weak fault diagnosis of rolling bearing, that is, the enhancement of impulse features of faulty vibration signal through vibration analysis and the selection of fault information sensitive frequency band for further envelope spectrum analysis, and based on the second-order cyclostationary characteristic of the vibration signal of faulty bearing, a two-stage method for weak feature extraction of rolling bearing combining cyclic Wiener filter with improved enhanced envelope spectrum (IEES) is proposed in the paper. Firstly, the original vibration signal of the rolling bearing’s early weak fault is handled by cyclic Wiener filter exploiting the spectral coherence (SCoh) theory and the noise components are filtered out. Then, SCoh is applied on the filtered signal. Subsequently, an IEES method obtained by integrating over the selected fault information sensitive spectral frequency band of the SCoh spectral is used to extract the fault features. The innovation of the proposed method is to fully excavate the advantages of cyclic Wiener filter and IEES simultaneously. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by simulation firstly, and vibration signals collected from accelerated bearing degradation tests and engineering machines are used to further verify its effectiveness.

The disorderly expansion of residential areas in Pinggu District, Beijing, China has led to the erosion of high-quality cultivated land in the region and the advantages of mountain resources have not been fully utilized in this area. Therefore, Pinggu District was selected as the research area. Using the spatial analysis function in GIS, this paper uses the comprehensive correction method of the per capita construction land standard and the neighborhood substitution method to analyze the quantitative potential of rural settlements to supplement cultivated land and the qualitative grade of cultivated land after arrangement. A combination of exclusion matrices are employed to identify the spatial and temporal arrangements of rural settlements. The research shows that the effective cultivated land area of rural settlements in Pinggu District is 514.24 ha, and the coefficient of increasing cultivated land is 9.25%. Rural residential areas in the district are divided into priority sorting area, key sorting area, moderate sorting area, and restricted sorting area; they account for 18.13%, 21.10%, 20.85%, and 39.93% of the total area, respectively.

Therefore, this study proposes a methodology to apply evolutionary benefits in the 37 trend lines developed by TRIZ researchers to assist in intelligently screening relevant patents applicable to the content of the product design. In such a way, the efficiency of problem solving and product design quality may be improved more effectively. First, the patent database is used as the training dataset, words and sentences in the patent documents are analyzed through natural language processing to obtain keywords that may be related to evolutionary benefits.

For this reason, tissue engineering strategies have been developed as alternative solutions to this problem. This research sought to create a cellular scaffold with an intricate and complex network of interconnected pores and microchannels using salt leaching and additive manufacturing (3D printing) methods that mimic the hierarchical internal structure of the bone. A biocompatible hydrogel film (based on poly-ethylene glycol) was used to cover the surface of different polymeric scaffolds. This thin film was then exposed to various stimuli to spontaneously form wrinkled micropatterns, with the aim of increasing the contact area and the material’s biocompatibility. The main innovation of this study was to include these wrinkled micropatterns on the surface of the scaffold by taking advantage of thin polymer film surface instabilities. On the other hand, salt and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) particles were included in the polymeric matrix to create a modified filament for 3D printing. The printed part was leached to eliminate porogen particles, leaving homogenously distributed pores on the structure. The pores have a mean size of 26.4 ± 9.9 μm, resulting in a global scaffold porosity of ~42% (including pores and microchannels). The presence of nHA particles, which display a homogeneous distribution according to the FE-SEM and EDX results, have a slight influence on the mechanical resistance of the material, but incredibly, despite being a bioactive compound for bone cells, did not show a significant increase in cell viability on the scaffold surface. However, the synergistic effect between the presence of the hydrogel and the pores on the material does produce an increase in cell viability compared to the control sample and the bare PCL material.', authkeywords='additive manufacturing | ATRP synthesis | bone scaffold | salt leaching | wrinkled micropatterns', citedby_count=8, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='MCIU', fund_no='VRID FAI 21/17', fund_sponsor='Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85139571233', doi='10.1371/journal.pone.0275498', pii=None, pubmed_id='36191027', title='Environmental regulation, R&D investment, and green technology innovation in China: Based on the PVAR model', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zhang Y.', afid='60013268', affilname='Taiyuan University of Technology', affiliation_city='Taiyuan', affiliation_country='China', author_count='3', author_names='Zhang, Yueting;Chen, Huaichao;He, Zhimin', author_ids='57811517000;57220058571;57811301600', author_afids='60013268;60013268;60013268', coverDate='2022-10-01', coverDisplayDate='October 2022', publicationName='PLoS ONE', issn=None, source_id='10600153309', eIssn='19326203', aggregationType='Journal', volume='17', issueIdentifier='10 October', article_number='e0275498', pageRange=None, description='The unreasonable economic development model of human beings has caused the environmental pollution problem to become increasingly serious. In order to achieve a positive relationship and interaction between environmental regulation, research and development (R&D) investment, and green technology innovation, and effectively solve the “strange circle” problem between high-quality economic development and environmental pollution in China and even the world, this paper takes the panel data of industrial enterprises above designated size in Chinese mainland 31 provinces from 2009 to 2019 as a research sample. The comprehensive index of R&D investment and green technology innovation was established by the entropy method, and the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model was constructed from the dynamic endogenous perspective, and the dynamic interaction and regional heterogeneity between environmental regulation, R&D investment, and green technology innovation were empirically analyzed by using impulse response function and variance decomposition. We obtain the following findings: (1) Environmental regulation has a two-way interaction relationship with R&D investment and green technology innovation, and R&D investment has a promotion effect on the “green degree” of technological innovation, but its role is still weak and has lagging characteristics. (2) There is significant regional heterogeneity in the dynamic responses of the eastern, central and western parts of China. (3) In the long run, environmental regulation has a “negative crowding out effect” on R&D investment in the central region, and the phenomenon of “central collapse” still exists but will gradually weaken. Environmental regulation has a “positive innovation compensation effect” on green technology innovation. Green technology innovation and R&D investment have an obvious “Pareto improvement” effect on environmental regulation, especially in the eastern region.

To fill this research gap, firstly, we conduct a comprehensive analysis from the micro-level technology composition perspective of patent documents and the macro-level technology association perspective of patent data involved in the technology field, and then we design a novel patent ontology that includes the entity of patent, function, solution and application field. Secondly, we create a patent heterogeneous network with the help of the proposed patent ontology and the technology association. Finally, to fully use the patent technology characteristics, we develop a heterogeneous graph embedding algorithm to embed this information into the patent representation, and the experiments done on non-perfluorinated proton exchange membrane patent data show that our method produces better patent representation than the comparable models.

The field of learning analytics (LA) has emerged over the last decade at the intersection of data science, learning sciences, human-centered and instructional design, and organizational change, and so could in principle inform how data can be gathered and analyzed in ways that support professional learning. However, in contrast to formal education where most research in LA has been conducted, much work-integrated learning is experiential, social, situated, and practice-bound. Supporting such learning exposes a significant weakness in LA research, and to make sense of this gap, this article proposes an adaptation of the Knowledge-Agency Window framework. It draws attention to how different forms of professional learning locate on the dimensions of learner agency and knowledge creation. Specifically, we argue that the concept of 'reframing oneself' holds particular relevance for informal, work-integrated learning. To illustrate how this insight translates into LA design for professionals, three examples are provided: first, analyzing personal and team skills profiles (skills analytics); second, making sense of challenging workplace experiences (reflective writing analytics); and third, reflecting on orientation to learning (dispositional analytics).

The goal is to ensure that water quality in Europe meets good ecological status by 2027. Whilst the WFD has been hailed as a cornerstone for governance innovation in water management, most EU member states (MS) still struggle to achieve good ecological status of their waters. The realignment to a multi-level governance structure under the WFD is discretionary, and has generated diversity in WFD multi-level governance implementation approaches and final governance arrangements across MS. This diversity may contribute to low goal achievement and weak compliance. This paper investigates how visual impressions of legislative structure across nine MS can illustrate and contribute to understanding the differences in multi-level implementation of WFD and associated water protection directives. We explore, in-depth, the drivers of visual differences in Portugal, Germany (Lower Saxony) and France. We hypothesise that many of the challenges of WFD implementation, and resulting governance arrangements can be explained in terms of the legacy effects of previous water governance choices. With this conceptual framework of investigating the history and legacy, we found the three in depth studies have had different starting points, paths, and end points in their water governance, with sticking points influencing the decision-making processes and compliance required by the WFD. Sticking points include the complexity of existing water governance structures, lobbying by different sectors, and the mandatory WFD timeline for implementation. Portugal had to resolve its focus on water infrastructure and engineering to enable a re-focus on water quality. France and Portugal experienced ‘top down’ governance at different points in time, slowing the shift to a multi-level governance system. Lower Saxony, representing just one of 16 federal state systems in Germany, highlighted the complex historic governance structures which cannot easily be restructured, generating a layering effect where new governance systems are fitted to old governance systems. We conclude that there is a need to implement a hybrid approach to water governance and WFD implementation including decentralisation (discretionary) to ensure collaboration and engagement of stakeholders at the local level. This hybrid governance system should run in parallel with a centralised (mandatory) governance and regulatory system to enable national environmental standards to be set and enforced. Such systems may provide the best of both worlds (bottom-up involvement of stakeholders meeting top-down goal achievements) and is worthy of further research.', authkeywords='Compliance | Diffuse water pollution from agriculture | Governance arrangements | Policy implementation | River basin approach | Sticking points | Water quality', citedby_count=12, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='EC', fund_no='727984', fund_sponsor='Horizon 2020'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85133391834', doi='10.1111/imcb.12568', pii=None, pubmed_id='35748687', title='Gender inequities in medical research funding is driving an exodus of women from Australian STEMM academia', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Borger J.G.', afid='60026553;60019578;60002813', affilname=\"University of Melbourne;Monash University;St Vincent's Institute\", affiliation_city='Melbourne;Melbourne;Fitzroy', affiliation_country='Australia;Australia;Australia', author_count='2', author_names='Borger, Jessica G.;Purton, Louise E.', author_ids='54382736400;6701515104', author_afids='60019578;60002813-60026553', coverDate='2022-10-01', coverDisplayDate='October 2022', publicationName='Immunology and Cell Biology', issn='08189641', source_id='20823', eIssn='14401711', aggregationType='Journal', volume='100', issueIdentifier='9', article_number=None, pageRange='674-678', description='Universally, women are under-represented in senior academic leadership in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM).

In this algorithm, the local and global search sections of its parent algorithms, are separated, and then based on a new indexing method in each iteration, according to the current population indexing, a global search and a local search are selected from the processes of its parent algorithms, and then the current population is updated with two selected sections. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving well-known standard benchmark problems and in solving real-world engineering problems have been tested and validated by statistical tools. The results of the research study show that the proposed algorithm can provide very effective results compared to other competing algorithms as well as its parent algorithms in many tests. The results show that the proper combination of optimisation algorithm processes can be used as a technique to design more powerful algorithms to solve global optimisation problems, especially complex real-world problems.', authkeywords='combination in meta-heuristic algorithms | improving meta-heuristic strategies | indexing in meta-heuristic algorithms | indexing meta-heuristic processes | performance indices and evaluation', citedby_count=0, openaccess=1, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85128704352', doi='10.1111/ijmr.12297', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Bringing together the whats and hows in the service innovation literature: An integrative framework', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Kurtmollaiev S.', afid='60111756;60111747;60025233', affilname='Kristiania University College;University of South-Eastern Norway;NHH Norwegian School of Economics', affiliation_city='Oslo;Kongsberg;Bergen', affiliation_country='Norway;Norway;Norway', author_count='2', author_names='Kurtmollaiev, Seidali;Pedersen, Per Egil', author_ids='57200184666;8088878200', author_afids='60111756-60025233;60025233-60111747', coverDate='2022-10-01', coverDisplayDate='October 2022', publicationName='International Journal of Management Reviews', issn='14608545', source_id='20037', eIssn='14682370', aggregationType='Journal', volume='24', issueIdentifier='4', article_number=None, pageRange='625-653', description='The concept of service has gone through both evolutionary and revolutionary changes, but this has had little effect on the way reviews portray service innovation research.

This integrative framework can assist with defining research questions and designing innovation studies, as well as selecting approaches to managing innovation. We also argue that the main obstacles to the progress of service innovation research are lexical cross-contamination, parallelism in approaches, the gravity of the new service development perspective and the legacy of new product development.

However, due to the dual complexity of MMNC systems and tribological process, the anti-friction and anti-wear mechanisms are unclear, and the subsequent tribological performance prediction and design of MMNCs are not easily possible: A critical up-to-date review is needed for MMNCs in tribology. This review systematically summarized the fabrication, manufacturing, and processing techniques for high-quality MMNC bulk and surface coating materials in tribology. Then, important factors determining the tribological performance (mainly anti-friction evaluation by the coefficient of friction (CoF) and anti-wear assessment with wear rate) in MMNCs have been investigated thoroughly, and the correlations have been analyzed to reveal their potential coupling/synergetic roles of tuning tribological behavior of MMNCs. Most importantly, this review combined the classical metal/alloy friction and wear theories and adapted them to give a (semi-)quantitative description of the detailed mechanisms of improved anti-friction and anti-wear performance in MMNCs. To guarantee the universal applications of these mechanisms, their links with the analyzed influencing factors (e.g., loading forces) and characteristic features like tribo-film have been clarified. This approach forms a solid basis for understanding, predicting, and engineering MMNCs’ tribological behavior, instead of pure phenomenology and experimental observation. Later, the pathway to achieve a broader application for MMNCs in tribo-related fields like smart materials, biomedical devices, energy storage, and electronics has been concisely discussed, with the focus on the potential development of modeling, experimental, and theoretical techniques in MMNCs’ tribological processes. In general, this review tries to elucidate the complex tribo-performances of MMNCs in a fundamentally universal yet straightforward way, and the discussion and summary in this review for the tribological performance in MMNCs could become a useful supplementary to and an insightful guidance for the current MMNC tribology study, research, and engineering innovations.

Presently, sustainability has become one of the targets all over the world, especially the Egyptian strategy that focuses more on women’s empowerment as human capital. There is a positive trend among organizations, governments and communities to focus more on the lead of sustainability in all our daily activities and business activities. Design/methodology/approach: Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to gather data from 100 engineers (50 women and 50 men) employees of Egyptian factories and industries located in Egypt. To analyze, the collected data, regression analysis and correlation coefficient were employed to examine the study objectives and questions. A statistical Package for Social Sciences has been used for data analysis. Findings: Results reveal that there is a direct positive relationship between women as a capital and sustainable development with its four interrelated pillars (economic, social, environmental and education) in a positive and significant way and the three factors of Human Capital (leadership and motivation, qualifications and satisfaction and creativity). Research limitations/implications: The findings only apply to the sample (engineering women, men) that has participated in the questionnaire in the Egyptian factories. More research would be recommended in terms of further research study, highlighting the role of women in other categories in the STEM field as they are the human capital crucial for sustainable development and highlighting its impact on the Egyptian sustainable strategy 2030. Practical implications: Although the Egyptian strategy reinforces gender equality and gaining more roles for women in the Egyptian community, there is still absence of women in factories and science. Based on the findings, there are three concerns that must be addressed: First, opportunities need to be embedded in the factories for more women, especially in engineering categories. Second, authorities must encourage human capital development for women. Third, there is a strong need to create responsible leadership between all human capitals which are especially important in areas of industry. Social implications: Egyptian factories need to support women’s enthusiasm for innovation, continuously advance science and engineering, foster a business environment that fosters the coexistence of science and technology, the economy and society, support enterprise transformation and optimize the industrial structure of Egyptian industry. Simultaneously, it should encourage and promote the transformation of female achievements and strengthen the role of women leadership enterprises in Egyptian society. In order to promote the ideas of women, more money must be spent on scientific research, human capital must be allocated more effectively and fresh momentum for sustainable economic growth must be generated. It must expand training investment, encourage high-quality human capital and remove the bottleneck. Originality/value: This paper is unique in presenting women as human capital in Egyptian society and reflects its impact on sustainable development pillars.

At the same time, periodontium, the site of periodontal pathologies, is an extraordinarily complex plexus of soft and hard tissues, the regeneration of which using even the most advanced forms of tissue engineering continues to be a challenge. Nanotechnologies, meanwhile, have provided exquisite tools for producing biomaterials and pharmaceutical formulations capable of elevating the efficacies of standard pharmacotherapies and surgical approaches to whole new levels. A bibliographic analysis provided here demonstrates a continuously increasing research output of studies on the use of nanotechnologies in the management of periodontal disease, even when they are normalized to the total output of studies on periodontitis. The great majority of biomaterials used to tackle periodontitis, including those that pioneered this interesting field, have been polymeric. In this article, a chronological review of polymeric nanotechnologies for the treatment of periodontitis is provided, focusing on the major conceptual innovations since the late 1990s, when the first nanostructures for the treatment of periodontal diseases were fabricated. In the opening sections, the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontitis and the anatomical and histological characteristics of the periodontium are being described, along with the general clinical manifestations of the disease and the standard means of its therapy. The most prospective chemistries in the design of polymers for these applications are also elaborated. It is concluded that the amount of innovation in this field is on the rise, despite the fact that most studies are focused on the refinement of already established paradigms in tissue engineering rather than on the development of revolutionary new concepts.', authkeywords='Alveolar bone | Cementum | Drug delivery | Gingiva | Guided tissue regeneration | Nanoparticles | Periodontal ligament', citedby_count=18, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85142277027', doi='10.1088/1755-1315/1081/1/012040', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Barrel Distortion Correction for Digital Optic-Based Motion Tracking in Ship Hydrodynamic Model Experiments', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Irawanto Z.', afid='60070707;128568457', affilname='Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember;National Agency for Research and Innovation', affiliation_city='Surabaya;Central Jakarta, Jakarta', affiliation_country='Indonesia;Indonesia', author_count='3', author_names='Irawanto, Z.;Ariana, I.

To cover a broader area of the trajectory, a wide-angle camera lens was utilized, consequently, the image recorded by the camera experienced a barrel distortion. As a reference for the measurements, gridlines spaced 2 meters apart were drawn on the floor of the basin. Using the grid pattern, the distortion was corrected by finding the relationship between the grid pattern in the object space and in the distorted image. A fourth-order polynomial regression was applied to solve the problem.

It is vital to monitor and keep track of damage in bridge structures as a result of multiple mechanical, environmental and traffic-induced factors.

Bridge health monitoring (BHM) has always been an active research area for engineers and stakeholders. While all monitoring techniques intend to provide accurate and decisive information on the remaining useful life, safety, integrity and serviceability of bridges, maintaining uninterrupted operation of a bridge relies strongly on understanding the development and propagation of damage. BHM methods have been extensively researched on bridges over the decades, and new methodologies have started to be used by domain experts, especially within the last decade. Emerging methods, as the products of technology advancements, have resulted in handy tools that have been quickly adopted by bridge engineers.

Nevertheless, the perspectives and creativity of women have been shown to contribute to important scientific discoveries. Visionary women have transformed the way we look at genetic information, from the groundbreaking work of Rosalind Franklin to understand DNA and RNA3 to the latest most exciting discoveries by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier to edit genes.4 Inspiring pioneers in computational chemistry include Mary Ann Mansigh Karlsen, who worked as a computer programmer with Berni Alder and Tom Wainwright in the early implementation of molecular dynamics in the midtwentieth century.5 As scientists, we know that diversity enhances creativity, and we should be excited about the prospect of creating new knowledge in a scientific environment that welcomes diversity. The American Chemical Society (ACS) is pursuing several activities to mentor and inspire the next generation of women. In particular, the computational chemistry community has been very active in supporting research, mentorship, and networking of young women. The “Women Make Computational Chemistry (COMP)” has been the first symposium dedicated to young women students and postdocs pulling together established women leaders in computational/theoretical chemistry and the next generation of young women scientists.6 “Women Make COMP” was tremendously successful among young women scientists who could recognize themselves in a strong supportive community. These difficulties can be even more severe for women of color, who also are experiencing the difficulties that women face in academia. These include difficulties in pursuing higher education, including social, economic, and cultural exclusions, which results in few women of color in academics. A study by Gretter et al.7 revealed that the lack of experience in computations and coding is dramatically affecting minority students, resulting in African Americans making up less than 9% of the science and engineering workforce. Despite these struggles, women of color have made impressive contributions to science and technology.9 Black women have been instrumental in winning the space race. Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson were three mathematicians of African American background, who worked as “human computers” at NASA during the space race. Katherine Johnson calculated rocket trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions8,9 but was not allowed to join meetings with men until her scientific skills were fully recognized. Dorothy Vaughan was a NASA pioneer who faced racial segregation and had to overcome prejudice, before becoming a leading scientist processing aeronautical research data.10 She was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal post-mortem. Mary Jackson was NASA’s first black female engineer,11 becoming a role model and championing women of color in STEM. In recognition of her contribution and effort to increase diversity, the Washington, DC headquarters of NASA has been renamed the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters. These extraordinary women show us the potential of women of color in science. THE CREATIVITY, TALENT, AND LATERAL THINKING, WITH RESPECT TO CANONICAL OPINIONS, OF WOMEN OF COLOR CAN TRANSFORM CONVENTIONS AND IDEAS, ULTIMATELY FOSTERING INNOVATION. Following the example of “Women Make COMP”, the ACS recently organized the “Black, Indigenous, and People of Color Make COMP” symposium, dedicated to Black, Latinx, and Native American young scientists. Established leaders with African American, Hispanic, and Native American backgrounds shared their career experiences and offered guidance. It was the first time that such a one-on-one mentorship was offered to young people of color in the field of computational/theoretical chemistry. This should be only the beginning of a long-term commitment of the scientific community, which should focus on measures we can take to overcome the hurdles that underrepresented minorities are facing in science. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Respect (DEIR) is a core value of the ACS. The cover of the DEIR issue of the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling is a handmade painting depicting a woman of color and her extraordinary brain power.

Using multi - level data from 404 science and engineering undergraduates of 100 science and technology innovation teams across 78 universities in China, we examine the independent and interactive effects of multi - level focused humility leadership on individual and team scientific creativity. The results show that: at the individual level, individual - focused humble leadership has a positive effect on individual scientific creativity, which is mediated by individual perspective taking. At the team level, team - focused humble leadership has a positive effect on team scientific creativity, and team perspective taking mediates this positive effect. Furthermore, team perspective taking constructs a cross - level situational factor, which not only moderates the effect of individual perspective taking on individual scientific creativity, but also moderates the indirect effect of individual - focused humble leadership on individual scientific creativity through individual perspective taking. The above effects are stronger when team perspective taking is high.

For this purpose, the accessible resources of the modern agriculture have been harnessed mainly through conventional genetics approaches in the past decades. Presently, the advent of state-of-the-art biotechnologies is addressing such field challenges for continuous ‘agricultural success’.

How to combine traditional mechanical model with modern mathematical methods to achieve quantitative research on this instability mechanism analysis is the theoretical innovation on vertical stability of drilling shaft lining structure and the research content of this paper as well. When the shaft suspended and sunk to the bottom of the well, a certain amount of elastic potential energy is accumulated. At this time, the state of stable equilibrium is dynamic, and the shaft may tilt, slip, or even lose stability., and strengthened monitoring and effective prevention is necessary. In this paper, based on the theory of catastrophe and the mechanics model of shaft wall suspension and subsidence, the total potential energy function and the cusp catastrophe model for vertical instability of shaft lining were established. According to the equilibrium surface and bifurcation point equation of the model, the quantitative determination conditions of the instability are given. The results show that the values of the control variables m and n directly determine the stable equilibrium state of the shaft wall. When Δ>0, the control variable (m,n) falls outside the bipartite point set, the system is located at the upper and lower blade of the equilibrium surface, and the shaft structure is in a stable equilibrium state. When Δ<0 the control variable (m,n) falls inside the bipartite point set, the system is located at the middle of the equilibrium surface, and the shaft structure is in an unstable equilibrium state. When Δ= 0, the control variable (m,n) falls on the boundary of the bipartite point set and the structure is in a critical stable equilibrium state. Furthermore, based on thecritical condition of stable equilibrium, the critical depth formula of vertical instability of shaft lining full and non-full water is established. At the same time, in order to popularize the engineering application of the catastrophic model analysis method, the flow chart of instability analysis and judgment is established by using Python language, which provides the theoretical basis for monitoring and forecasting and well type parameter optimization. Combined with an engineering example, it is found that the critical depth based on catastrophe theory in this paper is 0.396% and 7.15% different from those obtained by energy method respectively under full water and non-full water condition. Therefore, the study method of shaft lining structure stability based on catastrophe theory can effectively explain the vertical instability of shaft lining structure.', authkeywords='critical depth | cusp catastrophe theory | Phthon language | shaft lining instability | vertical instability', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85140045179', doi='10.12030/j.cjee.202111134', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Assessment of urban rainfall runoff technological readiness level improvement and challenges in technological development produced by “Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment”', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Qi F.', afid='60006782', affilname='Beijing Forestry University', affiliation_city='Beijing', affiliation_country='China', author_count='6', author_names='Qi, Fei;Chen, Miao;Wang, Zhenbei;Huangfu, Zizheng;Li, Chen;Sun, Dezhi', author_ids='35082538300;57224119560;56681510100;57931599100;57218490866;57206242377', author_afids='60006782;60006782;60006782;60006782;60006782;60006782', coverDate='2022-09-01', coverDisplayDate='September 2022', publicationName='Chinese Journal of Environmental Engineering', issn='16739108', source_id='21100287325', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='16', issueIdentifier='9', article_number=None, pageRange='3144-3156', description='This article carefully sorted out the key technologies of urban runoff pollution elimination researched or developed by the “National Science and Technology Major Project of China: Water Pollution Control and Treatment” in “Eleventh Five-Year Plan” and “Twelfth Five-Year Plan”.

Physics teaching is among those areas which have changed from its traditional methods during this period. The return to school during the ‘New Normal’ has resulted in certain concerns about students’ adaptability due to their possible lack of learning over this time. We analyse, in the current research, the transitions of three generations crossing several pandemic stages during their time participating in university physics courses during the first year, a common entry point for engineering programs. In addition, we analyse several academic traits as causal factors of academic success in order to understand how performance could be affected during online education and during the ‘New Normal’. The results highlight a general high level of adaptation for the most of the students, but still, some of them were affected in terms of the functioning of their learning styles or regarding their personality profiles.

Unfortunately, students often underestimate the importance of their courses as they do not perceive these courses’ practical applications in their future professional practice. In this study, we propose using blended learning spaces to develop new learning experiences in the context of a biomedical signals and systems analysis course to enhance students’ motivation and interest and the relevance of the materials learned. We created a learning experience based on wearable devices and cloud-based collaborative development environments such that the students turned daily-life scenarios into experiential learning spaces. Overall, our results suggest a positive impact on the students’ perceptions of their learning experience concerning relevance, motivation, and interest. Namely, the evidence shows a reduction in the variability of such perceptions. However, further research must confirm this potential impact.

Because of the prioritization of shared mobility solutions, more and more operators appear on the smart city markets, which is associated with many challenges related to the increased competition among service providers. One of the challenges is the appropriate visibility of the brand and vehicles in urban transport systems. This aspect, despite its high applicability, constitutes a research gap among world studies. Aiming to fill this gap, this article was dedicated to the issues of perception of visual communication by operators of shared mobility services. As part of the research, an expert study was conducted among representatives of shared mobility services operating in Poland. The expert survey was conducted with the Computer-Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) technique. The results of the research show that visual communication is not used quite correctly by operators. Although operators use single visual communication practices, overall consistency is lacking, which would add value to the brand.

Innovation is very important for the solution of cast-in-place concrete forms in practice today. Part of its innovative construction application is the possibility of using foam concrete in a composite structure and the use of its mechanical properties in the load-bearing parts of civil engineering structures. The method of detecting the mechanical properties of foam concrete by using non-standard cantilever test is also innovative. Here, an advanced approach of modelling specimens using powerful computational systems based on the finite element method is used. This modern material is researched especially for its use in transportation structures. For its application, it is necessary to define its resistance to mechanical loads. The main content of the research consists of correlations between experimental measurements and analytical and numerical results. This is the principle of quasi-linear identification of the non-linear behavior of polymeric cementitious porous material during tests on specimens. The focus of the research is an extensive experiment: measurements of the deformation of the specimens until failure. The following methods were chosen to investigate the material properties: small cantilever test, standard tensile test and compression test. The cantilever test was performed for the individual components of the FC500 composite and cement concrete, but also as a compact composite. Numerical simulation models were developed to correlate the individual results in order to validate the uniaxial test results. The conclusions of the research led to the definition of standardized stress–strain diagrams of the FC500 material for compression and especially tension. This is a definition of the behavior of this polymer composite, usable for the development of numerical models of full-scale structures.

Pharmaceutically active molecules with low solubility convey a higher risk of failure for drug innovation and development. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and several other parameters, such as drug distribution, protein binding and absorption, are majorly affected by their solubility. Among all pharmaceutical dosage forms, oral dosage forms cover more than 50%, and the drug molecule should be water-soluble. For good therapeutic activity by the drug molecule on the target site, solubility and bioavailability are crucial factors. The pharmaceutical industry’s screening programs identified that around 40% of new chemical entities (NCEs) face various difficulties at the formulation and development stages. These pharmaceuticals demonstrate less solubility and bioavailability. Enhancement of the bioavailability and solubility of drugs is a significant challenge in the area of pharmaceutical formulations.

The research results of PVAR (Panel Vector Autoregressive) model further prove this dynamic and continuous positive promotion. The threshold regression results indicate that with the improvement of green finance, there is a non-linear relationship between RETI and industrial structure. In areas where green finance is relatively low, RETI can inhibit the upgrading of industrial structure. When the degree of green finance development is relatively high, the influence of RETI on industrial structure is remarkably positive. Heterogeneity analysis shows that in eastern China, renewable energy technological innovation has significantly promoted the industrial structure upgrading.

To address this gap, this paper employs slacks-based dynamic network data envelopment analysis to calculate the overall, intertemporal, and divisional green technology innovation efficiency covering China's 30 provinces over 2012–2019. The results indicate that (1) a strong spatial dependence of efficiency scores exists, accounting for 60 % of the aggregate statistics. (2) China's overall scores are low, and inefficient regions need to improve efficiency by at least 31.41 % to become efficient. (3) Economically developed regions, provinces with advanced manufacturing, and nonresource-based areas have relatively high scores. (4) The period scores fluctuate greatly up and down around the overall scores, showing a significant spatial imbalance within consecutive multiple periods.

Specifically, engineering teams may benefit from reflexivity interventions to improve decision making, problem solving, innovation, and performance. In this study, we focus on team reflexivity in direct application to engineering project management to identify reflexivity processes that facilitate effective communication. Literature review: Although research has shown that team reflexivity interventions - elicited through communication - can improve team interaction and performance, little empirical evidence exists into the temporal dimensions across the action and transition phases of team reflexivity processes. Research questions: 1. How is team reflexivity expressed through text-based communication? 2. How and when do team members shift between reflexivity processes over time, especially across and between transition and action phases? Research methodology: We analyzed collaborative activity among 62 four-person teams in a computer-simulated microworld across two scenarios. The reflexivity processes exhibited during interaction were identified and analyzed using statistical and content analysis. Results and discussion: Analyses indicated that team reflection promoted discussions about key issues, facilitated frequent process shifts among transition and action phases, and resulted in overall better performance. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the importance of team reflexivity interventions in engineering project teams to strategically guide members to improve planning, responding, and quality of attention devoted to long-term outcomes.

One of the greatest challenges is the difficulty of modeling the highly complex interactions among the design variables, such as catalyst technology attributes, and greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the computational aids crucial to deal with the complexity of chemical processes require data that is either unavailable or uncertain at an early stage of design. The multistage integrated system for sustainable design proposed in this paper boosts these computational aids by applying data science techniques to allow uncertainty to be handled more efficiently, thereby facilitating the modeling of the interactions between the properties of new materials or processes and sustainability indicators. In this system, current data connectivity methods are used to find paths of correlation among catalysts properties and greenhouse gas emissions. The key feature of the proposed system relies on the integration through multiple stages of Fuzzy Inference systems and a data-driven technique for Emissions Analytics, FIEMA.1 The algorithm in FIEMA provides a semi-supervised learning approach to emission analytics: it determines data clusters by a C-means algorithm and subsequently builds fuzzy sets for multiple stages of input–output inference. The proposed FIEMA system was demonstrated in an effort to determine the optimal configurations of the properties of catalysts to minimize the probability of associated greenhouse gas emissions for a methanol production process. The results showed the potential of this approach to reduce the search space of catalyst material designs by suggesting promising configurations for oxygen storage capacity, mechanical strength, lifetime, size, and poisoning level.

The research addresses several areas of application, but there is a predominance of quantitatively based subfields of construction, such as estimation and cost control, logistics, planning, and scheduling. Future research should focus on developing holistic and process-oriented frameworks for projects to move from ambition to practice. Findings can inform the future development and implementation of AI in the construction industry context. For researchers, this study identifies areas in need of further attention and examines possibilities for future exploration of multidisciplinary approaches that combine construction engineering, project management, AI, and social science. For practitioners, the study highlights current trends and work within the field, providing an overview of the potential for pilot studies, tests, and innovations.', authkeywords='artificial intelligence | construction projects | literature review | scoping review', citedby_count=8, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85133473547', doi='10.1145/3505227', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='How Customer Demand Reactions Impact Technology Innovation and Security', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Lisa Yeo M.', afid='60154066;60135978;60134855;60005565', affilname='School of Engineering;Ohio University College of Business;Haskayne School of Business;California State Polytechnic University, Pomona', affiliation_city='Merced;Athens;Calgary;Pomona', affiliation_country='United States;United States;Canada;United States', author_count='4', author_names='Lisa Yeo, M.;Rolland, Erik;Ulmer, Jacquelyn Rees;Patterson, Raymond A.', author_ids='57780575700;55497988300;7402322224;7403567107', author_afids='60154066;60005565;60135978;60134855', coverDate='2022-09-01', coverDisplayDate='September 2022', publicationName='ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems', issn='2158656X', source_id='21100200804', eIssn='21586578', aggregationType='Journal', volume='13', issueIdentifier='3', article_number='32', pageRange=None, description='Innovation is a very important concern for both managers and governmental policy makers. There is an important interplay between security and technology innovation that is largely unrecognized in the literature. This research considers the case where technology innovation in the form of additional product features increases demand through greater functionality. However, the likelihood of a security breach increases with the number of product features as the features interact in unintended ways, thereby increasing the attack surface. Using a two-stage game, we demonstrate how potential demand changes (from direct risk or externalities) impact firm technology innovation strategy. The analysis shows that the type and extent of customer demand reaction has a significant impact on innovative feature development. This research identifies two potential impacts on the level of innovation that can be strategically managed - the impact of externalities on demand and industry risk - explaining how these forces alter the level of innovation in the product ecosystem.

By using publicly available data, we estimated learning-by-deploying rates of 31.4% and 27.6%; and learning-by-researching rates of 2.3% and 4.7% for onshore wind and solar PV, respectively. By adopting a logistic curve approach, an additional $1322 and $819 mil. were forecast to be spent by 2050 in RD&D for onshore wind and solar PV, respectively. We explored the plausible long-term effects of diverse RD&D investment scenarios on electricity generation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using a system dynamics model.

The second is contextual, in response to category leniency, when a market category has ambiguous social meaning. Central and peripheral firms in lenient categories use category innovation to send a clearer signal of their position. These pathways are countervailing: the more lenient a firm's categories, the weaker the relationship between category combination and category innovation. Exploratory analyses show category innovation is associated with firm success. Managerial Summary: Firms use category labels to communicate the market they are in. This article studies the linguistic tactic category innovation: when firms introduce a new label to signal the firm is carving out a new market. I find firms use this tactic when they (a) develop novel, category-combining products that do not fit into existing markets, or (b) are in a market that is not well-defined (a lenient market category). I also find that for firms in lenient markets, the relationship between novel products and category innovation weakens.

On the one hand, these employees can use their domain-specific knowledge to identify the value of what may seem a far-fetched solution to the average employee. On the other hand, previous research has shown that employees typically evaluate ideas in their domains less favorably if they do not align with ongoing exploitation activities. Hence, this study focuses on whether a higher degree of relevant domain-specific knowledge makes employees participating in internal crowdsourcing prefer exploitative solutions when evaluating ideas. An empirical study of an online platform for firm-internal innovation in a multinational engineering company showed that employees who only infrequently participated in internal crowdsourcing mostly contributed to and evaluated ideas within their own domain. Employees who frequently participated also contributed to and evaluated ideas outside their own domains. By statistically analyzing group differences during idea evaluation, we show that employees participating infrequently favor exploitable solutions, whereas employees participating frequently are more uncertain. The former difference is only seen concerning ideas that require domain-specific knowledge to understand, but the latter is observed for all types of ideas. This study makes three substantial contributions. First, employees with domain-specific knowledge, through their preference for exploitative solutions, bias the outcome of internal crowdsourcing when idea evaluation requires domain-specific knowledge. Second, this bias is aggravated by the overall higher level of uncertainty displayed by employees participating frequently in internal crowdsourcing and thereby tend to reach out to other domains. Third, in order to mitigate this, bias management can build engagement in internal crowdsourcing through idea challenges that do not require domain-specific knowledge and consider avoiding employees with a strongly associated domain knowledge for idea evaluation.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=3, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='2015‐01524', fund_sponsor='VINNOVA'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85138023222', doi='10.4324/9781003046899', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Routledge Companion to Technology Management', subtype='bk', subtypeDescription='Book', creator='Daim T.', afid='60147807', affilname='Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science', affiliation_city='Portland', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='3', author_names='Daim, Tugrul;Dabic, Marina;Su, Yu Shan', author_ids='35565192000;6507123949;55638358500', author_afids='60147807;;', coverDate='2022-08-31', coverDisplayDate='31 August 2022', publicationName='The Routledge Companion to Technology Management', issn=None, source_id='21101108014', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-657', description='Bringing together an international range of expertise, this comprehensive Companion to Technology Management is designed to facilitate the development of management frameworks adaptable for a wide range of organizations, as well as an overview of the development and integration of technology in advanced and emerging economies.

This is partly because industries and universities can not achieve smooth coordination and deep integration as they share different functional architectures and value propositions. Henceforth, China has set up a large number of so-called “Application-oriented Universities (AOUs)” in recent years, with an aim to solve aforementioned deficiencies and to promote local industrial economies. Nevertheless, while the central government has set a clear vision when proposing this term of AOUs, it failed to give an clear definition and connotation. As a result, AOUs were stuck with problems such as a lack of resources, vague positioning, homogeneous development with “Research-oriented Universities (ROUs)” directly affiliated to the central government and weak local embeddedness in their early stage of development and performed far below expectations. Until recently, AOUs has gradually found their positioning and ways of strategizing during the process of integration and experiment with industries, ROUs, and governments by forming a symbiotic and complementary relationship, and thereby made up for the breakpoints of innovation chains to a great extent. Based on this, from the perspective of relational dynamics, this study focuses on how Chinese engineering AOUs participate in the process of transfer, transformation and diffusion of scientific and technological achievements. Taking Shanghai University of Engineering Science and Anhui Institute of Information Technology as research cases, this study discusses how AOUs in China manage to find suitable ways of positioning and strategizing with the policy guidance and resource support of two tiers of governments - central and local respectively. Also, this study explores the dynamic mechanisms underlying the change of relationships between AOUs and ROUS in the same region from competition to commensalism. This study clearly depicts the “bridge” function served by AOUs as well as the complementary effects between AOUs and ROUs in the process of transfer and transformation of scientific and technological achievements.

Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the SCR2 program has been successfully conducted for the last three years, engaging a consortium of 14 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 1 Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, is the lead institution for this program. The SCR2 program is designed to engage underperforming REU students in research opportunities demonstrated to improve students' retention and graduation rates. In addition, teachers from local community colleges and high schools are recruited in this program as RET participants. The experience of RET participants in hands-on engineering research projects helps them encourage their students to pursue engineering as a career. The SCR2 program offers summer research experience (eight weeks for students and six weeks for teachers) focusing on smart and connected cities. In this paper, we present our learnings from the last three years of the SCR2 program, which will inform the progress of engineering education and training in the United States. While the 2019 SCR2 program was able to offer on-campus research experience and mentorship for the REU/RETs, the 2020 program had to go virtual to accommodate the extraneous circumstances posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this transition, the 2020 program engaged 32 undergraduates and 12 teachers, who successfully participated in 12 research projects across three host sites. Learning from the experience of the summer 2020 virtual program, the 2021 SCR2 program was redesigned as a hybrid program and was able to bring six host sites together, offering 18 projects in which 47 undergraduates and 23 teachers participated. One major success of the program was the positive impact of remote learning on both students and teachers. Despite the hybrid nature of the program, students excelled in their technical skills due to the effective collaboration using video conferencing tools. However, during the post-program survey, one primary concern was reported regarding the reduced participation of women students in the program. Simultaneously, the women participants reported less satisfaction and reduced confidence and knowledge gain than men. The transition of the SCR2 program from on-site to online and finally hybrid model exemplifies how innovation in engineering education can overcome the challenges posed by the health crisis. However, it is evident from the assessment results that more attention is needed concerning the experience of women in the program to improve their sense of belongingness in the field of engineering.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1849454', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85138313949', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Supporting an Alternate PhD Pathway in STEM: Findings from a Qualitative Study of Students and Faculty', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Rorrer A.', afid='60006951', affilname='The University of North Carolina at Charlotte', affiliation_city='Charlotte', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='7', author_names='Rorrer, Audrey;Pugalee, David K.;Srinivasan, Kamalapriya;Ramaprabhu, P.;Xu, T.;Uddin, M.;Cherukuri, H.', author_ids='24721526300;6506095855;57895684400;6507192270;57294210900;57212863029;6701596391', author_afids='60006951;60006951;60006951;60006951;60006951;60006951;60006951', coverDate='2022-08-23', coverDisplayDate='23 August 2022', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='PAtENT (Pathways to Entrepreneurship) is a pilot program for an alternate pathway allowing doctoral candidates in STEM programs to satisfy capstone degree requirements by applying for patents.

The rapid transition to online learning during the COVID-19 lockdown triggered a boost of technology adoption among higher education instructors. For more than two years into the pandemic, the effect of digital learning on higher education has been remarkably profound. We are going through a change that has not happened for decades in traditional classrooms and a new digital world is forming. The pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of digitized learning modes, such as live-streaming videos, recorded videos, video conferences, screen sharing, 3D graphics, online chatting, cloud file storage and transfer. Both instructors and students are getting used to technology adoption in the classroom instruction. The advantages of technology use in teaching, such as time flexibility, accessibility and convenience, are evident. As we expect a light at the end of tunnel for the pandemic, it is of tremendous interest to know how digital learning will impact post-pandemic classroom instruction. In this paper, the effect of digital learning on civil engineering classroom instructions during the pandemic time are studied, and surveys were conducted in three civil engineering courses over the four consecutive semesters from Spring 2020 to Fall 2021, and the quantitative survey results are analyzed and compared.

The School of Engineering from a private university in Chile, enjoying the highest enrollment numbers in engineering careers nationwide, has made innovations in its curriculum in order to incorporate DT across all of its subjects. Professionals by and large acknowledge the importance of DT, while those associated to professional training recognize as necessary its inclusion in the curriculum.

There was thus a need to to identify this gap that could indicate weaknesses in the curricular innovation process to include DT and would thus allow the creation of improvement guidelines in relation to the preparation of the teachers involved. This present study aims to look into perceptions held by School of Engineering professors regarding the importance DT and any barriers had on the use of digital tools in relation to their reaching. Surveys were applied to ascertain professors' perception regarding DT usefulness and to determine how much they actually use digital tools, using quantitative data analysis methods.

This evidence-based practice paper investigates the pivot to the pandemic world of online-only availability and what can be retained from the experience to enhance student learning in future engineering education courses. First, it looks at the necessary changes to an experiential project-based inquiry course for first-year students. Second, this paper looks at the adaptations in a microcontroller-based first programming course with a final design project. Both courses are moderately large (~100-200 students/year) and are enrolled by a wide variety of science, engineering, and design majors at the University of Minnesota (a large public research university.) Three key adaptations from these two courses show potentially lasting promise. The first is utilizing individual projects where students collaboratively support each other's projects (from ideation to implementation). The second is the use of static, responsive, and teleconference- based video submissions for project check-ins, reports, and design reviews. The final is using online communications tools, including Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and particularly the Discord service.

As many generations before them, today's students have a very significant restlessness related to the practical application of their knowledge. Being able to relate classroom contents with their professional, or even day-to-day lives, can never be underestimated in the students' learning, but this doesn't mean it is any less of a challenge for teachers. It is important to understand the relation between practical knowledge and the intrinsic motivation in the students. A student that understands that his learning goes beyond a single class (or a single topic) and that has a better understanding of the practical applications is going to be motivated and therefore, more willing to learn new concepts. The authors have designed and implemented an activity in which they present a simplified version of a stay-cable bridge. The physics students would create a pre-design of the structural elements based on their knowledge of Newton's First Law of Movement viewed in class and compare their results with a structural model in a software. The activity is similar to the exercises that Civil Engineer students face in their studies. The objective is to show them how the book-based problems seen in physics (or even in math) are just the first step they have to take in order to understand a much larger amount of concepts once they've reached a college level of physics or even in their future jobs as engineers. In this paper, the authors are going to present a qualitative investigation of the student's perception of the real-life activity. The objective of this research is to find out if this activity has had an impact on the student's ability to see the bigger picture of their studies and, by consequence, increase their motivation to study the topic. This investigation will be based on high school students, specifically 12th grade.

The International Engineering Alliance continuously updates the requirements for the Program Learning Outcomes according to the needs of the current and future global graduating engineers that member countries of the WA must fulfill. Recent requirements emphasize lifelong learning, complex problem solving, engineering activities, and computing and digital tools capabilities geared towards developing engineering graduates ready for 21st century challenges. When brought upon engineering educators, these increasing requirements posed a dilemma because most are not trained to educate students beyond what they have experienced in their previous formal learning processes, which may be irrelevant for today's learners. In a survey conducted by the UK Royal Academy of Engineering, engineering knowledge and skills are the topmost needed challenges to meet the needs of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Thus, to transform engineering education in Malaysia, the gap between the needs of the current and future engineering requirements, with the current engineering education practices, must be determined. Hence, this study aims to identify the gaps in Malaysian engineering education towards preparing 21st century ready educators, study the transition of engineering educators in their attempt to implement innovative education, and finally develop a framework for transforming engineering education through the infusion of innovative teaching and learning to support the development of the future-ready educators. The study uses a mixed-method research design to identify the gaps through document analysis, interviews, questionnaire surveys, and focus group discussions (FGD) among engineering education providers and industry players. The data will be analyzed and triangulated to chart the gaps in engineering education toward preparing 21st century educators. Later, this result will be used to develop the directions, actions, and transformation framework. The findings from this study will be used to formulate Malaysian national policy for transforming future-ready engineering educators who can excel and be on the leading edge of knowledge, innovation, and humanistic values to develop quality engineers in the 21st century.

In academia, AM has also received great deal of interest as a vehicle to improve design and manufacturing education and facilitate student innovation. The objective of this effort is to improve the readiness and diversity of the engineering workforce in the aerospace industry, which is experiencing critical scarcity in talent. We engaged a multidisciplinary team of minority engineering students in the design and manufacture of a modular quadcopter drone driven by AM. The modular drone focus provides a suitable context for the implementation of experiential learning, which is proven to support the development of practical student research and engineering design skills. Design thinking was used to drive the developments needed to achieve a modular drone that can be easily customized and reconfigured for different applications. With the design flexibility offered by AM, students designed and built drone arms that can be quickly detached and assembled, both structurally and electrically in one-step while avoiding the need for soldering electric connections at nodes. They also developed an optional propeller guard, which can be compactly packed, if not needed, as well as a concept for a 3D printed power distribution board to replace standard commercially available boards. An additional objective of the project is to arm students with desirable soft skills such as interdisciplinary team skills, leadership, lifelong learning, and entrepreneurship mind set. To guide students in this project, a multidisciplinary team of faculty mentors met with the student team once a week to advice on technical issues and provide general direction and context. The students' work schedules were deliberately selected to maximize overlap between team members with the aim of facilitating effective communication and cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. Furthermore, to build self-confidence, promote experiential learning and develop leadership skills, the students were encouraged to take full ownership of the development process by giving them the latitude needed to find for themselves what works and what does not. Through a focus group with the participating students, an independent external evaluator found that the project context and mentoring approaches helped them experience the benefits of AM, improved their understanding of real-life engineering product development as well as their engineering courses.

As part of a broader project designed to realign program goals, practices and outcomes, this study included semi-structured interviews and focus groups, designed to understand how program stakeholders conceptualize first principles thinking, and how they perceive the benefits or utility of such an approach. Through the historical analysis of the engineering curriculum, a key tension identified is the focus on foundational mathematics and science, which is contrasted with a focus on professional practice and the applications of engineering work. An interest in emphasizing mathematics and science led to the launch of a number of undergraduate and graduate programs around the world in Engineering Science, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and the persistent inclusion of a comprehensive foundation in mathematics and science in engineering programs. This foundation has enabled a focus on first principles as part of the teaching and learning discourse in some engineering programs. More recently, first principles thinking has also been discussed in the popular technology discourse as connected to innovation. Here, it is described as a method used to identify and reason from the most fundamental truths in our knowledge base to support problem solving and innovation. While many stakeholders have a vague awareness of first principles thinking as a philosophy of knowledge construct, there is a gap in conceptualizing this in the engineering and education literature. Thematic analysis was used to identify several key findings. First, while some stakeholders viewed first principles thinking as a learning and problem solving strategy, others tied the practice to the disciplinary knowledge itself, for example, key theories and equations and their derivations. While these two conceptualizations are related, the latter provides less room for transfer to the engineering problem solving process, and stakeholders expressed an interest in building this opportunity to transfer the skill to other engineering contexts. Second, different stakeholders viewed the utility of the approach differently; for example, while alumni articulated the benefits of building first principles reasoning as a skill, students felt that the practice was more tied to a career in research and less useful in other engineering settings. Third, students in particular noted the challenge in maximizing the learning benefits associated with first principles thinking with the heavy workload and knowledge base in engineering. These results provide some avenues for the examination of first principles thinking in engineering education, particularly in considering the interplay between disciplinary knowledge and learning skills, and the need to balance first principles thinking with other considerations in the curriculum. We hope this work will open the door to future inquiry about the value of first principles thinking in the development of life-long learning and innovation in engineering.

Depending on the elements included from engineering design and entrepreneurship methodologies, some curricula espouse a more inventive focus, where problem identification and solution finding are likely to result in the creation of something novel, useful, and non-obvious. While some programs and curricula identify specifically as “invention education,” we contend that the student learning experience exists on a continuum, ranging from less to more inventive, irrespective of the self-applied label. Even at the intersection of engineering design and entrepreneurship, a fertile ground for inventiveness, some curricular experiences are more inventive than others. Curricula that explicitly encourage inventive products and habits provide agency for students to build their own future and to develop ways of thinking and working that will support their success in life. Specifically, students engage unique skillsets, mindsets, and interests which enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for underrepresented students who are more likely to be excluded when analytical skills are prioritized over inventiveness and cultural assets. This hypothesis is backed by preliminary data from inventive curriculum research which shows higher levels of participation in invention activities from underrepresented groups relative to typical rates in engineering programs. In this paper, we propose a definition of inventiveness to describe both attributes and student work products. We contrast inventiveness with analytical skills where methods and outcomes are typically known. To explore opportunities for inventiveness in curricula, subject matter experts evaluated 23 activities common in engineering design and entrepreneurship curricula and rated their expected student work outcomes with respect to inventiveness and analytical skills. We also evaluated nine problem statements from engineering design coursework with respect to their potential for resulting in inventive and analytical student work products. We contend that the inclusion of curricular elements that rate higher with respect to inventiveness are more likely to promote student engagement, particularly from underrepresented groups. This analysis may be applied when considering whether a curriculum is sufficiently promoting and rewarding inventiveness or inventive practices.

The growing popularity of customer-orientated technological innovation has led to different approaches that feature customer involvement in new product development. The transition from an old model with no or little customer involvement to a customer-based approach that values customer feedback on innovations requires more attention to competitors in the field as their products are based on similar concepts. Innovation based on the customers' needs is a more commercially beneficial and interactive approach to fulfill the market need. Importantly, involving customers in the innovation process requires a new set of concerns, concepts, and decision-making: customers have a lot of options, and companies have to compete for business ever more intensely. When preparing a survey for market research, the main goal should be to validate consumer needs and willingness to buy the product. Determining the demographic to which the product appeals to can narrow down a target market and the features of the product that interest customers. Additionally, customer surveys, market analysis, and business plans are some important elements for success. How to conduct market research is especially vital. This article will focus on successful market research methods, sample survey questions, survey samples, results, and an analysis of productive innovations.

The integrated nature of manufacturing is evident in its symbiotic relationship with innovation, national security, and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Moreover, manufacturing is increasingly important to the balanced education of engineers in all disciplines. However, today's manufacturing is undergoing the greatest change in more than 100 years, and the current skills gap causes serious concerns about the ability of manufacturers to fill critical positions. Manufacturing needs a well-trained workforce that possesses skills like problem-solving and critical thinking to make effective decisions at all stages of the manufacturing process. One of the fundamental skills is to make good decisions at early stages that facilitate, not impede, the manufacturing process down the road. Traditional curricula designs tend to focus on a specific discipline, creating a silo effect rather than viewing manufacturing as a connected, systemic process needing decisions made with respect to the entire product development life cycle. This study investigates this belief by 1) examining if students understand product manufacturing as a connected, systemic process, 2) exploring in which manufacturing knowledge area, if any, students are deficient, and 3) analyzing if these knowledge gaps exist for both engineering and business students. To study these possible gaps, this research proposes a holistic design approach for manufacturing education to provide students with an integrated view of how products in the real world metamorphose from an idea into the hands of end-consumers. A dynamic decision making framework integrating product manufacturing topics across engineering and business courses is developed to highlight system thinking and decision making in the context of the entire product life cycle (i.e., product design, manufacturing process, manufacturing system, and business process). Utilizing the Understanding by Design model, we first established clear learning objectives associated with students' basic understanding of manufacturing knowledge in connection with product development life cycle based on Bloom's taxonomy (i.e., remember and understand). Next, the team created an assessment to collect acceptable evidence for the defined learning outcomes. Finally, learning modules were created by an interdisciplinary team of instructors to introduce the related manufacturing topics. A pilot study with current engineering and business undergraduate courses was conducted and pre- and post-survey data was collected and analyzed.

There is a high concern that the necessary skill set (e.g., adaptability, persistence, and performance) of the new cohort, who are primarily underrepresented Hispanics from underserved and challenged communities from the Rio Grande Valley, is not optimal for the rigor of engineering education. To this end, an onboarding bootcamp for incoming and transfer students was created to bridge the transition from secondary education to higher education by priming students to overcome academic deficiencies, develop a critical skills portfolio, learn problem-solving techniques, build a sustainable community of mentoring support with faculty and students, and provide a template to sustain academic and professional success during their undergraduate education. This research-to-practice paper presents the bootcamps' design process steps: curricular analysis, identification of areas of opportunities, skills inventory, and blueprinting process, as well as its initial implementation in the mechanical engineering program. In this regard, the bootcamp was organized over a week span with hands-on engineering activities, faculty and student talks, and engineering lab tours; and was based on a design thinking approach. Daily activities were structured based on challenge-based instruction, innovation, design, and mentoring, and focused primarily on promoting critical thinking, being assertive in the face of adversity, making informed decisions, and prioritizing tasks. Results indicate that the bootcamp increased student confidence and established a valuable network system amongst other findings.

The computer revolution has generated numerous key innovations that are applicable to the neuroscience field. That is, inexpensive and powerful microprocessors, accessible coding languages, and electronic components that are both affordable and modular. The field of neuroscience has benefited from these advances in several ways. Alzheimer's is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, often affecting people over the age of sixty five. Although there is still no cure for this disease, many studies over the years have shown that brain exercises can help maintain basic cognitive skills for Alzheimer's patients. While there are many different brain exercises that already exist, most of them either don't offer many levels of difficulty, are difficult to carry, or are not accessible for some patients. This paper proposes a design for the Brain Trainer: an educational gaming device for Alzheimer's patients, that is portable, engaging, and easy to operate. It has three different types of cognitive exercises, all of which have different levels of difficulty, which can help maintain cognitive function. The exercises also display scores and changes in performance. Furthermore, the results could be compared to existing tests to gather data on the exercises' effectiveness. While there is room for improvement in terms of cost and durability, the Brain Trainer met our goal of providing an effective brain-training game for Alzheimer's patients. In addition, this project teaches students to master various skills, such as research, persistence, design, construction, and technical writing. The skills learned by this project were invaluable and important experiences within engineering.

This paper is the first of many that will explore the integration of research in an applied program.

The researchers suggest that faculty can provide substantially more effective and engaging instruction in freshman through senior courses when students are continuously involved in the use of research throughout the educational experience. For example, the CR cycle can be used to formulate a question, conduct a literature survey, re-formulate the question, propose a solution, an improvement, or an updated approach, design/build/implement the proposed approach, and present to others.

Innovation commercialization seeks to transform products/services from the laboratory to the marketplace or the end-user. The number of commercialized innovations by Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) - originally established mainly as teaching and blue-collar trade institutions to educate African Americans - is significantly lower than their non-HBCUs counterparts (specifically, Predominately White Institutions - PWIs). This is largely because HBCUs have been traditionally under-served and under-resourced. To bridge this gap, HBCUs are promoting entrepreneurial training and mindset through changes in engineering education programs and curriculum. For instance, federally funded programs like the National Science Foundation (NSF) Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) and NSF I-Corps promote the education and training of innovators on commercialization of innovations at HBCUs. Little Research has been done to investigate the level of awareness of engineering graduate students at an HBCU. The purpose of this study is to assess the level of awareness of engineering graduate students at an HBCU about innovation commercialization. In this study, we conducted a survey using a questionnaire-based data collection method that focused only on engineering graduate students at the University of the District of Columbia. We used both binary and ordinal scales, where we ask questions first using a binary scale, such that If an answer is “Yes” then we follow it with another question using an ordinal scale that is whether awareness level is low, average, or high. The study population of interest includes 15 engineering graduate students at the institution. The results from this study have been analyzed using participants' responses to the questionnaire and aggregating these responses to identify patterns. The results showed general low level of awareness and understanding of innovation commercialization processes. These patterns will be discussed in detail to illuminate the level of awareness about innovation commercialization in HBCUs. We are using the results of this study to provide useful guidelines and framework for HBCUs leadership to initiate programs to promote innovation commercialization, especially for engineering innovators.

Its interest lies in the fact that in 1955/56 the British government created a sub-system of higher technological education in England and Wales that had as its objective, the education of highly qualified engineers and applied scientists for manufacturing industry. This sub-system came to an end in 1964/5. While it could have been the subject of an official evaluation, it was not. However, fortuitously, it was established during a period increasing interest in research in higher education, and several researches addressed various aspects of the system that, accidentally, make a retrospective, but partial informal evaluation possible.. The discussion is presented in two papers because of the structure of the conference, and the need to provide the detailed explanation of the cultural system in which the development took place which would be of substantial length. That is the purpose of this, the first paper. Together these papers have a secondary function of showing factors that contributed to the success and failure of a major innovation in order that the mistakes made will not be repeated in the future: that is to foster learning of the collective past. Their final purpose is more international collaboration among engineering educators and its research fraternity. Since the social forces (attitudes, beliefs and values) at work in society ultimately determine the success or failure of educational innovations, part 1 (this paper) shows the importance of social class in what is valued and not valued in the English educational system. The academic is preferred to the vocational. Grammar schools and universities are associated with the academic. Technical and further education colleges with the vocational. The antecedent philosophy driving this innovation in degree level technological education, as expressed in the 1945 report of the Percy Committee on Higher Technological Education placed the Colleges of Advanced Technology (CATs) created in 1955/6 firmly in the vocational sector. The results of the investigations carried out in the CATs reported in part 2 (the second paper) showed that schoolteachers and their pupils tended to view the CATs as second class citizens: that most students had good experiences of industrial training although many believed it could be improved, and that the curriculum offered tended to model that found in the universities. The Robbins Committee believed that the curriculum offered was of degree level standard and recommended that the CATs be given university status, which they were in 1964/5.

A cohort of 11 teachers participated during the summer of 2021 and included teachers and instructors from Indiana and Illinois high school teachers and community colleges. Research projects involved industrial collaborations with local steel industry partners. The project kicked off with a 6-week in-person research experience hosted at the Center for Innovation through Visualization and Simulation (CIVS) at Purdue University Northwest. The teachers worked with faculty and research staff mentors and graduate students on research projects in the areas of blast furnace/environmental using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, reheat furnace efficiency using CFD, overhead crane stress using finite element analysis (FEA), and safety training using interactive visualization. Each research project included research mentor staff, graduate and undergraduate students, as well as collaboration with steel industry partners. In addition to the research outcomes, each teacher also developed a lesson plan and education module which will be hosted online for use by other educators. Lesson plans involved a variety of topics programming activities for computer science and related classes, chemistry and environmental activities, math and statistics analysis, and engineering. Each lesson plan also involved some form of activity involving computer simulation and/or interactive visualization. Surveys measured teacher's self-efficacy in a number of areas including research literature review, design, data collection and analysis, communication of research results, ability to relate real world research problems to teaching, and use of simulation and visualization tools for research and teaching. There was a measured improvement between pre-summer experience and post-summer experience in all categories, with the largest improvements involving ability to discuss research ideas and ability to use simulation/visualization tools for research and teaching. Follow-up activities are ongoing during the teacher's academic school year, including assistance from the RET to carry out implementation of the lesson plans in the classroom, field trips, networking activities, presenting research career information to students, and surveying students on their interest in pursuing STEM activities and related careers.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85138254442', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Lived Experiences that Influence How Women Engineering Majors Describe Themselves as Creative', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Delahanty C.M.', afid='128585743', affilname='Area Coordinator of Science and Engineering', affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country=None, author_count='2', author_names='Delahanty, Christine Michelle;Silverman, Jason', author_ids='56843087100;23095953100', author_afids='128585743;128585743', coverDate='2022-08-23', coverDisplayDate='23 August 2022', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"Engineering is a creative profession where diverse perspectives of both men and women are crucial to the field. The importance of better understanding the pipeline of female students into engineering, and the path to their success in the major is evident.

In 2019, women comprised 48% of the workforce, 34% of the STEM workforce, and only 16% of practicing engineers, a 3% increase from 2009. In an effort to better understand these disparities, this mixed methods research investigated the creative self-efficacy (CSE) of women engineering majors and their beliefs about creativity in relation to lived experiences and explores the research question: In what ways do undergraduate women engineering students describe their creativity and how their lived experiences influenced their decision to major in engineering? The researchers investigated the lived experiences of women engineering students before they entered the engineering major in relation to the way they described themselves as creative. A survey of CSE and beliefs about creativity was administered to 121 undergraduate women engineering students who volunteered for this study. Interviews were conducted of 15 participants selected from survey results with different levels of CSE who met the researcher's criteria for success in the engineering major. The findings of this study lead to several conclusions: (1) students' descriptions of themselves as creative corresponded more with the arts than to innovation in engineering; (2) students who described themselves as less creative: (a) had a lower level of CSE; (b) had a greater exposure to engineering in high school through engineering-centered courses and clubs; (c) had a family member who worked in the profession; (d) described more negative classroom experiences at all educational levels that involved intimidation, isolation, and gender-bias.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85138251948', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Divergent thinking in engineering: Diverse exploration is key to successful project outcomes', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Murphy L.', afid=None, affilname=None, affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country=None, author_count='4', author_names='Murphy, Laura;Clancy, Shannon M.;Daly, Shanna;Seifert, Colleen M.', author_ids='57195966246;56193008700;23093513400;35606631400', author_afids=None, coverDate='2022-08-23', coverDisplayDate='23 August 2022', publicationName='ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21100797240', eIssn='21535965', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='Engineers have the power to drive innovation and rethink the way the world is designed.

Not only is such a discrepancy in investment socially unjust, but it deprives the US of the advantages in innovation and global competition that could stem from widening participation in innovative sectors. Yet, despite efforts to provide targeted support to women and underrepresented minority-owned businesses, more remains to be done to close the investment gap. The US Small Business Administration (SBA) provides more than $3.5 billion in funding [1] to over 5,000 startups per year through its Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. Moreover, the Small Business Act provides these programs with a mandate to target women and underrepresented minority groups. Despite this, only 15% of those funds went to minority-owned companies [2]. The private sector tells a similar story. Diversity VC, a nonprofit partnership promoting diversity in Venture Capital, reported in 2019 that in a comprehensive survey [3] of around 10,000 founders receiving venture capital backing, only 9% were women and a mere 1% were Black. In order to i) accelerate innovation, ii) increase participation of under-represented minorities in new startups, and iii) ensure US competitiveness in the global market, the National Science Foundation (NSF) introduced the Small Business Postdoctoral Research Diversity Fellowship (SBPRDF) program in 2010 and selected the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) to administer it. The SBPRDF placed postdoctoral Fellows with high-tech start-up companies, allowing Fellows to learn to collaborate in a multidisciplinary environment and develop an understanding of the expectations and constraints involved in successful entrepreneurship. In return, the Fellows applied their academic expertise to the important work of product realization in a globally competitive market. In 2019 NSF/IIP (Industrial Innovation and Partnerships) selected ASEE to administer the Innovative Postdoctoral Entrepreneurial Research Fellowship (IPERF) program as a successful extension to the previous SBPRDF grant. The overarching goal of the IPERF program is to emphasize and strengthen the entrepreneurial development of underrepresented Fellows, advance best practices in postdoctoral programs, and significantly expand the participation of underrepresented scholars in innovative research and technology entrepreneurship. The IPERF grant is committed to providing professional experiences for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in innovative start-ups and more industry-oriented research to encourage their own entrepreneurship.

This research project considered the unique ways of being, thinking, and knowing-what we call latent diversity-that can be highlighted and valued. Students' latent diversity may or may not align with the values in engineering education that focus on a social/technical dualism, meritocracy, and rigor, which are built-in Whiteness and masculinity. Students, particularly minoritized students (i.e., women, Black, Indigenous, and Latinx students), may feel pushed out of engineering or they may feel the need to conform to these values to fit in.

Much of the research about educational innovation has focused on undergraduate classrooms in large enrollment courses and/or research-intensive institutions. Propagation of innovations across settings, especially those quite unlike the original context, has received less attention in the literature. This includes liberal arts institutions, which collectively educate a large number of undergraduate engineering students in various contexts. Therefore, this study focuses on the implementation of an instructional innovation in a liberal arts institution that started a new engineering program to educate a regional engineering workforce. This qualitative study documented the experiences of one engineering instructor who adopted and adapted a blended learning environment for undergraduate dynamics designed to promote active and collaborative learning in undergraduate engineering courses. We analyzed interviews, documents, artifacts, visual materials, and field notes to examine the propagation of the instructional system in context with cultural features in local institution settings. Our findings show how an engineering instructor orchestrated a culture-aligned adoption and adaptation of an instructional innovation. Using reflective practice, the research participant adapted the implemented innovative instruction to their hands-on institution culture, such as adjusting expectations in content, adapting resources to students' individual needs, adjusting uncertainty of problem solving, and adapting to a hands-on institution culture. This research highlights the important role of institutional culture in local adaptations of educational innovations, and it provides the community with an expanded way to think about innovation propagation. Improving teaching and learning has been an important issue in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Alternative to traditional engineering instruction that focused on delivering content knowledge, researchers have promoted active learning that focus on increasing student participation and engagement learning [1], [2]. However, despite consistent efforts to disseminate active learning pedagogies, traditional lecture still dominates undergraduate STEM education [3]. Many researchers contend that various challenges hinder instructors from adopting using research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) due to student resistance, limited time for course preparation, and lack of institutional support and rewards [4] - [6]. To promote the use of RBIS for instructors, Froyd et al. [7] maintain that researchers aim to implement RBIS to fit local contexts through collaboration with potential adopters. They emphasized the importance of fit in local context and individual instructors' decisions to adopt and adapt the original RBIS. However, despite their attentions to general needs in local context for instructional innovation, little attention was paid to what specific local context were associated with individual instructors' instructional adaptation.

First, develop creative skills in coherent steps and, secondly, create communities which support and validate creative growth. This paper strives to operationalize this approach by providing examples from across academia for doing both. After describing potential sources of individual and institutional resistance to deliberate development of creativity within engineering students the paper summarizes proven methods from the literature to address both elements of the approach.

The purpose of this study is to use Critical Race Theory to examine how entrepreneurship programs can foster an inclusive environment through understanding the perceptions of racially minoritized engineering faculty (i.e., persons who identify as African American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American/Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) of an entrepreneurship program. Seven racially minoritized engineering faculty of an entrepreneurship training program participated in 60-minute semi-structured interviews to understand their sense of belonging in the program and their experiences related to respect and inclusion in the program. Two themes emerged from the data: 1) reducing structural barriers and rectifying harsh climate conditions can improve participants' overall sense of belonging and 2) representation of racially minoritized populations can be improved through more inclusive recruiting and marketing efforts.

In this article, through literature research and case studies, taking a certain engineering college located in Beijing, China as an example, a series of programs were implemented, including training of scientific research skills, research interest group discussions, and training of scientific research projects. Two hundred forty undergraduates of the same grade are randomly selected and divided into three classes to cultivate scientific research literacy in different extra-curricular learning modes. Afterward, tracking, comparing, and analyzing the practical data of those undergraduate students for three-year extra-curricular learning reveals the outstanding achievements yielded from a series of China's policy-driven university training programs and the improvement of university students' scientific research capabilities. This article puts forward a “trinity system” development scheme and mode and Carries out innovative talent training engineering practice by studying and analyzing the orienting and results under different training modes. More specifically, inspiring students' enthusiasm by taking practical projects training; building the whole-process progressive training modes of centralized teaching, self-study, student seminars, and project training as the core to improve their scientific literacy. The scientific research atmosphere is enhanced and constructed to collectively drive individual development and form a sense of innovation in virtuous competition and cooperation.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this formerly in-person course adopted a synchronous teaching model and used online instructional tools for lectures, group activities, and project support. The robotic project helped introduce students to engineering principles by employing multi-developmental phases for creating a robot. The teaching approach also provided students an engineering design experience while working in interdisciplinary teams with members serving unique engineering roles such as design, hardware, software, project, or testing lead. Students were required to design and fabricate a relevant prototype for stakeholders and, while doing so, learn and acquire essential competencies and skillsets relevant to engineering professions. Course methodology involved weekly assignments and the acquisition of project kits by individual students. The engineering mindset was assessed through content knowledge of inclusive modules in electronics, programming, 3D printing, innovation, and data analysis assignments. Learning outcomes include using software, hardware-based technologies, and research-based inquiries to design, fabricate, test, and improve an autonomous robot. Measurement of these outcomes was accomplished through course assessments, student evaluations, and the final project showcase results.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative methodology of covariance-based structural equation modelling. The data were collected from a three-scale, self-completed questionnaire, which was constructed using the existing modelling of the academic literature. The questionnaire was validated by confirmatory factor analysis and applied to a sample of 342 professional engineering and business graduates in Colombia. Findings: The results of the structural equation modelling demonstrate a negative relationship between design thinking traits and cognitive passive resistance, and this relationship is mediated by linear thinking. These findings link design thinking and behavioural strategy and build new foundations for future studies, providing further theoretical support to the academic literature’s discussion of the relationship between design thinking and theories of managerial practices and innovation management. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is the subjectivity of the answers because of potential bias from the respondents in completing the questionnaire. Another limitation is that the research was conducted only in the context of Colombia, so it is recommended that other studies be carried to generalise the results. This study has several theoretical implications. This study contributes to existing research on design thinking, evidencing a promising field of study to support it theoretically, such as the behavioural strategy. This study also contributes to the literature on innovation management deepening into a field of study that has received less attention in the literature, such as passive cognitive resistance to innovation. Likewise, this study presents a theoretical contribution to the dual process of cognition, proposing a new dimension to the construction of the multidimensional concept of nonlinear thinking. This study also contributes to the behavioural strategy field, evidencing a growing area of application in strategic management, such as design thinking. Finally, this research also proposes the development of a new research avenue about the concept of knowledge hiding as a possible source of innovation resistance. Practical implications: This research also has implications for business and engineering education and practice. This study’s results suggest that before implementing an organisational initiative such as design thinking, which seeks to change people's behaviour, it is necessary to approach it as a cognitive process and develop strategies to mitigate passive cognitive resistance to change. This research’s results also present implications for business and engineering education, evidencing the need to include other perspectives of thinking that allow non-designers to develop creative thinking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first quantitative study on design thinking as a business management concept using linear thinking of non-designers to relate design thinking traits with cognitive passive resistance.

At present, the focus of ancient books research has been on the original and regenerative protection, while the conservation of inheritance is relatively lagging behind, and the role of the promotion of ancient books reading has not been fully played. The emergence of virtual reality (VR) technology provides a new idea and method for the intelligent transformation of ancient book reading promotion, which is of great value to the construction of a library\\'s intelligent knowledge service system and the innovation of the service mode. With the help of VR technology, the intelligent reading promotion of ancient books shows the characteristics of \"narrative presentation scene\", \"reading service immersion\" and \"reading space humanization\". [Method/Process] In order to provide reference for the research and development of intelligent reading in the new era, this paper first discusses the concept \"gene\" of intelligent reading of ancient books enabled by the VR technology, and summarizes the application scenarios of the VR technology in the promotion of intelligent reading of ancient books, combined with the National Library of China\\'s specific case on \"VR panorama cultural classics\". Then the application path of VR technology was put forward enabling the intelligent reading and promotion of ancient books. To this end, this paper first summarizes the concept \"genes\" of intelligent reading promotion from a macro perspective, and then analyzes the application scenarios of VR technology in the promotion of intelligent reading of ancient books based on the investigation of the application cases of \"VR + ancient book reading promotion\". It analyzes the construction practice of \"VR Panorama Cultural Classics\" in the National Library of China from four perspectives of content narrative, visual presentation, empathy mechanism and communication strategy, to construct a \"VR and ancient books\" reading promotion path. The content narrative of \"VR panoramic cultural books\" should focus on activating characteristic collection\\'s historical materials and recording key historical moments. In the aspect of visual presentation, it should pay attention to excavating the elements of characteristic cultural scene and reconstructing the landscape scientifically and rigorously. In terms of the mechanism of empathy, the focus should be put on the use of the block type structure to present the history panorama, and the use of typical characters to compose stories. When it comes to communication strategy, it should pay attention to jointly creating a new pattern of \"library +\" by combining online and offline multi-screen media. [Results/Conclusions] A library should first pay attention to narrative expression, and the control of the narrative logic of ancient book stories. Second, the library should pay attention to scene perception and explore the presentation mode of panoramic vision threshold. Third, attention should be paid to top-level design and giving play to the guiding force of ancient books\\' cultural engineering. Fourth, the library should pay attention to cross-border cooperation and adhere to the concept of library reader service. In the promotion of reading ancient books, full consideration should be given to the particularity of ancient books resources and existing reading difficulties. In the process of content dissemination, the focus should be on contructing a model through ring upon ring decomposing and progressively thinning method, and taking targeted measures from the aspects of top-level design, strengthening demonstration, building benchmarking, series construction, cross-border cooperation, building platforms, strengthening perception and strengthening ethical supervision, so as to promote the intelligent reading and promotion of ancient books.', authkeywords='ancient books | intelligent reading | reading promotion | virtual reality (VR)', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85136299276', doi='10.3389/fenvs.2022.904518', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A Conceptual Framework for Collaborative Development of Intelligent Construction and Building Industrialization', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Guo Z.', afid='60017060;60014486', affilname='Central South University;Shenyang Jianzhu University', affiliation_city='Changsha;Shenyang', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='2', author_names='Guo, Zhenxu;Li, Lihong', author_ids='57469248700;57001791400', author_afids='60017060;60014486', coverDate='2022-08-04', coverDisplayDate='4 August 2022', publicationName='Frontiers in Environmental Science', issn=None, source_id='21100826280', eIssn='2296665X', aggregationType='Journal', volume='10', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='904518', pageRange=None, description='Digitalization drives the arrival of the era of intelligent construction, which greatly affects the development of construction industrialization.

This case study contributes to an emerging field of research within STEAM that is informed by practice with emphasis placed on the value of collaboration and transdisciplinary pedagogical approaches. The multi collaborators included lecturers from a college of education with expertise in STEM and Visual Arts education, creative professionals (artists, scientists, and architects), teachers, students, and children. Encompassing all the mentioned stakeholders was important and placed transdisciplinarity at the core of the learning. Qualitative data was collected using questionnaires, focus groups and interviews to research how the participants interpreted their experiences and what meaning they attributed to their experiences. It was found that a program of STEAM education integrating new and emerging technologies with data science and the IoT can promote and encourage the delivery of a transdisciplinary model of STEAM education and the overall reconceptualization of how individual subject areas are taught at elementary level. Innovative data capturing technologies, exploring real-life data within their local educational contexts can positively impact children and teachers’ knowledge and skills in STEAM supporting the development of artistic concepts, engineering habits of mind, imagination, and creativity.

Further study shows that digital finance has a better effect on the improvement of GTFEE in central and western cities, small cities and non-resource-based cities, but has no significant or small impact on GTFEE in eastern cities, large cities and resource-based cities, reflecting the inclusiveness of digital finance.', authkeywords='digital finance | green technology innovation | green total factor energy efficiency | industrial structure upgrading', citedby_count=30, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85136916839', doi='10.3390/nano12152646', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Digital Innovation Enabled Nanomaterial Manufacturing; Machine Learning Strategies and Green Perspectives', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Konstantopoulos G.', afid='60002947;121044243', affilname='National Technical University of Athens (NTUA);Innovation in Research & Engineering Solutions (IRES)', affiliation_city='Athens;Brussels', affiliation_country='Greece;Belgium', author_count='3', author_names='Konstantopoulos, Georgios;Koumoulos, Elias P.;Charitidis, Costas A.', author_ids='6507631659;36930766000;55892292800', author_afids='60002947;121044243;60002947', coverDate='2022-08-01', coverDisplayDate='August 2022', publicationName='Nanomaterials', issn=None, source_id='21100253674', eIssn='20794991', aggregationType='Journal', volume='12', issueIdentifier='15', article_number='2646', pageRange=None, description='Machine learning has been an emerging scientific field serving the modern multidisciplinary needs in the Materials Science and Manufacturing sector. The taxonomy and mapping of nanomaterial properties based on data analytics is going to ensure safe and green manufacturing with consciousness raised on effective resource management. The utilization of predictive modelling tools empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) has proposed novel paths in materials discovery and optimization, while it can further stimulate the cutting-edge and data-driven design of a tailored behavioral profile of nanomaterials to serve the special needs of application environments. The previous knowledge of the physics and mathematical representation of material behaviors, as well as the utilization of already generated testing data, received specific attention by scientists. However, the exploration of available information is not always manageable, and machine intelligence can efficiently (computational resources, time) meet this challenge via high-throughput multidimensional search exploration capabilities. Moreover, the modelling of bio-chemical interactions with the environment and living organisms has been demonstrated to connect chemical structure with acute or tolerable effects upon exposure. Thus, in this review, a summary of recent computational developments is provided with the aim to cover excelling research and present challenges towards unbiased, decentralized, and data-driven decision-making, in relation to increased impact in the field of advanced nanomaterials manufacturing and nanoinformatics, and to indicate the steps required to realize rapid, safe, and circular-by-design nanomaterials.', authkeywords='artificial intelligence | data-driven engineering | in silico design of materials | machine learning | manufacturing | nanomaterials', citedby_count=20, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='H2020', fund_no='814588', fund_sponsor='Horizon 2020 Framework Programme'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85136462123', doi='10.3390/en15155680', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='FTCN: A Reservoir Parameter Prediction Method Based on a Fusional Temporal Convolutional Network', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zhang H.', afid='60105111;60021623;128494695', affilname='China University of Petroleum (East China);Sinopec;Qingdao)', affiliation_city='Qingdao;Beijing;Qingdao', affiliation_country='China;China;China', author_count='7', author_names='Zhang, Hongxia;Fu, Kaijie;Lv, Zhihao;Wang, Zhe;Shi, Jiqiang;Yu, Huawei;Ge, Xinmin', author_ids='56907949500;57854948700;57855150700;57203867829;57854948800;25951655200;36469983100', author_afids='128494695;128494695;128494695;60105111;60021623;60105111;60105111', coverDate='2022-08-01', coverDisplayDate='August 2022', publicationName='Energies', issn=None, source_id='62932', eIssn='19961073', aggregationType='Journal', volume='15', issueIdentifier='15', article_number='5680', pageRange=None, description='Predicting reservoir parameters accurately is of great significance in petroleum exploration and development. In this paper, we propose a reservoir parameter prediction method named a fusional temporal convolutional network (FTCN). Specifically, we first analyze the relationship between logging curves and reservoir parameters. Then, we build a temporal convolutional network and design a fusion module to improve the prediction results in curve inflection points, which integrates characteristics of the shallow convolution layer and the deep temporal convolution network. Finally, we conduct experiments on real logging datasets. The results indicate that compared with the baseline method, the mean square errors of FTCN are reduced by 0.23, 0.24 and 0.25 in predicting porosity, permeability, and water saturation, respectively, which shows that our method is more consistent with the actual reservoir geological conditions. Our innovation is that we propose a new reservoir parameter prediction method and introduce the fusion module in the model innovatively. Our main contribution is that this method can well predict reservoir parameters even when there are great changes in formation properties.

It does so by integrating knowledge of potential dangers in the design process and developing methods to design undesirable effects out of the innovation. Recent discussions have highlighted several challenges in conceptualizing safety and integrating the value into the design process. Therefore, some have argued to design for the responsibility for safety, instead of for safety itself. However, this idea has not been developed further. In this article, we develop an approach to Safe-by-Design, grounded in care ethics, which builds on the idea of designing for responsibility and can deal with the complexity that is inherent to the conceptualization of safety. We describe five ways in which care ethics contributes to the conceptualization of Safe-by-Design: (1) It suggests the development of ‘circles of care’ in which stakeholders share the responsibility for safety; (2) it recognizes the importance of considering safety as something that is situated in the surroundings of a technology, instead of as a property of the technology itself; (3) it acknowledges that achieving safety is labour that requires an ongoing commitment; (4) it emphasizes that the way in which we relate to technology impacts its safety; and (5) it recognizes the role of emotions in assessing safety.

A multi-pronged financial strategy included attracting federal research funds, leasing university land, technology transfer income and endowment from gifts and equity in university-originated firms in varying past and future proportions. Bottom-up initiatives proliferated, filling technology transfer and start-up support gaps in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Insulating material, as the core of electrical power equipment and electrified transportation asset, faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The goal of carbon neutral and the urgent need for innovation in electric power equipment and electrification assets are first discussed. The engineering challenges constrained by the insulation system in future electric power equipment/devices and electrified transportation assets are investigated. Insulating materials, including intelligent insulating material, high thermal conductivity insulating material, high energy storage density insulating material, extreme environment resistant insulating material, and environmental-friendly insulating material, are categorised with their scientific issues, opportunities and challenges under the goal of carbon neutrality being discussed.

Methods: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 115,775 CA aged 12-17 years, proxy-reported through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. We calculated post-vaccination infection risk after one dose of BNT162b2, and described the illness profile of CA with post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to unvaccinated CA, and post-vaccination side-effects. Findings: Between August 5, 2021 and February 14, 2022, 25,971 UK CA aged 12-17 years received one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. The probability of testing positive for infection diverged soon after vaccination, and was lower in CA with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination reduced proxy-reported infection risk (-80·4% (95% CI -0·82 -0·78) and -53·7% (95% CI -0·62 -0·43) at 14–30 days with Delta and Omicron variants respectively, and -61·5% (95% CI -0·74 -0·44) and -63·7% (95% CI -0·68 -0.59) after 61–90 days). Vaccinated CA who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta period had milder disease than unvaccinated CA; during the Omicron period this was only evident in children aged 12-15 years. Overall disease profile was similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated CA. Post-vaccination local side-effects were common, systemic side-effects were uncommon, and both resolved within few days (3 days in most cases). Interpretation: One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 90 days in CA aged 12-17 years. Vaccine protection varied for SARS-CoV-2 variant type (lower for Omicron than Delta variant), and was enhanced by pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severity of COVID-19 presentation after vaccination was generally milder, although unvaccinated CA also had generally mild disease. Overall, vaccination was well-tolerated.

For example, the initiative can fail if design solutions do not achieve the required quality, which, in turn, is influenced by factors such as domain knowledge, problem complexity, and incentive structures. Thus, there lies a need to systematically design crowdsourcing initiatives.

Earned value management (EVM) is the most common method to evaluate and further predict a project in terms of time and cost. Because of poor accuracy in forecasting different durations, the application of the EVM for schedule performance prediction has been limited. Therefore, in this paper, the Kalman filter was used to analyze the data and compare the results with those of a few hybrid machine learning (HML) techniques. The innovation of this study comes in the face of the prediction of the project time and cost by efficient machine learning algorithms based on some directly measurable variables. For this purpose, 398 data points from five different dam projects were used to predict two output variables by hybrid schemes of multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm combined with the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), herein referred to as MLP-GA and MLP-PSO, respectively. Four input variables, namely earned schedule (month), earned value ($), actual progress (%), and actual cost (%), were considered for time prediction, and the time (month) was considered as an input variable for cost prediction. The results showed that early warnings for the risk of delay in project schedule and cost were generated in months 1 and 8 by the MLP-PSO, months 1 and 11 by the MLP-GA, and rather months 7 and NV (no value) for the Kalman filter, indicating the fast operation coupled with high accuracy of the HML algorithms, as compared to the Kalman filter.

This increase occurred in an environment characterized by rapid technological innovation, including genetic engineering, and commercial hybrid varieties with short life cycles. An important question, then, is whether and how breeders and farmers have learned about the optimal planting density. In this paper, we use unique and detailed U.S. farm-level data, consisting of more than 400,000 planting choices from 1995–2016, to assess the nature of learning about seeding density. Importantly, we control for unobserved confounders through both hybrid and farm-level fixed effects. We find that the variance in planting rates for a given hybrid has decreased over time, and that farmers tend to plant a given variety at higher rates over time. This is consistent with Bayesian learning in which risk-neutral farmers possess priors consistently below the true optimal rate. We cast doubt on risk aversion as a credible explanation for this finding by analyzing the contrasting evolution of soybean planting rates (a crop with exogenously different agronomic determinants of seed density). We interpret our results as evidence of inertia: the initial bias in maize farmers' priors is tilted towards the optimal planting rates of varieties planted in the past. One implication of the finding that farmers historically underinvested in seeding rates is that eliminating this tendency could result in productivity gains.\", authkeywords='Bayesian learning | inertia | maize hybrids | productivity | seeding density | uncertainty', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NIFA', fund_no='20186702327682', fund_sponsor='National Institute of Food and Agriculture'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85120054182', doi='10.1109/TE.2021.3126694', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Procedure for the Determination of the Student Workload and the Learning Environment Created in the Power Electronics Course Taught Through Project-Based Learning', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Herrero-De Lucas L.C.', afid='60028442;60024695;60014907', affilname='Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Universidad de Valladolid;Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena', affiliation_city='Madrid;Valladolid;Cartagena', affiliation_country='Spain;Spain;Spain', author_count='5', author_names='Herrero-De Lucas, L.

This procedure also makes it possible to analyze how different teaching variables are affected by workload and to visualize the learning environment generated in the course. Background: When the project-based learning (PBL) methodology is used in a course, if the students' workload is not properly planned and controlled, important variables in the educational environment, such as the teaching organization and the students' approach to learning, can be affected. The PBL methodology may even become unfeasible as it affects the other courses with which it shares year and semester. This justifies the need to know the student workload of a subject. The previous research has presented procedures for establishing student workload. However, they use questionnaires with a high number of questions. A questionnaire with many questions affects the reliability of students' answers. The questionnaire presented in this article reduces the number of questions without affecting the results obtained and it is easily applicable to other courses. Research Questions: The questions to be answered in this research are: 1) is the workload of the students, when using the PBL methodology in a course, in line with the one established in the syllabus? and 2) is the learning environment created in the course as expected? Methodology: The methodology used to obtain the necessary data is based on students completing weekly surveys, two critical incident questionnaires (CIQs), and a final survey. The aim was always to minimize the number of questions to be answered, ensuring that the data collected provided a true picture of the workload and the educational environment. Findings: The analysis of the data obtained by applying the procedure provides mechanisms to control the workload, ensure involvement and motivation, improve students' academic results and show the learning environment created in the course. The implementation of this method, during three academic years, has allowed to test its effectiveness, validate some of the initial hypotheses, and confirm the conclusions of some previous studies.\", authkeywords='Active learning | approaches to learning | cooperative learning (CL) | engineering curriculum | perceived workload | project-based learning (PBL) | student workload', citedby_count=7, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85112462225', doi='10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102374', pii='S0166497221001553', pubmed_id=None, title='Systematizing serendipity for big science infrastructures: The ATTRACT project', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Wareham J.', afid='60113192;60028883;60019778;60011373', affilname='Universitat Ramon Llull, ESADE;IESE Business School;Organisation Européenne pour la Recherche Nucléaire;Technical University of Denmark', affiliation_city='Barcelona;Barcelona;Geneva;Lyngby', affiliation_country='Spain;Spain;Switzerland;Denmark', author_count='6', author_names='Wareham, Jonathan;Pujol Priego, Laia;Romasanta, Angelo Kenneth;Mathiassen, Thomas Wareham;Nordberg, Markus;Tello, Pablo Garcia', author_ids='6701663400;57193545572;57202199330;58534737300;31967758000;57222356025', author_afids='60113192;60028883;60113192;60011373;60019778;60019778', coverDate='2022-08-01', coverDisplayDate='August 2022', publicationName='Technovation', issn='01664972', source_id='14726', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='116', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='102374', pageRange=None, description=\"Big Science Research Infrastructures (BSRIs) are tremendous sources of ‘deep-tech’ with the potential to foment alternative commercial applications in diverse industries.

Given these challenges, research is needed to understand if- and how-serendipitous innovations can be purposefully developed from BSRIs. In this study, we analyse ATTRACT, a novel initiative funded by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program, which funded 170 projects with €100,000 each to develop a proof-of-concept commercial application of BSRI technologies within one year. Our analysis of this dataset identifies three modes employed by researchers to come up with alternate applications: (1) combining different technologies, (2) applying technology into a different field, and (3) using artificial intelligence or machine learning. In a second step, we conducted multinomial logistic regressions using the project data, expert evaluations, and a questionnaire to identify the antecedents associated with the pursuit of each of the three modes. Our findings suggest that scientists and engineers develop many new ideas about novel potential applications of BSRI technologies in their daily work.

A conceptual model is proposed, using a multi-case study approach involving high-tech start-ups that have attended accelerator and incubator programs in Greater London, United Kingdom. The research involved 32 semistructured interviews with chief executive officers and cofounders of start-up companies. Our findings suggest that entrepreneurs are influenced by various forms of knowledge spillover which assist in determining the strategic decision of the company, in terms of formation, including partnerships or alliances, allocation of Research and Development budgets, and engagement in product innovation. Further observations confirm that high-tech start-ups focus on a fast pace of constant product innovation to cover identified gaps in the market.

The review is organized in four aspects. Firstly, a systematic examination of the structural damping theories and a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of damping characteristics for long-span bridges are presented. Secondly, an extensive summary of the working principles, excitation systems, and application status of long-span bridge excitation technology are provided. Thirdly, the research progress of time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency domain methods for long-span bridge damping identification based on ambient excitation is deeply analyzed, and the latest achievements in the areas of intelligent, automated, and uncertainty quantification of damping identification are systematically elaborated; in addition, the damping identification methods based on forced vibration and their application status are summarized. Lastly, the paper identifies directions for further research in four areas: damping theory, excitation technology, sensing systems, and identification methods. The findings from this review offer a theoretical foundation for the development of damping theory and identification method for long-span bridge structures.

Whether researchers are using high performance computers to solve complex differential equations modeling climate change or using effective social media strategies to engage the public in a discourse about the importance of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, cyberinfrastructure (CI) has become our most powerful tool for the creation and dissemination of scientific knowledge. With this sea change in the scientific process, tremendous discoveries have been made possible, but not without significant challenges. The Research Innovation with Scientists and Engineers (RISE) team was created to address some of these challenges. Over the past two years, Penn State Institute for Computational and Data Sciences' (ICDS) research staff have partnered with RISE CI experts who facilitate research through a variety of CI resources. These include, but are not limited to, Penn State's high performance computing resources (Roar), national resources such as the Open Science Grid and XSEDE, and cloud services provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Using funds provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) CC∗program, the RISE team has had direct engagement through multiple activities that benefit research projects conducted at Penn State.

Nowadays, the development of innovation sensing systems and the construction of the sensing mechanism to improve the analytical performance of compounds remain a major challenge. Herein, we construct an advanced photoinduced thermocatalytic chemiluminescence (PI-TC-CL) gas-sensing system via the introduction of a Z-scheme heterojunction Ag3PO4/Ag/Bi4Ti3O12to achieve higher efficient detection of H2S. The unique electron transport path of the Z-scheme heterojunction and the LSPR effect of Ag nanoparticles fascinate the generation of the photoinduced electron-hole pair on the surface of catalysts when stimulated by LED lamps and slow down the recombination of electron-hole pairs under thermal conditions. Thus, based on the cooperative effect of the Z-scheme heterojunction AgPO/Ag/BTO and PI-TC-CL system, we have successfully established an efficient H2S CTL detection system, which has a response three times higher than that on the traditional CTL system and even 45 times higher than that on BTO and ranges among the best of the state-of-the-art CTL performance in H2S detection with the linear range of 0.095-8.87 μg mL-1and a limit of detection of 0.0065 μg mL-1.

Accelerated discovery, and impact from such discoveries have come from convergence approaches across disciplines, sectors, institutions, and the multiple communities seeking the common goal of innovations that transform. The classic simultaneous pursuit of fundamental understanding and application has been termed Pasteur s quadrant, where use-inspired basic research occurs. In the classic schematic developed by Donald Stokes, three quadrants represent research approaches using a 2D plane in which the vertical dimension represents the quest for understanding (basic research) and the horizontal dimension represents the consideration of use (applied research). The three outer quadrants are Bohr s (pure basic research), Edison s (pure applied research), and Pasteur s (useinspired basic research). Viewing each of these axes as a continuum, we label the previously unnamed but contributory cell as the Innominate quadrant, where a nonzero amount of discovery and applied research also has value in generating scientific tools, novel processes or products that inform the other quadrants. More importantly, a reimagined Pasteur s quadrant schema shows a third dimension of Transformations over Time, occurring through a continuous fluid interchange among the quadrants. Transformative innovations may originate from any single quadrant. While work in Pasteur s quadrant has been shown to be highly productive, a dynamic fluid interchange among the quadrants is often involved and generates transformative advances at a faster rate.

Indeed, between 2014 and 2021, 72% of publications in this domain resulted from European research in diverse fields such as engineering, design, music composition, art-making, and so forth. These studies took advantage of advanced VR affordances, such as head and hand motion trackers to synchronize an avatar in real-time, live streaming of a video into a VR headset screen to create artwork, etc. Four main topics were explored: (a) new creativity techniques involving a virtual upgrade of traditionally used techniques, virtual sketching and prototyping, as well as sophisticated interactive virtual menus and motion tracking systems, (b) the right digital self-representation for enhancing creativity and the degree to which users identify with the “persona avatar” in the context of user-centered innovations, (c) the impact of physical and social virtual contextual cues on creative performance, and (d) the perception of virtual reality by creativity and innovation professionals.

Complex construction conditions and severe operation environment lead to great technical challenges in their construction and long-term safety guarantee. The main research results of the National Research and Development Program of China during the 13th Five-Year Plan period “Key technologies for construction and long-term safety protection of extra-high earth-rock dams under complex conditions” are introduced as follows: the mechanism of particle breakage on deformation of dams, flow rules during loading and creeping of rockfill materials as well as the damage process of in-situ structures of overburden soils are revealed, and the constitutive theories that can be used to predict the deformation developing process and distribution of dam body and foundation are established accordingly. The numerical methods for complex contacting problems and initiation and development of 3D cracks in high earth and rockfill dams are developed based on the computational contact mechanics. The practical consolidation theory of unsaturated soils is developed to simulate the deformation-seepage coupling effects during the whole life spans of high earth and rockfill dams. A new thermo-mechanical coupled method is proposed to account for the temperature-induced stress and damage of concrete slabs in concrete-faced rockfill dams. A high performance software platform is established to simulate the whole process including dam filling, impoundment and operation of high earth and rockfill dams.

Under the background of the innovative development of the global energy and power industry, the development of power generation towards low-carbon, clean, intelligent, electrification, marketization and internationalization will become an inevitable trend. The current situation, existing problems and future technological development path of low-carbon transformation scientific and technological innovation in the field of power generation in China were analyzed in the direction of clean and efficient coal power generation, renewable energy power generation, nuclear energy, advanced energy storage and hydrogen energy. In order to adapt to the new power system based on new energy, the traditional main power supply gradually changes to the basic power supply in China′s coal-fired power units. However, most of the domestic units are designed according to the basic load, and the key indicators such as load regulation range and load change rate are far behind those of abroad. In addition, there are still the problems of low efficiency and high carbon emission of old units. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the research on flexible and intelligent power generation, ultra-high parameter coal-fired power generation, new and efficient coal-fired power generation, and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies. The hydropower technology in China has been improved in an all-round way and formed the integration capacity of whole industrial chain. However, it also needs to make efforts in high head, large capacity and ultra-low head generator units, safe and efficient operation and smart power stations. The wind power technology in China has made comprehensive research, deployment and breakthroughs in wind turbine design and manufacturing, wind farm development and operation and maintenance, equipment testing and certification, and standard system construction, and it also needs to tackle the key problems in the direction of large-scale, lightweight and low-cost wind power generation, promote the application of next-generation information and communication technology, and improve the localization rate of key components. The photovoltaic power generation technology in China is basically synchronized with the world. High efficiency and low cost are its main technical direction. The solar thermal power generation technology in China lags behind foreign countries with respect to systematic design and integrated operation, and it is necessary to develop solar thermal power generation technology with large capacity, high parameters, long-time heat storage and low cost. The geothermal power generation and marine power generation technologies in China are in the stage of basic research or technology research and verification, technical research and engineering demonstration still need to be strengthened in the future. In terms of nuclear filed, China already has a complete nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear industry system, and nuclear power technology is in the forefront of the world, however, problems still exist in basic technology, process, materials, software and other aspects. It is also necessary to strengthen the research in advanced nuclear energy systems and comprehensive utilization of nuclear energy, adhere to the technical route of closed nuclear fuel cycle, and continuously improve the safety of nuclear energy utilization. In terms of energy storage technology, At present, China′s energy storage filed is moving towards large-scale development, but there is still a gap between the energy storage industry and the overall healthy development, and the energy storage technology still needs to be developed in the direction of safety, long life, low cost and large-scale. In terms of hydrogen energy technology, China has formed a complete industrial chain, but hydrogen mainly comes from gray hydrogen. In the future, the development of electrolytic water to produce green hydrogen technology supported by large-scale photovoltaic power generation or wind power generation will become the focus.', authkeywords='carbon neutralization | carbon peak | energy storage | hydrogen energy | low carbon transformation | nuclear energy | power generation | renewable energy', citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85136448079', doi='10.1007/s12274-022-4387-2', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Erratum to: Multi-stage anisotropic etching of two-dimensional heterostructures (Nano Research, (2022), 15, 6, (4909-4915), 10.1007/s12274-022-4193-x)', subtype='er', subtypeDescription='Erratum', creator='Li L.', afid='60104544;60104290;60103153;60030743;60019533', affilname='Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon;Singapore University of Technology and Design;Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology;A-Star, Institute of Materials Research and Engineering;Tianjin University', affiliation_city='Daejeon;Singapore City;Ulsan;Singapore City;Tianjin', affiliation_country='South Korea;Singapore;South Korea;Singapore;China', author_count='8', author_names='Li, Lin;Dong, Jichen;Geng, Dechao;Li, Menghan;Fu, Wei;Ding, Feng;Hu, Wenping;Yang, Hui Ying', author_ids='57298738600;55541722400;37661213900;57226231953;57203243940;57210518533;57215373688;7406563870', author_afids='60019533;60104544;60104290-60019533;60019533;60030743;60104544-60103153;60019533;60104290', coverDate='2022-07-01', coverDisplayDate='July 2022', publicationName='Nano Research', issn='19980124', source_id='17500155020', eIssn='19980000', aggregationType='Journal', volume='15', issueIdentifier='7', article_number=None, pageRange='6790-6791', description='The affiliation of the author “Feng Ding” was unfortunately mistakenly marked.

Based on the test data of 32 m simply supported box beam of Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway in the speed range of 420 km/h of EMU, the adaptability of 32 m simply supported box beam used in the 350 km/h high speed railway to 400 km/h operation of EMU was done by the analyses of its natural frequency, vertical stiffness and dynamic response under the action of EMU. Research conclusions:(1)The measured vertical natural frequency of 32 m simply supported box beam is 6.68~7.03 Hz, which is greater than the fundamental frequency limit of 5.1 Hz determined by the relevant literature according to the 440 km/h simulation calculation. (2) The vertical stiffness of the 32 m simply supported box beam can ensure the safety and ride comfort of EMU running at 400 km/h. (3) The structure bearing capacity of the 32 m simply supported box beam meets the operating load requirement of EMU running at 400 km/h. (4) The maximum measured vertical vibration acceleration of 32 m simply supported box beam is 0.27 m/s2, which is less than limit value of 5.0 m/s2 specified in Code for Design of High Speed Railway. (5) Within the speed range of 420 km/h of the EMU, the measured wheelset lateral force of main line is generally less than 20 kN, the measured values of the lateral amplitude at the midspan of beam and the top of pier are small, and the measured lateral relative displacement of the rail support on both sides of the adjacent beam ends of the ballastless track is less than the limit value of 1 mm specified in Code for Design of High Speed Railway. The vertical and lateral stiffness of 32 m simply supported box beam used in the existing 350 km/h high speed railway can ensure the safety and ride comfort of EMU running at 400 km/h.

With a not large, but old public asset, the Italian context may represent an interesting case to start investigating difficulties and problems in the management of the social housing system that, as it occurs in most Mediterranean countries, arise when the public housing rental model is adopted. In the paper, a multiple case study on five Italian regional public Agencies responsible for the social housing system is discussed. In particular, the theoretical lens of process theory and ambidextrous business process management are adopted to study the Agencies’ “problematic situation” and identify innovative solutions to address it. The paper contributes to research and practice on process innovation and digital transformation of public administrations: three important lessons are derived and discussed also taking into consideration Industry 5.0, the vision on the future of industry recently proposed by the European Commission.

Females have been shown to report greater reactogenicity and generate higher humoral and cellular immune responses than males following vaccination with several different vaccines. Whether this is also the case for COVID-19 vaccines is currently unknown, as COVID-19 vaccine study data disaggregated by sex are not routinely reported. Therefore, we have assessed the influence of sex on reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Methods: Vaccine efficacy was assessed in 15169 volunteers enrolled into single-blind randomised controlled trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in Brazil and the UK, with the primary endpoint defined as nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants were electronically randomised to receive two standard doses of vaccine or the control product. Logistic regression models were fitted to explore the effect of age and sex on reactogenicity, and linear models fitted to log-transformed values for immunogenicity data. Reactogenicity data were taken from self-reported diaries of 788 trial participants. Pseudovirus neutralisation assay data were available from 748 participants and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG assay data from 1543 participants. Findings: 7619 participants received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 7550 received the control. Vaccine efficacy in participants after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4243 females and 3376 males) was 66.1% (95% CI 55.9-73.9%) in males and 59.9% (95% CI 49.8-67.9%) in females; with no evidence of a difference in efficacy between the sexes (vaccine by sex interaction term P=0.3359). A small, statistically significant difference in anti-spike IgG was observed (adjusted GMR 1.14; 95% CI 1.04-1.26), with higher titres in females than males, but there were no statistically significant differences in other immunological endpoints. Whilst the majority of individuals reported at least one systemic reaction following a first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, females were twice as likely as males to report any systemic reaction after a first dose (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.37-2.77). Measured fever of 38°C or above was reported in 5% of females and 1% of males following first doses. Headache and fatigue were the most commonly reported reactions in both sexes. Interpretation: Our results show that there is no evidence of difference in efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in males and females. Greater reactogenicity in females was not associated with any difference in vaccine efficacy.

Vehicle-mounted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are of significance in mobility experience and traffic surveys. However, as a new type of product, UAVs lack general rules in modeling design and the process of development decision making presents some fuzzy characteristics, which make the evo-lution and iteration of modeling design more complex. Based on the theories of Kansei Engineering, this study utilized support vector regression (SVR) to establish a correlation model between design factors and preference degree. Because the perceptual evaluation knowledge is fuzzy and uncertain, the paper applied cross-validation and grid search methods to find the optimal parameters. The parameters of the SVR model were adjusted to meet the need for stable learning and for endurance of the noise from subjective experience data to improve the prediction effect and generalization ability. In addition, by means of the Kano model, the customers’ cognition of demand types was quantified to obtain the prioritization of UAV modeling design elements, as well as to compare with the preference scores to validate the feasibility of this research. It was found that the SVR model proposed in the study could effectively predict user preference (R2 = 0.763, RMSE = 0.057). For the UAVs with a higher preference score, the modeling characteristics were consistent with the attrac-tive, one-dimensional or must-be quality elements in the results of the Kano model, which verified the reliability of the study.

Despite this perception, investigations of their survival-based behaviors, select anatomical features, and biological composition have led to the creation of several beneficial technologies for medical applications. In this review, we briefly explore these mosquito-based innovations by discussing how unique characteristics and behaviors of mosquitoes drive the development of select biomaterials and medical devices. Mosquito-inspired microneedles have been fabricated from a variety of materials, including biocompatible metals and polymers, to mimic of the mouthparts that some mosquitoes use to bite a host with minimal injury during blood collection. The salivary components that these mosquitoes use to reduce the clotting of blood extracted during the biting process provide a rich source of anticoagulants that could potentially be integrated into blood-contacting biomaterials or administered in therapeutics to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Mosquito movement, vision, and olfaction are other behaviors that also have the potential for inspiring the development of medically relevant technologies. For instance, viscoelastic proteins that facilitate mosquito movement are being investigated for use in tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Even the non-wetting nanostructure of a mosquito eye has inspired the creation of a robust superhydrophobic surface coating that shows promise for biomaterial and drug delivery applications. Additionally, biosensors incorporating mosquito olfactory receptors have been built to detect disease-specific volatile organic compounds. Advanced technologies derived from mosquitoes, and insects in general, form a research area that is ripe for exploration and can uncover potential in further dissecting mosquito features for the continued development of novel medical innovations.', authkeywords='bioinspiration | biomimetic microneedles and microprobes | insect eye | insect proboscis | insect saliva | insect-based olfactory sensor | insect-derived anticoagulants | insect-derived polymers | nanostructured superhydrophobic coating', citedby_count=10, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='AFOSR', fund_no='FA9550-14-1-0398', fund_sponsor='Air Force Office of Scientific Research'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85133304848', doi='10.3390/rs14133036', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Prediction of Potential Geothermal Disaster Areas along the Yunnan–Tibet Railway Project', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Chen Z.', afid='60273019;60027363;60026846;126678589', affilname='Aerospace Information Research Institute;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Chengdu University of Technology;International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals', affiliation_city='Beijing;Beijing;Chengdu;Beijing', affiliation_country='China;China;China;China', author_count='7', author_names='Chen, Zhe;Chang, Ruichun;Guo, Huadong;Pei, Xiangjun;Zhao, Wenbo;Yu, Zhengbo;Zou, Lu', author_ids='57223193109;57641064900;57214151151;14058672500;57223191443;57776429300;57638529200', author_afids='60026846-126678589;60026846;126678589-60026846-60273019-60027363;60026846;60273019-60027363;60026846;60026846', coverDate='2022-07-01', coverDisplayDate='July-1 2022', publicationName='Remote Sensing', issn=None, source_id='86430', eIssn='20724292', aggregationType='Journal', volume='14', issueIdentifier='13', article_number='3036', pageRange=None, description='As China’s railways continue to expand into the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, the number of deep-buried long tunnels is increasing.

In this paper, the Yunnan–Tibet railway project was the study area. Landsat-8 images and other spatial data were used to investigate causes and distributions of geothermal disasters. A collinearity diagnosis of environmental variables was carried out. Twelve environmental variables, such as land surface temperature, were selected to predict potential geothermal disaster areas using four niche models (MaxEnt, Bioclim, Domain and GARP). The prediction results were divided into four levels and had different characteristics. Among them, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and kappa values of the MaxEnt model were the highest, at 0.84 and 0.63, respectively. Its prediction accuracy was the highest and the algorithm results are more suitable for the prediction of geothermal disasters. The prediction results show that the geothermal disaster potential is greatest in the Markam-Deqen, Zuogong-Zayu and Baxoi-Zayu regions. Through jack-knife analysis, it was found that the land surface temperature, active faults, water system distribution and Moho depth are the key environmental predictors of potential geothermal disaster areas.

Reviewing and learning from the examples and history of successful CCS practices in advanced countries will help other countries, including China, to promote and deploy CCS projects using scientific methods. This paper shows that the establishment of major science and technology CCS infrastructures in advanced countries has become the main source of CCS technological innovation, cost reduction, risk reduction, commercial promotion, and talent training in the development and demonstration of key CCS technologies. Sound development of CCS requires a transition from pilot-scale science and technology infrastructures to large-scale commercial infrastructures, in addition to incentive policies; otherwise, it will be difficult to overcome the technical barriers between small-scale demonstrations and the implementation of million-tonne-scale CCS and ten-million-tonne-scale CCS hubs. Geological CO2 storage is the ultimate goal of CCS projects and the driving force of CO2 capture. Further improving the accuracy of technologies for the measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) of CO2 storage capacity, emission reduction, and safety remains a problem for geological storage. CO2 storage in saline aquifers can better couple multiple carbon emission sources and is currently a priority direction for development. Reducing the energy consumption of low-concentration CO2 capture and the depletion of chemical absorbents and improving the operational efficiency and stability of post-combustion CO2 capture systems have become the key constraints to large-scale CCS deployment.

Since the 1920s, rye has been a subject of chromosome research. It started by plotting its mitotic and meiotic chromosomes to de-termine genome size. After controversial evidence, it became clear that the base number is n = 7. However, structural differences exist between species within the genus Secale. Some rye populations even carry accessory chromosomes evolutionary derived from the A genome. The development of tetraploid strains significantly promoted chromosome analysis. Various techniques have tried to stabilize the disturbed chromosome pairing of the induced tetraploids. Although slight improvements could be achieved, they did not lead to a breakthrough. However, the various an-euploid derivatives of the polyploids found major advances in the genetic analysis of rye. Tri-somics, telo-trisomics, and reciprocal translocation have served as important tools for gene map-ping. Since the 1970s, various chromosome banding techniques have stimulated scientific pro-gress. The seven haploid chromosomes could be diagnosed unequivocally, not only in S. cereale but also in related species. These findings led to a clear homoeologous assignment to the genomes of related grass species such as wheat, barley, rice, etc. Current applications of in situ fluorescence staining methods, such as GISH and FISH, allow even more precise results, depending on the specificity of the DNA samples. Advanced preparation techniques are supplemented by the variety of innovations in the field of molecular genome analysis. They replace complex cytological ex-aminations. In this way, introgressions can be safely detected by DNA markers and be much more detailed.

As the human-machine interface information data of the mechanical equipment system are numerous, complex, and changeable, operators often make operation mistakes, misread and misjudge, and do not give timely feedback, resulting in task failure or, in serious cases, major mechanical faults and accidents. Therefore, the human-machine interface data information is screened, and the information useful for the operator is directly obtained according to the target set by the operator, so as to effectively solve the complex and changeable data information in the information system.

This study investigates the perceptions of first-year students on their future role and the competencies they need by developing an engineering role model on the business model of Tracey and Wiersema. The premise of the PREFER-model is that most vacancies for junior engineers fall into one of three roles: Product Leadership (i.e., focus on radical innovation), Operational Excellence (i.e., focus on process optimization), and Customer Intimacy (i.e., focus on client-tailored solutions). A survey was administered to first-year students from the three largest engineering degrees in Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands. A total of 197 students in Belgium (KU Leuven – Engineering Technology), 89 students in Ireland (TU Dublin – Engineering), and 372 students in the Netherlands (TU Delft – Aerospace Engineering) participated. In this survey, students were also asked to express their preference for three fictional job vacancies reflecting the three different roles. The results showed that first-year students do not have a clear view of the future and have an idealized perception of the engineering profession centred around the Product Leadership role. Students were also found to overestimate their level of preparedness when it comes to their mastery of competencies.

The theoretical significance of the article is that, based on the authors’ analysis, the social and economic prerequisites for the strategic development of universities in the conditions of war and post-war period are characterized; a comprehensive analysis of political, economic, social and demographic and technological factors that cause opportunities/threats to the strategic development of universities is presented. The practical significances of the article are that the main challenges that will hinder the strategic development of universities in the conditions of war and post-war period were highlighted; strategic tasks for universities based on current peculiarities of social and economic environment are proposed. It is substantiated that in the process of strategic development of universities it is advisable to conduct an in-depth comprehensive analysis of political, economic, social and demographic and technological factors that directly affect or will likely affect their (universities) strategic goals and objectives. The method of PEST analysis was used to comprehensively characterize the set of the most significant factors of influence. It is determined that the significant political factors are large-scale military aggression of the Russian Federation, domestic political center-oriented processes and prevailing of populist paradigms, national policy on economic development/global leadership/competitiveness. Among the economic factors are significant losses of social and economic potential of the country\\'s regions, significant destruction of infrastructure, loss of human potential due to external migration, rising unemployment, loss of export positions, relocation of business from the occupied territories. Among the social and demographic factors, it was substantiated significant migration flows, declining of pace of population reproduction, accelerating the aging process, increasing the share of single-parent families, the unity of Ukrainian society in the direction of countering the enemy, a high level of patriotism, the formation of a democratic political nation and civil society, responsibility, ability to radically change the further history of Ukraine. The key challenges that create opportunities/threats for the strategic development of universities are identified: the need to restore the material and technical base, human resources and research infrastructure of universities, bringing training programs in line with regional labor markets, introduction of retraining/adult training programs, optimization and reengineering of business processes, providing flexibility in responding to changing conditions, introducing the concept of result-based university management, increasing the level oftechnologization and digitalization of business processes, strengthening the research component in activities along with deepening the level of international partnership. Strategic vectors of development of universities during post-war period are proposed: the need to intensify cooperation with partners, focus on research aimed at overcoming the greatest societal challenges, involving a wide range of stakeholders in the process of co-production and innovation, building \"smart specialization\" of each university, implementation of certain principles (positioning of university, synergy, integration, technological development, involvement, optimality) in the process of strategizing, incorporation of ICT in order to improve internal business processes of universities, widespread implementation of the so-called partnership model of university management, implementation of communicative and information function in cooperation with refugees, accelerating training of engineering and technological specialties.', authkeywords='institutions of higher education | post-war period | social and economic prerequisites | strategic development | strategic management | war', citedby_count=1, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85139926826', doi='10.34190/ejel.20.4.2327', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A Systematic Mapping of E-Learning Research: An Interdisciplinary and Multi-paradigmatic Perspective from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Peters M.', afid='60002581', affilname='Universitat Oberta de Catalunya', affiliation_city='Barcelona', affiliation_country='Spain', author_count='3', author_names='Peters, Mitchell;Perez-Navarro, A.;Fabregues, Sergi', author_ids='57208740414;26422428700;55216489400', author_afids='60002581;60002581;60002581', coverDate='2022-06-30', coverDisplayDate='30 June 2022', publicationName='Electronic Journal of e-Learning', issn=None, source_id='21100201056', eIssn='14794403', aggregationType='Journal', volume='20', issueIdentifier='4', article_number=None, pageRange='451-466', description='E-learning research is a dynamic and ever-expanding interdisciplinary field. Research in this area is often conducted at the intersection of social science, cognitive science, learning sciences, as well as engineering and computer science. Common concerns in the field include ambiguity and confusion toward how best to approach methodological design as well as tensions around whether the field is coherent or fragmented. E-learning research has been characterized as a multi-paradigmatic knowledge field with distinct theoretical foundations and a horizontal knowledge structure composed of “specialist” languages. There has been a remarkable increase in systematic literature reviews in the field, representing a burgeoning research industry. Although there is a clear division between technical and social scientific approaches, there is a scarcity of literature which attempts to synthesize the evidence on how e-learning research is conducted across disciplines and within distinctive research communities from a multi-paradigmatic perspective. The objective of the current study is to systematically map research done in the field of e-learning in higher education at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) within the frame of an institutional analysis. The aim is to identify key features and distinctive approaches to research across disciplines in this area from a multi-paradigmatic perspective. A systematic mapping review has been conducted, synthesizing research published between 2015-2020 by authors affiliated with the UOC. The study identified 291 articles, the majority of which use quantitative approaches following both design-based research methods as well as design and development research aims across three distinct research areas (a) educational research, (b) discipline-based education research and (c) learning engineering research. Fragmentation was identified across distinct research areas and communities of practice, particularly between research aims and the methods used to achieve these aims. By empirically examining the claims about methodological capacity and coherence in e-learning research, recommendations are offered for reorienting the field by: (a) increasing interdisciplinary collaboration through integrated research agendas; (b) supporting the expanding profession of the ‘learning engineer’; and (c) promoting methodological capacity, clarity and innovation.', authkeywords='e-learning | educational technology | interdisciplinary | research methods | systematic review', citedby_count=2, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='UOC', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Universitat Oberta de Catalunya'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85135499695', doi='10.3969/j.issn.2096-1693.2022.02.021', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Progress and prospects of manufacturing technology for oil country tubular goods in China', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Feng Y.', afid='60089797;60083489;60073573;128437341;126289995;126223820;126157798;124034405;113076321', affilname='Baoshan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.;Tubular Goods Research Center of CNPC;Tarim Oilfield Company;Tianjing Pipe Corporation;Ltd.;Ltd.;Ltd.;PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company;PetroChina Changqing Oilfield Company', affiliation_city=\"Shanghai;Xi'an;Korla City;Tianjin;Chengdu;Hengyang;Baotou;Chengdu;Xi'an\", affiliation_country='China;China;China;China;China;China;China;China;China', author_count='12', author_names='Feng, Yaorong;Li, Helin;Han, Lihong;Zhang, Zhonghua;Zhang, Chuanyou;Cheng, Haitao;Bai, Zhenquan;Tian, Yan;Shi, Xiaoxia;Xie, Junfeng;Le, Hong;Zheng, Mingke', author_ids='9243477200;27170000400;55523103082;57215374966;57832357400;57832193500;7202524298;57832524300;57832357500;56805826900;57831862200;57832524400', author_afids='60083489;60083489;60083489;60089797;128437341;126289995;60083489;126157798;126223820;60073573;124034405;113076321', coverDate='2022-06-29', coverDisplayDate='29 June 2022', publicationName='Petroleum Science Bulletin', issn='20961693', source_id='21101089141', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='7', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='229-241', description='The main progress of localization technology of Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) in China is summarized, and the development direction of OCTG is put forward.

This paper aims to solicit the view of stakeholders on the awareness of formwork design practices in the GCI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted the interpretivism research philosophy and inductive reasoning. Through a semi-structured interview guide, data was collected. The data (interview) recorded was transcribed using the Amberscript web application. This study used thematic analysis in analyzing the data collected using Nvivo 10 software. Findings: The data collected from the 22 professionals indicated that the respondents were unaware of the concept of formwork design and its practice, neither could they speak to the existence of any specific regulation nor code of practice. However, the respondents established that there was a need to design formwork and stated some benefits of it. Originality/value: From the literature, little research has been done on formwork design and its context in the GCI is yet to be explored. This research attempts to fill this gap. The findings indicate that to practice formwork design, there must be education and training of human resources for formwork design, there must be a code of practice to guide the design process and legal backing through policies and regulations to mandate the design.', authkeywords='Architecture | Construction innovation | Design innovation | Engineering | Formwork | Ghanaian construction industry', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85133724183', doi='10.24136/eq.2022.019', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Impact of cooperation flexibility on innovation flexibility in SMEs', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Tomášková E.', afid='60029543;60013826', affilname='Masaryk University;Brno University of Technology', affiliation_city='Brno;Brno', affiliation_country='Czech Republic;Czech Republic', author_count='2', author_names='Tomášková, Eva;Kaňovská, Lucie', author_ids='55364267300;56481574800', author_afids='60029543;60013826', coverDate='2022-06-25', coverDisplayDate='25 June 2022', publicationName='Equilibrium.

Furthermore, innovations are perceived as an important factor in company strategy, which can differentiate the company from the competition. Purpose of the article: This present study investigates the problems of cooperation flexibility and innovation flexibility in manufacturing companies among electrical engineering companies in the Czech Republic. The aim of this paper is to identify the impact of cooperation flexibility on innovation flexibility in small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Methods: A questionnaire addressed to SMEs in the form of the Likert scale was prepared to gather information about cooperation flexibility and innovation flexibility. All parts of the questionnaire were tested using Cronbach Alpha. Spearman correlation and regression analysis were used for analysis. Findings & value added: The results of the research show that external cooperation flexibility and internal cooperation flexibility is related to innovation flexibility in SMEs. Results of the research show that there is a positive relationship 1) between external cooperation flexibility and innovation flexibility and 2) between innovation flexibility and business performance at SMEs. The findings of the research contribute to an understanding of the relationship between cooperation flexibility, innovation flexibility and also innovation performance. The novelty value of this paper lies in its perception of flexibility as having two parts, namely external (with suppliers and customers) and internal cooperation flexibility.

During the FW process, welding heat is generated by the pressure and high-speed relative motion between the joint interfaces of the workpieces. After the joint interfaces and their neighborhood arrive at the thermoplastic state, the workpieces are pressed into a whole by upsetting. FW has a wide range of weldability (e.g., carbon steel, alloy steel, non-ferrous metals, other materials of the same kind, dissimilar metal materials, and metal and non-metal materials with completely different properties) and can obtain welded joints with excellent properties (closed to base metal) and fewer defects (e.g., cracks, pores, and segregation); thus, it has high reliability to welded joints. As its advantages, FW exhibits low energy consumption (i.e., 10%-20% of fusion welding), high efficiency (i.e., only a few seconds to realize an effective joining of the workpieces), and environmental friendliness (i.e., no welding rod, wire, flux, or protective gas and no arc, spatter, smoke, or slag as in fusion welding) and can easily realize automation and large-scale production. FW is widely used in high-tech manufacturing in various industries, including in the automobile, aviation, aerospace, nuclear energy, oil drilling, marine development, and electric power industries. On the basis of the classification and the brief description of FW, the present situation of the research, development, and application of the continuous-drive FW (CDFW) technology was comprehensively sorted out and analyzed in-depth in this paper.

Although this has weakened the sector, it is a real opportunity to assimilate and understand the role of technology, particularly BIM. In this context, the main objective is to draw conclusions on the role of BIM during and after Covid-19 through the analysis of the AEC industry in Morocco and the benchmarking of BIM contributions during this health crisis. A qualitative approach was conducted, including the analysis of the pre-Covid-19, Covid-19 and post-epidemic phases and the benchmarking of the contribution of BIM. This study demonstrates the inevitability of adopting critical thinking when it comes to solutions about the evolution of the construction sector and the practical implications for a successful revival of the AEC industry post-Covid-19.

This paper outlines the potential for self-healing within water infrastructure systems, a sector that has been slow to embrace system-wide approaches. A systematic review of the topic identifies emerging terminology and methods within the water domain, and the extent to which current research aligns with self-healing methodology is discussed. Finally, the steps that can be implemented to shift the water sector towards a self-healing perspective are explored through a case study of leakage management in water pipeline systems.', authkeywords='infrastructure | innovation | maintenance & inspection | management | UN SDG 9: Industry | water supply', citedby_count=2, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85132803803', doi='10.3389/fpsyg.2022.921840', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on Construction of High-Quality Application-Oriented Talent Cultivation System for Internet of Things Engineering: Based on Educational Psychology', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Nie Y.', afid='60089798;60073587', affilname='Luoyang Institute of Science and Technology;Henan University of Science and Technology', affiliation_city='Luoyang;Luoyang', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='4', author_names='Nie, Yalin;Wang, Haijun;Liu, Baoluo;Yang, Shangsen', author_ids='47962135300;57188702678;16318940700;36609674600', author_afids='60089798;60073587;60089798;60089798', coverDate='2022-06-02', coverDisplayDate='2 June 2022', publicationName='Frontiers in Psychology', issn=None, source_id='21100216571', eIssn='16641078', aggregationType='Journal', volume='13', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='921840', pageRange=None, description='High-quality talent cultivating Internet of Things (IoT) Engineering is the basis for the rapid development of IoT technology.

Among them, precision dairy technology can be one of the most important ways to realize the modern dairy industry. Farm management can be transformed from the group to the individual for high efficiency and production level. However, the current adoption of precision dairy technology was still lacking so far. Most research was focused on the influencing factors of technology application and development. Only a few explored the current adoption of precision dairy technology. This study aims to investigate the adoption behavior of precision dairy technology by dairy farmers. The research areas were selected as the dairy-producing bases in North China (Hebei Province, Henan Province, Shandong Province, and Shanxi Province). 345 valid samples were firstly collected for the latter use. A binary Logit regression was then used to construct the theoretical framework for the farmers' adoption of precision dairy technology, according to the farmers' behavior and innovation diffusion theory. The results showed that: 1) The adoption rates of automatic cup stripping, identification, milk recording, and estrus monitoring technology by dairy farmers were 64.9%, 57.7%, 56.2%, and 37.7%, respectively. 2) The non-adoption of new technologies was ever more costly for dairy farmers, particularly for the unaffordable investment in the early stage of technology. 3) All technology popularization levels, breeding scales, and average daily milk production presented a significant positive correlation on the adoption of four technologies. By contrast, there was a significant correlation with the other factors on the adoption of at least two technologies. Among the four technologies, the automatic cup stripping technology was the least affected by the breeding scale, policy subsidies, and technical training. The automatic identification technology was the most affected by the satisfaction of breeding income and education level. The automatic milk recording technology was the most affected by the average daily milk production, and policy subsidies without technical training. The automatic estrus monitoring technology was the least affected by the education level and average daily milk production without the policy subsidies, particularly the most influence from the breeding scale and technical training. Therefore, it is recommended to implement the different promotion measures for the four technologies. Specifically, the automatic cup stripping technology can be focused on small-scale farms, due to the least influence from the farming scale. The automatic estrus monitoring technology can be focused on large-scale breeding farms, technical popularization, and training for the strong skills of data management for the dairy farmers.\", authkeywords='agriculture automation | application status | dairy farmers | influencing factors | precision dairy technology | the north China region', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85140255035', doi='10.2174/2667387816666220429095834', pii=None, pubmed_id='35507801', title='Exploring the Patent Landscape and Innovation of Hydrogel-based Bio-inks Used for 3D Bioprinting', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Fatimi A.', afid='60088902', affilname='Université Sultan Moulay Slimane', affiliation_city='Beni Mellal', affiliation_country='Morocco', author_count='1', author_names='Fatimi, Ahmed', author_ids='23396673300', author_afids='60088902', coverDate='2022-06-01', coverDisplayDate='June 2022', publicationName='Recent Advances in Drug Delivery and Formulation', issn='26673878', source_id='21101062403', eIssn='26673886', aggregationType='Journal', volume='16', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='145-163', description='Background: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the patent situation for hydrogel-based bioinks used for 3D bioprinting globally.

Furthermore, the novel part, synthesized patents, is regarded as a breakthrough in hydrogel-based bioinks. Methods: The following research aspects of this study are based on data collection from selected patent databases. The search results are then analyzed according to publication years, classification, inventors, applicants, and owners, as well as jurisdictions. Results: Based on the earliest priority date, it is possible to precisely assume that 2004 is considered the starting year of patenting of hydrogel-based bioinks. Furthermore, 2020 was the year with the most patent documents. According to the findings, the United States, China, and the Republic of Korea are the most prolific countries in terms of patenting on hydrogel-based bioinks. The most prolific patenting companies are from the United States, Sweden, and Australia, while universities from the Republic of Korea and the United States are the academic institutions leading the way. Most inventions of hydrogel-based bioinks intended for hydrogels or hydrocolloids used as materials for prostheses or for coating prostheses are characterized by their function or physical properties. Conclusion: The state has been reviewed by introducing what has been patented concerning hydrogelbased bioinks.

Using natural materials as a guide, the ability to create high-performance biomaterials that control cell fate, and support the next generation of cell- and tissue-based therapeutics, is starting to emerge. Supramolecular chemistry takes inspiration from the wealth of noncovalent interactions found in natural materials that are inherently complex, and using the skills of synthetic and polymer chemistry, recreates simple systems to imitate their features. Within the past decade, supramolecular biomaterials have shown utility in tissue engineering and the progress predicts a bright future. On this 30th anniversary of the Netherlands Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering society, we briefly recount the state of supramolecular biomaterials in the Dutch academic and industrial research and development context. This review provides the background, recent advances, industrial successes and challenges, as well as future directions of the field, as we see it. Throughout this work, we notice the intricate interplay between simplicity and complexity in creating more advanced solutions. We hope that the interplay and juxtaposition between these two forces can propel the field forward. Supramolecular biomaterials based on noncovalent interactions hold the ability to rebuild some of the complexity of natural biomaterials in synthetic systems. While still in its infancy, the field is currently vigorously moving from fundamental experiments toward applications and products in the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine arena. Herein, we review the current state of the field in the Netherlands. While supramolecular biomaterials have incredible potential, systematic studies, balancing complexity and simplicity, efficient translation, and enhanced performance are all required for success of these strategies.

To the health care sector's benefit, the advent and proliferation of mobile devices have provided an opportunity for interventions that combine asynchronous technology-aided health services to improve the lives of the less privileged and marginalized people and their communities, particularly in developing societies. Objective: This study aimed to report on the perspectives of the different stakeholders involved in the study and to review an existing government mobile health (mHealth) program. It forms part of a study to design a re-engineered strategy based on the best demonstrated practices (considerations and methods) and learned experiences from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders within the digital health innovation ecosystem in South Africa. Methods: This study used an ethnographic approach involving document review, stakeholder mapping, semistructured individual interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations to explore, describe, and analyze the perspectives of its heterogeneous participant categories representing purposively sampled but different constituencies. Results: Overall, 80 participants were involved in the study, in addition to the 6 meetings the researcher attended with members of a government-appointed task team. In addition, 46 archived records and reports were consulted and reviewed as part of gathering data relating to the government's MomConnect project. Among the consulted stakeholders, there was general consensus that the existing government-sponsored MomConnect program should be implemented beyond mere piloting, to as best as possible capacity within the available resources and time. It was further intimated that the scalability and sustainability of mHealth services as part of an innovative digital health ecosystem was hamstrung by challenges that included stakeholder mismanagement, impact assessment inadequacies, management of data, lack of effective leadership and political support, inappropriate technology choices, eHealth and mHealth funding, integration of mHealth to existing health programs in tandem with Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals, integration of lessons learned from other mHealth initiatives to avoid resource wastage and duplication of efforts, proactive evaluation of both mHealth and eHealth strategies, and change management and developing human resources for eHealth. Conclusions: This study has only laid a foundation for the re-engineering of mHealth services within the digital health innovation ecosystem. This study articulated the need for stakeholder collaboration, such as continuous engagement among academics, technologists, and mHealth fieldwork professionals. Such compelling collaboration is accentuated more by the South African realities of the best practices in the fieldwork, which may not necessarily be documented in peer-reviewed or systematic research documents from which South African professionals, research experts, and practitioners could learn. Further research is needed for the retrospective analysis of mHealth initiatives and forecasting of the sustainability of current and future mHealth initiatives in South Africa.\", authkeywords='digital health innovation ecosystem | global digital health index | mHealth | MomConnect | patient-facing eHealth | practitioner-researcher | principles of digital development | re-engineering in health services | stakeholder-centered design | strong structuration theory | sustainable development goals', citedby_count=10, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85131903946', doi='10.1089/omi.2022.0055', pii=None, pubmed_id='35666517', title='Women in Systems Science and Gender Parity: Why and How to Democratize the \"technology, Innovation, and Society Nexus\"', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Hamdi Y.', afid='60040957;60010932', affilname='Institut Pasteur de Tunis;Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town', affiliation_city='Tunis;Cape Town', affiliation_country='Tunisia;South Africa', author_count='3', author_names='Hamdi, Yosr;Mulder, Nicola;Abdelhak, Sonia', author_ids='27867755000;7102238454;6603711657', author_afids='60040957;60010932;60040957', coverDate='2022-06-01', coverDisplayDate='1 June 2022', publicationName='OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology', issn='15362310', source_id='19001', eIssn='15578100', aggregationType='Journal', volume='26', issueIdentifier='6', article_number=None, pageRange='329-338', description='A career in systems science offers exciting prospects as well as challenges around the world, which are often underexplored or unknown.

Without endangering food production (and intensifying), GHG emissions come from all sources in animal husbandry. The aim of this study was to comprehensively reduce GHG emissions by applying a holistic process management model to one of the most popular cowsheds in Lithuania (260-seat boxing cowshed, cows are milked on site, computerized management of technological processes, productivity of 8600 kg of milk, barn system, and liquid manure). Considering the cow keeping technology applied on the farm, the equipment used, and the feed production and ration system, a model for the management of technological parameters of production processes was prepared for the farm. This model balanced trade-offs among animal welfare, cow productivity, production costs, and GHG and NH3 emissions. The aim of the research was the adaptation of the integrated model to fully control, manage, and optimize milk production processes through bio-and engineering innovations to implement climate-friendly feed production and feeding and feed rationing systems, to improve animal housing and working conditions, and to reduce GHG and NH3 emissions without increasing production costs. The environmental impact assessment was performed with SimaPro 9.1 process modeling software. Data from milk production, biomass cultivation, and feed preparation, transportation, and equipment were used from the Ecoinvent v3 database. Based on the LML-I calculation methodology, the effect of processes was determined. To quantify the potential emissions in the dairy farm, the emission factors were estimated using a life cycle assessment method per functional unit—1000 kg—of standardized milk. Grass silage, maize silage, and feed concentrate were found to account for the largest share of gas emissions—26.09% (107.39 kg CO2 eq. FU−1), 22.70% (93.44 kg CO2 eq. FU−1), and 21.85% (89.92 kg CO2 eq. FU−1) of the total CO2 emissions during the process, respectively. Considering the critical points of the classic SC scenario, the cultivation technology was adjusted, where 50% of N fertilizers were replaced by bioproducts (biological preparations). Both scenarios—classic SC (control variant) and Bio SC (variants using bioproducts)—were evaluated for comparison. The use of biopreparations in the categories reduced the environmental impact from 0.1% to 45.7% in dairy production technology grass silage, barley grain, hay production, and corn silage stocks. The carbon footprint of the sustainable bio-based milk production (0.393 kg CO2 eq. kg−1 FPCM (fat-and protein-adjusted milk)) was lower by 4.6% compared to the average Lithuanian classic dairy farm (0.412 kg CO2 eq. kg−1 FPCM). Based on this methodology, it is possible to assess many dairy farms and address critical points in an integrated way, which can help to improve the quality of dairy production and the environment.', authkeywords='fat-and protein-adjusted milk | GHG reduction | global warming potential | greenhouse gas | holistic management | milk production', citedby_count=2, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85131701028', doi='10.1093/jas/skac132', pii=None, pubmed_id='35419602', title='ASAS-NANP symposium: Mathematical modeling in animal nutrition: Limitations and potential next steps for modeling and modelers in the animal sciences', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Jacobs M.', afid='60194675;60112030;60020547;60015881;60014826;128262201;128261946', affilname=\"Sherbrooke Research and Development Centre;Physiologie, Environnement et Génétique pour l'Animal et les Systèmes d'Elevage (PEGASE);Texas A&M University;University of Guelph;South Dakota State University;Farmworx;FR Analytics B.V.\", affiliation_city='Sherbrooke;Saint-Gilles;College Station;Guelph;Brookings;;Wierden', affiliation_country='Canada;France;United States;Canada;United States;Netherlands;Netherlands', author_count='7', author_names='Jacobs, Marc;Remus, Aline;Gaillard, Charlotte;Menendez, Hector M.;Tedeschi, Luis O.;Neethirajan, Suresh;Ellis, Jennifer L.', author_ids='57190215371;54416199800;56988804400;57194133738;7005093079;57217318680;14037315500', author_afids='128261946;60194675;60112030;60014826;60020547;128262201;60015881', coverDate='2022-06-01', coverDisplayDate='1 June 2022', publicationName='Journal of Animal Science', issn='00218812', source_id='35941', eIssn='15253163', aggregationType='Journal', volume='100', issueIdentifier='6', article_number='skac132', pageRange=None, description='The field of animal science, and especially animal nutrition, relies heavily on modeling to accomplish its day-To-day objectives. New data streams (\"big data\") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of \"new\"modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: Technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-And-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine \"old\"and \"new\"modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained.

Their effectiveness can be improved by using new generation sensors able to realize widespread, low-cost monitoring at increasing spatial and temporal resolution. The main aim of the research is, therefore, to develop a versatile strain transducer capable of monitoring elements of different nature such as slopes, buildings and linear infrastructures performing distributed real-time measurements. The paper introduces a new smart hybrid transducer (NSHT), a strain transducer belonging to the distributed optical fiber sensors family, appositely designed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional solutions. An experimental laboratory setup was arranged to test its reliability and a comparison between measurements retrieved by the NSHT and traditional devices were done. The results showed that the NSHT is able to perform strain monitoring with spatial resolution as high as 5 cm and accuracy comparable to that of the traditional devices. Finally, an integrated structural and geotechnical monitoring system architecture based on its use is proposed for the Petacciato site, where a deep-seated landslide affects the historical town and some infrastructures. To realize a single communication line in such a complex monitoring system, where multiple elements have to be monitored, a specific tool was also designed and tested, that allows the exact spatial identification of the various elements under observation. Although on-site validation is needed, these early results are encouraging and demonstrate that the NSHT is a low-cost transducer with great potential and that, looking forward, it can be used to increase the effectiveness of the existing EW, SHM and SHMR Systems.

Nowadays, bioscience has introduced some ideas which can be fulfilled by 4D printing. Blending time with variations caused by the situation has many beneficial aspects such as perceptibility and adaptability. Since 4D printing can create a dynamic structure with stimuli-responsive materials, the applications of smart materials, stimulus, and 3D printing are the effective criteria in 4D printing technology. Smart materials with their flexible properties can reshape, recolor, or change function under the effect of the internal or exterior stimuli. Thus, an attractive prospect in the medical field is the integration of the 4D printing approach along with smart materials. This research aims to show the most recent applications of 4D printing technology and smart materials in medical engineering which can show better prospective of 4D printing applications in the future. Also, it describes smart medical implants, tissue engineering, and bioprinting and how they are being used for the 4D printing approach in medical engineering applications.

Adopting energy-efficient technology innovations has been recognised as the most promising approach to reducing energy consumption in buildings. However, such technology adoption is considerably lacking due to traditional techno-economic thinking, which lacks human focus. Energy culture has been identified as a research domain that successfully overcomes the traditional techno-economic focus of technology diffusion. However, available energy culture studies on adopting energy-efficient technology innovations in buildings are limited to exploring specific energy cultures rather than investigating holistic energy culture maturity, which guides incremental diffusion of energy-efficient technology innovations. Conversely, culture maturity has been studied in other cultural research domains such as safety cultures. Therefore, this study aims to develop an energy culture maturity conceptual framework that provides a holistic view of energy culture maturity for adopting energy-efficient technology innovations in buildings. The research method this study implemented was a scoping literature review method, using Web of Science, Scopus, and Engineering Village research databases. The findings of the study include the development of factor categorisation with 14 main factors and 11 subfactors and the development of three energy culture maturity stages, as well as the development of the energy culture maturity conceptual framework as the principal outcome.

This review is in part a catalog of success in an effort to inform the process of innovation. Tissue engineering has recruited new technologies and developed new methods for engineering tissue constructs that can be used to mitigate or model disease states for study. Key to this antecedent statement is that the scientific effort must be anchored in the needs of a disease state and be working toward a functional product in regenerative medicine. It is this focus on the wildly important ideas coupled with partnered research efforts within both academia and industry that have shown most translational potential. The field continues to thrive and among the most important recent developments are the use of three-dimensional bioprinting, organ-on-a-chip, and induced pluripotent stem cell technologies that warrant special attention. Developments in the aforementioned areas as well as future directions are highlighted in this article.

A wide range of emerging technologies such as blockchain, internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotics and many others have changed the way in which firm value chain activities or processes were executed traditionally. The mining industry has also witnessed the introduction of these emerging technologies in various processes from the exploration stage to the final processing of ores. The purpose of this paper is to understand the pace of adoption of emerging technologies in the Indian mining industry and identify the challenges that managers confront while adopting emerging technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertook qualitative research. Data collection was done in two stages. Secondary research was conducted to arrive at a repository of use cases of the adoption of emerging technologies in the global mining industry. Primary data collection was also done. The insights on emerging technology adoption and challenges faced in the Indian mining industry were captured by in-depth interviewing of subject matter experts. The authors interviewed 21 mining subject matter experts with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. The responses were content analyzed by thematic content analysis. Technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) frameworks were applied to segregate different factors affecting the adoption of emerging technologies in the Indian mining industry. Findings: Emerging technologies such as blockchain, IoT, AI, ML, robotics has been applied across various mining engineering value chain activities such as in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling. However, emerging technologies adoption was hindered because of a lack of managerial awareness, cultural inertia, substantive upfront investments and the nature of intangible benefits in the short run. Research limitations/implications: The research applied technology adoption frameworks in the mining industry. The authors used TOE and DOI frameworks to understand the challenges faced by Indian mining firms. The research findings, thus added to the conversation of TOE and DOI frameworks in the context of the Indian mining industry. Practical implications: The research finding would help mining firm managers to anticipate the challenges with respect to technology adoption. This would allow mining executives to create a proper technology adoption plan and intervene proactively. The research would also provide information about the steps taken by competing firms with respect to emerging technologies adoption. The research would help managers to decide technology implementation steps in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling to be undertaken for successful adoption of emerging technologies. Technology firms could gain insights into the issues faced by mining firms in adopting emerging technologies. This research would help managers to influence organizational technology policy and endorse the addition of pro-technology policies in mining activities. Policymakers involved in the mining sector could also incorporate industry-level policy decisions so as to facilitate the adoption of emerging technologies among mining firms and remove the barriers to the adoption of emerging technologies. This would create an opportunity for technology providers to redesign product offerings, which could be a good fit for Indian mining firms. Originality/value: Indian mining industry contributed significantly to the Indian economy. Despite this, limited focus has been put regarding the adoption of emerging technologies in the mining industry. Mining managers did not have any framework to understand the challenges faced in the adoption of technologies across the mining value chain that is in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling. This study focused on identifying those challenges through the use of technology adoption frameworks.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors evaluated the perception of knowledge about social entrepreneurship of a group of students from a university certified as Ashoka Changemaker Campus to check if there are differences by gender and disciplinary area. The population was 140 students, to whom a validated instrument was applied. Findings: The results shed light on the few differences among students in the business, engineering and health sciences disciplines compared to those enrolled in the humanities and social sciences concerning knowledge and experience in social entrepreneurship. The findings also indicate gender equality in the perception of knowledge and experience of innovation and social entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: The sample size in the different disciplinary areas is a limitation of this research. However, the findings are valuable in terms of gender and the study being conducted in the first university certified as a Changemaker Campus in Latin America. Practical implications: Underlying the statistics and the hypotheses is important in improving students' experience and expanding their equitable opportunities to learn about and implement innovative proposals for social entrepreneurship projects. Social implications: Training in equality and inclusion contributes to an equitable and socially just society, especially when this training aims to bring new possibilities to society.

Inspired by biological functional surfaces, many new applications have been developed for biomimetic surfaces, such as structural colors, superhydrophobicity, self-cleaning, and optical performance improvement. Femtosecond laser direct writing technology is a processing method that can accurately control the material structures in the micro-nano scale. By adjusting the femtosecond laser processing parameters, 3D processing beyond the diffraction limit can be realized in a variety of material systems. The unique feature of the femtosecond laser direct writing technology is that it can realize the cross-scale modification of materials, and prepare more complex micro-nano structures through simulation and optimization. In this review, the characteristics and processing advantages of femtosecond laser are first introduced, and then the applications of femtosecond laser in the fields of structural colors, superhydrophobicity, anti-reflection, and bionic compound eyes are described in detail. In addition, the applications of the femtosecond laser fabrication of bionic functional micro-nano structures in other fields are briefly illustrated. Finally, the development of the femtosecond laser fabrication of bionic functional micro-nano structures is prospected. Progress In the long and brutal process of natural selection and biological evolution, various organisms have evolved their own unique functions to adapt to the environment. With the help of microscopic imaging, it has been found that the surfaces of many organisms are covered with many micro-nano structures. It is the different characteristics of these micro-nano structures that enable the organisms to adapt to extreme living environments. In line with the principle of learning from nature, researchers have carried out a lot of research on the micro-nano structures of biological surfaces, using different processing methods to imitate the structures of organisms in a variety of material systems, realizing the structural colors of material surfaces, superhydrophobicity, anti-reflection, large field of view angles and other functions. At present, nano-imprint printing, 3D printing, plasma etching, photolithography, ultra-fast laser processing, and other technologies have been used to achieve the preparation of bionic functional micro-nano structures. Among them, the femtosecond laser processing technology has the characteristics of high precision, cold processing, and diffraction limit breaking, and has an obvious technical complementarity with the traditional processing methods. Nature may be said to be the guide to the extreme manufacturing of modern industry. Therefore, the bionic design born from learning from nature presents unique functional characteristics due to the micro-nano structures of their unique surfaces widely used in radar, submarine, aircraft, corrosion resistant coating, and self-cleaning occasions. The femtosecond laser direct writing technology is widely used in the controllable fabrication of bionic micro-nano structures. A femtosecond laser has two obvious characteristics. One is that the duration of a femtosecond laser pulse is very short, which inhibits the formation of thermal action zones around the laser focus area. The other is that a femtosecond laser has a very high peak power, which far exceeds that of the Coulomb field in atoms. This kind of technology is highly accurate, simple, and efficient. Compared with other micro-nano manufacturing technologies, it also has the advantage of good compatibility with materials. Bioinspired micro-nano surfaces have been widely concerned in the industrial field and the academic circles due to their wide application background, such as self-cleaning, oil-water separation, and fog collection. This paper reviews the new progress in the preparation of biomimetic functional micro-nano structures by a femtosecond laser, and shows their properties in structural colors, surface wettability, optical performance regulation, and so on. The potential application prospects of the femtosecond laser preparation of biomimetic functional surfaces in present and future are discussed. Conclusion and Prospect Due to the limitation of the length of this article, other excellent femtosecond laser fabrication of bionic micro-nano functional structures and their applications cannot be introduced in detail. The femtosecond laser direct writing technology can be used to simulate and fabricate the surface micro-nano structures of lotus leaves, nepenthes plants, rice leaves, butterfly wings, and gecko fingerprints. These structures include micro-pores, micro-columns, periodic structures, and self-assembled structures. The microstructures can realize self-cleaning, anti-ice, oil-water separation, bubble manipulation, structure colors, fog collection, underwater bubble collection, droplet transport, shock resistance, adhesion, and other functions. In this paper, the applications of femtosecond laser direct writing to fabricate bionic functional micro-nano structures in structural colors, superhydrophobicity, and optical performance control are reviewed. The biological surface micro-nano structures have provided infinite inspiration for researchers and stimulated a large number of excellent works on the ultra-fast laser fabrication of bionic functional surfaces. However, there are still some problems, such as how to quickly and efficiently simulate complex natural surfaces and how to accurately reproduce cross-scale micro-nano structures. There is no doubt that the solution of these problems will further enhance the competitiveness of the femtosecond laser fabrication of bionic functional micro-nano structures. It is believed that with the improvement of femtosecond laser micro-nano manufacturing capability and the continuous new inspiration brought to us by nature, the bionic multi-functional surfaces should create more application value in biological, medical, environmental protection, and other fields in future.

Traditional AM technology is essential in printing macroscale structures. However, its printing accuracy is limited, and the difficulty of meeting the demanding requirements for printing accuracy in many micro-nano manufacturing fields has grown tremendously. For example, the printing accuracy of microfluidic chips in the biological field is on a microscale. In micro-nano optics, the period of photonic crystals requires printing accuracy to reach hundreds of nanometers. Additionally, 3D printing technology can manufacture high-precision and complex three-dimensional structures and has huge industrial application needs in micro-nano electromechanical systems, micro-nano photonic devices, micro-fluidic devices, biomedicine and tissue engineering, and new materials. Thus, research on micro-nano 3D printing technology has received widespread attention. Progress Recently, researchers have developed various types of micro-nano 3D printing technologies suitable for several materials (organic polymers, metals, glass, ceramics, biological materials, composite materials, etc.). Micro-stereolithography (single-photon absorption) and two-photon polymerization using photopolymerization are the most representative micro-nano-scale 3D printing technologies. Micro-nano 3D printing technology based on photopolymerization uses the continuous, pulsed laser or LED light as its energy source. The photopolymerization reaction process is controlled at the micro-nano scale to print and manufacture the micro-nano 3D structure. First, the optical micro-nano resolution of 3D printing mainly depends on the diffraction limit of the optical system, such as the Rayleigh criterion 0. 61 X/NA, where A and NA are the wavelength of the light source and numerical aperture of the imaging system, respectively. Sub-micron resolution can be obtained using a light source with a shorter wavelength, such as the UV beam, and an objective lens with a higher NA. Additionally, the lithography resolution, which is far beyond the optical diffraction limit (below 100 nm) can be achieved using ultra-fast femtosecond pulse lasers to excite the nonlinear response of the material, such as two-photon or multiphoton absorption effect. Finally, most of the micro-nano 3D printing optical systems are sets of micro-imaging systems, and the lithography resolution is improved using the latest and frontier super-resolution micro-imaging technology. For example, by introducing super-resolution microscopy, stimulated emission depletion ( STED ), two-color non-degenerate two-photon absorption (ND-TPA), and other technologies, the lithography resolution can be increased to less than 10 nm. Currently, micro-nano 3D printing is one of the most frontier advanced manufacturing fields in the world. In 2014, micro-nano 3D printing was listed in the top 10 disruptive innovations of the year by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Technology Review. With the rapid improvement of prototyping technology for printing accuracy, efficiency, and other performance requirements, plane projection 3D printing has developed rapidly recently. Compared with traditional micro stereolithography, plane projection 3D printing has advantages including accuracy, efficiency, and equipment cost-efficiency. In 2015, researchers from Carbon 3D and the University of North Carolina proposed a layer scanning-based manufacturing method, known as the continuous liquid interface production (CLIP), which increased the printing rate by about 100 times. Recently, the most disruptive and transformative ultra-high-precision surface projection stereolithography (PfiSL) and femtosecond projection two-photon lithography (FP-TPL) technologies have been undergoing rapid development. These technologies can break through the inherent contradiction between the printing precision and size and can achieve high-precision, high-efficiency, large-size, and low-cost manufacturing. Conclusions and Prospect This paper present an up-to-date review of the development history, trends, and latest research progress in high-resolution, large-scale micro-nano 3D printing technology, achieved by different photochemical principles and optical methods. The rapid development of micro-nano 3D printing technology has completely changed the manufacturing of arbitrarily designable 3D structures from macro- to microscale. Projecting 3D printing has become the most important and rapidly developing micro-nano 3D printing method due to its performance and cost-effectiveness. We systematically reviewed different principles of optical 3D printing technology, from one-photon absorption, two-photon absorption, super-resolution imaging-assisted one/two-photon absorption principle. Furthermore, we reviewed the performance of different optical 3D printing systems, from single-focus serial scanning, multi-focus parallel scanning, surface projection, layer scanning, and volume manufacturing. We focused on the contradiction between print throughput and print resolution. Additionally, we discussed specific challenges in manufacturing structures with sub-diffraction limit feature size and large-scale area. The projection of 3D printing technology has been continuously developed and improved through the combination of advanced microscope imaging methods, such as STED, light-sheet imaging, random access scanning, and computed tomography. These methods have been successfully applied to various 3D printing systems, effectively improving the demand for high-resolution printing of macroscale 3D structures. Finally, some new and innovative methods in the field of optics are the main driving force for developing of micro-nano 3D printing. The photopolymerization micro-nano 3D printing technology will become an essential technique in laser precision micromachining in the future, and promote the development of intelligent manufacturing by leaps and bounds.', authkeywords='3D printing | laser technique | optical micro-fabrication | printing efficiency | resolution | stereolithography | two-photon polymerization fabrication', citedby_count=10, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85131685531', doi='10.3787/j.issn.1000-0976.2022.05.015', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Innovation of natural gas science and technology management mode under the strategy of \"Gas Daqing\" in China', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Dang L.', afid='60004598', affilname='China National Petroleum Corporation', affiliation_city='Beijing', affiliation_country='China', author_count='6', author_names='Dang, Lurui;Gu, Sui;Liu, Jianqing;Wang, Fuping;Zhang, Yong;Peng, Zicheng', author_ids='35751815000;57201259232;57734686600;57189356320;57218471538;57678681600', author_afids='60004598;60004598;60004598;60004598;60004598;60004598', coverDate='2022-05-25', coverDisplayDate='25 May 2022', publicationName='Natural Gas Industry', issn='10000976', source_id='19559', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='42', issueIdentifier='5', article_number=None, pageRange='142-147', description='In the Sichuan Basin, there are abundant natural gas resources with great exploration and development potential and natural gas production has already stepped into the stage of rapid development.

An intervention was implemented in one of the low-lying areas of Basirhat Municipality (West Bengal, India) that included a number of action programs in order to address household- and community-level water-induced challenges. Design/methodology/approach: A research study was undertaken to identify the root causes of the problems that are generally spawned from geomorphological, hydro-fluvial, climatic factors and processes and the situation becomes complicated when many other cumulative problem-contexts layovers the existing ones. A number of social and technological innovations were tested in the field and this paper critically examined the intervention processes and outcomes. It was implemented through participatory process by involving related stakeholders working at that scale so that necessary public acceptance is received for scaling up, at least, in the similar physical, social, economic and institutional contexts. Findings: The problem conceptualization process, spatial assessment for contextualizing the problem, design of interventions for different scales, development of project deployment strategies from field-based learnings contributed in developing a total solution based on fusing of household-level technical solutions, social innovations and actions for community engagements towards sustainability. Mobilized community members in addressing local inundation and waterlogging crisis. Satellite image-based maps shown to make them understand the upper-lower connection of drainage. People also developed their own action plans and engaged themselves in resuscitation of an old canal, removed the garbage that resulted in improved drainage conditions in the area. Research limitations/implications: Pandemic due to COVID 19 and its related prolonged lock down, West Bengal State Assembly Election, closure of municipal governance system due to the forthcoming municipal election, closure of educational institutions, closure of Anganwadi Centre in the field area were the limitations. Due to the lock down, it was difficult for the team to maintain the time frame as well as the budget. As per the Election’s Code of Conduct gets released no public meeting was allowed without permission, people in the vicinity became suspicious, hence movement of the team members got restricted. Practical implications: Due to the COVID protocols, the team could not organise mass training programs. It was difficult for the team members to commute in public/private transport, hence filed work got impacted. As the team could not access data from the health department, they developed a strategy of generation data on body mass index, mid-upper arm circumferences and waist-to-hip ratios to understand the status of health and nutrition of the community. It was difficult to access the Public Health Engineering Department’s laboratory situated in the municipality for water sample test. Cost escalated due to extension of the project time. Social implications: During the second phase (wave) when people lost access to health facilities they requested the team to stop field visit. Women’s empowerment through acquiring knowledge and skill on treatment and safe storage of drinking water at home. Men appreciated and recognized this, which improved the status of women in the society. Children after expressing their willingness to learn the new technology of water purification were given handholding training by their mothers and knowledge transfer has taken place in the next generation.

Satellite image-based maps to understand the upper-lower connection of drainage helped them develop their own action plans and engaged themselves in resuscitation of an old canal, removed the garbage that resulted in improved drainage conditions in the area. Originality/value: Household-level solutions include supply of low cost, easy operable, sustainable water purifiers, community-level solution focused on securing water-related challenges at social/public gathering places and wider catchment area level solutions include the engagement of local communities to drain out stagnant waters by clearing drains, creating/digging small canals through collective actions. Geo-spatial techniques (topographical mapping, spatial survey, water quality tests) along with social methods such as participatory appraisals for gathering information on human health, public awareness campaigns and partnership development with local government agencies were the major activities performed as part of the implementation of interventions.

A sophisticated technical solution is usually not critical, especially in the early stages of a startup. It is not necessary to be an experienced software engineer to start a software startup. However, this can become problematic as the solution matures and software complexity increases.

In particular, information technology (IT) implementation is a field that needs more significant focus and a wider range of creative interventions. The author would undoubtedly see a more human-focused approach to HR management (HRM) in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) era, where enterprises and workers have had to reinvent themselves in a brief amount of time drastically. Following the nationwide lockdown caused by COVID-19, many companies were pushed to opt for remote working, which presents both difficulties and benefits for workers and employers. So the purpose of this study is to investigate some key consequences resulting from COVID-19’s effect on multiple HRM roles, how technology is empowering and fostering HRM, informative forecasts based on how organizations are coping and finally, the path in the post-pandemic environment. Design/methodology/approach: The COVID-19 epidemic has had a significant effect on every area of the global economy. It has had severe implications for public institutions and raises particular questions for medical schools. The emergence of COVID-19 has disrupted many activities and requires intense and prompt attention from medical educators. So, HR leaders now face the difficult task of managing the interests of workers and their corporations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has proved that this is not just a difficult time but rather a testing time for companies across the globe to check and ensure how swiftly they adapt themselves by thinking and planning differently. An enterprise evolves with nature, and change is unavoidable if performance and productivity are to improve. Changes in structure, technology and priorities are overgrowing, posing big obstacles to leaders. Corporations worldwide have looked to technology to pursue creative solutions to some of the world’s most pressing problems. This study provides a review of articles related to the role of technology in HRM in the COVID-19 period. The analyzed articles are divided into three groups, including articles related to the role of information communication technology, cloud computing and teleworking in HRM in the COVID-19 era. Also, the most important key challenges are collected, and solutions are provided for them. Findings: In times of trouble, authentic leadership shines through. The actions of pioneering HR leaders throughout the COVID-19 epidemic will significantly affect their respective organizations. When COVID-19 expanded around the world, HR agencies made their workers’ health and welfare a top priority. HRM’s long-term sustainability can be dictated by how they deal with the current crisis. Web-based solutions, such as cloud computing, will also address a vital resource allocation gap. It illustrates the possible efficacy of patient-oriented, web-based applications built on result-driven design, which continues to be validated by more testing and assessment. Many studies have emphasized business innovation as a necessity due to changes in the environment and various challenges and requirements facing businesses. The challenge of observing social distance and limiting face-to-face business services is the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic era. Research limitations/implications: This study could entail a joint international collaboration initiative among research centers, allowing information about COVID-19 impacts to be shared more easily. It will favor a worldwide policy to find a response to the epidemic but still address cultural and social issues. Practical implications: The survey concludes that, whenever possible, employers and medicals should explore remote working opportunities in all industries to alleviate uncertainty and improve employee psychological well-being. The facilitating considerations and problems are often addressed in order to supply practical views for developing cloud-based solutions. Originality/value: This research aims to lead to the advancement of scientific knowledge in the HRM area through the use of IT-based technology. It allows businesses to reinvent HRM techniques to save money and maximize efficiency without compromising their employees’ life quality and well-being.

In the future, oil and gas will still be the key demand for energy consumption and security, and the integration and innovation of conventional & unconventional petroleum geology will be the main challenge of discipline development. The emergence of conventional & unconventional petroleum geology is mainly due to the needs of reconstructing the theoretical framework of petroleum geology, reunderstanding the superbasin resource system, redeveloping applicable key technologies, reshaping the strategic role of energy transformation, and rerecording the exploration and development demonstration template. Conventional & unconventional petroleum geology is a geological discipline that studies the formation mechanism, orderly symbiosis, differential enrichment, recovery law and development strategy of conventional oil and gas reservoirs and unconventional oil and gas areas in the \"symbiotic enrichment\" basin, such as Ordos, Sichuan and other superbasins. It pays attention to the two resources of conventional oil and gas and unconventional oil and gas, and focuses on the evaluation of the characteristics and matching relationship of \"source rock, reservoir, oil bearing, mobility, recoverability and economy\" around the main source rock strata.

This research aims to provide references for the improvement of the disciplinary development policy systems, the scientific deployment of special plans and the optimization of the research layouts. [Method/Process] The study is based on the text analysis and information correlation method. First, the hotspots of basic research, technological innovation, and industry reports were sorted out. Then, the agglomeration and guiding role of multi-dimensional innovation elements on hotspots was studied, such as national strategic needs, policy-oriented promotion, and R&D capital investment. Accordingly, the development trend of subject hotspots was considered. [Results/Conclusions] Taking crop breeding as an example, the hotspots were divided into three categories based on this analytical method. There are intense research interests in the following directions, containing modern biological breeding technologies such as gene-editing breeding, molecular marker-assisted breeding, genome breeding, and transgenic technology, as well as mining of key genes for crop trait regulation and research on molecular regulation mechanism of traits, and crop trait improvement, in which the innovation elements are concentrated. Therefore, a series of high-quality results are expected to be produced in the future. The investments in innovation elements are highly concentrated, and the corresponding results are expected to be further expanded in the fields of the protection, utilization and accurate identification of germplasm resources, and innovations of targeted and precise breeding technologies such as molecular design and digital intelligent breeding. Classical breeding technology systems such as ploidy breeding, genetic transformation systems, tissue culture, and cell engineering breeding, as well as crop phenotype research, are calling for the new research momentum.

On the basis of previous studies, this review focuses on revealing how the research of next-generation OWC technology should be carried out to meet the requirements of B5G/6G for practical deployment. The research, development and engineering transformation of the OWC systems are a paragon of interdisciplinary. It involves a wide discussion on how to build a high-speed, multi-user, full-duplex, white-light OWC system based on existing technologies by showing the innovations and trade-offs at various levels with material, device, air-interface technology, system and network architecture. The compatibility of OWC is emphasized and some advanced heterogeneous OWC systems are presented, which involves the combination or integration of various functions such as sensing, near-infrared (NIR) beam-steering, positioning and coexistence with radio frequency (RF) communication.

Application Design: The study is implemented within a five-week module focused on developing the entrepreneurial mindset as part of a required course on supply chain management technology. The supporting pedagogical interventions include authentic learning, information literacy, a mix of low stakes and high stakes assessment, and parallel scaffold and collaborative learning. The module is assessed through a metacognitive reflection centered around self-regulated learning, seeing value, and lifelong learning. Findings: First, the metacognitive reflections showed 50% of participants would approach their work differently (e.g., make changes to management and scheduling, using credible sources, obtaining writing assistance through the university writing lab). Second, participants were able to articulate soft skill development and/or subject matter expertise as benefits as it relates to entering the workforce.

The numerous objectives of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement have various levels of interdependence, making it difficult to ascertain the influence of changes to particular indicators across the whole system. In this analysis, we aimed to detect and rank the complex interlinkages between objectives of sustainability agendas. Methods: We developed a method to find interlinkages among the 17 SDGs and climate change, including non-linear and non-monotonic dependences. We used time series of indicators defined by the World Bank, consisting of 400 indicators that measure progress towards the 17 SDGs and an 18th variable (annual average temperatures), representing progress in the response to the climate crisis, from 2000 to 2019. This method detects significant dependencies among the time evolution of the objectives by using partial distance correlations, a non-linear measure of conditional dependence that also discounts spurious correlations originating from lurking variables. We then used a network representation to identify the most important objectives (using network centrality) and to obtain nexuses of objectives (defined as highly interconnected clusters in the network). Findings: Using temporal data from 181 countries spanning 20 years, we analysed dependencies among SDGs and climate for 35 country groupings based on region, development, and income level. The observed significant interlinkages, central objectives, and nexuses identified varied greatly across country groupings; however, SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) and climate change ranked as highly important across many country groupings. Temperature rise was strongly linked to urbanisation, air pollution, and slum expansion (SDG 11), especially in country groupings likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown, such as Africa. In several country groupings composed of developing nations, we observed a consistent nexus of strongly interconnected objectives formed by SDG 1 (poverty reduction), SDG 4 (education), and SDG 8 (economic growth), sometimes incorporating SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG 16 (peace and justice). Interpretation: The differences across groupings emphasise the need to define goals in accordance with local circumstances and priorities. Our analysis highlights global partnerships (SDG 17) as a pivot in global sustainability efforts, which have been strongly linked to economic growth (SDG 8). However, if economic growth and trade expansion were repositioned as a means instead of an end goal of development, our analysis showed that education (SDG 4) and poverty reduction (SDG 1) become more central, thus suggesting that these could be prioritised in global partnerships. Urban livelihoods (SDG 11) were also flagged as important to avoid replicating unsustainable patterns of the past.

This paper focuses on the one-step methylation reaction of benzene with methanol or toluene with methanol to obtain high-purity p-xylene (BM-PX/TM-PX), and the one-step methylation reaction of xylene with methanol to obtain mesitylene (XM-TMB). The methylation reaction mechanism and the preparation strategy of a high-performance catalyst were reviewed. The high selectivity of PX obtained by pre-cisely controlling the pore size and acid site distribution of zeolites was emphasized.

Within the framework of competency-based education (CBE) and CBL are the design, implementation, and evaluation of an intensive 40 h elective course which includes a 5-day challenge to promote the development of disciplinary and transversal competencies in undergraduate engineering students whilst relying on UAVs as the medium where the teaching– learning process takes place. Within this credit course, a case study was carried out considering the framework of an exploratory mixed-methods educational research approach that sought a broad understanding of the studied phenomena using various data collection instruments with quantitative and qualitative characteristics. An innovative academic tool was introduced, namely a thematic UAV platform that systematically exposed students to the principles underlying robotic systems and the scientific method, thereby stimulating their intellectual curiosity as a trigger to solve the posed challenge. Moreover, students came up with innovative teamwork-based solutions to a designed challenge while having an enjoyable and motivating time flying drones on an indoor obstacle course arranged by themselves.

Enzymes catalyze biological reactions with a very high degree of specificity. Examples include the horseradish peroxidase, lactate, glucose, and cholesterol oxidases. For this reason, many industrial uses of enzymes outside their natural environments have been developed. Similar to enzymes, many industrial applications of nanozymes have been developed and used. Unlike the enzymes, however, nanozymes are cost-effectively prepared, purified, stored, and reproducibly and repeatedly used for long periods of time. The detection and identification of pathogens is among some of the reported applications of nanozymes. Three of the methodologic milestones in the evolution of pathogen detection and identification include the incubation and growth, immunoassays and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies. Although advances in the history of pathogen detection and identification have given rise to novel methods and devices, these are still short of the response speed, accuracy and cost required for point-of-care use. Debuting recently, nanozymology offers significant improvements in the six methodological indicators that are proposed as being key in this review, including simplicity, sensitivity, speed of response, cost, reliability, and durability of the immunoassays and PCR strategies. This review will focus on the applications of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens in samples obtained from foods, natural, and clinical sources. It will highlight the impact of nanozymes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent and PCR strategies by discussing the mechanistic improvements and the role of the design and architecture of the nanozyme nanoconjugates. Because of their contribution to world health burden, the three most important pathogens that will be considered include viruses, bacteria and fungi. Although not quite seen as pathogens, the review will also consider the detection of cancer cells and helminth parasites. The review leaves very little doubt that nanozymology has introduced remarkable advances in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and PCR strategies for detecting these five classes of pathogens. However, a gap still exists in the application of nanozymes to detect and identify fungal pathogens directly, although indirect strategies in which nanozymes are used have been reported. From a mechanistic point of view, the nanozyme technology transfer to laboratory research methods in PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies, and the point-of-care devices such as electronic biosensors and lateral flow detection strips, that is currently taking place, is most likely to give rise to no small revolution in each of the six methodological indicators for pathogen detection and identification. While the evidence of widespread research reports, clinical trials and point-of-care device patents support this view, the gaps that still exist point to a need for more basic research studies to be conducted on the applications of nanozymology in pathogen detection and identification. The multidisciplinary nature of the research on the application of nanozymes in the detection and identification of pathogens requires chemists and physicists for the design, fabrication, and characterization of nanozymes; microbiologists for the design, testing and analysis of the methodologies, and clinicians or clinical researchers for the evaluation of the methodologies and devices in the clinic. Many reports have also implicated required skills in mathematical modelling, and electronic engineering. While the review will conclude with a synopsis of the impact of nanozymology on the detection and identification of viruses, bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and helminths, it will also point out opportunities that exist in basic research as well as opportunities for innovation aimed at novel laboratory methodologies and devices. In this regard there is no doubt that there are numerous unexplored research areas in the application of nanozymes for the detection of pathogens. For example, most research on the applications of nanozymes for the detection and identification of fungi is so far limited only to the detection of mycotoxins and other chemical compounds associated with fungal infection. Therefore, there is scope for exploration of the application of nanozymes in the direct detection of fungi in foods, especially in the agricultural production thereof. Many fungal species found in seeds severely compromise their use by inactivating the germination thereof. Fungi also produce mycotoxins that can severely compromise the health of humans if consumed.', authkeywords='bacterial | cancer cell | enzyme mimic | fungal | helminth ova | immunosorbent assay | nanozyme | pathogen detection | polymerase chain reaction | viral', citedby_count=19, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='NRF', fund_no='118774', fund_sponsor='National Research Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85127856114', doi='10.1016/j.spc.2022.03.025', pii='S2352550922000781', pubmed_id=None, title='The hidden face<sup>1</sup> of the value in eco-design tools <sup>2</sup>: Theoretical basis of an essential concept', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Tyl B.', afid='60102125;122423969', affilname='Université de Bordeaux;APESA', affiliation_city='Bordeaux;Tarnos', affiliation_country='France;France', author_count='2', author_names='Tyl, Benjamin;Gomez, Armelle', author_ids='55507545500;57136121800', author_afids='122423969;60102125', coverDate='2022-05-01', coverDisplayDate='May 2022', publicationName='Sustainable Production and Consumption', issn=None, source_id='21100416081', eIssn='23525509', aggregationType='Journal', volume='31', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='794-804', description=\"Since the end of the 20th century, the engineering field, like many other sectors, has been faced with society's new preoccupations. Eco-design strives to reduce the harmful effect of industrial production and mass consumption on the environment. It makes use of tools and methods which, besides being built on technical and scientific foundations, borrow a vocabulary from economics and management science (“cost-benefits”, “needs”, “stakeholders”, etc.) and puts a fundamental category -“value”-, back on the agenda. This research endeavors to show how these foundational concepts “contaminate” the tools colonized by an economical imaginary. Researchers' and scientists' attempts to modify or overturn the existing order come up against a blind spot: the definition of value in the engineering field and, more specifically in sustainable development, finds its theoretical origins in the political economics of the 18th century, more precisely in the neo-classical economy of the 19th century. Through a narrative review methodology, we first argue that eco-design have not broken away from the ideology of orthodox economics, where riches are reduced to a simple monetary expression, and the social and environmental consequences are evaluated in terms of cost/benefits in the light of a rational instrumentality. Then, to illustrate these propositions, we base our arguments on the analysis of three tools used to develop ideas of sustainable development/innovation: Life Cycle Assessment; the Value Mapping tool, and the Triple Layered Business Model Canvas.\", authkeywords='Eco-design | Eco-innovation | Engineering | Political economy | Value theory', citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85127397909', doi='10.1007/s12598-021-01905-y', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Recent developments in nonferrous metals and related materials for biomedical applications in China: a review', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Tu H.L.', afid='60123062;60102437;60027799', affilname='Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials of Ministry of Education;China Academy of Space Technology;Institute of Microelectronics Chinese Academy of Sciences', affiliation_city='Beijing;Beijing;Beijing', affiliation_country='China;China;China', author_count='4', author_names='Tu, Hai Ling;Zhao, Hong Bin;Fan, Yan Yan;Zhang, Qing Zhu', author_ids='7102363501;55715828800;57202951940;56298331200', author_afids='60123062;60123062;60102437;60027799', coverDate='2022-05-01', coverDisplayDate='May 2022', publicationName='Rare Metals', issn='10010521', source_id='27919', eIssn='18677185', aggregationType='Journal', volume='41', issueIdentifier='5', article_number=None, pageRange='1410-1433', description='Abstract: Biomedical materials have received increasing attention in recent decades and have been used in medical applications to advance patient care, such as prosthetic implants, tissue repair and regeneration, drug delivery systems, pharmaceutical or biological therapy products, and sensitive diagnostic technologies.

To facilitate the adoption of VVC, many physical model-based and data-driven algorithms have been proposed. However, most of the physical model-based methods rely on distribution network parameters, whereas the data-driven algorithms lack safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose a data-driven safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for the VVC problem. We introduce three innovations to improve the learning efficiency and the safety. First, we train the RL agent using a learned environment model to improve the sample efficiency. Second, a safety layer is added to the policy neural network to enhance operational constraint satisfactions for both initial exploration phase and convergence phase. Finally, to improve the algorithm's performance when learning from limited data, we propose a novel mutual information regularization neural network for the safety layer. Simulation results on IEEE distribution test feeders show that the proposed algorithm improves constraint satisfactions compared to existing data-driven RL methods. With a modest amount of historical data, it is able to approximately maintain constraint satisfactions during the entire course of training. Asymptotically, it also yields similar level of performance of an ideal physical model-based benchmark. One possible limitation is that the proposed framework assumes a time-invariant distribution network topology and zero load transfer from other circuits. This is also an opportunity for future research.\", authkeywords='Data-driven | Deep reinforcement learning | Pathwise derivative | Safe exploration | Volt-VAR control', citedby_count=38, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85125717501', doi='10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00001-9', pii='S1473309922000019', pubmed_id='35176230', title='Generation time of the alpha and delta SARS-CoV-2 variants: an epidemiological analysis', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Hart W.S.', afid='60267654;60163091;60031331;60026851;60022020', affilname='UK Health Security Agency;Faculty of Science, Engineering and Medicine;London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine;University of Oxford;University of Warwick', affiliation_city='London;Coventry;London;Oxford;Coventry', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;United Kingdom;United Kingdom;United Kingdom;United Kingdom', author_count='7', author_names='Hart, William S.;Miller, Elizabeth;Andrews, Nick J.;Waight, Pauline;Maini, Philip K.;Funk, Sebastian;Thompson, Robin N.', author_ids='57204209963;35461770700;7103346572;57208572596;7007021673;26634997200;57051911800', author_afids='60026851;60031331-60267654;60267654;60267654;60026851;60031331;60163091-60022020', coverDate='2022-05-01', coverDisplayDate='May 2022', publicationName='The Lancet Infectious Diseases', issn='14733099', source_id='22471', eIssn='14744457', aggregationType='Journal', volume='22', issueIdentifier='5', article_number=None, pageRange='603-610', description='Background: In May, 2021, the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant became dominant in the UK, superseded by the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in December, 2021. The delta variant is associated with increased transmissibility compared with the alpha variant, which was the dominant variant in the UK between December, 2020, and May, 2021. To understand transmission and the effectiveness of interventions, we aimed to investigate whether the delta variant generation time (the interval between infections in infector–infectee pairs) is shorter—ie, transmissions are happening more quickly—than that of the alpha variant. Methods: In this epidemiological analysis, we analysed transmission data from an ongoing UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) prospective household study. Households were recruited to the study after an index case had a positive PCR test and genomic sequencing was used to determine the variant responsible. By fitting a mathematical transmission model to the data, we estimated the intrinsic generation time (which assumes a constant supply of susceptible individuals throughout infection) and the household generation time (which reflects realised transmission in the study households, accounting for susceptible depletion) for the alpha and delta variants. Findings: Between February and August, 2021, 227 households consisting of 559 participants were recruited to the UKHSA study. The alpha variant was detected or assumed to be responsible for infections in 131 households (243 infections in 334 participants) recruited in February–May, and the delta variant in 96 households (174 infections in 225 participants) in May–August. The mean intrinsic generation time was shorter for the delta variant (4·7 days, 95% credible interval [CI] 4·1–5·6) than the alpha variant (5·5 days, 4·7–6·5), with 92% posterior probability. The mean household generation time was 28% (95% CI 0–48%) shorter for the delta variant (3·2 days, 95% CI 2·5–4·2) than the alpha variant (4·5 days, 3·7–5·4), with 97·5% posterior probability. Interpretation: The delta variant transmits more quickly in households than the alpha variant, which can be attributed to faster depletion of susceptible individuals in households and a possible decrease in the intrinsic generation time. Interventions such as contact tracing, testing, and isolation might be less effective if transmission of the virus occurs quickly.

Much research has been carried out on improving concrete seawall performance. This work is a review of the current state-of-the-art in concrete seawalls focusing on design aspects including wave loading and innovative seawall designs, ecological considerations, and durability performance. Different conventional seawalls and their advantages and disadvantages are reviewed. Wave loads on seawalls have received significant attention; and multiple approaches for the quantification for the different types of loads are presented. However, wave load quantification remains a challenging task, especially for novel designs, and performance under load for such designs must be quantified through testing in wave tanks. Drawing inspiration from natural shorelines, modification of surface complexity at a multitude of scales can improve the otherwise poor ecological performance of seawalls. Ecological performance can also be improved by the incorporation of natural materials or structures in seawalls although the exact influence of concrete and other material chemistry on benthic diversity is unclear. The corrosion of the steel is a major durability concern, and the use of non-corrosive reinforcement can increase seawall durability toward corrosion. Other durability concerns include alkali silica reaction and sulfate attack, which can be mitigated through proper mixture design, including through the use of supplementary cementitious materials. Examples of innovative seawall designs and systems which have the capability to outperform conventional seawalls are discussed. Advances in structural design, ecological engineering, and infrastructure materials science will drive the development of multi-functional seawalls which are sustainable, durable, and resilient.', authkeywords='Coastal protection | Design | Durability | Ecology | Seawall | Sustainability', citedby_count=21, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='University of Miami'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85124178615', doi='10.1016/j.compag.2022.106742', pii='S016816992200059X', pubmed_id=None, title='Special report: The Internet of Things for Precision Agriculture (IoT4Ag)', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Kagan C.R.', afid='60154244;60154066;60102562;60009254', affilname='Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering;School of Engineering;School of Engineering and Applied Science;Purdue University', affiliation_city='Gainesville;Merced;Philadelphia;West Lafayette', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States;United States', author_count='5', author_names='Kagan, Cherie R.;Arnold, David P.;Cappelleri, David J.;Keske, Catherine M.;Turner, Kevin T.', author_ids='57206324696;8971174200;6507578291;24338242100;7201493602', author_afids='60102562;60154244;60009254;60154066;60102562', coverDate='2022-05-01', coverDisplayDate='May 2022', publicationName='Computers and Electronics in Agriculture', issn='01681699', source_id='30441', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='196', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='106742', pageRange=None, description='The National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) for the Internet of Things for Precision Agriculture (IoT4Ag) was established on September 1, 2020 and launched its collaborative programs across the four NSF ERC pillars of convergent research, engineering workforce development, diversity and culture of inclusion, and innovation ecosystem.

The research methodology was divided into two phases, including the synthesis and then the design of the VCLE. Also, in addition to the study’s authors, nine experts were used for the model’s development and another ten for its assessment (19 total). From their in-depth interviews and subsequent content analysis, their input of the proposed STEAM-ification process was synthesized and the data analyzed. The results revealed that the VCLE design should begin with a face-to-face, classroom learning environment in which the ‘gamification’ mechanisms were introduced and examined. This was then reinforced by moving the gamification process online outside of the classroom. Furthermore, five VCLE STEAM-ification steps were found to be particularly useful for enhancing creative thinking and student innovation. These included investigation, discovery, connections, creativity, and reflection. Moreover, we identified the gamification process as consisting of three main components. These were the ‘game mechanics,' the ‘game dynamics,' and ‘player emotions’. The ten experts agreed that the VCLE STEAM-ification creativity and innovation (C & I) process was appropriate at an ‘excellent’ level (x¯ = 4.68, S. D. = 0.47), which has great potential in the development of Thai undergraduate student C & I skills. Also, when undertaken correctly, innovation and motivation to learn are also outcomes from both VCLE and gamification applications. Thus, when students undertook study with the VCLE STEAM-ification format, they were found to achieve higher levels of creativity and innovation than students who studied using the traditional teaching plan.

The application of 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient mode to the clinical practice and teaching of digital medicine will be an innovative combination during the rapid development of 3D printing. This new mode will also further promote the development of applied medicine. OBJECTIVE: To compare the advantages of 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic with traditional medical teaching and 3D printing medical teaching, and expounds in detail the clinical practice teaching case of 3D printing medical worker combination clinic of the Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. METHODS: The teaching methods of traditional medicine and 3D printing medicine were investigated and compared with 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic at Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University in terms of “teaching, education, digital medicine”. We discussed the composition of 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic, investigated the development of 3D printing items, and summarized the number of participants who had participated in the training of 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic as well as the number of international conferences held in the 3D printing clinic center of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital from January 2018 to January 2021, thereby expounding the important role of 3D printing integrated medicine-industry outpatient clinic in the development of digital medical education. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The traditional medical education that proceeds in a large classroom is boring, in which students are easy to lose their attention and difficult to master knowledge comprehensively. 3D printing medical education could improve the understanding of abstract content in medical education, but there is a lack of clinical translation potential in 3D printing. 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinics could cultivate the transformation thinking of medical-industrial talents, train the students’ ability to transform scientific research achievements, and help the smooth implementation of clinical research achievements. 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinics at Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital has successfully produced personalized orthoses for patients, with the characteristics of interdisciplinary interaction, medical and industrial talent interaction, and system training. It took the lead in the development and exploration of 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinic in the clinical practice and teaching of digital medicine, and has achieved good results. At present, there are 42 Master/MD candidates and 137 trainees in the 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinic. It has held 10 international conferences on rehabilitation medicine and engineering, and 6 international conferences on the clinical transformation of advanced technologies in rehabilitation medicine and engineering, all of which have a profound impact on the development of 3D printing digital medicine education over the world. To conclude, the teaching mode based on 3D printing medical-industrial outpatient clinics is not only beneficial to training students’ scientific research and innovation ability guided by clinical needs, but also conducive to the development of cutting-edge disciplines such as translational medicine, tissue engineering, rehabilitation engineering and biomedical engineering.\", authkeywords='3D printing outpatient | Achievement transformation | Clinical teaching | Digital medical education | Medical-industrial combination | Scientific research innovation | Teaching mode | Tissue engineering', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='SJTU', fund_no='201914', fund_sponsor='Shanghai Jiao Tong University'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85121783951', doi='10.1145/3502265', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A Computer Science Perspective on Digital Transformation in Production', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Brauner P.', afid='60016653;60015815;60002596', affilname='Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen;Universität Stuttgart;Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT', affiliation_city='Aachen;Stuttgart;Sankt Augustin', affiliation_country='Germany;Germany;Germany', author_count='15', author_names='Brauner, Philipp;Dalibor, Manuela;Jarke, Matthias;Kunze, Ike;Koren, István;Lakemeyer, Gerhard;Liebenberg, Martin;Michael, Judith;Pennekamp, Jan;Quix, Christoph;Rumpe, Bernhard;Van Der Aalst, Wil;Wehrle, Klaus;Wortmann, Andreas;Ziefle, Martina', author_ids='35228685600;57204979669;7006359305;57195218382;55820473400;6603571701;56358649500;55341586200;57195223332;23398177400;55861872700;7007153024;56253795600;56581745100;6602475572', author_afids='60016653;60016653;60016653-60002596;60016653;60016653;60016653;60016653;60016653;60016653;60002596;60016653;60016653-60002596;60016653;60016653-60015815;60016653', coverDate='2022-05-01', coverDisplayDate='May 2022', publicationName='ACM Transactions on Internet of Things', issn='25776207', source_id='21101083126', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='3', issueIdentifier='2', article_number='15', pageRange=None, description='The Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) promises significant improvements for the manufacturing industry by facilitating the integration of manufacturing systems by Digital Twins.

Therefore, the innovation of vibration and noise reduction methods has never stopped. In recent years, the introduction of acoustic black holes to manipulate flexural waves has become a hot topic in the field of vibration and noise. In this review, the acoustic black hole is defined as a kind of structure which can converge the flexural wave by changing the geometric parameters or material properties. In the absolute ideal case, the flexural wave velocity gradually decreases to zero in the acoustic black hole region. Acoustic black hole structures, as a new kind of flexural wave manipulation technique, can effectively reduce the propagation speed of flexural waves in the structure, thus reducing the reflection at the end of the boundary and forming a region with high energy density. Therefore, it has a broad application prospect in vibration reduction, noise reduction, fluctuation control and energy recovery. Different from the composite structure of vibration reduction and noise reduction in the past, the acoustic black hole has some certain advantages in practical application because of its simple structure, material and preparation process. Up to now, a great deal of theoretical modeling and experimental research has been carried out on the structural form of acoustic black holes, and some certain research results have been obtained. This review first introduces the origin, basic definition and principle of acoustic black holes, then introduces the theoretical calculation and experimental research methods, including frequency domain methods (semi-analytical method, Gauss expansion method, geometric acoustics method, transfer matrix method, finite element method, unit decomposition finite element method, spectral element method, and finite difference method) and wave-number domain method. Additionally, the laser ultrasonic scanning technology is emphasized in the experimental research. Next, the four main functions of acoustic black holes are classified and described, which are vibration reduction, noise reduction, fluctuation control and energy recovery, and the research status and existing problems of each application direction are summarized. The application of acoustic black holes in vibration reduction and noise reduction is becoming more and more comprehensive, and its applications in wave regulation and energy recovery are emerging in recent years. As a new research direction, the basic theory and practical application of acoustic black holes still need to be widely studied further. The breakthrough points include: (1) The acoustic vibration coupling mechanism of acoustic black holes and the matching with functional materials need to be further clarified; (2) the nonlinear wave behavior in acoustic black holes needs to be further improved; (3) according to different engineering scenarios, the bearing integrated design method of acoustic black hole composite structures is developed; (4) theoretical modeling and application development of imperfect acoustic black hole structures. The development of acoustic black holes is also a supplement and broadening to the related research of vibration and noise reduction. From the perspective of social development needs, the related research of acoustic black holes has potential applications in the independent research and development of functional structures and materials.', authkeywords='Acoustic black hole | Energy recovery | Fluctuation control | Vibration and noise reduction', citedby_count=5, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85128554247', doi='10.13345/j.cjb.210375', pii=None, pubmed_id='35470631', title='Reform of the bio-separation engineering curriculum under the context of \"Emerging Engineering Education\"', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Ni H.', afid='60005816', affilname='South China Normal University', affiliation_city='Guangzhou', affiliation_country='China', author_count='5', author_names='Ni, He;Fan, Ruifang;Yin, Liang;Wang, Yutao;Chen, Jianfang', author_ids='36884664200;7102030217;44462247500;36496273200;57605832800', author_afids='60005816;60005816;60005816;60005816;60005816', coverDate='2022-04-25', coverDisplayDate='25 April 2022', publicationName='Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Biotechnology', issn='10003061', source_id='16144', eIssn='18722075', aggregationType='Journal', volume='38', issueIdentifier='4', article_number=None, pageRange='1612-1618', description='\"Bio-separation engineering\" is a compulsory course for undergraduate students majored in bioengineering, and an important part of the \"emerging engineering education\" system for bioengineering.

A more holistic road-asset-management approach enhanced by data-informed decision making through effective condition assessment, distress detection and future condition predictions can significantly enhance maintenance planning, prolonging asset life. Recent technology innovations such as digital twins have great potential to enable the needed approach for road condition predictions and proactive asset management. To this end, machine learning techniques have also demonstrated convincing capabilities in solving engineering problems. However, none of them has been considered specifically within a digital twin context. There is therefore a need to review and identify appropriate approaches for the usage of machine learning techniques with road digital twins. This paper provides a systematic literature review of machine learning algorithms used for road condition predictions and discusses findings within the road digital twin framework. The results show that existing machine learning approaches suitable and mature for stipulating successful road digital twin development.

Here we describe the initial formation of the partnership and the alteration made in response to the program to accommodate COVID-19 safety precautions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We outline how programming shifted from local, in-person programming in the summer of 2019 to a collaborative, mainly virtual curriculum in 2020 using students’ self-reported before and after surveys from both 2019 (n=33) and 2020 (n=42). Students from both in-person (2019) and virtual programs (2020) self-reported significant gains in scientific proficiency. A qualitative-directed content analysis of student open-response questions was performed. Students reported extensive benefits from the 2020 virtual training, including Personal Gains, Research Skills, Thinking and Working Like a Scientist, and Attitudes and Behaviors. Notedly, we observed increases in the Attitudes and Behaviors category. We outline the pros and cons of in-person and virtual programming and make recommendations moving forward in a postpandemic world with hybrid work and learning systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our effort informs the development of future undergraduate research training programs, significantly maximizing a hybrid training modality.

Toward passionate and imperceptible sport and health, people have begun to explore evolving functions beyond the basic values of textiles. Smart textiles with functions such as communication, sensing, color change, warming, cooling, actuation, and computing have become the new frontier of wearable technology. Global warming and the enormously scorching weather have adversely affected human production and living as well as the sustainable development of society. As being homothermal, the human body has the ability of automatic temperature regulation. However, people are still vulnerable to excessive heat load without the protection of buildings and traditional cooling systems. As the largest organ of the human body, the skin can sense the temperature changes of the external environment and regulate its own temperature. Human skin heat dissipation is a complex process including heat convection, heat evaporation and heat radiation. As the boundary between human skin and the external environment, textiles play an important part for the human body to attain thermal comfort under different environmental conditions. Therefore, personal thermal management, a technology regulating the microenvironments around the human body, can effectively control the heat exchange of the human body, and thus become an eco-friendly solution. With the progress of thermal and materials science, diverse cooling textiles have provided people with convenience and safety in the fields of medicine, firefighting, aerospace, and military technology. In the perspective of cooling principles, personal thermal management solutions based on textiles are categorized as UV-protective textiles, cooling textiles, active cooling suits, and radiative cooling textiles. Some of them have been utilized to maintain a relatively stable body temperature in different scenarios. Textile applications at present are no longer confined to social intercourse and aesthetics, but are more focused on functional breakthroughs. The urgency of global warming and the danger of outdoor work in special occupations have greatly increased the demand for innovations in cooling textiles. It is crucial to maintain thermal comfort of individuals for physical and mental health in extreme environments. Although certain cooling textiles have been commercialized and become basic essentials for specific occasions, stringent challenges remain for weakening the perception of cooling textiles during utilization, expanding their application scenarios to make them available life-essentials. This review focuses on the regulation mechanism and development of various cooling textiles for personal thermal management. We summarize recent research progress and its significance in energy saving and emission reduction. We also propose solutions toward related challenges in the research and development of high-performance protective textiles, and finally give a perspective to the rise of cooling protective textiles. Through multidisciplinary innovations in textile engineering, materials science, optics, thermal science, and mechanics, cooling textiles can be yielded in a low-cost way with multi-functional performance, while maintaining superior wearability and durability compatible with our daily activities. Cooling textiles would enable the construction of more effective, more comprehensive, and more subtle cooling systems for people. In the perspective of intelligent sport and health, the combination of cooling textiles with flexible electronics and digital twins technology can further enable common-looked textiles with intelligence such as autonomous thermal regulation, perception and interaction, thermoelectrical self-powering, short-haul communication, and metaverse.', authkeywords='Cooling textile | Functional fabric | Personal thermal management | Radiative cooling | Wearable technology', citedby_count=11, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85124808511', doi='10.1016/j.molliq.2022.118725', pii='S0167732222002628', pubmed_id=None, title='Nanoparticle applications as beneficial oil and gas drilling fluid additives: A review', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Al-Shargabi M.', afid='60170245;60024069;60001278', affilname='DWA Energy Ltd.;Tomsk Polytechnic University;Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS', affiliation_city='Lincoln;Tomsk;Seri Iskandar', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;Russian Federation;Malaysia', author_count='6', author_names='Al-Shargabi, Mohammed;Davoodi, Shadfar;Wood, David A.;Al-Musai, Ameen;Rukavishnikov, Valeriy S.;Minaev, Konstantin M.', author_ids='57457024600;57200278629;55468916000;57457024700;57212380944;55596796500', author_afids='60024069;60024069;60170245;60001278;60024069;60024069', coverDate='2022-04-15', coverDisplayDate='15 April 2022', publicationName='Journal of Molecular Liquids', issn='01677322', source_id='26965', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='352', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='118725', pageRange=None, description='Nanotechnology remains a relatively new innovation for the oil and gas industry.

This paper presents a detailed investigation on the mooring line analysis for two different configurations on the hull of a Paired Column Semisubmersible (PCSemi). The numerical research of the PCSemi platform coupled with mooring lines was conducted, and the model was validated. Two different mooring configurations were investigated: Chain-Polyester-Chain (CPC) and Polyester-Polyester (PP) configurations, with dynamic coupling in frequency domain (FD) and time domain (TD) using ANSYS AQWA and Orcaflex.

Since the integration of technology and finance is the main trend in future progress of GTI, it is meaningful to study the decision-making behavior and influencing factors of heterogenous enterprises and banks under market-based environmental regulation policies. This paper established a tripartite evolutionary game model among two types of enterprises with distinct Research & Development (R&D) ability and banks. The results show that: (1) the scenario when subsidy to enterprises is greater than to banks leads to a better situation; (2) penalty has more significant influence on enterprises than subsidies at the early stage, and enterprises' strategic choices of independent R&D is more reliable on subsidies; (3) when the price gap between different levels of technology increases, enterprises are inclined to continuously invest in green R&D, while it will restrain enterprises’ technology introduction behavior.\", authkeywords='Evolutionary game model | Green technology innovation | Green technology trading market | Incentive and penalty | Market-based environmental regulation', citedby_count=117, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85147506813', doi='10.14512/tatup.31.1.22', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Technology assessment in the STEM curriculum: Teaching responsible research and innovation skills to future innovators', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Mehlich J.', afid='60007493', affilname='Universität Bonn', affiliation_city='Bonn', affiliation_country='Germany', author_count='1', author_names='Mehlich, Jan', author_ids='35220207300', author_afids='60007493', coverDate='2022-04-08', coverDisplayDate='8 April 2022', publicationName='Zeitschrift fur Technikfolgenabschatzung in Theorie und Praxis / Journal for Technology Assessment in Theory and Practice', issn='2568020X', source_id='21101162971', eIssn='25678833', aggregationType='Journal', volume='31', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='22-77', description='• This article describes and evaluates a novel approach to incorporating technology assessment (TA), responsible research and innovation as well as science and technology ethics into STEM curricula (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) by the ex-ample of the online course ‘Good Chemistry – Methodological, Ethical, and Social Dimensions.’ Based on the evaluation of extensive student feedback, this article answers positively to three major reservations (Is it possible?

However, existing research focuses on preliminary theoretical exploration and case studies on individual cities/regions and is inadequate from the perspective of systematic and integrated research. We used visualization analysis software (CiteSpace5.6) to develop a knowledge graph of flexible space research based on more than 800 articles published between 1990 and 2020 on the topic of \"Flexible Space\" and \"Flexible Planning\", retrieved from two databases (\"Web of Science\" and \"China National Knowledge Infrastructure\"). The research drew the following conclusions: 1) The quantity of English literature had a significant upward trend, but the amount of Chinese literature increased first and then decreased. Most research focused on eco-environmental and engineering perspectives, and ecosystem services and land use suitability evaluation became the novel direction. 2) The cooperative network density of scientific research institutions related to flexible space research was 0.0042, indicating a relatively low degree of cooperation. The segmented cooperative network centered on several institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Queensland in Australia, etc. 3) The most common knowledge groups included the concept and connotation of flexible space, flexible planning methods, and regulation measures. Features such as land reservation, mixed utilization, and space replacement were emphasized in the descriptive terms, while the use of spatial and quantitative analysis models for spatial optimization and evaluation of suitability were technical focuses, and the most widely adopted methods included decision support systems and agent-based models. Various regulation measures were proposed, with the \"rigid-flexible combination\" approach being amongst the most widely used. To promote theoretical and systematic research on flexible space, the theoretical framework should be built first as a general guide to related research.

The high growth of e-commerce has an impact on the sustainability of both the economic dimension, the social dimension and the environmental dimension. Indonesia is the country with the fastest-growing e-commerce but also has the second-largest plastic waste in the world. The synergy of sustainability for e-commerce is an interesting and awaited innovation. This is because sustainability has become the responsibility of all countries in the world. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical understanding of the context of sustainability in e-commerce separately focuses on a company perspective and the use of green products from a consumer perspective. It requires the involvement of e-commerce stakeholders as a whole to get comprehensive research results. The use of qualitative research methods with exploratory approaches is used in this study to reveal the concept of sustainability in e-commerce in Indonesia. Findings: This study found similarities in the topic of acceptance of sustainability in e-commerce with a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence and habits. Changes to the variables were revealed due to changes in the e-commerce phase. The variable trust is in the introduction phase and builds trust in e-commerce. Currently, in Indonesia, the e-commerce phase is in a phase of growth and value formation. Habit creation and dependence is a requirement for value formation. Several new topics were proposed in this study, namely, awareness, security, logistics and user interface and user experience (UX). The establishment of an e-commerce identity through UX clearly shows its target market. The e-commerce phase and the topics involved in it can become a reference for e-commerce regulation-making in Indonesia. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to e-commerce in Indonesia with data processing limited to February 2020. Practical implications: The results of this study provide an overview of increasing the intention to use e-commerce through human acceptance and engineering dimensions. This research also reveals the stages of e-commerce in Indonesia that can be used as a reference for determining the right regulations for e-commerce and the trade-offs for sustainability. Originality/value: This study produces additional references to the intention to use technology by completing the UTAUT model. This study reveals changes in variables in perceived value that are interesting for further research along with technological developments and changes in people’s habits.

We aimed to better characterise omicron severity relative to delta by assessing the relative risk of hospital attendance, hospital admission, or death in a large national cohort. Methods: Individual-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases resident in England between Nov 29, 2021, and Jan 9, 2022, were linked to routine datasets on vaccination status, hospital attendance and admission, and mortality. The relative risk of hospital attendance or admission within 14 days, or death within 28 days after confirmed infection, was estimated using proportional hazards regression. Analyses were stratified by test date, 10-year age band, ethnicity, residential region, and vaccination status, and were further adjusted for sex, index of multiple deprivation decile, evidence of a previous infection, and year of age within each age band. A secondary analysis estimated variant-specific and vaccine-specific vaccine effectiveness and the intrinsic relative severity of omicron infection compared with delta (ie, the relative risk in unvaccinated cases). Findings: The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospital attendance (not necessarily resulting in admission) with omicron compared with delta was 0·56 (95% CI 0·54–0·58); for hospital admission and death, HR estimates were 0·41 (0·39–0·43) and 0·31 (0·26–0·37), respectively. Omicron versus delta HR estimates varied with age for all endpoints examined. The adjusted HR for hospital admission was 1·10 (0·85–1·42) in those younger than 10 years, decreasing to 0·25 (0·21–0·30) in 60–69-year-olds, and then increasing to 0·47 (0·40–0·56) in those aged at least 80 years. For both variants, past infection gave some protection against death both in vaccinated (HR 0·47 [0·32–0·68]) and unvaccinated (0·18 [0·06–0·57]) cases. In vaccinated cases, past infection offered no additional protection against hospital admission beyond that provided by vaccination (HR 0·96 [0·88–1·04]); however, for unvaccinated cases, past infection gave moderate protection (HR 0·55 [0·48–0·63]). Omicron versus delta HR estimates were lower for hospital admission (0·30 [0·28–0·32]) in unvaccinated cases than the corresponding HR estimated for all cases in the primary analysis. Booster vaccination with an mRNA vaccine was highly protective against hospitalisation and death in omicron cases (HR for hospital admission 8–11 weeks post-booster vs unvaccinated: 0·22 [0·20–0·24]), with the protection afforded after a booster not being affected by the vaccine used for doses 1 and 2. Interpretation: The risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for omicron than for delta, with higher reductions for more severe endpoints and significant variation with age. Underlying the observed risks is a larger reduction in intrinsic severity (in unvaccinated individuals) counterbalanced by a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Documented previous SARS-CoV-2 infection offered some protection against hospitalisation and high protection against death in unvaccinated individuals, but only offered additional protection in vaccinated individuals for the death endpoint. Booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines maintains over 70% protection against hospitalisation and death in breakthrough confirmed omicron infections.

This desire to solve problems might lead to new ways of doing things, better outcomes, and more efficient performance. In today's dynamic and changing economic environment, companies in any sector, including manufacturers, might certainly tolerate acting selfishly in their operations or the means by which they deliver products and services. As international markets and technological innovation continue to expose the manufacturing sector, businesses are being pushed to become more inventive in order to meet client needs and engage on a worldwide basis. As technology and innovation professionals prepare for future leadership roles in their firms, it's vital that they understand creativity and how to foster it among their peers. Employees are encouraged to cooperate when they are given the chance to be creative, according to the key contribution of this article. They solicit feedback from their co-workers when they have new ideas. The most intriguing component of offering a place for creation and invention was the creative process's design to foster collaboration and coordination. Several undergraduate engineering schools are gaining traction and integrating creativity into their curriculum, recognizing the realities of the corporate world and the necessity for creative problem-solving skills development. Creativity may be taught and people can be encouraged to come up with fresh ideas. On the other hand, teamwork and team teaching provide a lot of advantages. The current research will educate students about creativity and innovation, as well as how to foster it among their co-workers, in order to prepare them for future supervisory roles.

It is the disorder in which the cyst is formed in the ovary. The oocyte does not get mature at its natural which and form a fluid-filled sacs known as cyst. When there are many cysts in the ovary, it is then known as polycystic ovary. It may affect both the ovaries. It causes absent menstrual cycles, weight gain, hirsutism, pigmentation, and decrease in hair volume. There are some studies which say that this is a lifestyle disorder, but the main reason is not known yet. PCOS leads to an obstacle in conceiving. It can be suppressed by some changes in lifestyle patterns such as daily exercise and food patterns. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a science and engineering subject that deals with intelligent behavior. It is a subfield of computer science that has improved human existence in a variety of ways. AI is a combination of reasoning, learning, problem-solving perception, and language understanding. A general introduction to the subject of AI creates a new revolution in the world and creates a great scope in future to describe machines that mimic human nature in association with 'cognitive' functions of human mind, such as 'learning' and 'problem-solving.'AI is the technique in which the human work is totally handled by machines. In various domains, AI has recently outperformed humans, and there is enormous potential in healthcare. The health-care system deals with a massive volume of data that is difficult to examine using standard approaches. AI's success in health-care offers improved illness prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment. There are many inventions in machines which can take over the manual work. The AI can reduce the percentage of human error and provides the best and fast result. Together, human people and innovation may pave the road for better health-care services. The ability for a system to automatically learn and improve is provided by machine learning, a branch of AI logically planned. Its main objective is to create new machine learning algorithms that allow users to access specific datasets and use the information for analysis and research the unstructured. Applications of machine learning support significant change, particularly in businesses such as health care that deal with data identification, image recognition, prediction, and identification. Much critical attention has been paid to PCOS screening. In order to address this problem, the current study was created to investigate a noninvasive way to aid in PCOS screening. Our research demonstrates that the suggested algorithm successfully detects PCOS (mean area under the curve of 0.978), suggesting that deep learning may be a potent technique for PCOS identification. In addition, research findings may suggest the exceptional potential of using scleral pictures to diagnose diseases. A fruitful study area may emerge from the integration of AI and characteristics taken from scleral pictures. This article mainly is about PCOS and the role of AI for its diagnosis and better results. The transvaginal ultrasound machine is a noninvasive means of examining the human ovary to show important aspects for PCOS diagnosis. The key characteristics that distinguish ovarian pictures are the number of follicles and their diameters. As a result, PCOS is diagnosed by manually counting follicles and measuring their diameters. This procedure is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. So to make this process easy and error free the introduction of AI is needed.\", authkeywords='Follicle | hirsutism | polycystic ovary syndrome | transvaginal ultrasound machines', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85137474446', doi='10.1007/s41745-022-00320-1', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Building Indian Biomedical Leadership to Bridge the Gap Between Science, Primary Health Care and Public Health', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Krishna S.', afid='60114558;128546704', affilname='Indian Institute of Technology Goa;PCMH Restore Health and Wellness LLP & the Academy of Family Physicians of India', affiliation_city='Ponda;Bengaluru', affiliation_country='India;India', author_count='2', author_names='Krishna, Sudhir;Prasad, Ramakrishna', author_ids='7102243534;26536433300', author_afids='60114558;128546704', coverDate='2022-04-01', coverDisplayDate='April 2022', publicationName='Journal of the Indian Institute of Science', issn='09704140', source_id='22447', eIssn='00194964', aggregationType='Journal', volume='102', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='783-789', description=\"The Indian biomedical landscape has been characterized by the existence of somewhat polarized institutional structures and professional growth. While some scientific and public health challenges have been met with existing structures, there is still a large unmet scientific and public health need. Broadly, the physical separation of science, engineering, medical campuses and industry has led to silos of excellence and accomplishment with huge gaps in innovation and implementation. The lack of inter-disciplinary educational options has further reinforced the cultural underpinning of “guilds” that have found it difficult to collaborate. Strikingly, with almost a comparable number of institutions that train doctors in the allopathic or traditional disciplines such as Ayurveda, Unani etc., an “integrative medicine” framework has not emerged, apart from an over reliance on specialization at the expense of primary care.

Effective load balancing methods are essential to solving these issues. Adaptive task load model is the name of the method we suggest in our article for balancing the workload (ATLM). We developed an adaptive parallel distributed computing paradigm as a result of this (ADPM). While still maintaining the model's integrity, ADPM employs a more flexible synchronization approach to cut down on the amount of time synchronous operations use. As well as the ATLM load balancing technique, which solves the straggler issue caused by the performance disparity between nodes, ADPM also applies it to ensure model correctness.

Information literacy is especially important for engineers because of the need to be lifelong learners in order to adapt to the needs of society and technological innovations. Despite the importance of information literacy, it largely remains absent from undergraduate engineering curriculum. In this work, we developed two modules that were implemented and assessed at two time points in two different first-year engineering courses. These modules focus on defining information and providing a framework to assess the information. Each module includes a short video followed by a handout with questions designed to support students in making connections between the videos and their assigned design project. The development of the modules was informed by current research within the area of information literacy as well as the first two authors’ experience teaching first-year engineering students. Assessment data from the two implementations show that students were able to identify a range of resources they used to get information for their design project. While some students were able to assess the quality of information using a structured process, many students’ assessments were superficial and needed more time and instruction to improve. In addition to discussing our assessment outcomes, we provide a reflection on our personal experience implementing the modules to support the implementation of these modules by other instructors.

Adapted for further research, it can support the crucial role of deriving quantitative radar design criteria that balance the trade-offs among radar capabilities, cost, and impact to users. That is, the proposed methodology supports the evaluation of candidates for a potential WSR-88D replacement and any necessary major system upgrades in the interim.', authkeywords='Data quality control | Decision making | Experimental design | Radars/Radar observations', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='DOC', fund_no='11OAR4320072', fund_sponsor='U.S. Department of Commerce'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85128763813', doi='10.3390/buildings12040451', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Towards Automated Structural Stability Design of Buildings—A BIM-Based Solution', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Khattra S.K.', afid='60111242;60016760', affilname='Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana;Punjab Technical University', affiliation_city='Ludhiana;Jalandhar', affiliation_country='India;India', author_count='3', author_names='Khattra, Satinder Kaur;Rai, Hardeep Singh;Singh, Jagbir', author_ids='57218794225;56236850700;57213875596', author_afids='60016760;60111242;60111242', coverDate='2022-04-01', coverDisplayDate='April 2022', publicationName='Buildings', issn=None, source_id='26980', eIssn='20755309', aggregationType='Journal', volume='12', issueIdentifier='4', article_number='451', pageRange=None, description='Building information modelling (BIM) is a revolution in the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. In the AEC industry, several interesting innovations are being introduced every day. Most of the code compliance work, which is time-consuming and quite multifaceted, is now performed manually. The number of unwanted errors is increasing, and any suspension of the project is led by the structural code-checking system, and is a tiresome process. Subsequently, the BIM-based model is presented to automate the structural stability design of buildings. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) specification is introduced in this work, and is used to automate the building design processes to achieve design correctness and efficiency. The IFC-based interoperability framework is presented to automate the design of structural elements of RC buildings. Consequently, a deep multi-perception-based generalized adaptive framework (DMPBGAF) is presented for the automated code compliance checking process. The concepts and relationships in the building code were automatically matched to their equivalent concepts. A building code was checked against the Indian seismic code IS 13920, and when shear wall data were presented in this IFC file, it exchanged the data with the custom engine. It is possible to eliminate the unwanted issues based on the automated code compliance system with BIM. This goal can be accomplished by using a coding rule-based engine to compile the BIM model and store the design code of the specific country with its clauses. After generating the Python file to code all of the prepared checks, the python file in the form of functions was obtained from the IfcOpenShell library. Finally, a rule engine was developed for interpretation of the checks; the three model IFC files were tested on this, and it gave satisfactory results. The FreeCAD software was employed in this research for the IFC-based BIM model to automate the design. The shear wall data were presented in the first IFC model; all of the code checks were passed based on this modelled design, and when given to the rule engine, it gave a 100% compliance report. Insufficiently reinforced shear wall data contained in the other two IFC files were purposely created to fail some of the code checks. This method significantly reduces the time by eliminating the duplication of efforts. From the viewpoint of accuracy and reliability, the proposed method is more accurate and results in enhanced reliability as compared to manual design methods.', authkeywords='building information modelling (BIM) | code checks | generalized adaptive framework | Indian seismic code | industry foundation classes | IS 13920 | rule engine | shear wall data', citedby_count=7, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85128384060', doi='10.3390/s22083088', pii=None, pubmed_id='35459073', title='FDNet: Knowledge and Data Fusion-Driven Deep Neural Network for Coal Burst Prediction', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Cao A.', afid='60073460;126272552', affilname='China University of Mining and Technology;Ltd.', affiliation_city='Xuzhou;Xuzhou', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='5', author_names='Cao, Anye;Liu, Yaoqi;Yang, Xu;Li, Sen;Liu, Yapeng', author_ids='24469801300;57249542100;57191498665;57220898283;57191158974', author_afids='60073460-126272552;60073460;60073460;60073460;60073460', coverDate='2022-04-01', coverDisplayDate='April-2 2022', publicationName='Sensors', issn='14248220', source_id='130124', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='22', issueIdentifier='8', article_number='3088', pageRange=None, description='Coal burst prediction is an important research hotspot in coal mine production safety.

To inform responses, we aimed to model the increases in numbers of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death, as well as the cumulative orphanhood age-group distribution and circumstance (maternal or paternal orphanhood). Methods: We used updated excess mortality and fertility data to model increases in minimum estimates of COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver deaths from our original study period of March 1, 2020–April 30, 2021, to include the new period of May 1–Oct 31, 2021, for 21 countries. Orphanhood was defined as the death of one or both parents; primary caregiver loss included parental death or the death of one or both custodial grandparents; and secondary caregiver loss included co-residing grandparents or kin. We used logistic regression and further incorporated a fixed effect for western European countries into our previous model to avoid over-predicting caregiver loss in that region. For the entire 20-month period, we grouped children by age (0–4 years, 5–9 years, and 10–17 years) and maternal or paternal orphanhood, using fertility contributions, and we modelled global and regional extrapolations of numbers of orphans. 95% credible intervals (CrIs) are given for all estimates. Findings: The number of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death is estimated to have increased by 90·0% (95% CrI 89·7–90·4) from April 30 to Oct 31, 2021, from 2 737 300 (95% CrI 1 976 100–2 987 000) to 5 200 300 (3 619 400–5 731 400). Between March 1, 2020, and Oct 31, 2021, 491 300 (95% CrI 485 100–497 900) children aged 0–4 years, 736 800 (726 900–746 500) children aged 5–9 years, and 2 146 700 (2 120 900–2 174 200) children aged 10–17 years are estimated to have experienced COVID-19-associated orphanhood. Globally, 76·5% (95% CrI 76·3–76·7) of children were paternal orphans, whereas 23·5% (23·3–23·7) were maternal orphans. In each age group and region, the prevalence of paternal orphanhood exceeded that of maternal orphanhood. Interpretation: Our findings show that numbers of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death almost doubled in 6 months compared with the amount after the first 14 months of the pandemic. Over the entire 20-month period, 5·0 million COVID-19 deaths meant that 5·2 million children lost a parent or caregiver. Our data on children's ages and circumstances should support pandemic response planning for children globally.

At the same time, there is an insatiable interest in using such data for use cases that span all imaginable domains, including health, climate, business, and gaming. Beyond the novel socio-technical challenges that surround data-driven innovations, there are still open data processing challenges that impede the usability of data-driven techniques. It is commonly acknowledged that overcoming heterogeneity of data with regard to syntax and semantics to combine various sources for a common goal is a major bottleneck. Furthermore, the quality of such data is always under question as the data science pipelines today are highly ad-hoc and without the necessary care for provenance. Finally, quality criteria that go beyond the syntactical and semantic correctness of individual values but also incorporate population-level constraints, such as equal parity and opportunity with regard to protected groups, play a more and more important role in this process. Traditional research on data integration was focused on post-merger integration of companies, where customer or product databases had to be integrated.

Yet, despite the progress, several research gaps and challenges need to be addressed before leveraging QC for chemical engineering applications. Quantum computers offer higher computational power due to the exploitation of their quantum mechanical properties. However, not all computationally intractable problems can benefit from QC’s computational abilities. Achieving speedups over classical computing with quantum algorithms implemented on current quantum devices is possible for a few specific tasks. It is imperative to identify chemical engineering problems of practical relevance that may benefit from novel quantum techniques either with current quantum computers or of the future.

At the same time, attention to sustainability has grown putting in the spotlight its famous three pillars (economic, environmental, and social). Innovation and sustainability, as a consequence, seem to go hand in hand even more and “sustainable development” has become a well-known issue at a broad level. In the managerial field, recent studies show a growing attention at these topics, even if the strength of the relationship between Industry 4.0 innovations and sustainability has not yet been clarified. Given this research gap, the paper aims at studying Industry 4.0 and sustainability with its three pillars. A systematic review of the literature has been performed to analyze the main topic, the pillars of sustainability mainly considered and last, the possible outfalls of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. From a theoretical point of view, this paper contributes to the systematization of literature at the intersection between Industry 4.0 and sustainability, while from a managerial point of view it sheds light on implications and opportunities arising from considering the outfalls of innovations coming from Industry 4.0 on sustainability and its pillars.', authkeywords='Industry 4.0 | Management | Pillars | Sustainability | Systematic literature review', citedby_count=55, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85122618505', doi='10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2021.117485', pii='S0924013621004453', pubmed_id=None, title='Mechanistic artificial intelligence (mechanistic-AI) for modeling, design, and control of advanced manufacturing processes: Current state and perspectives', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Mozaffar M.', afid='60147353', affilname='Robert R.

A prominent hurdle on this path arises from the multiscale, multiphysics, dynamic, and stochastic nature of many manufacturing systems, which motivated many innovations at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and manufacturing sciences. This study reviews recent advances in Mechanistic-AI, defined as a methodology that combines the raw mathematical power of AI methods with mechanism-driven principles and engineering insights. Mechanistic-AI solutions are systematically analyzed for three aspects of manufacturing processes, i.e., modeling, design, and control, with a focus on approaches that can improve data requirements, generalizability, explainability, and capability to handle challenging and heterogeneous manufacturing data. Additionally, we introduce a corpus of cutting-edge Mechanistic-AI methods that have shown to be very promising in other scientific fields but yet to be applied in manufacturing. Finally, gaps in the knowledge and under-explored research directions are identified, such as lack of incorporating manufacturing constraints into AI methods, lack of uncertainty analysis, and limited reproducibility and established benchmarks. This paper shows the immense potential of the Mechanistic-AI to address new problems in manufacturing systems and is expected to drive further advancements in manufacturing and related fields.\", authkeywords='Additive manufacturing | Data-driven design | Data-driven discovery | Deep learning | Physics-informed machine learning | Scientific data science', citedby_count=60, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='CMMI-1934367', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85119499807', doi='10.1007/s11356-021-17407-4', pii=None, pubmed_id='34797541', title='The dynamics of public spending on sustainable green economy: role of technological innovation and industrial structure effects', subtype='tb', subtypeDescription='Retracted', creator='Yumei H.', afid='60089654;60016835;60000937;107066040', affilname='Ilma University;Beijing Institute of Technology;Shenzhen University;Yangen University', affiliation_city='Karachi;Beijing;Shenzhen;Quanzhou', affiliation_country='Pakistan;China;China;China', author_count='4', author_names='Yumei, Hou;Iqbal, Wasim;Irfan, Muhammad;Fatima, Arooj', author_ids='12759608300;57209286886;56351425900;57209284492', author_afids='107066040;60000937;60016835-60089654;60000937', coverDate='2022-04-01', coverDisplayDate='April 2022', publicationName='Environmental Science and Pollution Research', issn='09441344', source_id='23918', eIssn='16147499', aggregationType='Journal', volume='29', issueIdentifier='16', article_number=None, pageRange='22970-22988', description='In order to achieve the goal of sustainable green economic development, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the efficiency of the green economy and compare it with emission reductions.

The data were analyzed using the BRI economy panel data from 2008 to 2018. The generalized method of moments (GMM) was used to estimate the effect of government expenditures on education and research and development (R&D) on green economic performance index (GEE) in BRI countries. The results reveal that during the study period, BRI countries have experienced an upward transition towards green development, except for Pakistan and Bangladesh; their GEE decreased gradually from 2010 to 2018. Further, the findings of the system GMM revealed that both education and R&D have a positive impact on the green economy. Moreover, the compositional and technological effects of the overall sample were verified with the GMM process. Nevertheless, the sub-sample results revealed a heterogeneous impact on countries with a high per capita GDP.

However, while there are technological challenges, there are equally just as important ethical challenges that these technologies also generate. Governments, funding agencies and non-governmental organisations increasingly recognise the importance of incorporating ethics into the development of emerging technologies (for example, within the EU draft legislation on AI). As the world faces the global challenge of climate change there are urgent efforts to develop strategies so that responses to the climate problems do not reproduce more of the same. Ethical values from the onset are fundamental to this process and need highlighting.

In the recent years, biomaterials of polysaccharide origin have become innovative research goal in the arena of material science and engineering since polysaccharides establish a significant constituent of life matter and shows outstanding properties, which are the representative features of biomaterials. Polysaccharide biomaterials have been broadly proposed as scaffold materials in tissue engineering applications as gene carriers and for drug delivery systems.

Following the design science research paradigm and situational method engineering, we address this research gap by proposing a method called the Five Diamond Method. This method guides explorative BPM activities by supporting organizations in identifying opportunities from business and technology trends and integrating them into business processes with novel value propositions. The method is evaluated against literature-backed design objectives and competing artifacts, qualitative data gathered from BPM practitioners, as well as a pilot study and two real-world applications.

To support these processes more efficiently, this article presents an artificial-intelligence-based data mining model that helps firms spot emerging topics and trends at a higher level of automation than before. Its modular structure consists of components for query generation, data collection, data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic analysis, and visualization, combined in such a way that only a minimum amount of manual effort is required during its initial set up. The approach also incorporates self-adaptive capabilities, allowing the model to automatically update itself once new data has become available. The model parameterization is based on latest research in this area, and its threshold parameter is learnt during supervised training using a training data set. We have applied our model to an independent test data set to verify its effectiveness as an early warning system. By means of a retrospective analysis, we show in three case studies that our model is able to identify emerging technologies prior to their first publication in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies.

As technology advances at a rapid pace, some issues yet remain unresolved. One of the issues is phishing, which dates back to the 1980s. Phishing is an art used by cybercriminals from the 1980s until to date targeting online users to harvest financial, confidential, and other sensitive information. The art and the methodologies used by cybercriminals have not evolved much from the AOL (American online) heydays. However, the counter mechanisms to defeat phishing have undergone considerable changes over the past two decades. Although sophisticated antiphishing systems are in place, statistics shows that phishing is a major threat. Our practical research proves that one of the state-of-the-art antiphishing systems can be bypassed using simple techniques. The research further demonstrates why today's antiphishing mechanisms fail and the need for a novel mechanism that will identify the authenticity of the website. In this manuscript, an antiphishing algorithm, PhishSec (PH-Sec), is introduced. PhishSec will not consider the URL of the website as the primary factor to determine the authenticity, rather take a reverse approach where the URL of the website is derived by analyzing the content of the visited website to establish its authenticity. To accomplish this, the HTML DOM (document object model) of a given web page on load is considered. This manuscript quotes the research results of the analysis of a state-of-the-art antiphishing system along with the introduced algorithm to counter-attack phishing. The introduced system detects phishing attacks with 99.21% of accuracy.\", authkeywords='cyber security | e-crime | online security | online threats | password stealing | pharming | phishing | quantum computing | social engineering', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85126204980', doi='10.1145/3506860.3506862', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Scalability, Sustainability, and Ethicality of Multimodal Learning Analytics', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Yan L.', afid='60019578', affilname='Monash University', affiliation_city='Melbourne', affiliation_country='Australia', author_count='4', author_names='Yan, Lixiang;Zhao, Linxuan;Gasevic, Dragan;Martinez-Maldonado, Roberto', author_ids='57222734702;57485829100;8549413500;55255183300', author_afids='60019578;60019578;60019578;60019578', coverDate='2022-03-21', coverDisplayDate='21 March 2022', publicationName='ACM International Conference Proceeding Series', issn=None, source_id='11600154611', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='13-23', description='Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) innovations are commonly aimed at supporting learners in physical learning spaces through state-of-the-art sensing technologies and analysis techniques.

To solve this serious problem, many technologies, such as the activated sludge method, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, adsorption, and electrodialysis, have been developed to reduce the nitrate levels in water bodies. However, the applications of these traditional techniques are limited by several drawbacks, such as a long sludge retention time, slow kinetics, and undesirable by-products. From an environmental perspective, the most promising nitrate reduction technology is enabled to convert nitrate into benign N2, and features low cost, high efficiency, and environmental friendliness.

The study aims to analyze indicators of production, collaboration, visibility, impact, and innovation of Cuban universities through Scival during the period 2012-2021. Design/Methodology/Approach. The study design is non-experimental (cross-sectional) and quanti-tative (descriptive). Eleven Cuban universities were identified in Scival. The indicators were delimited in a time window of 10 years (2012-2021). We analized the results based on 21 indicators covering scientific output, thematic categories, collaboration, visibility, and scientific and patent impact. Results/Discussion. 59.7% of the scientific output is produced by the University of Havana (UH) and the Central University of Las Villas (UCLV). There is a high specialization in engineering and computational sci-ences. Basic sciences such as mathematics, chemistry and physics are highlighted. 62.1% of the scientific output has been cited. The works’ distribution by journals’ quartiles revealed that 47.3% of the production had been published in 50% of the top Scopus journals during the last ten years. Low performance in innovation and social impact through patents was evidenced. Only UH and UCLV are highlighted. Conclusions. Scival is highly useful for conducting more effective institutional scientific production studies and establishing comparisons of multiple indicators.

However, the current economic geography research focuses on the local scale and global scale. More omparative research on the effect of multi-scale industry-university cooperation needs to be carried out by economic geographers. Based on the IncoPat patent data from 2001-2017, this paper discusses the relationship between innovation industry-university cooperation and enterprise innovation performance from the perspective of scale and effect. Spatial pattern analysis and panel OLS analysis are the main methods used in this paper. The conclusions of this paper are as follows: (1) The spatial pattern of innovation industry-university cooperation in the Yangtze River Delta presents a star-shaped structure with provincial capital cities as the center. The dominant position of core cities in the network can help themselves to obtain innovation resources in the network. And the unbalanced distribution of university resources further consolidates the dominant position of provincial capital cities, which makes the pattern of innovation industry-university cooperation in the YRD have obvious characteristics of path dependence. (2) The impact of innovation industry-university cooperation on enterprise innovation performance in provincial and regional scales is significantly higher than that in other scales. On the one hand, the optimal scale of innovation industry-university cooperation has gradually evolved from the provincial scale to the regional scale during the integration of the YRD. On the other hand, the regional service characteristics of universities lead to the regional attribute of innovation industry-university cooperation. Therefore, the local or global scale has little explanatory power for the law of industry-university cooperation in China. It is particularly important to objectively view the role of universities in the process of spatial innovation from the regional scale. (3) There is a significant inverted \"U\" relationship between the average distance of innovation industry-university cooperation and enterprise innovation performance in the YRD. And the role and extreme point of innovation industry-university cooperation in engineering colleges are the largest among all types of colleges. Therefore, we need to pay attention to the differences brought about by the types of universities. This paper puts forward the following suggestions. We should speed up the construction of industry-university cooperation system focusing on regional scale. In addition, we should strengthen the construction of multi-scale coupling network of industry university cooperation in weak areas, and strive to enhance the network status of weak areas.', authkeywords='innovation industry-university cooperation | innovation network | innovation perfor-mance | scale | Yangtze River Delta', citedby_count=7, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85127175806', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Materials Science, Energy Technology and Power Engineering IV, MEP 2021', subtype='cr', subtypeDescription='Conference Review', creator=None, afid=None, affilname=None, affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country=None, author_count=None, author_names=None, author_ids=None, author_afids=None, coverDate='2022-03-10', coverDisplayDate='10 March 2022', publicationName='AIP Conference Proceedings', issn='0094243X', source_id='26916', eIssn='15517616', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2474', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='The proceedings contain 30 papers.

Among them, the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is categorized as a unique solar active particle with its outstanding intrinsic properties i.e., adequate band configuration, excellent light absorptivity and thermo-physical durability, which make it highly useful and reliable for revenue transformation and ecological concerns. Considering the intrinsic potential of g-C3N4 in photocatalysis, so far, no report has been done in literature for its extraordinary configuration, morphological characteristics and perspective tuning for said applications. To overcome this research gap, our primary emphasis of this review regarding photocatalysis is to provide layout as well as the advancement of visible-light-fueled materials as highly stabilized and extremely effective ones for pragmatic implementation. Thus, this existing comprehensive assessment conducts a systematic survey over visible light driven non-metal novel g-C3N4. The major advancement of this evaluation is the fabrication of well-designed nanosized g-C3N4 photocatalysts with unique configurable frameworks and compositions. Furthermore, alternative techniques in order to customize the analogue band configuration and noticeable cultivation such as metal (cation), nonmetal (anion) doping, worthy metal activating, and alloy initiation with certain semiconductors are discussed in detail. In addition to this, g-C3N4 photocatalytic functionalities towards photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, CO2 photoreduction, biological metal ions deterioration as well as bacterial sanitization are also presented and discussed in detail. Therefore, we believe that such a pivotal compact assessment can provide a roadmap in several perspectives on the currently underway obstacles in the innovation of effective g-C3N4 catalytic design processes. Moreover, this critical assessment will ultimately serve as a useful supplement in the research area of g-C3N4 nanosized photocatalysts and for the researchers working on its key aspects in diverse range of natural, chemistry, engineering and environmental applications.', authkeywords='Carbon dioxide (CO ) reduction 2 | Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C N ) 3 4 | Hydrogen (H ) evolution 2 | Photocatalysis | Pollutants degradation', citedby_count=60, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='MOHE', fund_no='RCAMS/KKU//006/21', fund_sponsor='Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85127389034', doi='10.1145/3478432.3499229', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Needs of K-12 Computer Science Educators towards Building an Inclusive Classroom: Implications for Policy, Practice, and Research', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Davis K.', afid='119267521;112737032', affilname='Kapor Center;Computer Science Teachers Association', affiliation_city='Oakland;Chicago', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='4', author_names='Davis, Kalisha;Twarek, Bryan;Becton-Consuegra, Dinah;Koshy, Sonia', author_ids='57222588204;57205698578;57557487800;57195670892', author_afids='119267521;112737032;119267521;119267521', coverDate='2022-03-03', coverDisplayDate='3 March 2022', publicationName='SIGCSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V.2', issn=None, source_id='21101083107', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1041-1042', description=\"The technology sector remains one of the fastest growing industries across the nation and continues to rapidly permeate all facets of society.

This study integrates both future material price expectations and cost reductions driven by technological innovation. Therefore, a roadmap is defined for automotive battery technology and its production process throughout 2030, based on market expectations and expert knowledge. This roadmap is translated into year-over-year cell cost by two engineering-based, bottom-up material and process cost models and, at current raw material prices, a decline from above 100 to around 70 $ kW h-1 in 2030 is forecasted. The simulation of analysts' price expectations for critical materials reveals that this decline might significantly flatten or, in the most pessimistic case, vanish completely.

Experts in the field of CBM from China have carried out a lot of basic research and engineering practice on CBM reservoir formation and the feasibility of co-production in multiple seams, which have gained fruitful results, providing strong support for deepening the CBM geological theory and promoting industrial development. To provide reference for subsequent research, engineering implementation and industrial construction, this paper systematically analyzes and reviews the latest research progress in the field of CBM co-production geology in China from four aspects: reservoir formation theory of stacked CBM systems; co-production geological constraints; co-production feasibility identification method; and co-production reservoir damage. The main understandings can be summarized as follows. (1) The sequence gas control mechanism of the accumulation of the stacked CBM systems and the later modification effect of rock formation and ground stress are deepened. The hydro-geochemical closed index of coal-measure groundwater environment is constructed, which provides a new parameter to identify the stacked gas-bearing systems and hydrodynamic conditions, and three types of stacked geological patterns of gas-bearing systems (growth type, decay type and stable type) are identified by using fluid pressure profiles. The concept of stacked CBM system is further extended to the category of coal measure gas, and the theory and method system of “co-mining compatibility” of stacked gas-bearing systems based on coal-measure composite reservoirs is proposed and applied to the pilot demonstration project of coal-measure gas co-production, which has a chieved preliminary results. (2) The Carboniferous-Permian (Taiyuan-Shanxi Formation) in North China and Late Permian (Changxing-Longtan Formation) in Western Guizhou and Eastern Yunnan are the hotspot areas for CBM co-production research and engineering practice, and the fluid pressure system and permeability differences are the most concerned geological factors in co-production. The difference in hydrodynamic conditions and fluid supply capacity of Shanxi Formation and Taiyuan Formation is an important factor limiting the CBM co-production in North China. The maximum inter-seam span, cumulative thickness, coal body structure of the coal seam in co-production in Western Guizhou and Eastern Yunnan have received more attention, and interference from shallow groundwater is the key restricting the efficiency of CBM co-production in the Zhijin Block. (3) Productivity analysis, physical simulation, numerical simulation, and geochemical analysis of produced water are important methods to identify the feasibility and interference of CBM co-production. The basic idea, technical template and evaluation process for analyzing the produced water source and identifying the degree of fluid interference in the co-production wells based on the geochemistry of produced water, as well as the production layer contribution analysis method based on the peaking and identification of the gas-production curve, have been proposed. The continuous maturity and innovation of technical methods provide strong support for the optimization and efficiency improvement of CBM co-production engineering. (4) CBM co-production is more sensitive to geological conditions and engineering disturbances, and is prone to induce reservoir damage, involving Jamin effect and airlock damage induced by production layer exposure, as well as stress-sensitive and velocity-sensitive damage induced by the pressure system and permeability differences. Homogenized reservoir reconstruction, separated-pressure system development (separated-time or separated-space), and refined drainage design and control are effective ways to reduce reservoir damage.', authkeywords='CBM co-production | coal-measure gas | geological research progress | interference discrimination | produced-water | reservoir damage | stacked gas-bearing system', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85130079633', doi='10.1149/2.F12221IF', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Diversity Unlocks Creativity and Innovation', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Badilescu S.', afid='60033154', affilname='Concordia University', affiliation_city='Montreal', affiliation_country='Canada', author_count='2', author_names='Badilescu, Simona;Packirisamy, Muthukumaran', author_ids='6603948816;6508095792', author_afids='60033154;60033154', coverDate='2022-03-01', coverDisplayDate='March 2022', publicationName='Electrochemical Society Interface', issn='10648208', source_id='25168', eIssn='19448783', aggregationType='Journal', volume='31', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='57-59', description='Aresearch lab (Optical-Bio Microsystem Laboratory), where international students are working toward their PhD and master s degrees along with senior researchers, is like a unit cell in the body of the university (Concordia University, Montreal, Canada).

Through Major National Science and Technology Projects and other technical researches, significant progress has been made in the theoretical understanding and engineering technology of CBM exploration and development. It is manifested in four aspects as follows. Firstly, the exploration concept has changed from looking for rich dessert areas to high-yield dessert areas, and the extensive development deployment has become finer. Secondly, in terms of efficient stimulation technology, with the expansion from two-dimensional seimic to three-dimensional seimic and from vertical wells (cluster wells) to horizontal wells, a new series of fracturing stimulation technologies for coal reservoirs transformation are developed, including indirect fracturing of crushed soft coal, multi-cluster acid fracturing of few sections of horizontal wells applied to calcite filled deep coal seams, and ultra-large-scale limit fracturing of horizontal wells in ultra-low permeability deep coal seams. These technologies have preliminarily solved the problem of economic benefit development of structural coal CBM, broken through the bottleneck of fracturing technology in coal seams with a depth of more than 2 000 m, and promoted the extension of CBM development from medium-shallow layers to deep layers. Thirdly, in terms of drainage and production technology, key technologies such as quantitative drainage and production multi-objective optimization design, CBM well rodless lifting and negative pressure drainage technology have been developed, promoting the transformation of CBM drainage and production control from qualitative to semi-quantitative and quantitative, solving the drainage and production problems of integrated cluster well groups and downward inclined horizontal wells, and effectively improving the production of single wells and the recovery rate of CBM. At last, in terms of stable production and stimulation technology, the innovative technologies are proposed, including stress release gas production of large-diameter horizontal wells and controllable temperature nitrogen injection displacement and stimulation of CBM, which provides technical reserves for the secondary development of CBM. In view of the stage characteristics of China’s CBM industry in the “climbing period” and “strategic opportunity period”, and the goal of the “carbon peak and neutrality”, based on the technical problems that need to be solved, this paper puts forward the “two-step” development strategy of China’s CBM industry. (1) By 2025, breakthroughs will be made in theory and technology, reaching the national target of 10 billion cubic meters per year in the 14th Five Year Plan, and strengthening confidence in industrial development. (2) By 2030, applicable technologies for different geological conditions in China will be formed, reaching the target of annual output of 30 billion cubic meters, and becoming an important part of natural gas production. The corresponding countermeasures are as follows. From the perspective of technology and management, according to the five elements of resources, technology, talents, policy and investment, and in line with the principle of “technological breakthrough as the core, five in one and collaborative innovation”, supporting safeguard measures are studied, formulated and implemented. Moreover, from the two aspects of efficient development and increasing the output of single well, theoretical research and technical research directions in nine aspects related to the future development of CBM industry are put forward, so as to achieve the goal of realizing the high-quality development of national CBM industry.', authkeywords='coalbed methane | development direction | drainage and production | efficient stimulation | exploration | technical progress', citedby_count=80, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85128434683', doi='10.7623/syxb202203010', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research progress of surfactant enhanced oil recovery based on microfluidics technology', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Bao B.', afid='60052453;60030270;60011069', affilname='Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development;Guangxi University;East China University of Science and Technology', affiliation_city='Beijing;Nanning;Shanghai', affiliation_country='China;China;China', author_count='6', author_names='Bao, Bo;Shi, Jiawei;Feng, Jia;Yang, Zaiyong;Peng, Baoliang;Zhao, Shuangliang', author_ids='57205379328;57580108200;57221396061;57221776495;57188707911;36969286100', author_afids='60011069;60011069;60011069;60030270;60052453;60011069-60030270', coverDate='2022-03-01', coverDisplayDate='March 2022', publicationName='Shiyou Xuebao/Acta Petrolei Sinica', issn='02532697', source_id='19462', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='43', issueIdentifier='3', article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='It is of great scientific significance and engineering value to enable the innovation in EOR evaluation methods for old and unconventional oilfields.

Defects in this region lead to noticeable deformities that are physically and psychologically devastating to patients. Advances in grafting and tissue transfer techniques have improved the surgical outcomes but our ability to fully regenerate the lost or defective tissue is limited. The purpose of this narrative review is to give attention to the advances that have been made towards the development of new techniques to reconstruct craniofacial bony defects using a tissue engineering approach. The aim is to bring together up to date knowledge about biomaterials that make up an ideal scaffold; different stem cell sources and their uses; growth factors and methods of delivery to defect sites; and gene therapy techniques through different vectors. Methods: A detailed data-based search using google scholar was performed looking for articles in English with the search including the following terms: bone regeneration, tissue engineering, craniofacial reconstruction, scaffolds, osteoinductive growth factors. The search was supplemented checking references of relevant review articles. Key Content and Findings: Currently, research and clinical approaches to achieve craniofacial bone regeneration are attempting to shift to new techniques to avoid intensive surgeries. Considering new technology and biomaterials, techniques are aimed at targeting delivery of specific cellular components and factors that influence the growth of native bone. Currently no method investigated has been proven to fulfil all characteristics needed to replace autologous grafting as the new gold standard. Conclusions: Currently the gold standard for craniofacial bone regeneration is still autologous grafting, but the invasiveness and surgical morbidities involved has prompted research to explore further options. This narrative review concludes that: the incorporation of computer aided designs have advanced our ability to mimic the configurations, morphologic traits and mechanical function of the native site; the recently developed techniques to obtain and process stem cells from new sources, have potentiated our ability to regenerate bone with ease; incorporation of growth factors, show promise in their regeneration ability; innovations in gene therapy and vectors have demonstrated successful bone regenerations capabilities.

Environmental sustainability is also one of the main motivations in development and innovation in the textile industry. Thus, the synthesis of MNPs using ecofriendly sources, such as polysaccharides, is of high importance. The main functions of polysaccharides in these processes are the reduction and stabilization of MNPs, as well as the adhesion of MNPs onto fabrics. This review covers the major research attempts to obtain textiles with different functional properties using polysaccharides and MNPs. The main polysaccharides reported include chitosan, alginate, starch, cyclodextrins, and cellulose, with silver, zinc, copper, and titanium being the most explored MNPs.

Across a representative sample of US and Canadian residents (n = 1478), we investigate public views and perceptions of agricultural gene editing. We advance existing survey-based studies, which tend to focus on whether knowledge, familiarity, trust, or perceptions of naturalness predict views on gene editing. Instead, we examine whether broader societal concerns about industrialized food systems-a key claim about genetic engineering launched by critics-predicts comfort with gene editing. We also explore the predictive power of views of climate change as an urgent problem, following proponent arguments. Survey results explore gene editing views in reference to specific cases (e.g., drought-tolerant wheat) and specific alternatives (e.g., versus pesticide use). We find that people critical of industrialized food systems were most likely to express overall absolute opposition to the technology, whereas those concerned with the imminence of climate change were more likely to support climate-relevant gene editing. Our findings suggest the need for further research into the conditions upon which public groups find gene editing compelling or not-namely, if applications enhance or counter industrial food systems, or offer particular climate adaptive benefits. Furthermore, we argue that attention to broader societal priorities in surveys of perceptions may help address calls for responsible research and innovation as concerns gene editing.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=6, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85126572452', doi='10.3390/info13030136', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Teacher Perceptions on Virtual Reality Escape Rooms for STEM Education', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Mystakidis S.', afid='60067711;60031155;60006876', affilname='Hellenic Open University;University of Patras;Turun yliopisto', affiliation_city='Patra;Rio;Turku', affiliation_country='Greece;Greece;Finland', author_count='2', author_names='Mystakidis, Stylianos;Christopoulos, Athanasios', author_ids='55547222700;55513838100', author_afids='60031155-60067711;60006876', coverDate='2022-03-01', coverDisplayDate='March 2022', publicationName='Information (Switzerland)', issn=None, source_id='21100223111', eIssn='20782489', aggregationType='Journal', volume='13', issueIdentifier='3', article_number='136', pageRange=None, description='Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a meta-discipline employ-ing active, problem-centric approaches such as game-based learning.

In line with this effort, more systematic professional development actions are recommended to encourage the development of additional teacher-led interventions.', authkeywords='Biology | Distance education | E-learning | Escape room | Online learning | Serious games | STEM education | Virtual reality', citedby_count=41, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85126362541', doi='10.21103/Article12(1)_GE', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Role of Biomolecules and Biologics in Precision Medicine, Personalized Medicine, and Emerging Therapies', subtype='ed', subtypeDescription='Editorial', creator='Rao G.H.R.', afid='60008772', affilname='University of Minnesota Medical School', affiliation_city='Minneapolis', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Rao, Gundu H.R.', author_ids='7403993477', author_afids='60008772', coverDate='2022-03-01', coverDisplayDate='March 2022', publicationName='International Journal of Biomedicine', issn='21580510', source_id='21101038719', eIssn='21580529', aggregationType='Journal', volume='12', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='70-81', description='In the 1990s, DNA sequencing technologies could only read bite-sized pieces of DNA. Then came the human genome project (HGP), a thirteen-year international effort, 1990-2003, with the primary goal of discovering the complete set of human genes, sequencing nucleotides, and making the information accessible worldwide for further biological studies. We have come a long way since that time in terms of sequencing the genes of the human genome. Now the researchers can sequence the DNA and analyze gene-expressed proteins in individual cells, allowing them to dissect the complexities of genetic diseases with exceptional details. Currently, technologies are available for single-cell or multi-omics platforms to analyze genotype and phenotype. The completion of this one-of-a-kind project created public expectations for immediate, better health care delivery and possible cures for ‘so called’ incurable diseases. The HGP was the single most influential investment made in modern basic science research. A monumental breakthrough in medicine has given us the ability to sequence the DNA in cancer cells to identify possible errors in mutations. The impact of the HGP’s success was so significant that President Barack Obama initiated a very ambitious new ‘precision medicine’ research initiative and announced the launch of this project during his State of the Union Address in 2015. The benefits of precision and personalized medicine include predicting susceptibility to diseases, improving disease diagnostics, preempting disease progression, customizing disease prevention strategies, and developing personalized drugs and therapies. As examples of emerging therapies, we have discussed the role of biomolecules and biologics in precision medicine applications like ‘The All of Us,’ personalized medicine approaches for monogenic diseases like hemophilia, sickle cell disease, and other rare genetic disorders, and CRISPR gene-editing technologies. Biomolecules play an essential role in all life processes, a variety of signaling processes, which are vital for normal functioning of physiological responses, in the early diagnosis of risk factors for various diseases, in the development of diseases and their progress. Furthermore, biomolecules, RNAs, DNAs, molecular and cellular engineering, genetic engineering of biologics, cells, tissues, and organs, play an important role in emerging therapeutic applications. The majority of the therapies discussed in this review are regulated as biologics under the Public Health Services Act of the USA. There is great interest in developing targeted therapy or precision medicine therapy for monogenic diseases, organ transplant applications, and tumor management, designed to interfere with targeted molecules for cancer-causing genes to slow the spread of cancer cells. Because molecular engineering, the development of biologics, gene-editing applications, and biomanufacturing are key components of emerging therapies, a keynote series was organized at INTERPHEX in November of 2021. INTEPHEX is the premier event that offers the latest intelligence, cutting-edge technologies, and state-of-the-art innovation for product development for pharmaceutical and biotechnology platforms.

Design of cold-formed steel structures usually requires physical testing, but it may be challenging to control the complexity and uncertainty inherent in physical experiments. The physical testing of new components and assemblies is often a cost barrier that prevents implementation and delays new product development. Testing by analysis has recently been recognized as a desirable area to pursue by the cold-formed steel structural industry due to the benefit of providing an efficient test environment. Not only does testing by analysis limit the high expense of physical experiments needed to quantify the behavior and safety of new members, connections, and structures, but it also reduces the time from product inception to development. Two considerations are necessary to ensure accurate results from testing by analysis. First, it requires a rational engineering analysis to calculate the capacities and deformations of the member or system, and the requirements to produce accurate analyses must be explicitly stated. Second, it is necessary to understand if the software used is capable of correctly modeling the behavior of thin-walled and nonsymmetric structural members and systems. Although the computational capability for structural design has been developed in recent years, there lacks a standardized approach to testing by analysis, especially for cold-formed steel design. This review aims to evaluate existing design standards that include the numerical test-based design for both cold-formed steel and other structural engineering industries. Recommendations for the use of testing by analysis based on the design standards and recent research related to numerical modeling are presented. The results of this study will assist with accurate and efficient design using testing by analysis.', authkeywords='Cold-formed steel | Finite element analysis | Test-based design | Testing by analysis | Virtual testing', citedby_count=4, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='AISI', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='American Iron and Steel Institute'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85122981074', doi='10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121375', pii='S014296122200014X', pubmed_id='35058075', title='Corrigendum to ‘Degradation and osteogenic induction of a SrHPO4-coated Mg–Nd–Zn–Zr alloy intramedullary nail in a rat femoral shaft fracture model’ [Biomaterials 247(2020) 119962] (Biomaterials (2020) 247, (S0142961220302088), (10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.119962))', subtype='er', subtypeDescription='Erratum', creator='Wang Z.', afid='60106702;60025084;60017060;60009860;60001117;126272631;112920252', affilname='Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences;Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Central South University;Fudan University;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine;Ltd.;Shanghai Innovation Institute for Materials', affiliation_city='Shanghai;Shanghai;Changsha;Shanghai;Baltimore;Shanghai;Shanghai', affiliation_country='China;China;China;China;United States;China;China', author_count='15', author_names='Wang, Zhe;Wang, Xinyuan;Tian, Yuan;Pei, Jia;Zhang, Jian;Jiang, Chang;Huang, Junming;Pang, Zhiying;Cao, Yuanwu;Wang, Xiuhui;An, Senbo;Wang, Xiao;Huang, Hua;Yuan, Guangyin;Yan, Zuoqin', author_ids='56224557800;57210918733;57416195100;56446288900;57416323400;57211211878;57189098910;57216153947;39261061600;55894810200;57189507723;57325553900;56200481700;7201553593;7402519901', author_afids='60009860-60001117;60009860;60025084;60025084-112920252;126272631;60009860;60009860;60009860;60009860;60106702;60017060;60001117;60025084-112920252;60025084-112920252;60009860', coverDate='2022-03-01', coverDisplayDate='March 2022', publicationName='Biomaterials', issn='01429612', source_id='28200', eIssn='18785905', aggregationType='Journal', volume='282', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='121375', pageRange=None, description='The authors regret that the authors order of the article [Biomaterials 247(2020) 119962,1–23/119962] should be revised as follows: Zhe Wanga,b,1, Xinyuan Wanga,1, Jia Peic,g,1, Yuan Tianc, Jian Zhangf, Chang Jianga, Junming Huanga, Zhiying Panga, Yuanwu Caoa, Xiuhui Wange, Senbo And, Xiao Wangb, Hua Huangc,g,∗, Guangyin Yuanc,g,∗∗, Zuoqin Yana,∗∗∗ a Department of Orthopedics, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200032, China b Department of Orthopedic Surgery, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA c National Engineering Research Center of Light Alloy Net Forming and State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composite, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China d Department of Orthopedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, China e Department of Orthopedics Zhoupu Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, Shanghai, 201318, China f Shanghai Innovation Medical Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, 201306, China g Shanghai Innovation Institute for Materials, Shanghai, 200444, China The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85122821047', doi='10.1016/j.vacuum.2021.110857', pii='S0042207X21008010', pubmed_id=None, title='Corrigendum to ‘MnO<inf>2</inf>/NiCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> loaded on nickel foam as a high-performance electrode for advanced asymmetric supercapacitor’ [Vacuum 195(2022) 110668/ VAC_110668](S0042207X21006163)(10.1016/j.vacuum.2021.110668)', subtype='er', subtypeDescription='Erratum', creator='Tao B.', afid='60001403', affilname='Qiqihar University', affiliation_city='Qiqihar', affiliation_country='China', author_count='4', author_names='Tao, Bairui;He, Jianlin;Miao, Fengjuan;Zang, Yu', author_ids='24077650000;57212080160;14520392700;36674092500', author_afids='60001403;60001403;60001403;60001403', coverDate='2022-03-01', coverDisplayDate='March 2022', publicationName='Vacuum', issn='0042207X', source_id='12489', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='197', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='110857', pageRange=None, description='The authors would like to make following amendments to the Acknowledgements section.

Though they have been the subject of considerable research, commercial prototypes of DFAFCs are rudimentary compared to other liquid fuel cells, particularly the widespread methanol-based direct methanol fuel cells. Various strategies for rationally engineering the electrocatalysts for enhancing DFAFC performance have been explored in the last few years, such as alloying noble metals with earth-abundant transition metals, designing specific morphological and structural arrangements, decorating the surface with corrosion-tolerant cocatalysts, and providing better catalyst support for effective catalyst dispersion. An overall approach may be necessary and should include (i) understanding the underlying mechanism, which will guide the direction of catalyst engineering, (ii) employing morphological, compositional, and structural control of the electrocatalysts to improve catalyst utilization and enhance the intrinsic activity for real-world applications, and (iii) integrating these in a proficiently designed cell architecture suitable for targeted applications.

Technology itself plays a major role in design processes, not only because technology development is what designing is all about, but also since the existing technology at any given point in time frames what is possible to achieve in terms of new outcomes. A limiting role of technology in design, education and other societal activities goes under the concept of technological determinism and has arguably been one of the most significant points of debate in the social sciences in the last decades. The aim of this article is to investigate how philosophical, sociological and historical research, as well as design and innovation research about technological determinism, could be fruitfully reconsidered in technology education. The analysis yielded three novel findings about the nature of technological determinism. First of all, technological determinism can take the form of an idea, theory or a way of explaining technology development in history or the present, but it can also take the form of actual material structures that—implicitly or explicitly—permeate and influence society, or, at least, this is what some researchers claim. Secondly, technological determinism is not just something that is the result of a bird’s eye view of technology and society or when we study technology as part of the macro level of society. Determinism can appear on all levels, even the micro level. Thirdly, like its counterpart social/societal determinism, technological determinism is not necessarily a “bad” thing, but a natural result of design being a balance between what is societally desirable and technically possible. The most critical issue from the point of view of technological literacy is to promote the idea that it is humans that design and retain control over technology.', authkeywords='Autonomous technology | Design | History | Technological determinism | Technological literacy | Technology education', citedby_count=33, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr='LiU', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Linköpings Universitet'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85136501456', doi='10.4324/9781003033097', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Higher education policy in developing and Western nations: Contemporary and emerging trends in local and global contexts', subtype='bk', subtypeDescription='Book', creator='Lindsay B.', afid='60089640;60026851;60022148', affilname='Ford Foundation;University of Oxford;University College London', affiliation_city='New York;Oxford;London', affiliation_country='United States;United Kingdom;United Kingdom', author_count='1', author_names='Lindsay, Beverly', author_ids='59432347600', author_afids='60089640-60026851-60022148', coverDate='2022-02-28', coverDisplayDate='28 February 2022', publicationName='Higher Education Policy in Developing and Western Nations: Contemporary and Emerging Trends in Local and Global Contexts', issn=None, source_id='21101102884', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-247', description='Recognizing that institutes of higher education function simultaneously in local and global contexts, this volume explores the applications of domestic and global policies in a range of industrialized nations in North America and Australia, and developing ones of Brazil, Indonesia, Myanmar, and in Southern Africa and the Caribbean The chapters focus on policies relating to global matters such as diversity, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) innovations, and development amid natural disasters and conflicts.

In the literature on construction industry transformation through policy-backed initiatives, how firms will respond to the demands to adopt and use innovative technologies and approaches is taken for granted, and there is scarcely any attention given to the institutional implications of transformation agenda. The purpose of this paper is to discuss these gaps and offer directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: Following a synthesis of literature on the UK’s industry transformation agenda, the authors use the concepts of institutional logics, arrangements, complexity and strategic responses to suggest seven research questions that are at the nexus of policy-backed transformation and institutional theory. Findings: In this paper, the authors argue that increasing demands for the adoption and use of digital technologies, platforms, manufacturing approaches and other “industry-4.0”-related technologies will reconfigure existing logics and arrangements in the construction industry, creating a problem of institutional complexity for general contracting firms in particular. Originality/value: The questions are relevant for our understanding of the nature of institutional complexities, change, strategic firm responses, field-level dynamics and implications for the construction industry in relation to the transformation agenda.

It is an elicitation approach that uses, specifically, healthcare business goals to derive the requirements of e-health system to be developed. Design/methodology/approach: GOREA consists of two major phases: (1) modelling e-health business requirements phase and (2) modelling e-health information technology (IT) and systems requirements phase. The modelling e-health business requirements phase is divided into two main stages: (1) model e-health business strategy stage and (2) model e-health business environment stage. The modelling e-health IT and systems requirements phase illustrates the process of obtaining requirements of e-health system from the organizational goals that are determined in the previous phase. It consists of four main steps that deal with business goals of e-health system: (1) modelling e-health business process (BP) step; (2) modelling e-health business goals step; (3) analysing e-health business goals step; and (4) eliciting e-health system requirements step. A case study based on the basic operations and services in hospital emergency unit for checking patient against COVID-19 virus and taking its diagnostic testing has been set and used to examine the validity of the proposed approach by achieving the conformance of the developed system to the business goals. Findings: The results indicate that (1) the proposed GOREA has a positive influence on the system implementation according to e-health business expectations; and (2) it can successfully fulfil the need of e-health business in order to save the citizens life by checking them against COVID-19 virus. Research limitations/implications: The proposed approach has some limitations. For example, it is only validated using one e-health business goal and thus it has to be authenticated with different e-health business goals in order to address different e-health problems. Originality/value: Many e-health projects and innovations are not established based on robust system requirements engineering phase. In order to ensure the success delivery of e-health services, all characteristics of e-health systems and applications must be understood in terms of technological perspectives as well as the all system requirements.', authkeywords='Case study | COVID-19 | e-health business process | Modelling e-health process | Requirement elicitation | Requirement engineering', citedby_count=22, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85113869316', doi='10.1108/SCM-02-2021-0071', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='How frugal innovation shape global sustainable supply chains during the pandemic crisis: lessons from the COVID-19', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Dubey R.', afid='60170411;60108544;60030759', affilname='Liverpool Business School;Montpellier Recherche en Management (MRM);California State University, Los Angeles', affiliation_city='Liverpool;Montpellier;Los Angeles', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;France;United States', author_count='5', author_names='Dubey, Rameshwar;Bryde, David James;Foropon, Cyril;Tiwari, Manisha;Gunasekaran, Angappa', author_ids='36991875200;9335931400;55570897100;57221261105;56238759300', author_afids='60170411;60170411;60108544;60170411;60030759', coverDate='2022-02-17', coverDisplayDate='17 February 2022', publicationName='Supply Chain Management', issn='13598546', source_id='23644', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='27', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='295-311', description='Purpose: The COVID-19 crisis has created enormous strain in global supply chains. The disruption has caused severe shortages of critical items, including personal protective equipment (e.g. face masks), ventilators and diagnostics. The failure of the industry to meet the sudden demand for these necessary items has caused a severe humanitarian crisis. These situations, resulting from the COVID-19, crisis have led to the informal growth of frugal innovation in sustainable global supply chains. This paper aims to provide a detailed overview of drivers of frugal-oriented sustainable global supply chains, following lessons acquired from emerging countries’ attempts to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a focused group approach to identify the drivers and this paper further validated them using existing literature published in international peer-reviewed journals and reports. The authors adopted total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) to analyze the complex relationships among identified drivers. Findings: The authors present a theoretical framework to explain how the drivers are interlinked. This paper has developed the framework through a synthesis of the TISM modeling and Matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment analysis. This paper observed that government financial support, policies and regulations, under the mediating effect of leadership and the moderating effect of national culture and international rules and regulations, has a significant effect on the adoption of emerging technology, volunteering initiatives and values and ethics. Further, emerging technology, volunteering initiative and values and ethics have a significant effect on supply chain talent and frugal engineering. These results provide some useful theoretical insights that may help in further investigating the role of frugal innovations in other contexts. Originality/value: The authors find that outcomes of the methodical contributions and the resulting managerial insights can be categorized into four levels.

Additionally, the following sub-objectives were also to be addressed: to assess emerging themes of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies in AECO and to identify lacunae in existing project supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The research relies on qualitative approaches and mixed methodologies, for building theories based on domain expert interviews and questionnaire surveys administered on industry professionals. Hypothesis testing has been used to analyze data and identify significant 4IR technology applications and evolve a PDSC framework to address multiple objectives in the AECO context. Findings: 4IR technologies can completely revolutionize AECO supply chains and catapult the discipline into a completely new paradigm. The immense computing power unleashed can contribute to enhancing effectiveness in delivery. Technologies such as the Internet of Things, Internet of Services, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Smart Factory, 3 D-Printing, Cyber-Physical Systems or Embedded Systems, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Robotics hold immense future potential. The study proposes an integrated framework to address the multiple objectives of improved project delivery, increased productivity and cost savings, activity monitoring, reporting and agility, better workflow processes and reduction of wastage. Research limitations/implications: The study offers ideas for complete integration of the AECO supply chain to deliver value to end customers. It, however, relies on opinions, perspectives and recollections of respondents, which is its limitation. Their opinion is expected to be influenced by their domain and project expertise. Practical implications: In today’s global environment, information and data management is a meaningful intermediary in 4IR. It can be delivered with the aid of the cloud to collect, appraise and evaluate data efficiently; faster machine operations to manufacture quality goods at a lower cost; boost productivity; and competitiveness in AECO companies.

Here, we developed a prototype smartphone-based flow cytometer (FC). This compact 3D-printed device incorporated a laser diode and a microfluidic flow cell and used the built-in camera of a smartphone to track immunofluorescently labeled cells in suspension and measure their color. This capability was enabled by high-brightness supra-nanoparticle assemblies of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (SiO2@QDs) as well as a support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm. The smartphone-based FC device detected and enumerated target cells against a background of other cells, simultaneously and selectively counted two different cell types in a mixture, and used multiple colors of SiO2@QD-antibody conjugates to screen for and identify a particular cell type.

Accordingly, electronic procurement systems (EPSs) have benefits that improve the economic, environmental and social initiatives for sustainable construction. However, the slow rate of EPSs uptake evinces the need for strategic approaches towards their widespread implementation. Scoping the previous studies on EPSs, there is a lack of research on the influence dynamics of these strategies for effective promotion of EPSs in the built environment. Therefore, this study investigates the dynamic influences of strategies by using the neurofuzzy model for the effective promotion of EPSs implementation. Through a comprehensive literature review, 14 strategies were employed in an expert survey. A total of 121 datasets were collected and analyzed in the study. From the data analysis, five groups were derived: technology education, innovation culture management, technological stimulation environment, incentives and partnership mechanism and organizational integration support. Further, the neurofuzzy model and sensitivity analysis were used to predict and determine optimal strategies for promoting EPSs implementation. The findings showed dynamic ways of hybridizing the strategies for EPSs promotion. Two hybrid-approaches, in addition to other strategies, that actively enhance effective EPS implementation are ‘innovation culture management – technology education’ and ‘innovation culture management – incentives and partnership mechanism’. Additionally, the combinations of strategies that result in low promotion of EPSs were also highlighted.

Few however consider both student learning and the teachers’ perspective in their assessments. In a co-constructive approach to translational research, we collaborated with teachers, in two case studies involving two classes each, to investigate how CS content could be used transversally. More specifically, teacher inputs and student learning data were combined in a mixed methods analysis to determine whether two CS Unplugged (CSU) activities from the curriculum could be leveraged to teach disciplinary content in primary school. The findings indicated that the CSU activities could be leveraged for maths and spelling, but require validation at a larger scale. More important, though, are the takeaways of the co-constructive experience with teachers. Interestingly the benefits of co-construction went both ways. While researchers gained a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of the activities, teachers i) appreciated having detailed student learning analyses, devoid of biases and impressions, ii) changed their perspective about researchers, and iii) were open to other collaborative research initiatives which they found to be drivers of change and innovation in their practice. The way co-construction was approached also impacted the teachers’ perception of their experience. Indeed, while one study was researcher-driven and included teachers, the other was teacher-driven and included researchers. When teacher-driven, the teachers felt they had a more active role, thus reflecting more on the study design, results and implications.

Caused by disordered systemic bone remodeling, osteoporosis manifests as progressive loss of bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, increasing the risk of fractures and eventually leading to osteoporotic fragility fractures. As fracture risk increases, antiosteoporosis treatments transition from nonpharmacological management to pharmacological intervention, and finally to the treatment of fragility fractures. Calcium-based nanomaterials (CBNMs) have unique advantages in osteoporosis treatment because of several characteristics including similarity to natural bone, excellent biocompatibility, easy preparation and functionalization, low pH-responsive disaggregation, and inherent pro-osteogenic properties. By combining additional ingredients, CBNMs can play multiple roles to construct antiosteoporotic biomaterials with different forms. This review covers recent advances in CBNMs for osteoporosis treatment. For ease of understanding, CBNMs for antiosteoporosis treatment can be classified as locally applied CBNMs, such as implant coatings and filling materials for osteoporotic bone regeneration, and systemically administered CBNMs for antiosteoporosis treatment. Locally applied CBNMs for osteoporotic bone regeneration develop faster than the systemically administered CBNMs, an important consideration given the serious outcomes of fragility fractures. Nevertheless, many innovations in construction strategies and preparation methods have been applied to build systemically administered CBNMs. Furthermore, with increasing interest in delaying osteoporosis progression and avoiding fragility fracture occurrence, research into systemic administration of CBNMs for antiosteoporosis treatment will have more development prospects. Deep understanding of the CBNM preparation process and optimizing CBNM properties will allow for increased application of CBNMs in osteoporosis treatments in the future.', authkeywords='calcium | local application | nanomaterial | osteoporosis | systemic administration', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='2020KF-03', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85125843744', doi='10.4271/2021-36-0420', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Vehicle Dynamic Control using Vehicle Network Toolbox from MATLAB/Simulink®', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Albelo D.M.', afid='60085150', affilname='Mercedes Benz Cars', affiliation_city='Stuttgart', affiliation_country='Germany', author_count='4', author_names='Albelo, Douglas Marini;Dias, Rodrigo Dantas;Neves, Renato;Paterlini, Bruno Scarano', author_ids='57478707400;57478570900;57479405500;57194146946', author_afids='60085150;60085150;60085150;60085150', coverDate='2022-02-10', coverDisplayDate='10 February 2022', publicationName='SAE Technical Papers', issn=None, source_id='21100239259', eIssn='01487191', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier='2022', article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"Automotive companies are strongly investing in vehicle innovation through partnerships with universities, research centers and improvements in its R&D units.

Device behavior fingerprinting emerged as an important means to characterize the network behavior of connected devices due to the dynamic nature of smart systems. The study of device behavior fingerprinting strategies gave us an insight into the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning techniques. It also led us to some research questions that we incorporated in the proposed framework. Firstly, we explored the means to improve the efficiency of passive device fingerprinting techniques. Secondly, we needed to address the privacy concerns that arise from the creation and maintenance of device fingerprints. Objective: To our best knowledge, this is the first time that device for fingerprints had been generated in the form of images. The use of device fingerprints in image form best utilized the object recognition capabilities of capsule networks. Method: We designed a novel method to classify and save the network behaviour of IoT devices that are connected to a network. The proposed model was based on a two-fold innovation of the generation of unique images based on packet parameters of device transmissions, and the design of a model that could carry out efficient and accurate classification of device vendors based on their network behavior. Results and Conclusion: The generation of unique images offered a big advantage of saving the memory of the system. While a packet capture file may take around 150kb or more, the generated images were as small as the order of 2kb. For a smart system made up of thousands of devices, the order of memory space saved would become significant. Furthermore, since the algorithm of image generation could be customized by the network administrators, the images cannot be reverse-engineered by potential attackers, thereby assuring a secure way to save device behavior fingerprints. The developed model has compiled over 500 epochs that roughly translated to 100 minutes and gave the accuracy of the order of 92%. This was the first time that device network behaviour has been translated into an image and tested through classification using capsule networks. The translation of captured packet flows to black and white images not only saved on memory space but also provided a safeguard against reverse engineering by potential attackers. There is a vast scope to further use of this strategy to develop more complex device fingerprinting methods.', authkeywords='Capsule network | CNN | Device behavior fingerprinting | Image generation | Internet of Things | Smart systems', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85124883432', doi='10.3390/s22041675', pii=None, pubmed_id='35214578', title='Translational Applications of Wearable Sensors in Education: Implementation and Efficacy', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Ferrier B.', afid='60018186;60004655', affilname='Edinburgh Napier University;Charles Darwin University', affiliation_city='Edinburgh;Darwin', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;Australia', author_count='4', author_names='Ferrier, Brendon;Lee, Jim;Mbuli, Alex;James, Daniel A.', author_ids='56549688900;24469814900;57205184530;7401733644', author_afids='60018186-60004655;60004655;60018186;60004655', coverDate='2022-02-01', coverDisplayDate='February-2 2022', publicationName='Sensors', issn='14248220', source_id='130124', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='22', issueIdentifier='4', article_number='1675', pageRange=None, description='Background: Adding new approaches to teaching curriculums can be both expensive and complex to learn.

Through 29 interviews with researchers in nanotechnology, biotechnology and chemical engineering differences in perceptions of safety, life-cycle thinking and responsibility for safety were explored. Results indicate that although safety is perceived as a paramount topic in scientific practice, its meaning is rigorously demarcated, marking out safety within the work environment. In effect, this creates a limited perceived role responsibility vis-à-vis safety in the production of knowledge and in teaching, with negligible critical consideration of research’s downstream impacts. This is at odds with the adoption of a broader conception of, and responsibility for, safety. The considerations supporting the perceived boundaries demarcating scientific practice are scrutinized.

Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence–based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government’s requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Th Vi n Pháp Lu t, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step. Results: In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians’ performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system’s capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks. Conclusions: Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet. More research is needed in the future to guide the implementation of digital health care systems in the Vietnam hospital setting.', authkeywords='Administrative information | Compulsory | Data | Digital health | EHealth | Electronic medical records | Health | Health insurance ID | Hospital care | Mobile phone | Patient ID | Policy | Standards | Vietnam', citedby_count=12, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85123943792', doi='10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101916', pii='S0160791X22000574', pubmed_id=None, title='How global value chain participation affects green technology innovation processes: A moderated mediation model', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Hu D.', afid='60088465;60002836', affilname='Yuxi Normal University;Hefei University of Technology', affiliation_city='Yuxi;Hefei', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='5', author_names='Hu, Dianxi;Jiao, Jianling;Tang, Yunshu;Xu, Yuwen;Zha, Jianrui', author_ids='57220605304;36190755000;36794004000;57218587709;57201032194', author_afids='60002836-60088465;60002836;60002836;60002836;60002836', coverDate='2022-02-01', coverDisplayDate='February 2022', publicationName='Technology in Society', issn='0160791X', source_id='18676', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='68', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='101916', pageRange=None, description=\"Global value chain (GVC) embeddedness is an irreversible development paradigm in China's manufacturing sector.

The specific mechanism and path influences on GVC participation in green technological innovation require further clarification. This study subdivides green technology innovation into process innovation and product innovation, constructing an improved Utterback and Abernathy (A-U) technological innovation process model to reveal the mediation effect moderated by environmental regulation. Our innovative findings are as follows: Green process innovation completely mediates GVC participation and green product innovation nexus; and environmental regulation positively moderates green process innovation's mediating role between GVC participation and green product innovation. Cleaner production technology innovation completely mediates the relationship between GVC participation and green product innovation. Green process innovation partially mediates the relationship between GVC forward participation and green product innovation. Cleaner production technology innovation completely mediates GVC forward participation and green product innovation nexus. The research conclusions provide new theoretical evidence for improving GVC forward participation and giving full play to cleaner production process innovation to promote China's green and low-carbon transformation; we also offer some references for other developing countries and emerging economies.\", authkeywords=\"China'S manufacturing sector | Cleaner production technology innovation | Environmental regulation | Global value chain participation | Green process innovation | Green technology innovation processes\", citedby_count=49, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='2017FH001 -072', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85123941405', doi='10.3390/catal12020194', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Copper‐Containing Catalysts for Azide–Alkyne Cycloaddition in Supercritical CO<inf>2</inf>', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='López S.', afid='60000823', affilname='Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha', affiliation_city='Ciudad Real', affiliation_country='Spain', author_count='6', author_names='López, Sonia;García‐vargas, Jesús Manuel;García, María Teresa;Rodríguez, Juan Francisco;Gracia, Ignacio;Ramos, María Jesús', author_ids='57654266600;26633708400;21634553200;57812345400;7006647005;10042315100', author_afids='60000823;60000823;60000823;60000823;60000823;60000823', coverDate='2022-02-01', coverDisplayDate='February 2022', publicationName='Catalysts', issn=None, source_id='21100332402', eIssn='20734344', aggregationType='Journal', volume='12', issueIdentifier='2', article_number='194', pageRange=None, description='Background: Chemical industry has increased the investment into and innovation capac-ity to supply chemicals from safe and sustainable sources, which will be essential to offering new solutions and supporting the green transition of the global economy and society. In this sense, the use of green solvents and reusable heterogeneous catalysts has emerged as a promising sustainable process strategy for engineering, chemistry and the environment. In this work, different homogeneous (copper bromide, CuBr and copper(II) acetate, Cu (CH3COO)2∙H2O) and heterogeneous (Cu Wire, Cu Plate, Cu/β‐SiC, pre‐treated Cu Wire and pre‐treated Cu Plate) copper catalysts were tested for the copper(I)‐catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. In addition, the influence of different reaction media was analyzed, comparing the use of an organic solvent such as toluene and a green solvent such as supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Methods: Characterization of the catalysts includes by X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Scan Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA) and Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR). Parameters such as catalyst loading, reaction time, reusability and leaching of the catalysts were studied to obtain more information on the CuAAC reaction in scCO2. Results: The pre‐treated copper plate achieved a 57% increase in reaction yield compared to the non pre‐treated copper plate. However, the recovery and reuse of the pre‐treated copper plate showed a severe deterioration and a considerable change in its surface. Cu Wire (without pre‐treatment) achieved yields of up to 94.2% after reusing it for five cycles. Conclusions: These results suggest the possibility to exploit the combination of heterogeneous catalysts and scCO2 and justify further research to highlight green solvents and simultaneously address the challenges of reaction, purification and recycling.', authkeywords='Copper catalysts | CuAAC | Green chemistry | Heterogeneous catalyst | Reusability | ScCO 2', citedby_count=9, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='FEDER', fund_no='BES‐2017‐079770', fund_sponsor='Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85123526208', doi='10.3390/machines10020078', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Modeling, Kinematic Characteristics Analysis and Experimental Testing of an Elliptical Rotor Scraper Pump', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zhang Z.', afid='60030434;126541341', affilname='Qingdao University;Power Integration and Energy Storage Systems Engineering Technology Center (Qingdao)', affiliation_city='Qingdao;Qingdao', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='7', author_names='Zhang, Zhen;Zhang, Tiezhu;Zhang, Hongxin;Yang, Jian;Cao, Yang;Jiang, Yong;Tian, Dong', author_ids='57427922500;7404373530;7409197781;57221980085;57427818000;56173698800;57428133200', author_afids='60030434-126541341;60030434-126541341;60030434-126541341;60030434-126541341;60030434-126541341;60030434-126541341;60030434-126541341', coverDate='2022-02-01', coverDisplayDate='February 2022', publicationName='Machines', issn=None, source_id='21100838145', eIssn='20751702', aggregationType='Journal', volume='10', issueIdentifier='2', article_number='78', pageRange=None, description=\"Against the backdrop of the rapid burgeoning of international energy engineering, the efficient utilization of energy is a paramount factor. The key idea in this paper is to propose an elliptical rotor scraper pump (ERSP) in order to address the imperfections and defects of traditional volume pumps, such as their labyrinthine design, low volume utilization efficiency and undesirable sealing performance. The ERSP can dramatically achieve the aims of ameliorating pump structure and improving energy efficiency. One of the Roots pump's rotors or the vane pump's shifting blade is replaced by a swing scraper in the ERSP. It is worth noting that a small swing range is a high-priority feature of the scraper; the scraper not only serves the purpose of dividing the pump cavity and self-sealing the unit but also reduces the noise level when working. A vital function of ERSP is the efficient conversion of mechanical energy into fluid pressure energy by changing the volume. Simultaneously, based on theoretical analysis, the mathematical model of the ERSP is established, and its kinematic characteristics are investigated, using ADAMS to verify the kinematic rationality of the ERSP. Ultimately, the research group manufactured a prototype of the pump, based on the previous simulation results and calculations, and experiments verified the feasibility of the pump. The design and research of the ERSP have essential reference significance for the development of fluid energy machinery technology.\", authkeywords='ADAMS | Kinematic characteristics | Prototype testing | Pumps | Structural innovation', citedby_count=7, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='19-6-1-92-nsh', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85123524971', doi='10.3390/su14031511', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Organizational (Non-) Adoption of Legally Obliged Energy-Saving Technologies: Why (Not) Comply?', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='van Helmond C.G.C.', afid='60002862', affilname='Faculteit der Managementwetenschappen', affiliation_city='Nijmegen', affiliation_country='Netherlands', author_count='2', author_names='van Helmond, Carlijn G.C.;Kok, Robert A.W.', author_ids='57428287900;7005310471', author_afids='60002862;60002862', coverDate='2022-02-01', coverDisplayDate='February-1 2022', publicationName='Sustainability (Switzerland)', issn=None, source_id='21100240100', eIssn='20711050', aggregationType='Journal', volume='14', issueIdentifier='3', article_number='1511', pageRange=None, description='Although there are organizations that have adopted legally imposed measures regarding energy-saving technologies, up until now, there has been a lot of unused energy-saving potential.

A “multiple mini-case” study, with six cases in the Dutch metalworking/electrical engineering sector and in the synthetic material/rubber sector, were conducted. Results show that, nowadays, organizations do not feel any regulatory pressures as they are not aware of the existence of the concerned legal obligations, e.g., where an organization’s self-awareness (of the relative advantages of the technologies) begins to play the most important role. To adopt the technologies, decisionmakers must be convinced that adopting energy-saving technologies involves advantages for the organization and that the payback time is sufficient. Financial dilemmas negatively influence these adoption processes.

The report asserts that it is possible to create a healthier and more equitable future where fewer adolescents and adults are infected, fewer babies are born with STIs, and people entering their sexual debut and continuing throughout the life span are taught the language and skills to conceptualize and enact their own vision for what it means to be sexually healthy.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=9, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='NIGMS', fund_no='U54GM104940', fund_sponsor='National Institute of General Medical Sciences'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85121451302', doi='10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101834', pii='S0160791X21003092', pubmed_id=None, title='The evolution of socio-technical transition studies: A scientometric analysis', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Nesari M.', afid='60024529;60022927', affilname=\"Allameh Tabataba'i University;University of Tehran\", affiliation_city='Tehran;Tehran', affiliation_country='Iran;Iran', author_count='4', author_names='Nesari, Mohammad;Naghizadeh, Mohammad;Ghazinoori, Soroush;Manteghi, Manoochehr', author_ids='57377827600;57213938763;14818929900;46161378700', author_afids='60024529;60024529;60024529;60022927', coverDate='2022-02-01', coverDisplayDate='February 2022', publicationName='Technology in Society', issn='0160791X', source_id='18676', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='68', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='101834', pageRange=None, description='Although socio-technical transition studies have gained lots of attention over recent decades from different aspects, the lack of systematic analysis is seen in this field.

The results indicate a growing trend in publication number in this field. In addition, this study represents a noticeable network of collaborations among scholars. Most papers were published by Netherlands, England, USA, Sweden, and Switzerland respectively. Most relevant authors of the socio-technical transition come from European countries and most cooperation has been between these countries themselves and between them and the countries such as USA and Australia. Frank Geels has the top position of the most relevant and most cited author of the field. The most frequent keyword is sustainability transitions which is an emerging topic in transition studies. The combination of development degree and relevance degree shows that energy transition, sustainability and sustainability transitions are the motor themes of the field.

A broad spectrum of methods has been proposed since the 1990s, which ranges into several dozen. It is unclear whether this large number trivially stems from copying and relabeling or whether there are substantial differences in these methods that can be tied to their applicability in different contexts or to the pursuit of different goals. Accordingly, we ask: Which activities do process improvement methods have in common, how do they differ, and why? In this paper, we approach these research questions using a multi-method design integrating techniques from systematic literature review, process mining, and statistical analysis. Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide a framework with 264 activities clustered in six stages that could be used for incrementally and radically improving processes. Second, we find that methods map to different configurations of the three dimensions described by the redesign orbit. Third, we uncover similarities and differences of the different methods contingent to the factors industry, objectives and whether a method is proposed or applied. Fourth, we observe three distinct clusters of method activities, which show that different strategies play a role when choosing a method for improvement.

Proponents of novel technologies within these firms then play an important role in bridging the developments in the field with the rest of the firm. In this study, we explore how researchers in big pharma firms engaged with knowledge from a promising, yet once-speculative approach called fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). To set the context, we mapped the publications and drugs in clinical trials coming from this approach across big pharma firms. Through our unique access to researchers in two big pharma firms (an early and a late adopter), we conducted a case study to explore how researchers built the capability within their firms. We find that at each stage of knowledge absorption (search and recognize value, assimilate, acquire, transform and exploit), proponents perform both internal- and external-facing activities to overcome uncertainties with regards to the field. We find that the emphasis of these activities evolves over time as the field evolves. In the early days of the field, proponents of the approach motivated knowledge absorption by emphasizing the internal needs of the firm. As the field matured, with its value becoming increasingly known, proponents lean on the exciting developments in the field to motivate further the adoption of the technology. In general, we find that proponents strategically tuned their external activities to cater to their internal context and similarly, adapted their internal activities to reflect external developments.

Yet we still lack an understanding of how firms can successfully adapt to this disruption. I examine this issue theoretically by combining arguments around dynamic capabilities and managerial cognition and developing several hypotheses concerning firm innovation, knowledge sources, management practices, and gender issues in relation to firms’ adaptation to this crisis. I test these assertions using data from two rounds of surveys involving more than 11,000 firms from 28 countries both before and after COVID-19 was officially declared a global crisis. The empirical results provide prima facie evidence that innovators, in particular those who are younger (i.e. start-ups) and those who rely on internal sources of knowledge, are more likely to adapt to COVID-19 than non-innovators. Moreover, firms with better management practices exhibit also greater ability to adapt to the crisis. I did not find systematic gender differences upon examining firms managed by women versus men.

In the proposed model, a firm makes unobservable efforts and can hide the technology's arrival from the regulator to avoid adoption costs. We find that the optimal policy follows a simple structure and induces part-time efforts, rather than the maximal effort reported in previous studies. In particular, the regulator should offer no subsidy before the arrival of a technology report, provide a one-time subsidy contingent upon that report, and always set a termination deadline. At the deadline, the firm is forced to select an external option that is associated with social costs. The optimal report-based subsidy decreases with time. Under the optimal policy, the firm works until an effort deadline, makes no effort thereafter, and reports the technology as soon as it arrives. This study also characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the optimal policy reduces to one that leads, in terms of throughout time, to effort that is maximal or minimal. Our results indicate that policymakers should implement a policy that compensates firms more in the present and less in the future.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=18, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NKRDPC', fund_no='2018AAA0101601', fund_sponsor='National Key Research and Development Program of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85102590478', doi='10.1177/09504222211001785', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A campus start-up ecosystem for mechanical engineering students: Challenges, approaches, catalysts and solutions', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Pradeep M.', afid='60032686', affilname='University of Calicut', affiliation_city='Chelari', affiliation_country='India', author_count='2', author_names='Pradeep, M.;Satish, K.

Practioners within the TI Office have sustained their commitment to roadmapping during an era of significant evolution of the practice within industry and academia. The practice came out of product manufacturing environments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Increasingly since the early 2000s, roadmapping has been applied outside this 'traditional' realm, requiring trial, iteration, and customization of processes, tools, and deliverables to meet different requirements. The TI Office's use of roadmapping is one 'nontraditional' variant because the agency is not in the business of generating profits by creating products in response to market demands. Instead, the TI Office has used roadmapping to communicate the agency's technology research, development, and demonstration agenda to the broader community - national laboratories, universities, manufacturers, etc. - so these external organizations can respond with proposals delivering products with the desired technology characteristics. These products, in turn, enable BPA to continue to fulfill its public service mission as an electric utility and government entity in providing safe, cost-effective, and reliable electricity throughout the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.\", authkeywords='Data visualization | electric utility | government | maturity model | roadmapping | university-industry collaboration', citedby_count=6, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85086015132', doi='10.1177/1469540520926252', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Towards a circular economy in food consumption: Food waste reduction practices as ethical work', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Lehtokunnas T.', afid='60011170', affilname='Tampere University', affiliation_city='Tampere', affiliation_country='Finland', author_count='4', author_names='Lehtokunnas, Taru;Mattila, Malla;Närvänen, Elina;Mesiranta, Nina', author_ids='57217067970;55582715000;55704320900;24171810800', author_afids='60011170;60011170;60011170;60011170', coverDate='2022-02-01', coverDisplayDate='February 2022', publicationName='Journal of Consumer Culture', issn='14695405', source_id='5700161512', eIssn='17412900', aggregationType='Journal', volume='22', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='227-245', description='This article explores the transition towards a circular economy in the context of household food waste practices. The research concerning the circular economy has mainly focused on engineering or the processes of production, manufacturing, business and industry. However, the transition towards a circular economy requires, in addition to new technologies, infrastructures and innovations, a societal change and a change in everyday practices. In this article, we address this by examining the everyday practices of food waste reduction in households as ethical work. We claim that the intertwined practices, institutions and policies of the circular economy create moral categories and responsibilities in everyday food consumption. Thus, the transition towards circular economy requires everyday ethical work carried out by consumers. However, our analysis also brings out some possible challenges related to this transition that has not yet been accomplished. Our research materials consist of 26 food waste diaries collected from Finnish households and participant observation in 4 leftover cooking workshops organized with the Finnish Martha organization. We adapt Michel Foucault’s conception of ethics, focusing on the constitution of ethical subjectivity in food waste practices. Moreover, we utilize practice theoretical approach that has been widely used in food waste and sustainable consumption studies and connect it with Foucault’s theory.

The evaluation of scientific and technological talents acts as the \"guiding stick\" of talent development, which would affect the value orientation, field direction, resource allocation and other key elements influencing the development of scientific and technological talents. In May 2021, Xi Jinping stressed the importance of evaluation system reform at the 20th Academician Conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the 15th Academician Conference of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the 10th National Congress of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology. He called to \"break the four only (paper-only, title-only, education-only and award-only tendency)\" and \"establish new standards\" at the same time. In September 2021, Xi Jinping stressed at the Central Conference on Talent-related Work that we should improve the talent evaluation system and speed up the establishment of a talent evaluation system guided by innovative value, ability and contribution. These views reflected that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China raised great attention to the basic and guiding role of the talent evaluation system, and determined to solve the problems within the current evaluation system. At its core, this study put forth the idea that talent evaluation should be based on the \"scientific value, technical value, economic value, social value and cultural value\" of the accomplishments made by the individual scholar (hereinafter referred to as the \"five values\"). Firstly, this paper systematically analyzed the internal relationship between scientific and technological talent evaluation and talent discovery, introduction, assessment, promotion, incentive and support, and summarized the evolvement of quantitative evaluation system internationally and in China as well. The study also reviewed the progress of recent reform of China\\'s scientific and technological talent evaluation. Secondly, the study analyzed the value orientation of different types of scientific and technological talent evaluation based on the five values orientation, that scientific value should be emphasized in the evaluation of the field of basic research, technical value should be emphasized in the evaluation of the field of applied research and technological development, economic value should be emphasized in the evaluation of the field of application and transfer of technology achievements, social value should be emphasized in the field related to public welfare, and cultural value should be emphasized in the field of science popularization, culture and consulting. The study further put forward the countermeasures and suggestions to \"break the four only\" and \"establish new standards\" within the five values framework. The suggestions were from the perspectives of improving the standard system, innovating methods and reforming the mechanism. Talents are the key to promoting independent innovation. Without the backing of a strong talent team, independent innovation is water without a source and a tree without roots. As an important part for the development of scientific and technological talents, talent evaluation should further pay attention to its \"baton\" role, adhere to the concept of five values in the evaluation of scientific and technological innovation achievements, constantly improve the evaluation system of scientific and technological talents, stimulate the internal driving force of scientific and technological talents, and continuously improve the overall level of scientific and technological talents.', authkeywords='Break the four only | Establish new standards | Five value orientation | Scientific and technological talents evaluation', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85129162922', doi='10.1145/3520084.3520094', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research and practice of ministry-level software process improvement based on SW - CMM model', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Wang X.F.', afid='60278193', affilname=\"Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China\", affiliation_city='Beijing', affiliation_country='China', author_count='2', author_names='Wang, Xue Fei;Wu, Kong Yi', author_ids='57465915300;57224476653', author_afids='60278193;60278193', coverDate='2022-01-21', coverDisplayDate='21 January 2022', publicationName='ACM International Conference Proceeding Series', issn=None, source_id='11600154611', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='61-67', description='With the continuous innovation of computer software technology, the e-government and other related information work of government departments has received increasing attention.

It is one of the key technologies of material genome engineering. High throughput preparation is the cornerstone of high throughput experiment. Its technical development direction can be summarized into two ca-tegories. The first is to improve the preparation efficiency through parallel experiments. The second is to achieve gradient changes in composition or process parameters on the same sample. According to the scale of sample preparation unit, it can be divided into nano-micro sample preparation method and macro sample preparation method. Nano-micro scale high throughput preparation technology represented by diffusion multiple method and combinatorial chips method has been widely used in various new materials. At present, one of the important development directions in this field is the high throughput preparation technology of bulk samples to realize the direct characterization of macroscopic mechanical properties. High throughput preparation methods of developing macro-scale samples can be generally divided into two categories: component high throughput preparation and process high throughput preparation. In this paper, latest research progress of high throughput preparation technology is reviewed, especially a combination technical approach of high throughput experiment and additive manufacture. In addition, the application of several high throughput preparation technologies in the design of high entropy alloys, amorphous alloys and novel structural materials are listed. The key points and trends of the future development of high throughput preparation technology are finally analyzed, including the high throughput preparation of homogeneous bulk samples, the integration of high throughput preparation and characterization and the development of an integra-ted cloud data platform for high throughput data acquisition, management and learning.

There are emerging genetic improvement objectives including need for developing CMS system, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, ideal plant types for high-density planting and mechanical harvesting, and ricin-free castor bean seeds. Conventional breeding efforts and innovations including hybrid development using two-line system, selecting annual type from perennial nature, incorporating resistance against diseases, increasing harvest index, etc. have contributed immensely for increasing the productivity of the crop. However, in the absence of suitable genetic material with suitable traits, a few of the objectives such as resistance to gray mold disease, resistance to foliage feeders, ricin-free castor bean, etc. have not been achieved with the traditional approach. In this background, the success stories that have been witnessed in other crops as well as with the basic information that has been generated in castor bean suggest that biotechnological approaches employing genomics-assisted breeding and genetic engineering strategies have immense potential in the genetic improvement of castor bean.

Design/methodology/approach: The research follows a design science research approach. Following the case of I4.0 technology introduction at a large food manufacturer, the paper develops a theoretical framework (artefact) and validates the applicability and efficacy of the framework within the case study. Findings: The theoretical framework highlights the different temporal (short-term/long-term) and locational (direct/indirect) value dimensions of I4.0 opportunities. The findings show that the use of the framework can shift managers’ perception regarding the business value of an I4.0 technology implementation. Specifically, the framework reversed initially negative perceptions around a narrowly scoped business case towards an opportunity-oriented attitude exploring further potentials of the technology. Research limitations/implications: The research adds to the debate when and why firms engage in, and sustain their I4.0 initiatives by providing a novel perspective on firms’ sensing capabilities.

However, its adoption rate is still reported as low in the construction industry due to a lack of expertise and the limited reliable applications for AI technology. Hence, this paper aims to present the detailed outcome of experimentations evaluating the applicability and the performance of AI object detection algorithms for construction modular object detection. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a thorough evaluation of two deep learning algorithms for object detection, including the faster region-based convolutional neural network (faster RCNN) and single shot multi-box detector (SSD). Two types of metrics are also presented; first, the average recall and mean average precision by image pixels; second, the recall and precision by counting. To conduct the experiments using the selected algorithms, four infrastructure and building construction sites are chosen to collect the required data, including a total of 990 images of three different but common modular objects, including modular panels, safety barricades and site fences. Findings: The results of the comprehensive evaluation of the algorithms show that the performance of faster RCNN and SSD depends on the context that detection occurs. Indeed, surrounding objects and the backgrounds of the objects affect the level of accuracy obtained from the AI analysis and may particularly effect precision and recall. The analysis of loss lines shows that the loss lines for selected objects depend on both their geometry and the image background. The results on selected objects show that faster RCNN offers higher accuracy than SSD for detection of selected objects. Research limitations/implications: The results show that modular object detection is crucial in construction for the achievement of the required information for project quality and safety objectives. The detection process can significantly improve monitoring object installation progress in an accurate and machine-based manner avoiding human errors. The results of this paper are limited to three construction sites, but future investigations can cover more tasks or objects from different construction sites in a fully automated manner. Originality/value: This paper’s originality lies in offering new AI applications in modular construction, using a large first-hand data set collected from three construction sites. Furthermore, the paper presents the scientific evaluation results of implementing recent object detection algorithms across a set of extended metrics using the original training and validation data sets to improve the generalisability of the experimentation.

It is challenging to identify and defend against these attacks since they are becoming more sophisticated and more frequent every day. So it's important to identify and prevent such type of attack before any impact. In this study, research on a new dataset of DDoS attacks which includes HTTP Flood attacks, and UDP Flood is conducted.SVM, KNN, and Random Forest among other machine learning algorithms for classification are used in this work to classify nodes as malicious or non-malicious nodes. Additionally, Fuzzy inference rules are applied to malicious nodes classified by machine learning algorithms(SVM, KNN, and Random Forest)accurately identify nodes as highly malicious, moderate malicious, or nonmalicious. Finally using all the processed information a decision is made to eliminate all the highly malicious nodes.

There are many methods to solve the resulting optimization problem, all of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. Rule-based Control is unsuitable for optimal integration of dynamic constraints, and the promising Model Predictive Control comes with a high engineering overhead. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subfamily of Machine Learning, has therefore been established as another method in research. In a previous work, we have demonstrated how two RL algorithms can be used for load shifting in a simulated cooling network with three consumer sites, under dynamic constraints. The continuous control DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm achieved slightly better results compared to the discrete control DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm. However, both were generally suitable for the application. In this work, we now investigate how the training and the final control performance change when recent innovations from RL research are used for both algorithms. For the continuous case, a SAC (Soft-Actor-Critic) algorithm is used and the discrete controlling DQN receives two additional design extensions. In addition, a Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization is performed for both algorithms. We can show that the training time is reduced several magnitudes compared to the last study while maintaining the same performance. After completion of training, both algorithms can save about 13 % of the weekly operating costs through load shifting, while maintaining the required temperature limits. Thus, the application to real-world problems becomes more feasible if the latest innovations from RL research are used.', authkeywords='Bayesian optimization | Building Energy System | Cooling network | Load shifting | Optimal control | Reinforcement Learning', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='BMWK', fund_no='03SBE0006A', fund_sponsor='Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85195319392', doi='10.3389/fsysb.2022.1044281', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Teaching computational systems biology with an eye on quantitative systems pharmacology at the undergraduate level: Why do it, who would take it, and what should we teach?', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Androulakis I.P.', afid='60119141;131337639', affilname='Rutgers University–New Brunswick;Biomedical Engineering Department', affiliation_city='New Brunswick;New Brunswick', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='1', author_names='Androulakis, Ioannis P.', author_ids='12803819700', author_afids='131337639-60119141', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Frontiers in Systems Biology', issn=None, source_id='21101226628', eIssn='26740702', aggregationType='Journal', volume='2', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='1044281', pageRange=None, description='Computational systems biology (CSB) is a field that emerged primarily as the product of research activities.

It comprises a variety of scientific fields, including pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. The drug discovery centers and industries have supplied several life-saving medications for decades, which contribute to novel treatment opportunities for several life-threatening diseases. A central aim of the initiatives for drug discovery is to identify new molecular entities that can be useful in the management of diseases with unsatisfied needs. These conditions do not have useful treatments and, in fact, or potentially, constitute life threats. Many disorders, particularly acute diseases, can now be treated and managed properly. New drugs for heart disease, metabolic disorders, osteoporosis, mental health problems, oncology, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive health care, viral infections, etc. have been discovered to improve the health and quality of life. The entire procedure of drug discovery is a very complicated, time-consuming, expensive, and financially risky effort. Nowadays, drugs are produced via different naturally occurring resources, both traditionally or by various innovative techniques (Figure 25.1). Normally, it takes 10–15 years and requires the application of even over 2.5 billion dollars to have a novel medication in the market. In terms of the research & development (R & D) process and the new drug application process (NDA), the drug development industry is restructuring worldwide. Many of the restructurings were driven by costs, often benchmarked by governments in the United States and Europe, to provide the best value to the public purse for the purchase of medicines for national medical services. During the early stages of the drug development process, large-scale and complex chemical libraries are examined to identify new hits (i.e., bioactive compounds, ligands, and biomarkers). The complete process of drug discovery and development is graphically represented in Figure 25.2. Traditional medicinal chemistry strategies are often combined with sophisticated structural-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD) methods for exploring the huge chemical and biological molecules mostly as a major element of hit-to-lead advancement, lead standardization, and development of new active compounds. It is well known that drug discovery changed. In the past 5 years, Big Pharma around the world has undergone significant restructuring, with large companies remaining in need of all their skills and knowledge. It started outsourcing research organizations, but now it has gone much even further into the digital world. The path from concept in the new world of drug discovery and the goal of patient benefit validation will be a joint effort. New therapeutic classes are generated based on scientific options and therapeutical needs of drugs like pain medication, sedatives, L-dopa, antimicrobial agents, bioactive molecules, immunotherapies, and other drugs. All these medications were developed within a chemical framework of drug therapy and medication. Historically procedure of drug discovery and development is as old as some of the oldest human cultures. Ayurveda practice in India and traditional Chinese medicines in China are still in practice with over 5000-year-old therapy. Since the time Edward Jenner discovered immunization against smallpox, the beginning of modern medicine is considered. The field developed gradually until 1928, when Sir Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin after which the field of medicinal chemistry flourished and it became a complex interdisciplinary platform by the end of the twentieth century, mainly based on synthetic biological chemistry, which extended to multiple physiological specificities. Just at the beginning of the 21st century, research on drug discovery faced new challenges that transformed the classical concept of drug development that had taken place over half a century in practice. Pharmaceutical firms have therefore settled policies to address these problems and identified many key success features. While there are significant obstacles to marketing new drugs, it is a trend in the past 15 years that the number of drug approvals has increased. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority approved an average of 43 drugs in 2014–18, compared to an average of 23 in the first decade of the century. Researchers regard 2018 as a successful year with almost 59 FDA-approved drugs. Though impressive, these figures must be seen as part of total research and development (R&D) spending in the pharmaceutical sector. As a result, in 35 years, efforts to find and develop new drugs have been doubled. We are still a long way behind this pursuit, despite progress and heavy investment. The concern is that there seems to be something wrong in this translation from precise early discovery experiments to translations in different animal models and clinical trials. All the high molecule assumptions focus on various methods for the mapping of chemicals and wet lab goals, including the target design of drugs, the creation of new targets and implementing existing targets, and the launch of special molecules from multiple perspectives, on a synthetic route and the biodiversity test for novel drugs, appeared to be failed. Despite high promising activities in the in-vitro models, the drop-off of molecules when transported through the development chain is high. In recent years, countless emerging innovations and concepts have emerged for drug discovery. Besides the onset of each new method, a commitment was made to generate better drugs while reducing or containing costs. At least to some degree, these techniques have been employed in most pharmaceutical companies. During the same period, industry management has been greatly pressured by shareholders and investors to increase drug development and innovation productivity to meet annual growth expectations. The most noticeable methods to cure have already been tried and often failed for many diseases. During the same period, industry management has been greatly pressured by shareholders and investors to increase drug development and innovation productivity to meet annual growth expectations. The most noticeable methods to cure have already been tried and often failed for many diseases. For the development and evaluation of new medicines, the complexity of human biology also presents many challenges. Drug molecules with activity specific to one unique biological pathway in diseased cells with an optimal beginning and/or duration of action pharmacokinetic profile or without side effects as a result of systemically exposed conditions are very difficult to design. Patient compliance can also be a significant challenge when taking medicines. Drug delivery systems allow the design and engineering level of control to overcome these challenges beyond the inherent properties of the drug molecule. The old ways of finding drugs have passed forever and surely nobody wants to go back to packing and running columns manually. The trend we presently see for the large pharmaceutical chemist to become a multidisciplinary drug explorer at the core of a global discovery web.

A series of SpaceLand Centers is conceived also to cater for vital needs of developing nations in terms of ethical science research, future-facing education and sustainable technological progress related to microgravity R&D, at the same time generating good returns to stakeholders. It all hinges around records set by SpaceLand also during NASA Microgravity Pathfinder Flights for state-of-the-art ICT and biomed R&D conducted with world\\'s youngest (11-yr-old Kim Marco Viberti), world\\'s oldest (93-yr-old Cesare Massano) and world\\'s 1st 100% disabled (Elma Schippa, April 2005) and other laypersons as subjects and operators of 0-G tests, also on behalf of a Nobel Prize winning scientist. Differently from the modus operandi hinted at by the UN Secretary-General when speaking, in September 2021, about “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on Earth”, the virtuous system hereby proposed intends to drastically reduce the financial burden to enter the Space era, thanks to “open” training and educational hubs affordable to anyone, linked with inexpensive parabolic flights on novel vehicles. Mixing aerospace tourism opportunities with weightless STEAMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math, Medicine) research open to anybody, this business also provides much-needed Space-engagement facilities and initiatives all-year-round to create jobs and sustainable socio-economic growth for the involved territories. Concentrating all such functions and services in an immersive fashion within futuristic \"Mars-base-like” ISRU settlements with ad-hoc ground and underwater testbeds, interactive educational tools, low-gravity emulators and STEAMM laboratories, at SpaceLand Centers scientists, people and payloads get prepared for the “real thing”, qualifying for Mars-gravity, Moon-gravity, Zero-gravity flight missions at the lowest-ever cost on the world\\'s longest single-aisle parabolic flight vehicle secured by SpaceLand to also serve as aero-launch platform for small satellite-carrying launchers. The success of this self-sustained business model showcases how an actual democratization of Space can indeed provide good returns to shareholders while wide-opening people\\'s access to Space-related techno-scientific tools and services. The transformative relevance of such a “Space for All” iniative stands out also insofar as it creates labour-intensive occupation, triggers new careers and aggregates valuable innovation and know-how for progress in all STEAMM areas, thanks to the uniqueness of microgravity.

Capacity building is capital in ensuring the space sector remains viable for generations. Space education is critical in awakening interest in Space amongst individuals. Educating children about Space often sparks their curiosity and encourages both genders to become involved in Sciences, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. A context-specific approach is needed when educating children on any topic because this facilitates their understanding and stimulates their ingenuity. Using the daily experiences and tools familiar to children is paramount. A sure way to do this is by providing children with adapted storybooks, comic books, and video games and creating space museums and planetariums. Also, organizing space boot camps where the children will learn about space exploration and see instruments used in space exploration can help increase children's knowledge and develop their interest in Space technologies. Documentaries and movies that involve visual stimuli and imagination, coupled with basic experiments and practical sessions involving tactile stimuli, will permit children to easily remember concepts learned and put these into practice when necessary. In conclusion, there is a need to efficiently involve the younger generation in space exploration through space education to promote quality education, reduce inequalities, and facilitate industry innovation and infrastructure, all necessary for the sustainable development of the space sector in LMICs.

NASA standards, released in 2015, show the need for autonomous medical care when the estimated levels of potential risk for medical problems are high. That is estimated to occur in long-duration planetary crewed missions (like that on the Moon and Mars) lasting more than 200 days. The need for such technology, currently not existing, shows that current capabilities and knowledge are not enough to mitigate hazards to human health. Adopting new healthcare capabilities leads to a shift in planning, managing, and executing health-related practices. Standard safety tests for general medical technology are not enough to ensure safety, and new capabilities are safe when meeting space safety requirements only. Furthermore, the same roadmaps share the need to account for private companies for delivering or commissioning services and products in space, not excluding the involvement of commercial astronauts. It is reasonable to think: what is healthcare innovation required for? And, who will be the end-user? Medical technology is closely related to specific services and end-users, two factors highly variable in incoming missions. Consequently, innovating in such a field could be extremely challenging and not practical. This work explores the driving factors of innovation in space medical technology, starting with the first human spaceflights. The objective is to investigate interrelated aspects of such driving factors concerning three significant elements: (i) space medical research discoveries, (ii) parameters of the astronaut population (such as background, age, gender, and in-flight hours, among others) and (iii) mission concepts. The significance of this work is in understanding the fit of technology and systems under development when mission constraints (such as budget and delivery time) vary. It is essential to raise awareness that such an innovation process may not be practical if the resources needed for reaching expected performance will not match constraints imposed by governmental entities.

However, the reason for the planet's specific composition and formation is yet to be explained. While many theories attempt to justify these facts, none can be confirmed without further investigation, such as one provided by a sample return mission. The science collected from this mission will allow for validation of theories about the formation of Mercury and possibly the Solar System. By investigating theories about Mercury's formation, more information will be uncovered about the Earth's Moon as there are quite a few similarities between the two bodies. These similarities will help establish a newer, more grounded theory about the origin of the Moon and its effects on Earth. Additionally, learning about Mercury could provide information on how the Earth might evolve over time. Sending a spacecraft to Mercury has many challenges, orbital mechanics being one of the biggest. As Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, its orbit is the most affected by the Sun's gravity, making it difficult to manoeuvre a spacecraft into a stable orbit. Moreover, going to Mercury is a complicated and long-duration mission requiring gravity assists and complex trajectories. Thermal control is another challenge since the spacecraft must be protected from Mercury's extreme temperatures. In this context, this research attempts to deal with these difficulties through innovative analyses of technologies to develop a feasible plan to perform such a mission. The study presents trades of different technologies and approaches for subsystems. Due to the previously discussed challenges imposed by Mercury, employing an innovative approach to the technologies will allow for designing a mission optimal for combatting challenges. The paper also discusses the mission design tools and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches used to validate results.

It is now run by the University of Houston using local resources. This student-led project, based on the 5E instructional model, is executed by the students from initial ideation of research objectives to the design, testing, and deployment of scientific payloads. The 5E Instructional model places the student at the center of knowledge building, while instructors facilitate interaction with content and guide the inquiry process. Since 2013, this project has been not only an effective vehicle for delivering STEM education but is also effective in increasing classroom engagement and interest in space. Space research is inherently interdisciplinary and crosscuts Geoscience, Engineering, and Technology. The project is designed to integrate engineering, technology, physics, material science, and earth and atmospheric sciences as an important opportunity for the students to gain access to cross-disciplinary experiential research. In addition to classroom engagement, the students build their own payloads and ground instruments. This project increases students' command of essential skills such as teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, technology, communication, innovation, and leadership. For the faculty, the project was an extended exercise in professional development, learning how to implement project level inquiry-based education on this scale. For the students, this formative experience continues to encourage the development of a much broader range of technical skills than is typically offered within an undergraduate degree. Furthermore, the extensive time and energy that students commit to this project promotes a strong sense of personal and professional responsibility and emphasizes the necessity of coherent teamwork. Not only do students make valuable connections with each other during this process, but also to the broader space science community. They often work with professionals from outside of the USIP structure, and regularly attend and present at conferences and student competitions throughout the project. This paper will present the results of the 2022 Alaska observing campaign. Student projects included subjects ranging from atmospheric trace gas chemistry, ground penetrating radar for measure permafrost thickness and thermal infrared imaging of frozen waterbodies coupled with multiwavelength LiDAR study of surface topography and chemistry, auroral electron precipitation, quantitative multi-wavelength airglow studies, search for stratospheric microplastics, and monitoring auroral radio emissions, and stratospheric conductivity.

As the first and most significant milestone, the deployment in orbit of the 3U CubeSat FACSAT-1 was achieved, becoming Colombia a satellite operator. However, this satellite was neither designed nor fully developed by COLAF. To give continuity to the program and increase the country's competitiveness in the industry, COLAF framed a strategy to achieve autonomy in mission design: It begins with the operational concept's definition, analysis, and implementation, followed by the satellite's preliminary and critical design; and ending with the creation and execution of its integration and validation plan. All above, through a transfer of knowledge (ToK) system provided by the technological ally GomSpace from Denmark and received by the Aerospace Technologies Research Center personnel (CITAE). In parallel with the transfer, COLAF sought to create the capacity to verify and validate the space products developed, leading to the design of the AIT facilities named “CUBO-2”, carried out under the supervision of INPE from Brazil in compliance with the technical standards: ISO 8 for the satellite bus and ISO 7 for payloads. In the Research, Development, and Innovation (R&D&I) activities, COLAF co-designed and co-developed a 6U CubeSat called FACSAT-2, following ECCS standards. The primary payload is an electro-optical sensor with a resolution of 5 meters per pixel, and the secondary payload is a spectrometric sensor that collects data for greenhouse gas analysis. As a result, COLAF generated products such as space-grade electronic boards (designed at the research center), payload encryption software, and mission control software for planning and tracking satellites. All of the above works as evidence of the capability acquired by the center through knowledge appropriation about subsystem identification, space mission design, sensor integration procedures, COTS model evaluation, and engineering analysis for requirements validation. In conclusion, the transfer of knowledge about satellite platforms besides the future construction of specialized facilities promotes the research for the development of new highly-functional space products. The discussion should now focus on promoting the development of new strategies that emphasize more practical elements to generate new missions and raise the capacity of the research center and, at the same time, the Colombian space program.\", authkeywords='CubeSats | emerging countries | Space program', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='S&amp;T', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Science and Technology Directorate'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85167596021', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='UNOOSA Space Law for New Space Actors: For Governmental Officials and Beyond', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator=\"O'Donnell S.\", afid='60022573', affilname='Osterreichische Institut fur Internationale Politik', affiliation_city='Vienna', affiliation_country='Austria', author_count='2', author_names=\"O'Donnell, Scarlet;Okumura, Yukiko\", author_ids='58531929900;57202434773', author_afids='60022573;60022573', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC', issn='00741795', source_id='21100255701', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2022-September', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"Innovation and knowledge derived from space exploration and related activities support economic growth, deliver high returns on investment, generate new technologies and create jobs.

The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), as the UN's dedicated entity for space affairs, works on the legal, policy and capacity-building aspects of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, as well as in space science and technology. In 2019, the Office launched the Space Law for New Space Actors project to provide targeted space law advisory services, through its legal services team, tailored to emerging spacefaring nations. Interested parties can request targeted space law capacity-building and advisory services in space law and policy provided by the Office. Since the Project's establishment, UNOOSA has delivered six technical advisory missions to governmental officials who are or will be involved in the developing process of space law and policy in their countries. Such capacity-building facilitates the development of national space law and/or policy that is in line with the existing international space law framework.

Technology, products, and materials have remarkably evolved over the last few decades. However, astronauts' present lifestyle and living standards are focused solely on surviving the harshness of outer space. Therefore, this project's premise revolves around making life in space more humane using the lens of design thinking. The project's context is centered on Space Galley as it has an exciting premise for a designer: frequent interaction of astronauts with the area, food being a crucial comfort element, and the galley is an essential aspect in long-duration space travel. Furthermore, while consuming food, it was observed that station-keeping is an essential aspect for astronauts. Hence, the project narrowed down to Restraint Aids, which help in station-keeping, allowing astronauts to orient themselves to the workspace and carry out experiments and daily activities. The project's outcome is space footwear and new mobility aid, which significantly reduce the physical discomfort to the user, improve ergonomics for a longer duration and enhance well-being. The project's overall theme focuses on shifting from a machine-centric approach to a more human-centric approach.

To nurture the sustainable growth of the national Space ecosystem, Portugal Space promotes a set of unconventional, dynamic and practical activities available to the national and international student community. In this paper we present and discuss two on-going educational initiatives: the Zero-G Portugal initiative intends to bring Space closer to high-school students by allowing them to experience the sensation of floating in Space even if just for a few seconds, while also learning about the physics and applications of microgravity. It is further expected to evolve this activity to research flights, where university students can perform their previously planned experiments in a microgravity environment, allowing to explore science in a more practical manner and create enthusiasm for Space while actively learning. Portugal Space also promotes the European Rocketry Challenge - EuRoC, that seeks to stimulate university students to fly sounding rockets, by designing and building the rockets themselves. Such competitions stimulate innovation and motivate students to extend themselves beyond the classroom, while learning to work as a team. The growth of EuRoC within Europe is visible, with an increasing number of teams applying and raising already worldwide interest. From 6 teams and 100 students in its first edition, to a second edition with 20 teams selected from 34 applications received, totaling around 400 students, with the first Portuguese team making their debut. For the third edition, a pre-EuRoC course, promoted in cooperation with the Technical University of Munich, has been established to provide students relevant scientific and engineering knowledge. The interest in the competition keeps growing considering the 700 students from 34 countries worldwide that attended this pre-course. From all over Portugal, students from more than 20 higher education institutions have participated, reflecting the national interest in Space-related engineering courses, along with different aerospace engineering degrees opening in national universities. Initiatives like the ones described in this paper attract students' attention and are well-suited tools for educational purposes. Although current enthusiasm is reflected in the number of participants, a long-term analysis will allow us to understand the real impact these have in the Space ecosystem as a whole.\", authkeywords='active learning | education | hands-on activities | Portugal | Space | STEM', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='ULisboa', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Universidade de Lisboa'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85167566963', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Innovation in water rockets development based on biomimicry design tool in collaboration with the Aerospace Engineering Group of Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR)', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='de-Lemos-Medina L.', afid='60071929', affilname='Universidad de Costa Rica', affiliation_city='San Jose', affiliation_country='Costa Rica', author_count='6', author_names='de-Lemos-Medina, Leonora;Campos-Fonseca, Susan;Mora-Castro, Rebeca;Soto-Garro, Morelia;Dittel-Meza, Angely;Salazar-López, Francisco', author_ids='58531331900;58531954800;57211475515;58530898100;58531954900;58531502900', author_afids='60071929;60071929;60071929;60071929;60071929;60071929', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC', issn='00741795', source_id='21100255701', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2022-September', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='At Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), we are bringing solutions and approaches to aerospace engineering in a more holistic way, considering other factors in addition to the traditionally technical ones. Since Costa Rica is a rich country in terms of biodiversity per area, we have ventured into the use of biomimicry approaches to achieve innovative and different solutions to rocketry problems. As a starting point, in this line of research and development, optimization through biomimicry thinking of the landing systems of high-power rockets was our topic of interest. This design approach from and with nature led us to propose as sources of inspiration and adaptations of robust functionality, the flying seeds of the South Pacific of Costa Rica. A prototype of a parachute system for a water rocket has been built; its design was based on the seeds of the Cedro Amargo, Cedrela odorata tree. The most remarkable characteristics of interest of this seed are the geometrical configurations and aerodynamic features, which we have identified as compatible with rocket parachute systems. This approach has allowed the development of tools for interdisciplinary collaboration, design analysis, use of materials, and experimentation that go beyond traditional practices. The biomimicry tool, in a country with significant natural wealth, represents a differentiating aspect of new design ethics, a driver of development and innovation and positions the University of Costa Rica and the country as a benchmark in the systematisation of comprehensive interdisciplinary methodologies that foster active involvement and deep respect for the natural world. In this scientific paper, we will describe the process that led to the definition of crucial variables, the selection of the best sources of inspiration from nature, and the impactful aspects that were considered in the final design.

For some years now, the sector has been opening up to other disciplines and has begun to integrate the hard sciences and soft sciences in parallel. However, there are some misunderstandings between these sciences and what they represent. Despite the initiatives that seek to create links between the humanities and the hard sciences, there are still obvious splits and tensions. This article aims to provide guidance towards achieving equality between the disciplines and the different sciences, through the particular example of design in the space sector. We will see how the different types of sciences have an interest in collaborating and making the space sector one of the first areas to consider the sciences equally with a common goal: to make life on the Moon possible and enjoyable for astronauts. The question of human missions to the Moon tackles technical challenges but also questions about our ways of living, about the very notion of habitat. In his article”Searching for Design Research Questions. A Conceptual Clarification” (2010), the theorist in design Alain Findeli says that “the purpose of design is to improve or at least maintain the 'habitability' of the world in all its dimensions.” If the role of the designer is indeed to participate in the habitability of the world, both on Earth and in space, then the place of designers in human space missions makes sense. It becomes even more interesting when the ability to work on extremely different and deeply interdisciplinary projects is considered. This article explores the value of combining research and design methods with all the disciplines involved in human spaceflight, and how this can be of immediate benefit. To do this, past examples are explored, but the techniques and technologies available presently, in a diagnostic approach to the existing situation, and the scenarios that this can generate in a process of innovation and improvement.\", authkeywords='Design | Habitat | Interdisciplinarity | Science | Technique', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='HIU', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Hope International University'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85167562988', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Role of Middle Management in the Implementation of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion as a Business Catalyst for the future Aerospace Industrial Workforce', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Pellegrino A.', afid='60115446;60019894;130064791;130064152;130064077;126324364;112369178', affilname='Thales Alenia Space Italia;Thales Alenia Space;FESA;Loft Orbital Solutions Inc;Women in Aerospace Europe (WIA-E);QinetiQ Space nv;NASA John F.

Studies in both private and public sectors show that diversity of skills and perspectives is one of the main drivers for greater innovation and success in these fields. Organizations representing a diverse workforce enable multiple demographics to relate to the company and brand, opening doors to new market segments, customers, and business partners. Consumers are becoming more diverse and firms may need to reflect this or risk losing out in important sectors. This is particularly significant for start-ups and industries where innovation is the key to growth, such as in aerospace. Moreover, no matter the business sector or the entity's size, equality and inclusion are also recognised as two of the core principles of a healthy workplace - and healthy workplaces drive productivity. The mutually reinforcing principles of equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are therefore key to business strategy and culture, as together they establish a sense of belonging among employees. Nevertheless, to create an equal, diverse, and inclusive workforce in the aerospace industry - a field that, like many STEM industries, has struggled to make progress with respect to EDI - a large cultural shift is required. Achieving EDI progress within an organization is a mindset-change that has to be progressively installed, and driving an inherent adherence to EDI principles is a shared responsibility, “being everyone's business”. However, there is no quick fix. All levels of organizations need to commit to EDI principles for company-wide initiatives to work, starting by top management commitment, immediately followed by middle management. Research clearly demonstrates that middle managers - responsible for taking executive strategies and objectives and translating them into sets of goals for their departments - often perceive EDI as an abstract concept or not as a priority. Unless the managers who directly supervise the majority of the workforce accept, encourage, and implement the recommended EDI initiatives, no progress will be made. This work was born out of the IAC IPMC Young Professionals Workshop 2021 and is thus written primarily from the perspective of diverse young professionals working in the aerospace sector. This paper aims to provide an extensive overview of how EDI principles can be effectively implemented and managed - and what the role of middle-management is within this process - in order to bring a strong positive human and business value for the future aerospace industrial workforce.\", authkeywords='diversity | EDI | equality | IMPC | inclusion | middle management', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85167562479', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title=\"JHU/APL's System Integration Support of NASA's Lunar Surface innovation Initiative\", subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Bussey B.', afid='60022054', affilname='Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory', affiliation_city='Laurel', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='5', author_names='Bussey, Ben;Clyde, Brenda;Hurley, Dana;Fuhrman, Wes;Klima, Rachel', author_ids='6602982371;16232123900;35794545900;55220311800;12789756300', author_afids='60022054;60022054;60022054;60022054;60022054', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC', issn='00741795', source_id='21100255701', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2022-September', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA)/Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative (LSII) aims to spur the deployment of technologies needed for lunar surface exploration and accelerate the technology readiness of key systems and components.

The access to sustainable energy services is a fundamental requirement for sustainable development, encompassing poverty eradication, food security, health, well-being, and education quality. Affordable and clean energy is explicitly recognized as one of the 17 sustainable development goals. OBJECTIVE: to analyse research trends and the knowledge structure in the field of affordable and clean energy. METHODS: This study was based on a descriptive bibliometric analysis of SDGs 7 \"Affordable and Clean Energy\". The Scopus database was used as a source of information, between 2012 and 2021. RESULTS: The trend of documents on Affordable and Clean Energy reveals a steady increase in the number of published papers related to this topic, indicating a growing interest and activity in researching and disseminating information about sustainable energy. It is observed that international collaboration accounts for 21.8% of the analyzed documents, indicating a significant involvement of researchers from different countries. Engineering emerges as the leading subject area with 591,146 scholarly outputs, indicating a strong focus on technological advancements and innovation. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific production in the field of affordable and clean energy has experienced steady growth, reflecting an increasing interest in research and development of sustainable energy solutions. However, it is important to recognize that this increase in the number of published papers has not translated into greater impact and recognition in the scientific community.

It first summarizes the research status of vibration and noise reduction, and research progress in phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials. Based on this, one-dimensional periodic beam, two-dimensional thin plate with circular hole, and corresponding gradient structures are introduced, and their dynamic characteristics are discussed in detail. Therefore, different equivalent methods for different models are proposed through theoretical analysis, modal analysis and transmission rate analysis. Finally, a Helmholtz-type acoustic metamaterial, i.e. a multi-layer slotted tube acoustic metamaterial, is studied. Aiming at the low-frequency band gap of this model, a theoretical model for solving the inverse problem of acousto-electric analogue equivalent is proposed, and the effect of structural parameters on the low-frequency band gap is studied using this equivalent model. This book closely revolves around how to conduct equivalent research on artificially fabricated periodic structures. The methods and conclusions presented in this book provide a new theoretical basis for the application of artificial woven periodic structures in the field of low-frequency vibration reduction and noise reduction and are also an innovation in the discipline of vibration and noise control.

BFfTH organized the online and onsite networking symposium Bio-Futures for Transplanetary Habitats to examine how emerging biotechnologies, living materials, and more-than-human life can be implemented in habitat design and mission planning. The two day symposium aimed to serve as a catalyst in establishing an international network of collaborators across industry, academia and the private sector. It also aimed to support the development of novel methodologies to move beyond discipline-specific approaches in order to address and interrogate emerging questions surrounding potential transplanetary habitats and habitats in extreme environments. The symposium was divided into five sessions which hosted a minimum of three speakers each, these sessions were: Mycelium for Mars, Plants and Agriculture, Sustainable Habitats and Travels, Artistic Approach to Extremes Habitats, and Novel Biotechnologies for Space Habitats. This paper presents key outcomes from the symposium sessions, moderated panel, and informal discussions. The trends in ongoing research are identified and summarized following the use of biotechnology and bio-design to ensure and support safety, sustainability, habitability, reliability, crew efficiency, productivity and comfort in extreme environments both here on Earth and off-world. Moving beyond pure design and engineering innovation, the outcomes of this symposium also further interrogates sociotechnical imaginaries. Biodesign-based and biotechnologically-enabled transplanetary futures are investigated to understand how we want these futures to behave, feel and be experienced. The symposium hosted a wide range of topics including: innovative material-driven processes for the design of transplanetary habitats; socio-political concerns or ethical implications to be taken into account; technology transfer and transitioning towards a sustainable built environment on Earth; multi-species narratives and relations to sustain human and other-than-human life in transplanetary habitats; sociotechnical considerations in propagating and sustaining Earthbound life beyond Earth environments; and sustainable living on Earth through a holistic systems thinking approach.

This article presents a survey with professors of undergraduate courses in Industrial Engineering about the inclusion of i4.0 technologies in these courses. The research is guided by five questions about the importance, maturity, challenges, strategies, and impacts of these technologies in Industrial Engineering courses. A total of 95 professors responded to the survey, representing 17.9% of the total number of invited professors. The results show that, although most of these technologies are considered necessary for the new profile of the industrial engineer, the degree of maturity in teaching these technologies, in most cases, is still in the early stages of adoption. In addition, challenges related to capacity, infrastructure, and resources need to be overcome for successful innovation. In this sense, some strategies were pointed out in the survey.

Aluminium is consumed globally in the form of castings and forgings, wires and cables, flat rolled products (plates, sheets and foils) and extrusions. Rolled products and extrusion segments dominate global applications of aluminium while in India, wires and cables form the largest application segment. Building, construction and packaging are other major growth segments in India, China and the Middle East. Due to aluminium’s unique combination of properties of strength to weight ratio and recyclability, it has been a vital material for driving light-weighting in the aviation, automotive and ground transportation segments.

However, the current regulatory landscape in Uganda like other developing countries is weak and poorly defined, which creates significant barriers to innovation, clinical evaluation, and translation of medical devices. Aim: To evaluate current knowledge, systems and infrastructure for medical devices regulation and innovation in Uganda. Methods: A mixed methods study design using the methods triangulation strategy was employed in this study. Data of equal weight were collected sequentially. First, a digital structured questionnaire was sent out to innovators to establish individual knowledge and experience with medical device innovation and regulation. Then, a single focus group discussion involving both medical device innovators and regulators to collect data about the current regulatory practices for medical devices in Uganda. Univariate and bivariate analysis was done for the quantitative data to summarize results in graphs and tables. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Ethical review and approval were obtained from the Makerere University School of Biomedical Sciences, Research and Ethics Committee, and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. Results: A total of 47 innovators responded to the questionnaire. 14 respondents were excluded since they were not medical device innovators. Majority (76%) of individuals had been innovators for more than a year, held a bachelor's degree with a background in Engineering and applied sciences, and worked in an academic research institute. 22 of the 33 medical device innovators had stopped working on their innovations and had stalled at the proof-of-concept stage. Insufficient funding, inadequate technical expertise and confusing regulatory landscape were major challenges to innovation. The two themes that emerged from the discussion were “developing standards for medical devices regulation” and “implementation of regulations in practical processes”. Legal limitations, lengthy processes, and low demand were identified as challenges to developing medical device regulations. Conclusions: Efforts have been taken by government to create a pathway for medical device innovations to be translated to the market. More work needs to be done to coordinate efforts among stakeholders to build effective medical device regulations in Uganda.\", authkeywords='clinical evaluation | medical device standards | medical devices | medical devices regulations | medical innovation | regulatory pathway', citedby_count=4, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='MRC', fund_no='MR/T03937X/1', fund_sponsor='Medical Research Council'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85163001959', doi='10.1007/978-3-030-90673-3_28', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Sequence-Based Marker Assisted Selection in Wheat', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Maccaferri M.', afid='60028218', affilname='Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna', affiliation_city='Bologna', affiliation_country='Italy', author_count='3', author_names='Maccaferri, Marco;Bruschi, Martina;Tuberosa, Roberto', author_ids='6603596116;58492459900;6701624176', author_afids='60028218;60028218;60028218', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2022', publicationName='Wheat Improvement: Food Security in a Changing Climate', issn=None, source_id='21101164822', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='513-538', description='Wheat improvement has traditionally been conducted by relying on arti\\xadficial crossing of suitable parental lines followed by selection of the best genetic combinations.

Wicked problems are ill-defined, ambiguous in both aims and solutions, and complex with interconnected and intertwined (coupled) factors. While being ubiquitous and difficult, however, wicked problems share characteristics common to science and design in three regards, namely agent finitude, system complexity, and problem normativity. These fundamental attributes allow a core cognitive process common to design and science to be identified and a strategic problem-solving conception of methodology be formulated as a result. The theory facilitates new opportunities for synergetic cross-disciplinary research and practice by incorporating the essences of Extenics to axiomatic design. Innovative thinking is enabled by exploring Extenics for problem reframing, paradigm shift, and abductive reasoning and by engaging axiomatic design in the co-evolution (iteration) of the need and viable design concept. The theory is unique in that it is a framework for quantifying imprecise and vague design information available during the conceptual design stage as mathematical expression and algorithm early in the design effort and enables the objective evaluation and emergence of an optimal design concept from among multitude of viable ones.

He begins by presenting the personal and political path that led him, after completing his engineering studies, to join the Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation at the École des Mines de Paris in 1968. His early work on the theme of innovation was conducted in a context where science and technology were the focus of multiple questions in economics and sociology. Michel Callon explains the collective research approach that led to the creation of the concept of translation, and the efforts to develop co-word analysis, an automated textual processing method designed to study the products of science and technology. It is from these questions on the processes of innovation, and from this long-standing dialogue with economists, that Michel Callon will develop, from the end of the 1990s, his work on markets. From research on the performativity of economic knowledge to the analysis of market agencements, this work has developed an original perspective on the dynamics of the economy, which goes beyond the criticisms usually levelled at capitalism by the social sciences. It invites us to develop a reflection on the plural roles that markets play not only in production and consumption, but also in the genesis of diverse social relations, in political organization and in crisis situations.\", authkeywords='Economic sociology | Innovation | Market agencement | Science Technology and society', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85161225277', doi='10.1007/978-3-031-05867-7_5', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Cognitive Neuroscience for Design', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Ueda K.', afid='60025272', affilname='The University of Tokyo', affiliation_city='Tokyo', affiliation_country='Japan', author_count='1', author_names='Ueda, Kazutaka', author_ids='36129031400', author_afids='60025272', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2022', publicationName='Emotional Engineering, Vol. 9: Move Ahead Toward Self-Satisfying Society (SSS)', issn=None, source_id='21101156273', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='49-55', description='Design is based on an engineering approach to solving various problems in the real world. When design is considered as a comprehensive planning of things, it is essential to understand human beings, because many of the things to be designed include human elements. This is already a common understanding among those involved in design, and in fact, various efforts are being made to understand users. However, user surveys, such as questionnaires, observation, and marketing, are still in their infancy due to the irrationality of humans and the diversity of contextual factors surrounding humans. Therefore, it is desirable to develop new theories and method-ologies to understand humans more precisely and better contribute to design. This chapter focuses on the cognitive neuroscience approach as a research approach for understanding humans as they relate to design. Cognitive neuroscience is a research field that aims to decompose human cognition and behavior as information processing processes and understand these processes, including the brain’s mechanisms, which are the biological basis of human cognition and behavior. In this field, the recent devel-opment of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and other brain function measurement techniques are expected to advance our understanding of the essence of human cognition and behavior.

Therefore, it should be given prime importance to develop crops for subsiding this issue. In order to improve the nutritional quality of crops, biofortification aids in combatting nutrient deficiency by enhancing the nutrientspecific component levels. Plants have various types of complex metabolic pathways specific for the synthesis of particular nutrient compounds as well as other secondary metabolites. Plant metabolic engineering aids in the modulation of these specific biosynthetic pathways so as to introduce the new metabolic abilities by either downgrading or upgrading any particular enzyme according to the requirement for amplifying the nutritional quality. Progress and innovations made in the sequencing and bioinformatics will provide an ample opportunity about metabolic pathways and discover the best intervention point. Knowledge attained about vitamin metabolism, uptake of minerals, and relocation in plant makes it feasible today to increase micronutrient level in crop plants. While making comparison of different agronomic practices and conventional plant breeding with plant metabolic engineering and synthetic biological strategies, the latter ones have found to be more effective in synthesizing the specific nutrients, bioactive components in crops.

Given these examinations, articles that investigate blockchain applications have been checked, broken down, and organized to absorb a proper data set curation. A two-step way to distinguish the articles had to be examined and explored to achieve this study's motivations. In the initial step, Data characterized relevant pursuit terms for digging the Scopus data set for significant articles. This data set was decided because of its extensive inclusion of companion audited research in legitimate diaries and its unavoidable presence in the local scholastic area. In the subsequent step, we utilized explicit rules to decide the consideration of articles in our data set for the bibliometric and content examinations.

Biomaterials can be described as natural or man-made materials consisting of biological components that may be from interdisciplinary scientific fields including material science, biofuels and bioenergy, pharmaceuticals, biology, genetic engineering, drug delivery, chemistry, etc. However, biological materials have wide range of applications yet the development of technology and new discoveries in the field of science require development of novel biomaterials and their systematic application. Here the use of term nano or more specifically nanotechnology takes its role. Nanotechnology is a field of research and innovation concerned with materials, devices, and particles on the atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The evolution of high standard biomaterials could be advanced by utilizing the newer generation applications of nanotechnology such as nanoparticles for drug delivery, nanocatalysts for biofuels production, nano-assemblies, or scaffolds for tissue and stem cell engineering. Contemporary technological expansion in the advancement of revolutionary speculative techniques for advance microscopy as well as for x-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, etc. has led to the investigation of substance at nano-level. Furthermore, it is strongly anticipated that healthcare, pharmaceutical, and bioenergy sectors can be remarkably upgraded by inspecting, envisioning, recognizing, refining biological materials, operations, and functions in the nanocsale domain. A considerable number of these approaches utilize nanoscale materials or nanobiomaterials for evolving distinct specifications demanded by these biological systems or processes. In this chapter, a comprehensive outlook of the field “nanobiomaterials” and a detailed overview of the numerous applications of nanobiomaterials are also discussed. In continuation, a specific presentation about various nanobiomaterials, their synthesis, their potential implementation, and finally their future prospects are also explained.', authkeywords='Bioenergy | Biofuels | Biomaterials | Health care | Nanotechnology | Pharmaceutical', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85153938419', doi='10.1109/ITME56794.2022.00165', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on Correlation between Higher Education Investment, Scientific and Technological Innovation and Economic Growth in Shandong Province under the Background of Big Data', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Zhao H.', afid='60103801;60003640', affilname='University of Jinan;Northwest Normal University China', affiliation_city='Jinan;Lanzhou', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='2', author_names='Zhao, Haixia;Yao, Wenxin', author_ids='58203347600;58203348900', author_afids='60103801;60003640', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings - 2022 12th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education, ITME 2022', issn=None, source_id='21101149128', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='792-796', description='This paper mainly studies the correlation between higher education investment, scientific and technological innovation and economic growth in Shandong Province under the background of big data.

Accessed 2020). This disease placed an unprecedented strain on healthcare systems around the world (Remuzzi and Remuzzi. Lancet. 395(10231):1225–8, 2020) and had a substantial effect on clinical practice across all surgical specialties, with neurosurgery being no exception (Bernstein. J Neurosurg. 2020:1–2. https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.4.JNS201031).

Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2020:1–9. https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.303). To conserve beds, workforce, and valuable resources such as masks, gowns, and ventilators, surgeons had to restrict operations to emergency and essential interventions. Some neurosurgeons were redeployed to new intradepartmental roles, others lateralized to provide care for coronavirus patients. In order to limit in-person interactions and contagion, there was a surge in telehealth and digital innovation for remote monitoring and management. Research laboratories were closed for prolonged periods. Medical education and residency training were also substantially altered, with cancellation of many in-person events and a transformation to online meetings and educational sessions. In this chapter, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the global neurosurgery community with respect to clinical care, education, and research.

Higher education has been particularly affected, due to social distancing imperatives and the need to develop alternate ways of delivery relying on technology and distance learning. When the pandemic hit, it highlighted the digital unpreparedness of North African (NA) universities, as they responded quickly so as not to lose what remained of the academic year. They needed to provide resources for distance learning, ensure that faculty and staff were committed and dedicated to the success of the endeavor, and develop student support mechanisms. But the pedagogical challenges faced by all NA universities also pointed to opportunities for improvements in teaching and research. As many were to point out, COVID-19 did not introduce distance learning, it simply accelerated an ongoing process. Leading world universities were already on a trajectory towards the incorporation of technology into pedagogy, for the advantages it offers in terms of data access and processing, wider access to resources, cost of education, shared coursework and competencies, collaborative research, and interactivity at all levels. On a strategic plan, the pandemic also drew the attention of NA universities to the larger question of preparedness for the fourth industrial revolution, digitalization, and digital transformation. As international higher education shifts toward science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and data science programs in order to face the ever-increasing mass of data now available, NA universities and educational decision makers are now also realizing the eventual costs of being left behind. Digitalizing course offerings is but a small part of the role universities have to play in promoting innovation and socio-economic development, through upskilling the current workforce, appropriately training that of tomorrow, and orienting research towards artificial intelligence.

In direct cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and other partners the project focuses on the following: 1) designing, creating, and verifying the on-line system (software) for setting the adequate form of technical education that would enable schools to successfully reach the expected learning results; 2) designing and verifying learning situations; 3) developing innovative teaching aids (mobile toolkits enabling sharing). The above results and products will make a positive contribution to the development of pupils' competencies-in particular, basic scientific and technical competences consisting of cognitive, motoric, social, social-moral and information-communication competencies that ensure that individuals 'participate in the use of technology as an element of culture'. Specifically, the following can be mentioned: the ability to solve problems, the ability to apply creative ideas in pupils' work, the ability to take responsibility, the ability to be self-sufficient, the ability to evaluate and express one's opinions, the ability to self-identify and self-assess in the direction of one's own professional orientation, the ability to respond flexibly to changes in the labour market.\", authkeywords='education | informatics | school | STEAM | technology', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85152847976', doi='10.1007/978-3-031-00801-6_16', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='How the CEPHEI E-course Syllabus Design Was Developed and Implemented', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Kurban C.F.', afid='60105072', affilname='MEF University', affiliation_city='Istanbul', affiliation_country='Turkey', author_count='1', author_names='Kurban, Caroline Fell', author_ids='58188208000', author_afids='60105072', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='1 January 2022', publicationName='Digital Teaching and Learning in Higher Education: Developing and Disseminating Skills for Blended Learning', issn=None, source_id='21101146806', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Book', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='331-355', description='While the digitalization of education has been around since the 1990s, it is only since the Covid-19 pandemic that it has really taken hold in education, when universities were forced to rapidly move online and traditional patterns of teaching were no longer viable. This pushed universities to provide a blended learning environment drawing on technologies that our students, as digital natives, had already been using on a daily basis for some time. However, blended learning is only effective if underpinned by tried and tested learning frameworks—something that many universities were not prepared for when the shift to online learning took place. The Cooperative e-learning Platform for Industrial Innovation (CEPHEI) however, was already prepared and ready for this shift, as from 2017 it had been working on the development of an e-learning platform with the aim of digitizing education while also integrating the reality of professional innovation activities into the context of education according to the demands of industry. To achieve this aim, one of the first phases of the project was to identify key learning frameworks for e-course syllabus design, based on existing research, that could be used to provide recommendations for instructors in the development of their CEPHEI courses. This chapter presents the culmination of this process and provides a framework that can be used by instructors or institutions wishing to design e-learning courses.

Methodology. In the course of the research, we have applied the methods of system analysis, which made it possible to explore the innovation-making in relation to the goals and scope of state policy and assess the impact of individual means of legal regulation on innovation performance. Subject-matter. The legal definition of innovation outlined in Russian legislation is investigated. It is shown that the use of the economic features of innovations for the development of a legal rule is an unsuccessful technique of legal engineering, and the application of the existing legal definition is one of the obstacles to the appropriate development of the state support system for innovation activity. Through examples, we show that uncertainty in the parameters of the state order for innovation is a constraining factor of innovative development. The article studies the performance of the “legal vacuum” to stimulate innovation activity. Findings. The legal definition of innovation and regulatory definition of the parameters of innovation activity is necessary solely for public-law effects, in particular, for developing the system of state support and state order of innovations. Law is an effective means of influence on the corresponding processes only to the extent when it allows establishing parameters for evaluation of the effectiveness and performance of the state support system. The system of state influence not assessed in parametric terms is a constraining factor of innovative development. There is an urgent need to clearly define the areas of innovation support, as well as to legally enshrine the requirements for state innovation support programs concerning the evaluation of their performance not by the amount of funding, but by effect from the sale of a new product, service or technology', authkeywords='efficiency | innovation | innovative system | legal definitions | legal engineering | legal regulation | public policy | venture capital market', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85152199183', doi='10.1109/ISAIEE57420.2022.00045', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='An Adaptive Deep Q-Learning Strategy for Routing Schemes in SDN-Based Data Centre Networks', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Li J.', afid='60108817;60010421;60005027;60001742;128960536', affilname='Guiyang University;Southwest Jiaotong University;Guizhou University;Tibet University;Guizhou Vocational Institute of Technology', affiliation_city='Guiyang;Chengdu;Guiyang;Lhasa;Fuquan', affiliation_country='China;China;China;China;China', author_count='6', author_names='Li, Jian;Wang, Shuoyu;Huang, Yubo;Liao, Kai;Bi, Feili;Lou, Xia', author_ids='58178780000;58087588700;59286608200;58178780100;58178692000;58178722400', author_afids='60108817;60001742;60010421;60005027;60108817;128960536', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings - 2022 International Symposium on Advances in Informatics, Electronics and Education, ISAIEE 2022', issn=None, source_id='21101145607', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='178-186', description='The enhancing size of uses on the cloud has improvised the requirement for dependable and elite execution network engineering in Datacentres.

This paper further discusses the security of the hydrocarbon accounting database and the overall automation of the production value chain, providing transparency to the joint venture partners involved in the crude oil export agreement to avoid revenue loss. It also provides a system that is not prone to malware or data alteration and promotes hydrocarbon allocation among the injectors, production data management and production data security. The existing system mostly in the sub-saharan Africa lacks trust and greater transparency. A new technology will be devolped using Blockchain Hyperledger which is a distributed ledger technology. For the purpose of this research Javascript, PHP, MySQL on Apache virtual machine was used to design and simulate the blockchain network. The web interface of the system was tested using katalon web test framework using Agile methodology. The system will have to integrate with the Lease Automation Custody Transfer (LACT) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), A LACT-SCADANode synchronized system will be implemented in the custody transfer point in the export pipeline, so all the oil and gas Exploration and Production (E&Ps) companies injecting crude oil can view what each company in the network injected and also the quantity that got to the export terminal daily. This will be achieved by having all the custody transfer nodes of the E&Ps and export terminal node in a network of consensus. Production data will be distributed at strategic points during the transportation among the nodes uniformly at the same time, making it impossible for cyber-invasion on all the nodes at the same time. The outcome of this research will achieve an advanced secured transparent system to store production data for accurate hydrocarbon allocation, in which the consensus attribute of the implemented blockchain technology will give each node autonomy. Hence, making the production data highly reliable and reconciliation will be achieved at real-time. This innovation further presents a new knowledge in the application of mechatronics engineering to the oil and gas sector, with its multidisciplinary focus on electronics, mechanical and computer systems. It is the integration of a software system to a LACT and sensors on the crude oil pipelines to acquire data, compute in a Hyperledger fabric network and display at real-time for hydrocarbon allocation settlement.', authkeywords=None, citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85150589427', doi='10.2523/IPTC-22141-MS', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Key Technologies of Ultra-Deep Hpht Horizontal Wells and Its Application in Shunbei Oilfield of SINOPEC', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Bai B.', afid='60021623;60016087', affilname='Sinopec;China University of Petroleum-Beijing', affiliation_city='Beijing;Beijing', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='9', author_names='Bai, Binzhen;Zeng, Yijin;Lu, Xin;Zhang, Hongning;Wang, Zhifa;Wang, Long;Zhou, Haobo;Silva, Eduardo David Gramajo;Maurice, Rached Rached', author_ids='58151387900;51162221500;58150927700;56180902900;57192240839;57223992434;55267668500;58726478600;58151700700', author_afids='60016087;60016087;60021623;60021623;60021623;60021623;60021623;60021623;60021623', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='International Petroleum Technology Conference, IPTC 2022', issn=None, source_id='21101142407', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='There was nearly 1.7 billion tons proved reserve in SINOPEC Shunbei oilfield, which is the deepest (>8000m) fault controlled marine carbonate oilfield in the world with high-temperature (>170 °C) and high -pressure (>140MPa). The formation geological conditions are complicated, high rock strength, easy leakage and collapse, multiple pressure systems co-exist in the slim borehole, which caused a series of directional drilling technical problems such as difficulty in controlling the tool surface, PDM build-up capacity prediction and so on. Therefore, the related research for ultra-deep direction drilling technology were carried out aiming at solving the directional drilling problem for Shunbei oilfield. Firstly, the optimized wellbore structure scheme design method was proposed, in which the geological characteristics, borehole size and the directional efficiency were considered. And then a double augmented well profile designed model was established based on optimizing the production casing size, through which the directional efficiency and the drilling rate of a trip were increased significantly, and the nonproductive time can be greatly reduced easily. Secondly, an ultra-deep directional well torque transmission prediction model was established based on the mechanical analysis of ultra-deep drilling string and based which a rapid tool face control method was formed. Furthermore, an innovative build-up rate prediction method was established based on both big Data analysis and balanced tendency build-up rate prediction method, and the accuracy is more than 90%. Moreover, the PDM rubber seal, stator and rotor dimensions are optimized to achieve high power output within a certain high temperature range to prolong the service life according to the wellbore temperature field. Finally, the optimization of high temperature MWD instrument and matching process technology was proposed, such as surface assisted cooling, borehole size enlarging and high displacement cooling technology effectively improve the reliability. The series of ultra-deep directional drilling technology has been applied in Shunbei oilfield. The field application results show that the average ROP of directional section is increased by more than 30%, directional efficiency is greatly improved, and the directional drilling cycle is shortened by more than 20%. Nearly 40 ultra-deep directional wells above 8000m have been constructed, setting more than 10 new Asia records of petroleum engineering onshore directional well. There are two innovations in this paper. The first is to put forward the design method of wellbore profile with the shortest drilling time as the goal, which can save 1-2 trips and improve the directional efficiency by more than 20%.

Many education institutions have online classes besides face-to-face classes.

It is reported that in a distance learning setting during the pandemic, the motivation and participation rate decreased while the absence and dropout rates increased. Knowledge conversion is a term to reflect the acquisition of new know-how or tacit knowledge from the learning activities. Currently, various technology vendor keeps making innovations to solve this problem, and available technologies that can be utilized to support distance learning education are increasing. Therefore, this paper aims to know the impact of the knowledge creation process on student satisfaction and explain how to utilize technologies throughout the knowledge creation chain. Based on the statistical analysis it is found that the knowledge creation process that is represented using the SECI model simultaneously has a significant positive effect on student satisfaction. This means all phases in SECI (socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) are simultaneously able to improve student satisfaction. However, partially, only socialization and internalization that has a significant positive impact on student satisfaction, which indicates these two factors partially could lead to better student satisfaction if it is planned and managed appropriately.

The 5G system consists of many macro cells and small cells, and its power consumption is enormous. The high efficiency and high- power density of GaN devices decreases the power consumption of the whole system. Up to now, ongoing research on N-polar GaN has demonstrated an extremely high-power and high PAE at W-band. Recently we demonstrated innovative high-k MIS N-polar GaN HEMTs which were fabricated, for the first time, using commercial 4-inch wafer process facilities. We overcame the challenge of developing a vital gate insulating film by incorporating Si LSI material technology. Furthermore, a ScAlN/GaN HEMT with high polarization and lattice-matching is also promising. An AlN/GaN HEMT on AlN substrate achieves high current density without heating up. Heat dissipation technology is a critical method of improving device performance and efficiency.

These pressures have substantially changed the role of Engineering Management in any organization from a governance group to visionaries, from oversight to innovation managers, and from task masters to talent cultivators. The Engineering Manager is no longer the hands-on arbitrator of duties. They are becoming those who are training the next generation to think and act in new ways, cultivating those ideas while mentoring a diverse and integrated workforce that does not come from traditional backgrounds. This challenges the Engineering Manager to be a director and mentor rather than following more traditional paths achieving the next set of technological solutions. This paper explores this new and ambitious approach, along with tools for success, especially in mentoring diversity candidates so their buried ideas can be brought forward in a way appealing and desirable to well-established and ingrained management structures found in corporations, companies and academia.

Digital Engineering, leveraging the best multiphysics simulation and high-performance computing (HPC), offers us a unique opportunity to lead these efforts, but a paradigm shift in engineering is mandatory: right now on the order of only 1% of engineers regularly use simulation as a tool in their design toolbox—meaning it is unusual for engineers to create virtual prototypes and broadly explore the available space of design options, and test and evolve them with modeling and simulation.

The broad nature of biotechnology is directly relevant to the military and defence sector where the applications span clinical diagnostics, medical countermeasures and therapeutics, to environmental remediation and biofuels for energy. Although the process for a commercial biotech research and development (R&D) pipeline and the Department of Defence (DOD) acquisition cycle both aim to result in products, they follow two distinctly different pathways. In the biotech industry, the pipeline progresses from basic to applied science that includes design and R&D, commercialisation and product launch, where market forces and financial returns on investment drive priorities. Along the way, the scientific and iterative nature of R&D often results in several candidates for a given assay, drug, therapeutic or vaccine, many of which are unsuccessful or wind up in the so-called valley of death. The DOD acquisition process is a multi-phase and often multi-decade cradle-to-grave product lifecycle engrained in mission requirements, warfighter needs and creating legacy programmes of record. The biotech industry is composed of many small R&D and ‘big pharma’ companies that meet DOD’s unique medical mission requirements. These small R&D companies considered that non-traditional DOD acquisition partners are developing new innovations in biotechnology, but the complex DOD acquisition process is challenging for these small start-ups to navigate. Technology solutions that gain support through DOD acquisitions are able to successfully develop their products and bridge the valley of death by obtaining much needed funding for advanced development, test and evaluation, and demonstration through clinical trials.

Research indicates that universities have distinctive capabilities that allow them to play an important role in the process of research innovation commercialization.

However, this is significantly lower compared to that of their counterparts (specifically, Predominately White Institutions - PWIs). This according to available research is mainly because HBCUs have been traditionally under-served and under-resourced. Currently several programs such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps and National Science Foundation Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (NSF- CREST) Center for Nanotechnology Research and Education (CNRE)) are being implemented by HBCUs to promote the commercialization of research innovations by training innovators about commercializing innovations. However, little research has been done to assess the level of awareness of engineering undergraduate students at an HBCU about the commercialization of engineering research innovations. This pilot study, therefore, seeks to investigate the level of awareness of engineering undergraduate students at an HBCU about engineering research innovation commercialization.

Evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) proposes systematic mapping study (SMS) and systematic literature review (SLR) methods for secondary studies on software engineering.

In this approach by using a QAT domain ontology, the keywords classification process is improved. The most important innovation of this study is the presentation of the QAT research tree. This research tree has been created by gathering research topics identified in this field along with existing gaps. Identified research topics include “QAT Approach,” “QAT Development,” “QAT Model,” “QAT Framework,” and “QAT Algorithm”. The results also indicate that “QAT Frameworks” is a research trend, and most recent studies have focused on this topic. On the other hand, “Trace Maintenance” and “Trace Integrity” are the research gaps in this field. In this article, active researchers, journals, conferences and countries in the field of QAT are also introduced.

As a new type of material post-processing technology, the ultrasonic rolling surface strengthening technology uses the method of coupling the preset initial static pressure and the dynamic ultrasonic impact force to complete the reciprocating processing of the material surface, achieving the smoothing effect of \"cutting peaks and filling valleys\". A deeper surface nanohardening layer and beneficial residual stress are obtained, they have unique advantages in improving the surface integrity of the material. In recent years, the research and application of ultrasonic rolling technology have become a research hotspot in the field of advanced manufacturing. Many scientific researchers and engineering technicians have deepened their research on the effective control of ultrasonic rolling process parameters and other process-assisted ultrasonic rolling composite processing technology. Research has achieved technological innovation in the preparation of high-performance materials and the remanufacturing of components. This paper introduces the research status and application of ultrasonic rolling surface strengthening technology at home and abroad, enumerates the shortcomings of the existing ultrasonic rolling surface strengthening technology, and looks forward to the future research direction. At present, most researchers at home and abroad have improved the properties of the processed materials from the experimental research, simulation analysis, micro-mechanism, and application research of ultrasonic rolling, and obtained good surface integrity. But for the ultrasonic rolling surface, the synergistic regulation relationship between performance and process parameters is still unclear, and the research on performance improvement and application of ultrasonic rolling composite processing technology has not been in-depth. For this reason, starting from the processing principle of ultrasonic rolling technology, the advantages of this technology in improving surface integrity are briefly expounded. The research progress of ultrasonic rolling technology is expounded. The influencing factors of ultrasonic rolling test mainly include ultrasonic rolling output amplitude, static pressure, processing times, spindle speed, feed rate, etc. The optimal selection of process parameters can improve the control effect between material structure and properties to a certain extent, and at the same time, some ultrasonic rolling composite post-treatment processes are also affected by process parameters introduced from the outside, such as introducing temperature during the ultrasonic rolling process or adding other physical or chemical composite processes to assist processing to better promote large plastic deformation of the material and induce fine grain size, so as to achieve the surface integrity gain effect of other process-assisted ultrasonic rolling treatments. Numerical simulation of the process in the experimental study is carried out, and the optimized process parameters can be selected to obtain better surface integrity of the material. The simulation analysis can provide a simple and feasible reference for the optimization of the experimental process. The improvement effect of ultrasonic rolling treatment on wear resistance and fatigue resistance of metal materials, as well as the synergistic regulation effect of other process-assisted ultrasonic rolling technology on the improvement of material properties, are mainly reviewed. Through the reasonable selection of ultrasonic rolling process parameters, the formation of nanostructures on the surface of the material, the transformation of beneficial residual stress, and the improvement of surface microhardness can achieve synergistic effects, thereby improving the microstructure, wear resistance and wear resistance of the material performance, erosion resistance and corrosion resistance. With the continuous deepening of the application field of ultrasonic rolling technology, the application scope has expanded from the initial research of ultrasonic rolling on the surface of metal materials to composite materials, coating materials, and even from traditional mechanical fields to biomedicine, military aerospace, petroleum engineering, etc. In the field, higher requirements are put forward for the surface performance indicators of engineering parts materials. Combined with the unique advantages of conventional ultrasonic rolling, through the coupling of other processing technologies and ultrasonic rolling technology, the ultrasonic rolling-assisted surface strengthening composite processing technology can better realize the post-processing of materials, and thus develope a variety of ultrasonic rolling assisted strengthening technology. It provides a new direction for the application and development of material surface post-treatment technology in engineering practice. The synergistic effect of ultrasonic rolling coupled with other surface strengthening processes (high temperature, remelting, electric pulse physical field and other auxiliary processes) is studied, which plays a positive role in improving the surface properties of materials and enhancing the corrosion resistance and friction resistance. At present, domestic and foreign researchers have used ultrasonic rolling technology to achieve post-processing of various metal materials, and obtained high-quality and high-efficiency materials through a single ultrasonic rolling or other process-assisted ultrasonic rolling methods. However, there are also situations in which the processing efficiency of ultrasonic rolling automation equipment is not stable enough, the processing quality is not high enough, and the application in the engineering field is not yet widely used, as well as the active control of material residual stress, nanostructure, fretting wear, and fatigue damage. The research on the microscopic improvement mechanism needs to be further expanded, and the research on the evaluation of surface integrity and the imperfect detection system is not comprehensive. In the future, based on the mature theory and broad application requirements of ultrasonic rolling technology, it is believed that the related ultrasonic rolling technology system will continue to improve in the future, and new progress will be made in the development of new composite processes and the evolution law of corresponding performance enhancement progress, and continue to expand the application field of its composite technology, to achieve the progress of my country\\'s advanced manufacturing industry.', authkeywords='surface integrity | surface strengthening | ultrasonic impact force | ultrasonic rolling', citedby_count=11, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='51965023', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85147535154', doi='10.5821/conference-9788412322262.1178', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title=\"ENGINEERING STUDENTS' MOTIVATION FOR LEARNING IN CHALLENGE-DRIVEN PROJECT COURSES: A QUALITATIVE PILOT STUDY\", subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Pantzos P.', afid='60268372;60002014', affilname='Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (TUS);The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)', affiliation_city='Limerick;Stockholm', affiliation_country='Ireland;Sweden', author_count='4', author_names='Pantzos, P.;Rosén, A.;Buckley, J.;Gumaelius, L.', author_ids='57215971986;8225560700;57188743594;6603449251', author_afids='60002014;60002014;60268372;60002014', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21101133562', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='2115-2121', description=\"This pilot study explores engineering students' motivation for learning and studying through the lens of Self-Determination Theory (SDT).

A combination of inductive and deductive approaches to analysing the data were used, and preliminary motivational factors emerged from the interviews are illustrated according to the SDT concepts. A variety of motivations for learning and studying, such as innovation, real-world problem solving, contribution to the society, and trial for following master thesis projects, emerged from the data and positioned on the self-determination continuum in which different types of regulations are guiding students' behaviours simultaneously. Furthermore, autonomy in the choice of a project, feedback and assignment deadlines, and relationships within group work, enhanced or/and undermined the three psychological needs defined by SDT; autonomy, competence and relatedness. Preliminary findings are discussed in relation to the SDT literature, and practical applications are suggested for supporting the motivational needs of engineering students.

With this newly developed tool specific competency profiles can be generated and analysed. Second, I operationalized and implemented the competence components in a questionnaire. On this basis, 200 CEOs and heads of research and development (R&D) departments of medium-sized and large enterprises in Germany were surveyed in November and December 2021 using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI). All enterprises have at least 50 employees and an in-house R&D department.

Transversal competencies, transferable across disciplines, chisel engineering students to become versatile and practical on the shop floor. Sustainability in engineering education is usually discussed only from the ecological/environmental viewpoints. This paper tries to find out the relevance of transversal competencies from the perspectives of engineering students at three levels: the most recurring competencies, the competencies they lack, and the ones that need improvement. Recurring and essential transversal competencies such as problem-solving, creativity and innovation, communication, lifelong learning etc., were identified from different policy frameworks of accreditation agencies, industry reports, organizational reports, and academia. Primary data was collected from final-year engineering students for this exploratory research through semi-structured interviews. These transversal competencies, latent throughout the formative years, have a definite role in the engineer's industry readiness, making engineering education sustainable. The need for industry readiness of the engineering students indicates the sustainability of engineering education, which can bridge the gap between the industry and academia.

In this paper, we introduce the Berlin Ethics Certificate (BEC) at the Technical University of Berlin, to demonstrate how this challenge can be addressed by using interdisciplinarity as a core building block of integrated ethics education. The BECӳ unique approach to ethics education enables the positioning of ethical issues in all study programs within the university by designing future-oriented interdisciplinary courses open to all students, be they from the humanities, natural or engineering sciences. The paper outlines the BECӳ conceptualization of interdisciplinarity, ultimately arguing that interdisciplinary ethics education must be built upon the epistemic practice of situating knowledge. Methodologically, we show how the BEC approaches integrated ethics education through three iterative steps: 1) situating disciplinary knowledge in relation to other forms of knowledge, values and experiences (by focusing on multidisciplinary learning experiences), 2) establishing a common epistemic practice of collaboration (by focusing on interdisciplinary learning experiences), and 3) actively engaging with non-academic stakeholders to create responsible technology and take ethical action beyond the university (by focusing on transdisciplinary learning experiences).

Hence, this chapter discusses the practical possibilities for interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering/technical sciences on the one hand, and social sciences/humanities on the other through a concrete case study of the techno-anthropological master program at Aalborg University in Denmark. The research question addressed here is whether Techno-Anthropology is an example of a successful combination of two different epistemic cultures? To answer this, the chapter introduces the concept of boundary objects. It portrays the techno-anthropological landscape, identifies two visions for the master program and links the concept of boundary objects to the curriculum of Techno-Anthropology. The chapter concludes that the curriculum of the master program in Techno-Anthropology is a boundary object so fluid that it enables interdisciplinary collaboration between two different research groups with different visions for Techno-Anthropology. The two visions are headlined as ‘to engage technical experts and users in conversation and to translate technology-user perspectives into technical design’ and ‘to discover the complexity of technologies through online and offline ethnographic work, and to feed that understanding into technological innovation’.', authkeywords='Boundary objects | Higher education | Interdisciplinarity | Techno-anthropology', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85147433249', doi='10.1007/978-3-031-11601-8_6', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on Engineers’ Work at a Turning Point?', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Colmellere C.', afid='60004981', affilname='École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay', affiliation_city='Gif-sur-Yvette', affiliation_country='France', author_count='1', author_names='Colmellere, Cynthia', author_ids='57200284093', author_afids='60004981', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Philosophy of Engineering and Technology', issn='18797202', source_id='21101039103', eIssn='18797210', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='42', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='111-131', description='According to their disciplinary perspective and their main object, engineering studies deal with engineering as a profession, describe the training, socialization, engineers’ activities, and question the specific ethical dimensions.

In this context, there is the Lean Startup (LS) methodology, which comprises a set of potential practices to facilitate the operationalization of these stages of development. However, the existing literature is incipient and lacks guidance on the LS practices with the greatest potential to contribute to each of these stages, which constitutes a theoretical gap. Thus, this research aims to identify the LS practices most used by researchers-entrepreneurs in the different stages of the Technological Business Planning Process. The methodological approach used was the case study in an important Brazilian public university. In this context, nine innovation projects in the process of generating technological business were analyzed. The results show four main contributions: i) the practices contributed mainly to the intermediate phase of the TBPP; ii) BMC and MVP were considered the most important practices to operationalize TBPP; iii) the LS practices contributed significantly to the knowledge management between team projects; and iv) the combined implementation of the practices highlighted the benefits for TBPP.

The CDIO standards have strongly influenced on the development of the curriculum framework together with the IPMA (International Project Management Association) project management competences. IPMA's Individual Competence Baseline® is utilized in the curriculum development. The students of TUAS have a possibility to take a certification test. Achieving the certification is an international recognition of project management competence described in the Individual Competence Baseline®. For the institution students achieving the certificate is evidence that the learning outcomes are valid, and the students obtain high enough proficiency level. The presented framework has given a backbone for overall curriculum development to our faculty.

The course structure consists of three parts that aims to improve students' three abilities: learning ability, academic research ability, and innovation ability. For learning ability, multiple usages of searching engines are added to help develop their search quotient. For academic research ability, how to search in many databases and how to manage the literatures are important issues. For innovation ability, how to evaluate innovations and how to manage one's inspirations are included. These three abilities are trained by project assignment that is required in a limited time.

Those machines and technologies that have been used for cleaning and subsequent sorting of coniferous seeds with their subsequent sowing in the nursery do not fully provide the forestry complex with good-quality planting material. The reason for this is the use of seeds of unsorted fractions in nurseries, the failure to observe conditions during sowing that ensure the amicable emergence of seedlings and conditions in the sowing rows for the normal development of plants, excluding their large mortality and obtaining non-standard seedlings. It should be noted that modern requirements for silvicultural production largely depend on the quality of planting material. Seedlings obtained by growing them without overshooting give a high silvicultural effect if they meet the intended purpose of the cultivated area, have biometric parameters determined by GOST, which make it possible to grow high-quality planting material without overshooting in two growing seasons. The use of innovations in the restoration of forest landscapes is necessary for the cooperation of engineers and researchers. The integration of scientific and technical research and engineering design contributes to the speedy achievement of stringent environmental requirements for vehicle engines and tools. Obtaining high-quality seed is possible while maintaining the sowing qualities of seeds, reducing the degree of injury and treatment cycles, reducing losses during processing and sowing in the nursery.

According to Tmall, the repurchase rate is only 6.1%, while research shows that a 5% increase in the repurchase rate can lead to a 25% to 95% increase in profit. To increase the repurchase rate, merchants need to predict potential repeat buyers and convert them into repurchasers. Therefore, it is necessary to predict repeat buyers. In this paper we build a prediction model of repeat purchasers using Tmall’s dataset. First, we build high-quality feature engineering for e-commerce scenarios by manual construction and algorithmic selection. We introduce the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm to solve the data imbalance problem and improve prediction performance. Then we train classical classifiers including factorization machine and logistic regression, and ensemble learning classifiers including extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine machines. Finally, we construct a two-layer fusion model based on the Stacking algorithm to further enhance prediction performance. The results show that through a series of innovations such as data imbalance processing, feature engineering, and fusion models, the model area under curve (AUC) value is improved by 0.01161.

Steeping high energy demands and lack of universal presence of resources gravitates the need to generate alternate fuel sources to sustain human life in the near future. Splitting water over heterogeneous nanocatalysts to generate hydrogen offers an economic, green, and fairly easy replacement for clean fuel production. As conventional and one of the most sought photoelectrodes, semiconductor nanomaterials forms an integral part of PEC evolution and the prelude of this chapter. This section details semiconductor-based photoelectrode research progress over the last decade, the role of befitting optical and electronic tunability, bandgap engineering, morphology control, and high surface of these nanomaterials which make them an ideal photoelectrode material. Efficiency of light to fuel conversion predominately depends on photon absorption and the magnitude of interfacial charge transfer (ICT). While highlighting the strategies for increasing photon absorption the course of this chapter follows to focus on the role of morphology of the nanomaterial as it dictates surface area, charge separation, transportation, and mobility. In continuation, advances towards functionalizing photomaterials for making them responsive to visible light, with emphasis on harvesting solar light are cited.

However, the current traffic sign detection has inadequate difficulty resisting anti-attack ability and even does not have basic defense capability. To solve this critical issue, an adversarial patch attack defense model IYOLO-TS is proposed in this paper. The main innovation is to simulate the conditions of traffic signs being partially damaged, obscured or maliciously modified in real world by training the attack patches, and then add the attacked classes in the last layer of the YOLOv2 which are corresponding to the original detection categories, and finally the attack patch obtained from the training is used to complete the adversarial training of the detection model. The attack patch is obtained by first using RP2 algorithm to attack the detection model and then training on the blank patch. In order to verify the defense effective of the proposed IYOLO-TS model, we constructed a patch dataset LISA-Mask containing 50 different mask generation patches of 33000 sheets, and then training dataset by combining LISA and LISA-Mask datasets. The experiment results show that the mAP of the proposed IYOLO-TS is up to 98.12%. Compared with YOLOv2, it improved the defense ability against patch attacks and has the real-time detection ability.

This article presents a methodological framework for DT-based applications development. DT-based applications support effective data-centric processes in the management of critical assets. The proposed approach is based on a flexible and federated data model, enabling dynamic data management. The federated data model provides an interface and connection among different knowledge domains. The service requirement definition provides the input specification for the application development, accomplished through the modelling of three fundamental components: data, processes, and algorithms. These components are assembled through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), supporting the DT-based services. The proposed approach is applied to the West Cambridge DT research facility and tested in the building energy sub-metering strategy. The developed approach allows flexible and interoperable data-centric applications development, contributing to the generalisation and scalability of DT-based built asset management applications.

As a rule, in specific unique conditions for the implementation of programs and projects, it is difficult for organization methodologists to choose a methodology \"suitable\" for the goals and scope of the functional coverage of projects from the methodologies presented on the global \"market\". If applying systematically approaches the problem of creating a methodology, then it is obvious that a \"boxed\" product in such a situation cannot be ideally suited, since this product was developed for certain application conditions that do not coincide with the specifics of the organization. This problem sets the task for project management methodologists to either adapt the \"box\" methodology or develop their own, for the specifics of the projects of this organization, under the conditions in which it operates. Considering management methodology as the language of effective stakeholder interaction, the importance of using classical methodologies is a priority. A sound project management methodology will guide the project manager through a controlled, manageable and visible set of activities to achieve project results. However, the development of a new qualitative methodology is a very costly undertaking that requires highly qualified methodological resources, versatile professional experience, time, etc. In professional cases, when solving this problem, managers-methodologists follow the path of adapting existing methodologies.

An effort is also made to identify the approaches taken to strengthen resilience in practice, as well as research approaches. Relevant literature is reviewed, and schools of thoughts regarding adaptability are also indicated. The review of the definitions of resilience shows how many emphasise the existence of external threats which it is first and foremost important for socio-ecological systems to withstand, before being in a position to mitigate effects, adapt to new circumstances, and also undergo transformation. Only less often is attention paid to internal factors that may lead to disturbances, but also favour or force reorganisation of a system. Newer definitions also highlight component elements of systems, such as individuals, households and communities; while highlighting issues of social inclusion. Notions of regional resilience most often relate to the economy, while definitions of urban resilience more often invoke urban functions and systems (including infrastructure aimed at preventing negative natural phenomena), as well as covering social issues. The literature in essence offers three distinguishable interpretations in resilience studies. These are important insofar as the acceptance of the appropriate one determines further research procedure, and even conclusions as to what is or is not a resilient system. It is engineering resilience, ecological resilience and evolutionary resilience that can be identified. Initially, it was the engineering-related interpretation that dominated in resilience research, even as today use is often made of a systemic approach referring to the interpretation of evolutionary (adaptive ) resilience . O n th e othe r hand , transformation al abilit ies are more and more often indicated as features of key importance to the building of resilient socio-ecological systems. Review of the literature on resilience shows that, among the approaches of practical value to its strengthening it is possible to distinguish such approaches as those involving disaster risk reduction, climate-change adaptation, social-ecological aspects, complex adaptive systems, livelihood, and agencies and institutions. Among the research approaches taken to the concept of resilience, it is possible to distinguish the equilibrium-related, systems perspectives, path dependence and the long view. And where schools of thought are concerned, there is a human capital agglomeration view; and industrial structure, economic variety and innovation approach considered along with the application of digital technologies in smart cities; and a third school putting the emphasis on institutions.', authkeywords='definitions | interpretations | re-gion | research approaches | research review | resilience | schools of thought | town and city', citedby_count=0, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85143979307', doi='10.1093/hr/uhac220', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Advances and prospects of orchid research and industrialization', subtype='re', subtypeDescription='Review', creator='Zhang D.', afid='60006782;60004630', affilname='Beijing Forestry University;Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University', affiliation_city='Beijing;Fuzhou', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='7', author_names='Zhang, Diyang;Zhao, Xue Wei;Li, Yuan Yuan;Ke, Shi Jie;Yin, Wei Lun;Lan, Siren;Liu, Zhong Jian', author_ids='57209746222;57967061900;57966753500;57967404000;57204782622;56158381600;56101469900', author_afids='60004630;60004630;60004630;60004630;60006782;60004630;60004630', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Horticulture Research', issn='26626810', source_id='21100773746', eIssn='20527276', aggregationType='Journal', volume='9', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='uhac220', pageRange=None, description='Orchidaceae is one of the largest, most diverse families in angiosperms with significant ecological and economical values. Orchids have long fascinated scientists by their complex life histories, exquisite floral morphology and pollination syndromes that exhibit exclusive specializations, more than any other plants on Earth.

The advent of sequencing technologies and transgenic techniques represents a quantum leap in orchid research, enabling molecular approaches to be employed to resolve the historically interesting puzzles in orchid basic and applied biology. To date, 16 different orchid genomes covering four subfamilies (Apostasioideae, Vanilloideae, Epidendroideae, and Orchidoideae) have been released. These genome projects have given rise to massive data that greatly empowers the studies pertaining to key innovations and evolutionary mechanisms for the breadth of orchid species. The extensive exploration of transcriptomics, comparative genomics, and recent advances in gene engineering have linked important traits of orchids with a multiplicity of gene families and their regulating networks, providing great potential for genetic enhancement and improvement.

In January 2021 MIT entered into an agreement with the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to design and offer a new educational research program focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) training. The goal of this collaboration is to design and advance educational research activities that promote maximum learning outcomes at scale for learners with diverse roles and educational backgrounds, ranging from Air Force and DoD personnel to the general public. This program is expected to offer different learning tracks addressing different groups of USAF employees based on their unique professional needs and backgrounds. The first pilot is currently underway and will provide the research team with data and insights that will inform the next iteration of the program, with the ultimate goal of formulating recommendations for the USAF and general public on how to reach large numbers of learners at scale in an optimum way. Currently, the program offers three different learning journeys for each of three different cohorts of USAF employees (i.e., leaders, developers, and users). These learning journeys span from online asynchronous and synchronous courses to in-person activities. Our research goals focus on exploring and understanding the learner experience via the study and analysis of AI content and curriculum, pedagogical approaches, learning modalities, and technological innovations to deliver learning experiences at scale. Key research activities involve evaluating a range of existing digital AI courses, mapping out the landscape of educational needs and competencies, and developing and piloting experiential learning experiences (to advance innovative technology-enabled training and learning technologies and methods). This paper discusses how preliminary research findings from this first pilot are informing the design and implementation of the next program iteration.

However, lots of factors, such as project resources, sites, funds, cooperatives, and so on, limit the project-based learning of engineering majors (Architecture, Urban and Rural Planning, Landscape Architecture). Therefore, the establishment and improvement of the corresponding course system are essential. The \"Design Workshop\"course, offered by the School of Architecture at Tianjin University (TJU) takes specific projects as the carrier to integrate diverse knowledge, improve students\\' overall abilities, and offer a solution to the concerns mentioned above. The purpose of the article is to provide a framework for the \"Design Workshop\"courses, based on OBE. The course addresses the design and practice learning teaching method. The skills needed for graduation are determined based on industry demands. The task list and course teaching methods are adapted to the skills needed for graduation. The \"Design Workshop\"course is offered in the third year because the main prerequisite courses have already been completed, and the core competency refers to the most intensive knowledge and tasks, besides the students will have the flexibility to be engaged in the industry. The teaching experience emphasizes the importance of a multi-level course support mechanism and the systematic nature of each support component. It was found, that the educational system focuses on competency rather than the outcome, according to the abilities it can be. Students freely meet the actual project requirements and the specific design tasks as the standards, based on the design process and the final design outputs to derive the knowledge to be learned. The ability requirements and specific tasks determine the course system, giving rise to normative thinking. Taking everything into account, students can improve their abilities through \"construction and building\", \"full life cycle support and management\", \"stakeholder coordination\", and \"activities and public occasions\\' preparation\". Consequently, students will be more likely to adapt to the changing industry demands.

While there is a high scope for utilizing game-based tools to help students connect with global sustainability challenges, literature reflects a scarcity of such innovative pedagogical tools in engineering education. To tackle this challenge, we introduced interactive game-based modules to teach sustainability within two different education cultural contexts - one in the U.S. as a part of a Honours course at a large public university, and one in India, as a part of the first year engineering curriculum at a small private university.To broaden the outlook of engineering students towards sustainability, our game-based activity learning outcomes for students were to: 1) contextualize sustainability and its importance in contemporary global issues 2) recognize how Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could be interrelated, 3) explain how change in entropy and our actions can affect sustainability. To facilitate these broad learning outcomes, we developed two interactive gamified activities and implemented them online (due to COVID-based shift to instruction) in two different engineering institutions. This innovation article reports the design of two gamified activities used to teach sustainability, and studies its impact on student learning outcomes through SDT framework of motivation and thematic analysis of student reflections.

Through a questionnaire provided to all firms approaching the ecosystem we identify recruitment as one of their lowest ranked interests. By interviewing members of the public organisations found in the ecosystem we identify how cooperation is initiated and maintained, and how this influences the opportunities for students to transfer into industry. The results provide nuance to the current emphasis in skill development within third-cycle (engineering) education. It is rarely recognized that fostering technical skill and academic entrepreneurship might not be enough to allow all types and sizes of firms to receive engineering students.Particularly, this study identifies the academic and industrial boundary spanning roles at knowledge-intensive SMEs as important. These roles require a third-cycle education that early on hones skills that typically do not become critical until much later for students that pursue an academic path - e.g., the inter-organisational project management skills necessary to effectively seek research funding or to negotiate goal alignment between organisations.

Engineers are a part of a broad community that contributes to the rapidly changing and growing technological innovations demanding contributions from multiple branches of engineering and academic disciplines. Therefore, the ability to recognize and understand interdisciplinary connections between engineering and all academic disciplines is critical for students' academic success and professional preparedness. There is a need to develop novel classroom activities that enable students to recognize such connections. To that end, the objective of this research was to (a) develop a hands-on, student-led, classroom activity that can help students make interdisciplinary connections and (b) assess the impact of the activity on students' perception about the interdisciplinary connections. A two-session classroom activity was designed in which students worked in teams and mapped different areas of study within mechanical engineering (ME) as well as seven non-engineering academic disciplines (NEAD) to real world, complex technological innovations such as virtual reality goggles, drones, and 3D printers. During the activity, active learning tools such as concept maps and jigsaw method were utilized. A total of 49 sophomore, ME students from a four-year university participated in the activity and associated assessments. All students participated in two surveys administered at the beginning and end of the activity to rate their motivation and excitement towards ME areas of study and seven NEAD, and their believed level of importance and relevance of the ME areas of study and NEAD to product development. The quantitative data analysis showed statistically significant increases in multiple survey items, showing an overall success of the activity in increasing students' awareness of connections within and outside of engineering. The lack of changes in some survey items guide us towards areas and topics that need improvement to teach the relevance and integration of all disciplines to students. In future, these quantitative findings will be coupled with qualitative data from students' retrospective reflection on the activity, student focus group, faculty interviews, student learning assessments and students' concept maps to optimize the activity, assess student learning and finalize assessment instruments so the activity can be widely adopted by educators.\", authkeywords='Active learning | Curricular-design | Engineering design | Integration | Interdisciplinary', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85143772849', doi='10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962724', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Reflective practitioners through design: Perspectives of second-year engineering undergraduate students', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Khan R.', afid='60016849', affilname='University of Toronto', affiliation_city='Toronto', affiliation_country='Canada', author_count='4', author_names='Khan, Rubaina;Asare, Philip;Romkey, Lisa;Slotta Ontario, James D.', author_ids='57192588784;35774067300;24725834600;58001008800', author_afids='60016849;60016849;60016849;60016849', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE', issn='15394565', source_id='16719', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2022-October', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"Full Research Paper - Engineering students experience a wide range of learning practices through technical and analytical thinking and a process of reflection is needed to support them with their meaning-making process.

In recent years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, professors have been facing several challenges to keep students engaged, motivated and learning. The active teaching methodologies that have been collaborating in recent years in the teaching and learning process of students, needed to adapt to the remote teaching class scenario that was implemented in several universities. This research measured the point of view of four professors, who are also researchers in computing education, about how their classes behaved in the last two years of the Software Testing subject in a graduate program at a Brazilian federal university. So that computing students have a way to obtain knowledge in a more practical way so that there is a decrease in the difficulty of students adapting to the job market. Professors are increasingly adopting active methodologies, group work and practical teaching approaches in order for students to acquire skills that will be decisive for their professional future. In view of the existing pandemic scenario and the need to adapt teaching plans for remote teaching, this paper sought to identify the perceptions that professors had, whether in the difficulties of adapting activities, adapting teaching plans to difficulties in keeping students attentive and motivated in the content that was being passed on. The objective of this work is to identify and discuss professors' perceptions about the use of active teaching methodologies using remote teaching in a software testing subject of a graduate class at a Brazilian federal university. It was also analyzed how the professors dealt with the issue of student motivation and engagement at that time. An analysis of the teaching plan of the software testing subject of the last two years of the graduate program in computing at a Brazilian federal university was carried out and each of the methodologies with the perception of the professors who participated in these subjects. The collection of these data was carried out by means of an interview with the four professors, the feedback from the students of the classes on each of the adopted methodologies was also analyzed and a triangulation of the data obtained was performed. The results indicate that there were great difficulties in adapting active methodologies from the point of view of the professors, however most of these challenges were overcome in the their views. It was also pointed out that certain methodologies and practices work better if the learning is done in an evolutionary way and that takes into account the students' previous knowledge about contents, tools and practices that the professors want to use. Thus, this paper aims to present an overview of professors' perspectives on the teaching of a computing subject that needs practical approaches using active methodologies in an emergency situation of remote teaching.\", authkeywords='activities methodologies | educational innovation | remote teaching | software testing', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85143762500', doi='10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962444', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Developing Skills for Industry 4.0: Challenges and Opportunities in Engineering Education', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Caratozzolo P.', afid='60153573;60007966', affilname='School of Engineering and Applied Sciences;Tecnológico de Monterrey', affiliation_city='Buffalo;Monterrey', affiliation_country='United States;Mexico', author_count='7', author_names='Caratozzolo, Patricia;Lara-Prieto, Vianney;Martinez-Leon, Cecilia;Rodriguez-Ruiz, Jorge;Ponce, Roberto;Vazquez-Villegas, Patricia;Membrillo-Hernandez, Jorge', author_ids='7801584968;35488233200;56154585600;57168627800;57205704459;36971247200;6701380233', author_afids='60007966;60007966;60153573;60007966;60007966;60007966;60007966', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE', issn='15394565', source_id='16719', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2022-October', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description=\"This Research to Practice Work in Progress Paper focuses on the Education 4.0 Framework, based on built-in skill development mechanisms and innovative learning pedagogies related to Active Learning approaches. Practicing engineers are increasingly expected to act as boundary spanners who manage and participate in diverse interdisciplinary global teams, leverage cultural differences, and draw on expert knowledge from multiple fields and specialities to translate competing stakeholders' needs into practical design solutions. This demand for a holistic type of engineer stems from the requirements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: engineers who assume the role of leaders can integrate knowledge and work seamlessly across intellectual, social, and cultural challenges. Our exploratory study aims to identify the implications for practice, challenges, and opportunities in Higher Education. More specifically, we look at two engineering programs of two universities, one located in Mexico and the other in the United States of America. Both universities have implemented massive Experiential and Challenge-Based Learning efforts with industry and external organizations as educational partners to immerse students in real-life contexts. The methodology used was qualitative-experimental, involved more than 120 students, and included a post-test for skills assessment with different instruments such as rubrics, questionnaires, interviews, and surveys. The preliminary findings of this work-in-progress study reveal that the role of Higher Education professors in the training of future engineering professionals within the Education 4.0 Framework has different degrees of complexity related to the cross-border nature of educational innovation, that requires the commitment and alignment of multiple actors: students, professors, organizations, and industry.\", authkeywords='education 4.0 skills | educational innovation | higher Education | industry 4.0 | STEM education', citedby_count=10, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='PHHT085-21ZZNV016', fund_sponsor='Novus International'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85143750969', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Towards a multi-faceted framework for planning and evaluating innovation in Engineering Education', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Engelbrecht E.', afid='60006288', affilname='Delft University of Technology', affiliation_city='Delft', affiliation_country='Netherlands', author_count='3', author_names='Engelbrecht, Erna;Rooij, Remon M.;Specht, Marcus M.', author_ids='58001276900;55576345200;7005896068', author_afids='60006288;60006288;60006288', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='CEUR Workshop Proceedings', issn='16130073', source_id='21100218356', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='3292', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='30-38', description='For universities, educational change at institutional level is a slow process [1], [2].

We also analyse the women’s insertion in professional fields that have great growth potential. Among the main occupations, we identify a dual trend with high automation chance for jobs that require low or no qualifications and are low paid, and low displacement probability for caring-related professions. Furthermore, even though in Brazil women have higher education levels than men, they are under-represented in STEM (Sciences, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) areas. We point out that the main challenges for Brazil include the lack of investment in innovation and that gender-aware policies should be designed to overcome structural barriers and guarantee an equal insertion of women and men. Paid parental leave, equal pay for equal work, and public health and education services are essential to overcome inequalities based on traditional gender roles.

For the purpose of this paper a small fragment of students' survey out of the ongoing research project was used. 558 students from various Kazakh universities were surveyed. One of the questions concerned IT development and digitalization level of the universities, because it enhances students' inclination for innovation and entrepreneurship. According to survey results forty three percent of students think that their universities have been sufficiently digitalized. Other forty percent remained neutral, and seventeen percent complained about the ICT equipment, which means that universities should address this issue to remain competitive. The research contributes to previous studies by focusing on students' attitudes toward ICT implementation. It describes both advantages and disadvantages of the ICT in education, and tries to summarize the current conditions of Kazakhstani higher education. For the successful policy implementation, the suggestions should come from the bottom. Therefore, the students' hands-on knowledge and experience with ICT implementation should be taken into consideration and could be helpful for further integration into educational process.\", authkeywords='entrepreneurial universities | higher education | information communication technologies | teaching and learning', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='AP08052656', fund_sponsor='Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85143336599', doi='10.1016/j.procs.2022.09.268', pii='S1877050922011541', pubmed_id=None, title='Innovations of Enterprises with Chinese Capital in Poland.

At the same time, statistics indicate that enterprises with foreign capital that operate in Poland are characterized by a greater propensity to pursue innovative activities. Amongst the many economies of the world, which have achieved tremendous progress in the recent years, both in terms of economic development and an increase in the level of innovation, China is commonly indicated as allocating more and more funds to R&D, while raising the quality and innovation of its production. Account taken of the above, the research problem undertaken by the authors consists in seeking an answer to the question whether the high level of innovative activity recorded in the Chinese economy translates in any way to the innovation of Chinese capital invested in Poland. In view of this, the aim of the research comprises taking an attempt to answer the following research questions: do enterprises that operate in Poland on the basis of Chinese capital conduct innovative activities and how is it directed?

The results prove that the examined Chinese capital invested in Poland undertakes innovative activity and treats it as a strategic element of development, as evidenced not only by the implementation of specific types of innovations, but also by the pursue of R&D activities in Poland. For the sake of completeness of the situation regarding the activity of Chinese capital in the field of innovative activities carried out in Poland, it is required to expand and deepen the scope of research by extending the subjective scope of companies from other sectors of the economy, identifying determinants that shape innovation of this type of investment, or analysis of Chinese business models capital invested in Poland.\", authkeywords='Chinese investments in Poland | enterprise | innovation', citedby_count=2, openaccess=1, freetoread='all', freetoreadLabel='All Open Access', fund_acr='MNiSW', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85143250548', doi='10.1109/E-TEMS53558.2022.9944441', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Scenario-based Requirements Engineering for Complex Smart City Projects', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Wiecher C.', afid='60020120', affilname='Fachhochschule Dortmund', affiliation_city='Dortmund', affiliation_country='Germany', author_count='3', author_names='Wiecher, Carsten;Tendyra, Philipp;Wolff, Carsten', author_ids='57212110875;57219802930;54421696300', author_afids='60020120;60020120;60020120', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='2022 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit, E-TEMS 2022 - Conference Proceedings', issn=None, source_id='21101124139', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='97-102', description=\"Various stakeholders with different backgrounds are involved in Smart City projects.

The rise of Industry 4.0 is associated with primary research endeavours that consider genuine computerized systems, the internet of things, massive data, and human-made mental aptitude. We created a brilliant intelligent welding station framework using Industry 4.0 framework execution and dynamic advances, ongoing observation, and framework control. The stage directs the execution of a solid welding framework requiring minimal work and employing the most recent industry innovations. The results presented above are useful in learning to use RAMI 4.0, also known as the Reference Architecture Model Industry. In addition, smart welding was introduced. New techniques and inventive innovations are highlighted. The reference model is also used to connect the framework to critical engineering. It is a planned stage for an intelligent welding station framework based on five layers and three stages of reference model creation. These features enable the producer to monitor activity and control frameworks to improve execution by implementing successful, effective, and adaptable creation strategies. As a result, Industry 4.0 continues to compel the manufacturing sector to employ innovative manufacturing frameworks to address organizational issues. Finally, we can improve an intelligent welding framework’s efficiency and use it for assembling tasks where we have critical assembling resources.

Trends such as advancing digitalization and connectivity of products open up numerous innovation potentials for UX developers. This contribution focuses on in-vehicle UX in terms of designing interactions between the vehicle and the user. In academia, theories and models to explain the phenomenon of user experience are widespread. Furthermore, numerous research approaches in the field of engineering sciences pursue the goal of making user experience measurable and evaluable. However, in the course of our literature review, we found that there is currently a lack of tools and methods that support product developers in eliciting user needs and subsequently synthesizing concepts. For this purpose, particularly the early phase of product development offers required creative freedom. However, this phase is also characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. These circumstances raise the question of which challenges product developers face when designing interactions. This paper aims to contribute to this question through a two-step descriptive analysis in cooperation with a leading German automotive group. Based on a literature review, challenges and strategic potentials were first discussed with UX experts in a workshop (n=11). From these results, a total of 28 hypotheses were derived, which were then evaluated in a second step in an online survey (n=45) by a broad set of experts. Subsequently, the challenges identified in this way were translated into four qualitative success factors to provide product developers with concrete recommendations for action.

Observing multiple physiological reactions to the same stimuli will help researchers gain a better understanding of how the human body responds. However, there is limited availability of multimodal physiological sensor setups. This article presents an approach utilizing the open-source distribution Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) which records, synchronizes, and exports high-quality data from multiple sensory measures. The challenge is to adapt proprietary hardware to utilize LSL, as most sensors are pre-programmed to interact with their own software. The aim is to reduce the cost associated with subscriptions to proprietary software, by switching to the open-source alternative which promotes higher quality, greater reliability, greater flexibility, and lower cost. The article presents a case where the proprietary sensors, electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) provided by Shimmer, adapt to the LSL network. Given the multidisciplinary aspect of the case both Wayfaring, Extreme Programming (XP), and Scrum were used as development methodologies. A description is provided of the software architecture for collecting data from the two Shimmer sensors and how the signals are transmitted to the LSL network. In addition, the article encourages the use of open-source resources and discusses the benefits that open research brings. Open research offers similar potential as open-source development in terms of rapidity and innovation. The advantage of allowing researchers to benefit from other researchers’ findings and results leads to advances that would not have been possible in a closed, or proprietary, environment. In light of the insights acquired in the development process, questions regarding companies’ attitudes toward open research are addressed.

Innovation success with complex technical systems can only be achieved economically and with manageable risk by using existing solutions as references. These references come from predecessors, competitors, and even industry-external products or concepts from research. The model of PGE – Product Generation Engineering describes these relationships. In design research, multiple approaches such as TRIZ, technical inheritance, and evolution trees use analogies between biological evolution and product development to make knowledge from past product generations usable. The aim of this contribution is to analyze the potential of an evolutionary perspective on PGE to support product developers to develop products with high innovation potential. We first analyzed the analogies between biological evolution and innovation in the context of PGE. We then collected and clustered existing evolutionary approaches. In the next step, we evaluated the extent to which the analogies between biological evolution and PGE are already being used in the approaches from the state of the art. The existing approaches do not offer a complete evolutionary view so far. References are in some form core of the majority of the approaches but the linkage with variation operations and the influence of contextual factors are not consistently considered or explained. Existing approaches support developers in solving specific technical problems. What they do not offer is a fundamental theoretical understanding of the innovation success of products along the lines of the theory of evolution in biology and the latest results in the field of PGE. Further empirical research based on an evolutionary perspective on the model of PGE could explain relationships between innovation pressure from changing context factors and variation activities.

In the SAR context design, engineering and technology transfer happen in real-time. Designing for complex systems calls for the right know-how and creativity, coupled with extensive knowledge, practice and field testing. Industry partners contribute further expertise, funding and equipment. This paper presents an innovative model for design and engineering education with lessons learned from an innovative Technology Transfer Design Sprint that took place simultaneously in-the-field, in studio and online. Bringing user-centred design to this context with “risk-familiar users” resulted in a vibrant opportunity for hybrid (soft/hard) design education. Introducing students to these users, who are trained to deal with unknowns and high-risk situations, can engage and prepare them to design inclusive, relevant and resilient solutions. Rapid and risk-receptive design processes are needed for adapting to the demand of SAR users, or better said: its “rescuesers”.\", authkeywords='design innovation | Extreme environments | personal protective equipment (PPE) | risk | search & rescue | technical apparel | technology transfer', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85142846616', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='USE OF DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS, DESIGN THINKING, AND DATA SCIENCE IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Saavedra V.', afid='60007966', affilname='Tecnológico de Monterrey', affiliation_city='Monterrey', affiliation_country='Mexico', author_count='7', author_names='Saavedra, Verónica;Gonzalez-Almaguer, Carlos;Barron, Arturo;Zubieta, Claudia;Caballero, Eduardo;Perez, Hugo;Muciño, Lourdes', author_ids='57384982700;55977821600;57984164900;57984706400;57209348318;57952888300;57985065300', author_afids='60007966;60007966;60007966;60007966;60007966;60007966;60007966', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Disrupt, Innovate, Regenerate and Transform, E and PDE 2022', issn=None, source_id='21101122911', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number='EPDE2022/1278', pageRange=None, description='Precision agriculture was born with the massive introduction of GPS at the beginning of this century and consists of the use of technology to obtain data, its statistical treatment, and decision-making.

A smart city is a real product of the high integration of digital technology and urban governance, which has a close theoretical correlation with PSL, but there is no academic research to quantitatively verify the relationship between the two. To bridge this research gap, this study empirically analyzes the relationship between smart city construction and PSL by constructing panel data of 212 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2018 using the difference-in-difference (DID) model. The baseline regression finds that smart city construction significantly improves PSL during the sample period. Among them, smart city construction improved the quality of education and medical services (EAM) by approximately 5.18% and the level of social life security (SLS) by approximately 4.04%. This result holds after performing the robustness test. The mechanism analysis revealed that smart city construction has a significant positive impact on PSL through informational, technological, and economic effects. The above study examines the policy effects of smart city construction and provides a course of action to optimize PSL.

Feedback was again very positive and a further workshop for academics from different disciplines was organised to develop subject-specific material and assess whether the method was transferable across disciplines. The experience proved highly beneficial to all parties who learnt from each other; the bespoke materials developed during the session were subsequently tested with students who again responded very positively, which soundly endorsed transferability. These various results show that design education remains innovative and is leading and supporting development of pioneering educational practices.

This is because teams with high levels of psychological safety feel safe to express ideas and opinions. While we are becoming more aware of the importance of psychological safety in teaming, there is limited evidence in how to facilitate or build it within teams, particularly in an educational context. This paper was developed to respond to this research void by identifying the impact of teaming interventions aimed at improving psychological safety in engineering design student teams. Specifically, we studied two cohorts of students in a cornerstone design class (N = 414 students), one who received a series of video interventions and introduced role playing (intervention) and one who did not (control). These role assignments - referred to as the Lenses of Psychologically Safety - were created to promote key leadership attributes that have been shown to be crucial in facilitating psychologically safe teams. To compare the utility of the intervention, Psychological Safety was gathered at 5 key time points of a multi-week design project. The results identified three key findings. First, the interventions were successful in increasing psychological safety in engineering teams. In addition, the results indicated the utility of the Lenses of Psychological Safety throughout the design process. Finally, the results identified that groups who used these lenses had higher perceptions of Psychological Safety in their teams. Overall, these results indicated that psychological safety can be improved in engineering education through the intervention methods described within.', authkeywords='design education | design theory | design theory | methodology', citedby_count=4, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='1825830', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85142503258', doi='10.1115/DETC2022-89731', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='DOES SYNCHRONOUS COLLABORATION IMPROVE COLLABORATIVE COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OUTPUT: RESULTS FROM A LARGE-SCALE COMPETITION', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Deng Y.', afid='60116407;60016849', affilname=\"D'Amore-McKim School of Business;University of Toronto\", affiliation_city='Boston;Toronto', affiliation_country='United States;Canada', author_count='3', author_names='Deng, Yuanzhe;Marion, Tucker;Olechowski, Alison', author_ids='57337362900;15072972500;55314243600', author_afids='60016849;60116407;60016849', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference', issn=None, source_id='21100838747', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='6', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='V006T06A026', pageRange=None, description='With the growing demand for distributed collaboration for large and complex design in modern engineering, the collaboration inefficiencies of traditional computer-aided design (CAD) tools are increasingly conspicuous. Emerging cloud-based multi-user computer-aided design (MUCAD) platforms bring a new working style for CAD in the form of real-time synchronous collaboration. Little research exists to characterize collaboration in CAD, and specifically the synchronicity of collaboration has yet to be examined. In this study, we analyzed the backend action logs of 101 teams’ design processes from a large-scale virtual robotic design competition, where all designs were modelled in a commercially available MUCAD platform. Metrics of interest were analyzed with regression and mediation analyses to uncover factors that correlated to a team’s success in the competition. Results show that team size is a positive predictor of team performance. Large teams, which tend to see a large amount of time commitment from members, were more likely to perform more CAD actions and achieve high scores from the competition. This suggests that the benefits of collaboration (e.g., economies of division of labor, learning) outweigh the potential downsides (e.g., coordination overhead, free riding) in this context. While controlling for team size, increased synchronous collaboration occurrences were observed to negatively correlate to teams’ performance – a novel finding which we discuss in detail. Thus, we conclude that although large teams benefited from the MUCAD environment, a tendency for synchronous real-time collaboration did not coincide with higher performance. This study provides important evidence in the ongoing design and innovation research fields aiming to better understand collaboration. Future research should investigate the characteristics of effective collaboration strategies in MUCAD environments to develop best practice for the increasing number of design teams moving to such tools.', authkeywords='computer-aided design | multi-user CAD | synchronous collaboration | user analytics', citedby_count=5, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85142494746', doi='10.1117/12.2660619', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on dynamic monitoring technology for overall lifting of steel corridor', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Li X.', afid='126142433;126141780;125814633', affilname='Ltd.;Ltd.;China Construction Industrial Engineering and Technology Research Academy Co.,Ltd.', affiliation_city='Changsha;Lishui;Beijing', affiliation_country='China;China;China', author_count='10', author_names='Li, Xinglong;Liu, Shengguo;Lin, Jindi;Ma, Wenxue;Wang, Leyu;Dang, Pengju;Cao, Zhen;Zhang, Wei;Qiao, Maowei;Yan, Zhijie', author_ids='57488055700;57488390700;57205541067;57980538000;57488716700;57980538800;57706141100;57381277500;57205542157;57979238900', author_afids='125814633-126141780;126142433;125814633-126141780;125814633-126141780;126142433;126142433;125814633-126141780;125814633-126141780;125814633-126141780;126142433', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering', issn='0277786X', source_id='40067', eIssn='1996756X', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='12457', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='124571U', pageRange=None, description='This paper takes the monitoring of steel corridor upgrading in Weihai Innovation Center as an example.

While the proposed patent embedding could be used to associate a pair of patents, we observe using a recall task that multiple initial patents could be associated with a target patent using mean cosine similarity, which could then be utilised to rank all target patents and retrieve the most relevant ones.

It will also be an important source of international competitiveness and discourse power of the textile industry. Nowadays intelligent highly bionic biodegradable and other new functional fiber materials are concerned by many researchers. As one of the important development directions of modern high-tech new materials the intelligent fiber material has been widely concerned by many researchers. Thermo-responsive textile materials can effectively transfer water with the change of external temperature. Especially on summer days with high temperature human body will sweat a lot. In order to ensure good wearing comfort of human body timely and rapid discharge of sweat mechanism is important. Chitosan is a natural widespread chitin by stripping acetyl role. As a kind of renewable and green material with a wealth of sources excellent performance and good biocompatibility chitosan is widely used in various fields including medicine food chemical cosmetic water treatment metal extraction and recovery biochemical and biomedical engineering etc. But there is still a lack of high value-added applied basic research about chitosan. It is urgently to develop a high value-added application theory and technology system of natural chitosan in the field of smart fiber to realize the wide application of renewable resources with high quality. The development of new materials with high-tech high performance and high added value functions and intelligent micro / nano fiber can provide new ideas for the development of intelligent biological new materials. In order to make the intelligent gel polymers be better applied in textile functional finish field chitosan was first modified by quaternary ammonium salt to obtain water-soluble chitosan. Based on the above in-situ polymerization interpenetrating polymer network technology was combined with the electrostatic spinning technology to prepare the chitosan quaternary ammonium salt / PNIPAAm / PEO nanofibers with temperature-sensitive responsiveness. Glutaraldehyde was used as the cross-linking agent and the nanofibers were in situ grafted to the tussah silk fabric to endow the fabric with excellent temperature-sensitive responsiveness. The molecular structure thermal properties hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and surface morphology of the modified tussah silk fabric were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR TG thermal analysis contact angle and SEM testing technology. The results indicate that chitosan quaternary ammonium salt / PNIPAAm / PEO hydrogels have good thermosensitivity and the phase inversion temperatures range from 32 ℃ to 33 ℃ which is consistent with the results of TG analysis. The chitosan quaternary ammonium salt / PNIPAAm / PEO nanofiber layer is formed on the surface of tussah silk fabric and the nanofibers are homogeneously distributed. The modified thermo-responsive tussah silk fabric has good hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity and when the temperature is higher than 45 ℃ the thermo-sensitive tussah fabric has obvious hydrophobicity. Therefore the combination of interpenetrating polymer network technology and electrostatic spinning technology is an effective method for the preparation of thermo-responsive fabrics. This provides a theoretical basis for the development of the textiles with good humidity and heat comfort. Intelligent temperature regulation outweighs the single heat preservation function of traditional textiles and can make the skin temperature always in a comfortable range when the environment changes dramatically which provides a comfortable microclimate environment for human body. Intelligent moisture permeable textiles are known as \" breathable fabrics\" for having waterproof moisture permeable windproof and thermal insulation properties. The development of intelligent temperature-sensitive textile materials not only broadens the application range of intelligent polymer materials in textile industry but also improves people\\'s living standard. At the same time the effective combination of functional intelligent polymer materials and natural materials also provides a new idea for the research of functional and intelligent new textile materials. And it also provides great application value for intelligent wear energy conservation and environmental protection information technology and biomedical materials in respects of industries wearing medicine and military.', authkeywords='chitosan | chitosan quaternary ammonium salt | electrostatic spinning technology | intelligent material | interpenetrating polymer network technology | temperature-sensitive responsiveness | tussah silk fabric', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85142026010', doi='10.1109/ISC255366.2022.9922559', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='An Experiment Orchestration Platform to Support Smart City Experiential Learning', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Puryear N.', afid='60279580;60137301', affilname='VCU College of Engineering;Batten College of Engineering & Technology', affiliation_city='Richmond;Norfolk', affiliation_country='United States;United States', author_count='6', author_names='Puryear, Nathan;Martin, Patrick J.;Kuzlu, Murat;Gueler, Oezguer;Jovanovic, Vukica;Abdelwahed, Sherif', author_ids='57314388200;56470091400;35409671400;36466376200;24605187000;6603027429', author_afids='60279580;60279580;60137301;;60137301;60279580', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='ISC2 2022 - 8th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference', issn=None, source_id='21101120702', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='This paper presents an experiment orchestration platform, called VirtualLab@OpenCyberCity, that supports the research and education of smart city technologies.

Magnesium alloys have the benefits of high specific strength and stiffness, damping and vibration reduction, electromagnetic shielding, remarkable machining performance, and easy recycling. With the continuous research and innovation of new materials and technologies of magnesium alloys, their application potential will be infinite. Researchers suggested an approach of applying a tunable ring spot in laser processing that has attracted a lot of attention in the field of laser processing. Although domestic and foreign scholars have performed a lot of research investigations on magnesium alloy laser welding and have attained good findings. There is still a big gap between the existing research investigations and practical engineering applications, and it is crucial to develop novel laser welding technology. Methods In this study, AZ31B magnesium alloy butt joints with a thickness of 5 mm are welded by fiber laser with an adjustable ring spot. Based on ensuring the total power of 3 kW, pure center laser, center laser/ring laser, and pure ring laser are employed to weld magnesium alloy joints. The surface shapes, microstructures, and mechanical properties of the joints are discovered and examined. Results and Discussions In terms of weld formation, first, compared with that when using pure center laser welding, the melting width in the upper part of the weld is considerably increased when using ring laser welding, and the combination of center laser and ring laser has a greater impact on the weld cross-sectional shape. Second, when the ring laser power is greater than the center laser power, the formations of the upper and lower surfaces of the welds become unstable (Figs. 3 and 4). In terms of metallographic structure, during pure center laser welding, the columnar crystal region near the fusion line of the weld is very narrow, and the grains in the center of the weld are finer, but due to the fast cooling rate, there are small pores and cracks around the weld [Figs. 5(al)-(a4)]. When the center is welded with a ring laser, the convection heat transfer time is extended in the molten pool's upper part, increasing the grain size in the center of the weld. Even in pure annular laser welding, a wide columnar grain region is formed near the weld fusion line [Figs. 5(cl)-(c3)]. The weld zone hardness is higher than that of the base metal, and as the ring laser power increases, the weld center hardness decreases. When the central laser power is 2000 W and the ring laser power is 1000 W (sample 2#), the tensile strength and elongation of the welded joint are the largest, reaching 215 MPa and 14. 0%, respectively, which are 79.6% and 96.6% of those of the base metal [Fig. 7(a)]. The joint fracture is a brittle-ductile mixed fracture. Conclusions The existence of a ring laser has a considerable influence on the weld formation. Based on the center laser, the ring laser application can substantially increase the fusion width in the upper part of the weld. The combination of center laser and ring laser has a great influence on the cross-sectional shape of the weld, the best weld formation is generated when the center laser power is 2000 W and the ring laser power is 1000 W. The existence of ring laser has a certain effect on the microstructure of the weld. Only in the central laser action area, there is no clear heat-affected zone or columnar grain zone near the weld fusion line, and the equiaxed grains are relatively fine. In the ring laser action area, there are heat-affected and columnar crystal zones near the weld fusion line, and the equiaxed crystal grains are coarse. Further, with the ring laser power increasing, the hardness value of the central area of the weld decreases. The ring laser beam can enhance the elongation of laser welded joints of the magnesium alloys, and the welded joints have better tensile strength produced under the optimized process parameters.\", authkeywords='AZ31B magnesium alloy | fiber laser with adjustable ring spot | laser technique | laser welding | microstructure | weld appearance', citedby_count=4, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85141618833', doi='10.23919/SoftCOM55329.2022.9911514', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Empirically Derived Use Cases for Software Analytics', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Rique T.', afid='60003709', affilname='Universidade Federal de Campina Grande', affiliation_city='Campina Grande', affiliation_country='Brazil', author_count='6', author_names='Rique, Thiago;Dantas, Emanuel;Perkusich, Mirko;Gorgonio, Kyller;Almeida, Hyggo;Perkusich, Angelo', author_ids='57791717200;57204732062;37075430200;14044931300;22733296600;6701736103', author_afids='60003709;60003709;60003709;60003709;60003709;60003709', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='2022 30th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks, SoftCOM 2022', issn=None, source_id='21101119902', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='[Background] Software engineering activities provide large volumes of data that software analytics tools can use to support decision-making.

Gamification has become the primary resolution to the low retention rate in learning platforms for undergraduates. However, most gamified learning studies focus on the player-type profiling method, while no intrinsic motivation-driven game elements are mapped to certain players. This paper refined self-needs and user motivation in the learning experience from different user behaviours through the distinction method of Grasha Learner Style, deriving six types of learners: independent, dependent, participant, avoidance, collaborative, and competitive. Based on the literature review, a gamified framework has been developed to engage undergraduates to persist in using a self-developed gamified platform, GamiClass, for up to 16 weeks. A suggested 20 game elements have been deployed based on the needs of the Octalysis Framework and Self-Determination Theory. The analysis mirrored the positive impact of game elements (group quest, challenges, and time pressure) on the undergraduates. In contrast, choices/consequences and exploration game elements negatively affect the undergraduates' continuity in the gamified platform. Furthermore, the group quest was identified as the critical game element that stimulates various types of undergraduates in competition and collaboration, thus internalising their extrinsic motivation into intrinsic motivation during their learning journey.\", authkeywords='Game elements | gamification | human computer interaction | intrinsic motivation', citedby_count=6, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85141573659', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='2022 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society Conference - Asia Pacific, TEMSCON-ASPAC 2022', subtype='cr', subtypeDescription='Conference Review', creator=None, afid=None, affilname=None, affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country=None, author_count=None, author_names=None, author_ids=None, author_afids=None, coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='2022 IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society Conference - Asia Pacific, TEMSCON-ASPAC 2022', issn=None, source_id='21101119947', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='The proceedings contain 22 papers.

This paradigmatic case study maps discursive positionings and discusses how these positionings aspire to transform engineering education in the light of the wide-ranging drifts in higher education. Based on 17 qualitative in-depth interviews with researchers, teachers, and managers, the article maps the discursive positions taken and not-taken in relation to the enactment of the teaching-research-practice-nexus. The exploration is guided by a theory-method-package inspired by situational analysis and interviewing methods developed in practice-based approaches as interview-to-the-double. The analysis identifies four discursive positions in the teaching-research-practice-nexus that enact knowledge production in engineering UAS differently. Furthermore, three unavailable discursive positions are identified. Interpretive flexibility makes different discursive enactments of knowledge production possible. The study concludes that (1) that the primary mission of UAS in Denmark is teaching; research and engagement with practice are subordinate missions; (2) that the applied and third mission drift has been effective in instituting alternative discursive enactments; (3) some positions are seemingly discursively illegitimate. The undisputability of the educational mission–and the applied and third mission drifts–seems to effectively outweigh academic drift in the Danish UAS.', authkeywords='discourse analysis | education policy | Engineering education | higher education | research to practice', citedby_count=1, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85141433388', doi='10.1109/BCD54882.2022.9900649', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Factors Impacting the Intention to use Role-playing Games in Learning Communicative English of University Students in da Nang City', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Vo Truong An P.', afid='60117455', affilname='FPT University', affiliation_city='Hanoi', affiliation_country='Viet Nam', author_count='3', author_names='Vo Truong An, Pha;Ta Xuan, Phu;Trong, Van Hung', author_ids='57955454600;57955454700;57956577600', author_afids='60117455;60117455;60117455', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings - 2022 IEEE/ACIS 7th International Conference on Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Data Science, BCD 2022', issn=None, source_id='21101119513', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='7-12', description=\"English could be described as a language used to achieve across borders and bridge the gaps.

Anyway, in the last decades, the investment on LEPs in increasing all over the world (Flyvjierg, B., 2014), and the construction of LEPs is still considered a basic leverage to increase the wealth of nations. The topic is particularly relevant at EU level. In fact the decision-making process on which infrastructure (LEP) should be funded and which not by the public sector has been criticized by new “sovranist” political parties. For example, studies both in favor and against the funding of the same infrastructure have been published by different academics, even belonging to the same institution (Ponti, M. et al., 2019) (Cantarella G.E., et al., 2019). In the last few months there is a lot of discussion in Italy about the feasibility of an Hyperloop, that is a “Hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes through whith a pod may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while being very efficient, thereby drastically reducing travel times over medium-range distances” (Opgenoord, Max M.J., 2019). In particular, six possible route have been drafted, e.g. Milan-Rome, Milan Cadorna Station-Milan Malpensa Airport, Verona-Trieste and others. The Authors want to evaluate the economic feasibility of that revolutionary transpiration mode, applying a broad approach, according both the indications of the European Commission’s Guide to Cost-Benefit Analysis of Investment Projects (2014), including both ordinary costs and benefits, and evaluation also the innovation benefits that such transportation mode, if implemented, will bring: evaluating such a transportation mode as, for example, an ordinary high speed train mode, won’t be correct, because implementing it will cause innovation in several technologic fields and in the transportation sector as a whole, and these benefits must be encompassed in the analysis. In addition, the authors will evaluate other success criteria such as the one indicated by Atkinson, R. (1999), i.e. “stakeholder benefits against which projects can he assessed”. Including the approach by Turner and Zolin (2012) of taking into account multiple perspectives by multiple stakeholders over multiple time frames: In Large Engineering Projects “How different stake-holders perceive success can change with time, and so the project manager needs leading performance indicators that go beyond the traditional triple constraint to 148 forecast how key stakeholders will perceive success months or even years later” (Turner and Zolin, 2012). This research has the aim of carrying out a preliminary technical-economic feasibility study of a potential Hyperloop line connecting the cities of Rome and Milan, chosen as they are poles of attraction and generators of transportation demand. The main objective is not to analyze the validity of the technology used as to assess the feasibility and sustainability of such a project. The first section briefly describes the history and technology, the main characteristics and limitations of these vehicles. The second section presents a transportation study of the potential demand through surveys that will make it possible to identify users’ preferences, assessing the transportation demand and the willingness to pay of potential users. In the third and fourth sections a financial and economic analysis is performed, presenting assumptions and limitations that this research necessarily has, due to the lack of information on several areas. In the last section before conclusions, some consideration is made about the possible social impact on potential stakeholders involvement, presenting also preliminary feedback, from interviews to industrial stakeholder that are considering their involvement in a hyperloop venture in Italy.

With the continuous improvement of China's material level, product innovation design has changed from functional needs to emotional needs, and the product design method centered on users' emotional needs has attracted much attention. With the emergence of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data, the automation and intelligence of advanced algorithms and innovative design methods for online product decision driven by multimodal multimedia data in e-commerce have become inevitable trends in the field of product design, and it is a big challenge to improve the innovative design ability of products by using information technology. In order to solve this problem, based on the research of BP neural network technology, this paper puts forward an innovative product design method based on image-Kempi method. The color features of images are reconstructed and integrated, and then transferred to product modeling, so as to generate new products with both content image modeling features and style image color features, which brings visual inspiration to users. The results show that KENPI method combines the theories of Kansei engineering, convolutional neural network, and neural style transfer, and establishes a mapping model between product modeling elements and product semantics. Convolutional neural network and neural style transfer model are used to extract, reconstruct, and integrate the color features of style diagrams, and transfer them to product modeling to design new product images. By evaluating the image quality and comparing the product semantics before and after the migration, the validity and feasibility of the migration are verified. Based on BP neural network, a nonlinear mapping model between product attribute space and product semantic space is constructed, and the generalization ability of the model is evaluated, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.

The primary aim of this paper was to synthesize both research and practice reports on micro-credentials (MCRs). Background There has been an increase in reports and research on the plausibility of MCRs to support dynamic human skills development for an increasingly impatient and rapidly changing digital world. The integration of fast-paced emerging technologies and digitalization necessitate alternative learning paradigms. MCRs offer time, financial, and space flexibility and can be stacked into a larger qualification, thereby allowing for a broader range of transdisciplinary competencies within a qualification. However, MCRs often lack the academic rigor required for accreditation within existing disciplines. Methodology The study followed the PRISMA framework (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses), which offers a rigorous method to enhance reporting quality. The study used both academic research and practice reports. Contribution The paper makes a theoretical contribution to the discourse about the need for innovation within existing educational paradigms for continued relevance in a changing world. It also contributes to the debate on the role of MCRs in bridging the gap between practice and academia despite the growing difference between their interests, and the role that MCRs play in the social-economic plans of countries. Findings The key findings are that investments in MCRs are mainly in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and Education sectors, and have taken place mainly in high-income countries and regions – contexts that particularly value practice-accredited MCRs. Low-income countries, by contrast, remain traditional and insist on MCRs that are formally accredited by a recognized academic institution. This contributes to a widening skills gap between low- and high-income countries or regions, which results in greater global disparities. There is also a growing divide between academia and practice concerning their interest in MCRs (a reflection of the rigor versus relevance debate), which partially explains why many global and larger organizations have gone on to create their own learning institutions. Recommendations We recommend that educational mechanisms consider the critical importance for Practitioners of MCRs as part of innovative efforts for life-wide (different sectors) and lifelong (same sector) learning, especially in low-income countries. MCRs provide dynamic mechanisms to fill skills gaps in an increasing ruthless international battle for talent. Recommendations We recommend focused research into skills and career pathways using MCRs for Researchers while at the same time remaining responsive to transdisciplinary efforts and sensitive to global and local changes within any sector. Impact on Society Work and society have transformed over time, and more so in the new digital age, yet academia has been slow in adapting to the changes, forcing organizations to create their own learning institutions or to use MCRs to fill the skills gap. The purpose of education goes beyond preparing individuals for work, extending further to creating an environment where individuals and governments seek their own social and economic outcomes. MCRs provide a flexible means for co-creation between individuals, education, organizations, and government that could stem global rising unemployment, social exclusion, and redundancy. Future Research Future research should focus on the co-creation of MCRs between practitioners and academia.', authkeywords='COVID-19 | credentials | digital badges | education 4.0 | micro-credentials | online learning', citedby_count=11, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85140483088', doi='10.1007/978-3-031-17288-5_32', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Eco-Feasibility Study and Application of Natural Inventive Principles in Chemical Engineering Design', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Mas’udah ', afid='60104628;60005597;128773696', affilname='State Polytechnic of Malang;University of Applied Sciences Offenburg;iFluids Engineering', affiliation_city='Malang;Offenburg;Chennai', affiliation_country='Indonesia;Germany;India', author_count='6', author_names='Mas’udah, ;Livotov, Pavel;Santosa, Sandra;Sekaran, Arun Prasad Chandra;Takwanto, Anang;Pachulska, Agata M.', author_ids='57204723857;57164768200;57212476429;57349766100;57218144141;57939729400', author_afids='60104628;60005597;60104628;128773696;60104628;60005597', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology', issn='18684238', source_id='19400157163', eIssn='1868422X', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='655 IFIP', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='382-394', description='The early stages of the front-end process development are critical for the future success of projects involving new technologies.

At the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution, they are familiar with innovations and modern technologies that allow them to create innovative solutions and build an environmentally friendly mining sector. The aim of the paper was to assess the feasibility of implementing the assumptions of the industrial revolution 4.0 in the mining industry. Based on the author's own research and literature research, a set of scenarios for the transformation process was developed. After the verification, three alternative scenarios related to the transformation process 4.0 in mines were used for the research. The transformation scenarios were assessed from the perspective of individual stakeholder groups. The NAIADE (Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments), which so far has not been used in the mining industry to assess development scenarios, the method was used to assess the transformation scenarios. The research identified and characterized nine groups of stakeholders. Based on the conducted structured interviews, a set of technical criteria for the assessment of scenarios was defined. The analysis results from the impact matrix and social impact matrix developed for the first time for the mining industry transformation scenarios. Based on the analysis of the impacts of individual factors, it was shown which scenario is the most acceptable for stakeholders and the best from a technical point of view. The research focuses on the deficit of digital competencies and the generational change, as well as the change in the competency requirements of the new type of worker-miner-operator 4.0.\", authkeywords='digital transformation | Industry 4.0 | Mining 4.0 | mining engineering | multicriteria analysis | NAIADE | operator 4.0 | predictive maintenance | smart mining', citedby_count=18, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85140081223', doi='10.1155/2022/7175807', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Quantitative Impact Analysis of Financial Support on Regional Science and Technology Innovation and Productivity Based on the Multivariate Statistical Model', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Liu L.', afid='60210345', affilname='Xinjiang University of Finance and Economics', affiliation_city='Urumqi', affiliation_country='China', author_count='1', author_names='Liu, Ling', author_ids='57887952500', author_afids='60210345', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Mathematical Problems in Engineering', issn='1024123X', source_id='13082', eIssn='15635147', aggregationType='Journal', volume='2022', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='7175807', pageRange=None, description=\"Science and technology (S&T) innovation is a significant driving force for regional productivity, and strong financial support can effectively promote S&T innovation.

These are the reports of Soviet specialists in the field of technical knowledge on the business trips to Czechoslovakia in the period from the mid-1940s until the end of the 1960s. Their authors were employees of the Leningrad sectoral research institutes. They were technical chemists, shipbuilders, hydraulic engineers, mining engineers, machine builders, etc. The presented materials made it possible to take a fresh look at the issues of the Soviet-Czechoslovak technological transfer, both within the framework of bilateral relations and within the framework of CMEA. A distinctive feature of all the reports was their de-ideologization. These documents did not contain references to the classics of Marxism-Leninism and assurances of the superiority of socialist science over bourgeois, but they reflected a deep sincere interest in foreign technologies and engineering solutions. Noteworthy is the very respectful attitude of Soviet specialists towards their Czech and Slovak colleagues, and at the same time - deep attention to Czechoslovak technical developments. This fact clearly distinguishes the reports of engineers from the reports of their colleagues in the humanities, especially from the institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The latter often wrote such documents from the arrogant position of the “elder brother”, who has a monopoly on the Marxist truth. The Soviet authors of the reports did not separate Soviet technical science from the global context and tried in every possible way to convey the idea of the importance of exchanging experience and scientific and technical information with foreign partners. They looked with some envy at their Czechoslovak colleagues, who, albeit limitedly, had access to Western scientific and technical literature. If we talk about the transfer of knowledge and technology from the standpoint of mutual benefit, then we need to draw a conclusion about its success. Cooperation with the USSR allowed Czechoslovakia to develop a number of new technical areas, such as nuclear power, at the same time, the Soviet side got the opportunity to access promising Czechoslovak technologies in the field of mechanical engineering or polymer chemistry. However, the system of intellectual exchanges, despite the obvious mutual interest of the specialists of the two countries in it, was still fettered by ideological frameworks and party control, and the introduction of certain technical innovations often faced the sluggishness of the planned economy.', authkeywords='business foreign trips | history of science and technology | Leningrad | research institutes | Soviet engineers | Soviet-Czechoslovak scientific relations | technology transfer', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85139435230', doi='10.15407/scine18.04.106', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='INNOVATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR ADVANCED INFORMATION SYSTEMS', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Lavrich Y.M.', afid='60138342', affilname='Institute of Transport Systems and Technologies of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine', affiliation_city='Dnipro', affiliation_country='Ukraine', author_count='3', author_names='Lavrich, Y.

In the global practice of creating large information systems, always there is the problem of availability and, even more so, the introduction of new technologies, so the developer has to work out his own innovation technology for all stages of the life cycle. Purpose. The purpose of this research is to analyze and to generalize the design and technological features of advanced SC information systems development and production. Materials and Methods. The system analysis of the aspects of design and technological support in the process of developing and manufacturing a new radar generation with the use of the conventional and cutting-edge R&D achievements has been used. Results. It has been shown that because of the fact that while developing a space control radar innovation, the developer may not always use advanced scientific knowledge as basis for creating new technology and sometimes has to look for solutions outside the scholarly research field, based on the existing research and engineering experience and technological monopoly as a result of his/her own developments and inventions. Some specific aspects of the preparatory works and related problems, as well as the possible ways for their effective solution have been considered. Several proposals aiming at ensuring the equipment efficiency at all stages of new model life cycle have been presented. Conclusions. Ukraine remains among a few countries having a full technological cycle of development and manufacture of highly advanced information systems. However, to ensure sustainable development of the in dustry, the necessary conditions are the availability of R&D experience and the development of their own innovation technologies.', authkeywords='and technological equipment | innovations | technical process | technological documentation', citedby_count=0, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85139385570', doi='10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3208915', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Evolutionary Analysis of Cloud Manufacturing Platform Service Innovation Based on a Multiagent Game Perspective', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Xin Y.', afid='60017456;60001419', affilname='Jinan University;Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University', affiliation_city='Guangzhou;Guangzhou', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='3', author_names='Xin, Yuhong;Liu, Dehui;Zhou, Xindi', author_ids='57454947700;57454792600;57917905100', author_afids='60001419;60001419;60017456', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='IEEE Access', issn=None, source_id='21100374601', eIssn='21693536', aggregationType='Journal', volume='10', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='104543-104554', description=\"With the rapid development of cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other new generation information technologies, a new service-oriented networked intelligent manufacturing mode-cloud manufacturing (CMfg), is emerged. In the CMfg paradigm, cloud manufacturing platform service innovation is an effective way to improve the service function, service quality and service efficiency of cloud manufacturing platforms. However, the service innovation of cloud manufacturing platforms is complex system engineering, which needs to consider many participants with independent interests simultaneously. If one party's behaviour strategy changes, the whole system will be affected. In order to adapt the decision-making management of manufacturing service innovation in cloud manufacturing system, to provide the effective decision-making support for service innovation of cloud manufacturing system in uncertain environment, to explore the interaction mechanism and equilibrium strategy of various stakeholders in the evolution process of cloud manufacturing system. This research constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model among participants based on evolutionary game theory, Analyses the influence of participants' strategy choices, The Cloud manufacturing platform's service quality coefficients and users' preference Coefficients on the equilibrium state stability of cloud manufacturing systems, and uses MATLAB software for numerical simulation. The results show that the evolutionary stability strategy of cloud manufacturing enterprises plays a decisive role in the service innovation of the cloud manufacturing platform. When cloud manufacturing enterprises choose a noncooperation strategy, the evolutionary stability strategy of the cloud manufacturing platform is innovation. When cloud manufacturing enterprises choose a cooperation strategy, the evolutionary stability strategy of the cloud manufacturing platform is affected by the platform's service quality coefficient and the user's preference coefficient, and both factors can promote the evolution of cloud manufacturing platform service innovation. The platform's service quality coefficient has a threshold value, which depends on the relative size of benefits, costs and user's preference coefficient generated by the service innovation of the platform. Therefore, in the cloud manufacturing mode, the cloud manufacturing platform must rely on different enterprises to provide their own innovation resources to realize the service innovation of the cloud manufacturing platform, so the cloud manufacturing platform should focus on introducing a group of high-quality cloud manufacturing enterprises for cooperation. In addition, users' strong demand for high-quality services can provide sufficient impetus for cloud manufacturing enterprises to choose cooperation and cloud manufacturing platforms to choose innovation, which can not only encourage cloud manufacturing platforms to provide personalized services for users but also avoid the extra waste of resources.\", authkeywords='Cloud manufacturing platform | multiagent perspective | service innovation | tripartite evolutionary game', citedby_count=10, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='NSFC', fund_no='52275479', fund_sponsor='National Natural Science Foundation of China'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85139383719', doi='10.1155/2022/3291030', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Simulation Model of Enterprise Financial Management Activities Based on the Random Forest Algorithm', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Zhao F.', afid='127436846', affilname='Henan Industry and Trade Vocational College', affiliation_city='Zhengzhou', affiliation_country='China', author_count='1', author_names='Zhao, Fang', author_ids='57917805900', author_afids='127436846', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Mobile Information Systems', issn='1574017X', source_id='19700174653', eIssn='1875905X', aggregationType='Journal', volume='2022', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='3291030', pageRange=None, description='In the era of information and data, big data and cloud computing have been widely used in all walks of life, especially for promoting the transformation of business model and the financial administration model of corporations.

First, during the construction of the Demonstration Area, the \"three-control\" shale gas enrichment and high-production theory is innovatively proposed, and the shale gas enrichment model in the southern Sichuan Basin is clarified. Second, a high-production well cultivation method based on geology-engineering integration is established by developing six main technologies for shale gas exploration and development, which effectively supports the large-scale benefit development of shale gas in the Demonstration Area. Third, the benefit development model of middle-deep shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin is preliminarily formed, and the benefit and efficiency of productivity construction are improved comprehensively. Fourth, the three measures of \"controlling the decline rate, enhancing the reserve production and expanding the periphery\" are used to support the replacement and stable production of middle-deep shale gas. In conclusion, to sustainably ensure the long-term benefit and stable production of shale gas in the southern Sichuan Basin, it is still necessary to deepen fine reservoir description and complex mechanism understanding and explore EOR technologies and methods. What\\'s more, the important mean to improve the single-well shale gas production rate in this area is to strengthen the fine fracturing design and implementation under the deep integration of geology and engineering and improve the construction quality of fracturing network continuously. Furthermore, the only way to the low-cost development of the demonstration area is to promote the management reform and innovation continuously and improve the benefit development model further. .', authkeywords='Changning-Weiyuan | Geology-engineering integration, Profitable development | Middle-deep formation | National shale gas demonstration area | Resource Enrichment and high-production | Sichuan Basin | Stable production optimization', citedby_count=10, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85138812434', doi='10.3787/j.issn.1000-0976.2022.08.005', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Deep shale gas exploration and development in the Weirong and Yongchuan areas, South Sichuan Basin: Progress, challenges and prospect', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Guo T.', afid='60021623', affilname='Sinopec', affiliation_city='Beijing', affiliation_country='China', author_count='5', author_names='Guo, Tonglou;Xiong, Liang;Lei, Wei;Zhao, Yong;Pang, Heqing', author_ids='14011875200;56438710900;57366702800;57211918293;36020480800', author_afids='60021623;60021623;60021623;60021623;60021623', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Natural Gas Industry', issn='10000976', source_id='19559', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='42', issueIdentifier='8', article_number=None, pageRange='45-59', description='Benefit development of shale gas has been achieved in areas above 3 500 m in depth in China, and relatively thorough geological theories and exploration & development technologies have been formed. Although the deep shale gas at such depth is of good geological parameters, it is difficult to develop effectively due to worse engineering and geological conditions. In order to improve the exploration and development benefit of deep shale gas, based on comparison of geological–engineering parameters between deep and medium shale gas, taking the deep shale gas in the Rongwei and Yongchuan areas as an example, this paper summarizes the technical progresses in geology, drilling, completion, fracturing, production, and transportation, analyzes the involved problems and challenges, and predicts the future development direction. The following results were achieved. (1) The basic geological characteristics of deep shale, such as geochemical indicators, content of brittle minerals, porosity and gas-bearing property, are similar to those of medium–deep shale, but the engineering and geologic features are more complex, with the characteristics of high geostress, high horizontal stress difference, high plasticity and high formation pressure. (2) Due to the less developed fractures within the deep shale and complex geostress of the study area, the effective fracturing volume is small, leading to a low initial productivity, rapid production decline, low EUR and high fracturing fluid backflow rate, which have restrained the benefit development of deep shale gas. (3) A complete set of key matching techniques have been established for the exploration and development of deep shale gas, such as evaluation and prediction of sweet spots, integration of geological modeling–fracturing simulation–numerical simulation, excellent and fast drilling and completion, volume fracturing, production management with \"three-precises\" and intensive gas production. (4) Currently, the exploration and development of deep shale gas are facing several key problems (such as casing deformation, fracturing pressure channeling and poorly reservoir reconstruction effect), so technological research on geological evaluation, geological modeling–numerical simulation, drilling, fracturing, production–transportation should be carried out constantly. In conclusion, to form key technologies for deep shale gas exploration and development is of great significance to improving China\\'s shale gas supportability.

However, the shuttle effect induced by lithium polysulfide intermediates and kinetically slow redox reactions limits the utilization of active materials and results in rapid capacity degradation, therefore hindering practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries. In order to solve these problems, researchers firstly have adopted physical confinement and/or chemisorption of polysulfides to alleviate the shuttle effect. However, these strategies confront a dilemma that physically confined or chemisorbed polysulfides will eventually become saturated and so to trigger shuttle effect. If the adsorbed polysulfides can be rapidly converted to immobile solid phases, the shuttle effect could be mitigated. In this regard, researchers have adopted the concept of “lithium-sulfur catalysis” to promote kinetics of polysulfide conversion reactions. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances in designing principles of catalytic materials and systems adopted in lithium-sulfur batteries, with aspects to both heterogeneous and homogeneous systems. For heterogeneous systems, one research direction is to regulate processes at both cell and electrode levels using solid catalysts. At the cell level, considering the “dissolution-deposition” mechanism in which active materials are subjected to multiple phase transitions (solid-liquid-solid), it is vital to define the key step that determines the apparent reaction rates so that researchers could employ materials able to selectively catalyze the key processes. Therefore, some works are discussed with a focus on methods to quantify all-phase catalysis kinetics. To simultaneously catalyze multiple processes, “bidirectional” catalysts are introduced to enable regulation of both discharge and charge processes. At the electrode level, progress regulation focuses on the synergy between electron conduction, adsorption, and catalysis. Bulk electrical conductivity and surface polarity are identified as two key parameters of solid catalyst design for lithium-sulfur catalysis. Some works propose heterostructured catalysts to incorporate the above two parameters into one design. In addition to the catalytic processes, the reconstruction and deactivation of solid catalysts are also important processes occurring in a working battery. Some meaningful works are summarized, highlighting the dominant role of complex interactions between catalysts and polysulfides or other electrolyte components in this aspect. Once the diffusion process is no longer rate-determining, the catalytic efficiency will be governed by the adsorption/desorption and surface reaction. This motivates the optimization of catalytically active sites and catalyst structure, which presents as another research direction of heterogeneous lithium-sulfur catalysis. There are a number of effective methods to regulate the structure and catalytic performance of solid catalysts, include doping, vacancy engineering, and cooperation between multisites. On one hand, introducing heteroatoms or vacancy defects to solid catalyst can induce changes in the local electronic structure and thus modify the properties of these sites. On the other hand, cooperation between multisites with controlled “sulfiphilicity” and “lithiophilicity” is proposed beyond single-site catalysis. The cooperative sulfiphilic and lithiophilic sites that simultaneously bind heteropolar Li/S atoms are able to facilitate the dissociation or reorganization of end-group Li−S bond in polysulfides. Representative catalysts with multisite synergy are reviewed. For homogeneous systems, the soluble and mobile nature of a homogeneous catalyst allows it to fully contact immobile reactants in lithium-sulfur batteries, such as sulfur and lithium sulfides solids. Homogeneous lithium-sulfur catalysis process is usually realized by the use of soluble redox mediators (RMs). By tuning the redox potential and diffusivity of RMs, both sulfur reduction reactions and lithium sulfide oxidation reactions could be delicately regulated. A number of typical RMs are discussed. However, similar to polysulfides, soluble RMs also suffer from severe shuttle effect. Hence, a (semi-)immobilization strategy for RM design is proposed to circumvent the inherent RM shuttle problem. Moreover, the semi-immobilization strategy can be extended to heterogeneous lithium-sulfur catalysis to endow catalysts with both heterogeneous and homogeneous characteristics. As a consequence, strongly coupled heterogeneous and homogeneous processes in lithium-sulfur batteries can be regulated concurrently.

Health-care institutions are facing an increasing availability of complex technologies, while data on their clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness are rarely provided. A partnership/collaboration between health-care institutions, academia, and private industries will enhance their own specific interests with the common goal of improving overall health and quality of life. The complexity of the subject combined with the variety of specialists and stakeholders involved requires the implementation, in hospital centers of clinical excellence, of units dedicated to the whole path of the medical device innovation. Stakeholders should quickly provide adequate measures to facilitate the complex medical device innovation path under the more stringent MDR aimed to increase safety and quality of care.', authkeywords='clinical investigation | clinical trial | cost-effectiveness | effectiveness | engineering | innovation | MDR 2017/745 | Medical device | Medical Device Regulation | regulatory | safety | statistics | surveillance | Value based healthcare', citedby_count=10, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85137730943', doi='10.52202/065147-0064', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research and Application of Cloud-based Calculation Tools for Building Engineering Design', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Lai Y.', afid='60084616;126140954', affilname='Chengdu Aircraft Design and Research Institute;Ltd.', affiliation_city='Chengdu;Chengdu', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='6', author_names='Lai, Yifeng;Zhu, Honghao;Kang, Yongjun;Wu, Shu;Gao, Fei;Li, Rui', author_ids='57216270027;57883606800;37020221400;57884104100;57885065800;57885100600', author_afids='60084616;126140954;60084616;60084616;60084616;126140954', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Conference Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Project Management, China, ISPM 2022', issn=None, source_id='21101107102', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='466-474', description='With the digital development of building engineering, traditional design calculation tools are also facing innovation.

The management is the helm of the development of the enterprise, the main body of the company's actual production activities, and the direct person in charge of the company's management. Its influence on the innovation of the enterprise is self-evident, and the education level of the management directly determines the manager's ability and vision. However, the current research on management mainly focuses on the position change of management and the rights of management and does not involve the level of education of management. Based on this, this article started from the management education and subdivided it with the K-means clustering algorithm, so as to explore the impact of management education on the technological innovation of enterprises. The experiment showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the educational level of management and the technological innovation ability of enterprises, and the correlation coefficient was 1.521.

Four-dimensional (4D) structures can replace these construction principles with reduced complexity. However, the materials, manufacturing, and design methods used are still inadequate. In hybrid manufacturing processes, the advantages of textile manufacturing processes can be combined with the advantages of generative manufacturing processes. In the field of 4D structures, Tibbits (2017) has provided the proof of concept of a hybrid 4D structure consisting of prestressed textile surfaces with printed thermoplastic reinforcements for the first time. Thomas Gries and his research group filed a patent application for 4D textiles in 2016. What is new is the purposeful change in the shape of the hybrid material over time as a result of the interaction of a prestressed, anisotropic textile carrier structure and printed heterogeneous beam structures as reinforcement. Systematic consideration of the elements’ textile surface and selective reinforcements and their relation on the level of interfaces and superior mechanics of elements enables the engineering of the hybrid material. In this chapter, models for the calculation, selection, design, and characterization of possible solutions and test methods are discussed for the elements and their relations. Materials are selected under consideration of the constraints resulting from the relations. Finally, a design methodology based on design thinking for 4D structures is proposed.

Popular culture views the past as disposable, and that we must look forward to the future for innovation and big ideas. But the past is valuable. As Dr. John Lennox, a professor at Oxford University, writes, 'New things are old things happening to new people.' Teams at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) started exploring ways to implement our vision statement of 'Dare Unite Ex-plore', a vision acknowledging the need to continually evolve to meet the demands of the future. Through brainstorming and benchmarking other NASA Centers, the authors proposed an'Innovation Team' to meet the vision to work with greater speed and agility, communicate effectively between organizations, improve innovation and increase workforce flexibility. However, when the idea was proposed, it was met with some skepticism given an analogous effort in a prior decade or two. This paper describes how the authors overcame these challenges to implement a collaborative, concurrent engineering framework tailored to JSC's needs. Our process to drive cultural change, the steps taken, and challenges encountered are discussed, including the aspects that were considered given JSC's operation-focused, Program-driven landscape. Modeled after rapid concept development teams like NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Innovation Foundry and NASA Glenn Research Center's Compass team, NASA JSC is laying the foundation of an innovation team called 'The Forge'. This team is as much about getting employees tempered in the ways of innovative thinking as it is about refining design studies and hammering out proposals. The first two pilots of the teaming framework are described with initial results presented in terms of employee engagement and fostering innovation. We also describe the planned future work and next steps to continue to push the initiative forward. Building upon JSC's long heritage in human spaceflight programs and operations, we are forging a renewed emphasis to Dare to expand frontiers, Unite with our partners and Explore space to benefit humanity.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85137582339', doi='10.1007/978-981-19-5137-4_1', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='10 Years of Research at Cadi Ayyad University: Pedagogical Innovation to Cross Borders in Education', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Berrada K.', afid='60104175;60030364;60000784', affilname='International University of La Rioja;Faculté des Sciences Semlalia;Faculté des Sciences Rabat', affiliation_city='Logrono;Marakech;Rabat', affiliation_country='Spain;Morocco;Morocco', author_count='3', author_names='Berrada, Khalid;El Kharki, Khadija;Burgos, Daniel', author_ids='57197691680;57217083887;8937994100', author_afids='60000784;60030364;60104175', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Lecture Notes in Educational Technology', issn='21964963', source_id='21100834881', eIssn='21964971', aggregationType='Book Series', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-7', description='This introductory chapter presents an overview of all contributions that summarize a decade of scientific research around science education at Cadi Ayyad University (UCA).

Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Lean are two vital innovations for the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) industry used in the industry to improve aspects of productivity and efficiency. BIM has been used to generate and compare designs to ensure optimum use of resources, reduce design time, improve collaboration between stakeholders, and reduce errors in design and construction. On the other hand, the main agenda of Lean is to reduce (both material and production process) waste, increase value, and thrive for continuous improvement. In the construction industry, BIM and Lean have been mostly used in isolation. However, studies suggest that BIM and Lean have mutual relationships and are complementary to achieve each other’s objectives. To do so, it is very crucial to understand the mechanism behind the relationship and the interaction between BIM and Lean. Informed analysis and understanding of the mutual relationship would help construction management decision-makers to achieve the utmost benefits from the implementation of these two drivers. However, previous studies have explored BIM and Lean relationships, but limited studies were done to support construction management decision-makers in identifying relevant BIM functions to enable Lean or to identify relevant Lean principles to support BIM. Therefore, this paper aims to represent a conceptual BIM-Lean relationship assessment framework by using Design Science Research methodology to identify and measure the relationship between BIM and Lean to support construction management decision-makers.', authkeywords='BIM | Framework | Lean | Relationship', citedby_count=2, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85137243882', doi='10.21008/j.0860-6897.2022.1.08', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Multidisciplinary Integration of Knowledge, Approaches and Tools: Toward the Sensory Human Experience Centres', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Masullo M.', afid='60026777', affilname='Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli', affiliation_city='Naples', affiliation_country='Italy', author_count='2', author_names='Masullo, Massimiliano;Maffei, Luigi', author_ids='35737296400;7103160021', author_afids='60026777;60026777', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Vibrations in Physical Systems', issn='08606897', source_id='21100218015', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='33', issueIdentifier='1', article_number='2022108', pageRange=None, description=\"The technological progress of the last decades has significantly contributed to the development and innovation of several areas, such as engineering, architecture, and medicine, providing new possibilities to measure, control, simulate and assess most of the physical phenomena of the environment, and the corresponding reactions of the individuals. This has shifted the attention of researchers toward the need to understand, in depth, the mechanisms which influence the perception and well-being of humans in complex environments (e.g., cities, urban parks). In this light, it can be expected that the first-person experiences will be assumed as the new frontier of future decision-making and design processes, as they may involve representatives of local communities and groups of interest. This approach leads to a multidisciplinary integration and contamination of the scientific competencies for all research groups involved in the so-called holistic research. Overcoming the concept of noise that has dominated until the end of the last century and considering the environmental sounds as a 'resource' rather than a 'waste', with the introduction of the Soundscape approach, psychologists and sociologists have provided several tools (e.g., questionnaires, scales, tasks) to measure the perceptual, emotional, and cognitive reactions of the individuals when they are exposed to the sounds. Different multidisciplinary research groups are involved in studies that adopt, refine, or propose new investigation tools, to assess, modify and manage the sound of cities, and their effects on the satisfaction and well-being of the population. Moreover, the huge development of miniaturised and powerful hardware and software of the last decade allowed the reconstruction of audio-visual scenarios with a very high degree of realism and the possibility of interacting ecologically with the virtual environment in a fully functional immersive experience. The recent possibility to measure the physiological and neurological reactions of the individuals has opened a further road to extend the knowledge about the effects of noise and the weight of the other physical factors on the populations. A scheme of Sensory Human Experience Centres, where approaches, tools, competencies of various disciplines are integrated, is presented. These kinds of centres could represent, in future, the places where they concentrate the selection and validations of design alternatives (e.g., product, building, city and infrastructure scale) at the local and national levels.\", authkeywords='approaches | experiences | multidisciplinary | multisensory | virtual reality', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85137179040', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Harnessing the Power of Responsible Innovation: The Shift towards Human-centered Skills and Competences in AI Engineering', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Sharkov G.', afid='60024147;60010653;60007615;122671764', affilname='The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences;European Software Institute Center Eastern Europe;Paisii Hilendarski University of Plovdiv;Biopharmaceutical Laboratory Complex', affiliation_city='Sofia;Zamudio;Plovdiv;Sofia', affiliation_country='Bulgaria;Bulgaria;Bulgaria;Bulgaria', author_count='3', author_names='Sharkov, George;Todorova, Christina;Varbanov, Pavel', author_ids='57192113835;57195637499;57195641919', author_afids='60010653-60007615;60010653-122671764;60010653-60024147', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='CEUR Workshop Proceedings', issn='16130073', source_id='21100218356', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='3191', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1-17', description='Particularly against the backdrop of several notable incidents of abuse and malicious use of technology, in recent years, ethical issues across all technological fields, including artificial intelligence, have become a prominent topic for public discussion.

The structural mechanical behavior during demolition is an instantaneous release process. When the bending moment is positive, there is a risk of floor cracking and roof collapse in the beam section at the pier-beam junction; the structural performance of bridges in service continues to deteriorate under the long-term coupling action of load and environment. There is an urgent need to improve the structural performance through maintenance and reinforcement, but the rate of structural performance deterioration of the “over-medical” bridge structure will continue to accelerate after long-term operation, which will greatly shorten the service life of the bridge. Therefore, appropriate maintenance measures should be taken at the best maintenance time. It can effectively prolong the service life of bridges; however, a series of maintenance and reinforcement measures will make it more difficult to accurately assess and predict the state of bridge structures; intelligent bridge demolition is to use a new generation of information technology to grasp the real stress state of the whole process of bridge demolition in real time.

Green innovation has therefore become a research hotspot. With the acceleration of the digitalization process in equipment enterprises, intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises located at the top of the industrial chain are in urgent need of green core technology innovation activities. In order to explore the internal mechanism of core green technology innovation, this research introduces reputation theory into the evolutionary game analysis process. By constructing an evolutionary game model between the government and intelligent manufacturing equipment enterprises, this research analyzes the dynamic factors that affect the selection and evolution of the main strategies of the players in the evaluation game. The results show that corporate reputation, core green technology innovation profit, government subsidies, government reputation, and the cost for the government to support core technology, among other factors, importantly affect the game between the government and the enterprises. At the same time, since both the government and the enterprises are affected by the initial state and the maximization of the interests of both sides of the game, it is difficult for them to spontaneously reach an ideal stable and balanced state through a virtuous circle. The greater the profits and the reputation premium the core green technology innovation brings to the enterprises, the more favorable it is for the enterprises to choose core green technology innovation; government subsidies within a certain range will also drive enterprises to choose core green technology innovation. When the value of enterprise core green technology innovation is low, the cost for the government to support core green technology innovation is lower, enterprises will lose more opportunities and decline in global competitiveness, and it will become more favorable for the government to evolve towards supporting core green technology innovation. On the contrary, the government will gradually transfer its tangible hand to the intangible hand of the market based on the consideration of subsidies, innovation costs, and reputation.

The integration of information technology and curriculum is the use of information technology to present the curriculum in a new way in the teaching process. Therefore, compared with the traditional teaching mode, the integration of information technology and curriculum is more flexible and can show the boring classroom vividly and graphically in front of students, thus motivating students to learn actively and improving classroom efficiency. In recent years, with the continuous development of computer technology, the rise of information technology such as data analysis and the Internet of Things has caused a wave of \"Internet+\"education. With the promotion of education informatization, the smart classroom has been developed based on modern education technology. As a result, the classroom teaching mode based on modern information technology has become one of the hot spots for research. As a product of the integration of new technologies and teaching, the smart classroom creates a better learning environment for students with features such as intelligence, diversity, and personalization. At the same time, this teaching model gradually cultivates the information literacy of teachers and students while improving learning effectiveness. Also, with the rapid development of modern information technology, integrated teaching has become a popular and common teaching method. In this context, integrated teaching has a great impact on traditional teaching methods. This requires teachers to make corresponding changes in classroom teaching methods, approaches, and strategies in line with the trend of the times. However, although there are many changes, the corresponding teaching theory has not been updated. While modern information technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data have been widely used to track, collect, and analyze human behavior, it has been difficult for teachers to integrate these technologies into their teaching to help them teach effectively. In recent years, a growing number of experts and scholars have joined the discussion on instructional design that incorporates modern information technologies. There is a need to explore how to teach students in depth through big data and other tools, but there is no complete theoretical chain. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the reform and practice of modern Internet-based classroom teaching models. This study begins with an understanding of the current utilization of smart learning platforms in some schools and the teaching needs of IT subjects.

In the context of the industrial revolution “Industry 4.0” in science, along with the most common models, such as personality-oriented, engineering, etc., many other models are used that meet the specifics of education. The literature review also shows that innovation models are an improvement on one of the existing basic paradigms, which brings them closer and increases the possibility of subsequent integration. This indicates the relevance of the formation of a new holistic paradigm of education. The logic of scientific and technological progress also leads to the unification of engineering and humanitarian paradigms. A feature of the methodology of the 6th technological order (Glazyev) is that its key factors, in addition to technical sciences, are cognitive sciences and socio-humanitarian knowledge. The study confirms the need to include the humanities in the content of modern professional engineering education. As a result of the study, it was concluded that further productive technological development of society requires the unification of disparate educational models into a single modern educational paradigm.

The infrastructure for these paging systems is typically owned, operated, and maintained by the local government or agency to ensure coverage includes as close to 100% of the jurisdiction as possible. This paper proposes the use of datacasting technology to provide a redundant method for critical data distribution over a wide area to serve the paging needs of public safety and uses North Carolina as a test case. This concept could lead to cost-sharing, higher reliability, greater collaboration across jurisdictions, and reduced response times. The public deserves the best possible response from the public safety sector and therefore, public safety deserves the best technology available in order to achieve their mission. PBS North Carolina, along with the North Carolina Department of Information Technology First Responder Emerging Technologies Program (FirstTech), presented this concept at the 2019 National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Broadcast Engineering and Information Technology Conference. Much progress has been made since then. Starting in early 2020, a United States Department of Homeland Security Small Business Innovation Research grant was awarded to develop a prototype system that included an encoder and a custom ATSC 3.0 paging receiver with a miniature antenna.

What accounts for its limited application are as follows: (1) the high cost of high-accuracy laser LIDAR and (2) existing TLS equipment does not possess self-adaptation scanning planning and takes no account of efficiency of point cloud processing and consumption of computing power. This paper proposes a novel TLS equipment and a high-efficiency point cloud processing method customized for the novel equipment, with purpose to achieve self-adaption measurement on the basis of indoor characteristics of construction during civil engineering at low cost. This paper mainly presents two parts of innovations: (1) for planning of scanning, the novel TLS features planning sampling density of scanning according to room size and converting scanning data from poses to point clouds, and (2) for processing of point clouds, this paper proposes two novel segmentation algorithms, namely, \"on-boundary segmentation algorithm\"and \"on-angular-distance segmentation algorithm,\"based on indoor spatial structure features and characteristics of TLS. Besides, this paper presents modified RANSAC-TLS (random sample consensus-total least squares) plane fitting algorithm, on basis of TLS point cloud distribution characteristics and spatial transformation. Through actual measurement test, it is concluded that the \"on-boundary segmentation algorithm\"and \"on-angular-distance segmentation algorithm\"are suitable for point cloud segmentation in different types of scenes.

While China’s polyolefin industry enjoys the advantage of the largest scale with facilities practicing the most varieties of process technologies for the most diversified feedstocks in the world, also some crucial issues are obvious such as weak international competitiveness and structural contradictions. The reasons are expounded. Firstly, activities in both basic research and applied research are insufficient to initiate breakthroughs in technological innovation with originality. Secondly, inadequate pilot-scale research platforms constrain the speed of translation from bench-scale achievement to industrialization. Thirdly, the technical barrier in engineering, equipment manufacturing, and industrial norms and standards restrict the autonomy and the risk control of the industrial manufacturing of high-end products. Finally, the dependency on the import of crude oil leads to the uncontrollable cost of olefin feedstocks. Some proposals are made to improve the current situation of the polyolefin industry. To achieve technological leadership in the polyolefin industry, areas of breakthrough are identified for research and innovation, which include feedstock and key monomers, high performance catalysts, advanced polymerization process and engineering, high-end product development, innovation in processing technology, product applications and recycled utilization of polyolefin waste for sustainability. To improve the mechanism for research and innovation, the seamless collaboration of “industry-university-research-application” should be encouraged and deepened to carry out fundamental and theoretical researches on polymer physics and chemistry for the advancement in key scientific and technological aspects including catalyst, reaction engineering, process intensification, processing and application. Meanwhile, it is critical to formulate the norms and standards for pilot plant test for the breakthrough of the barrier from bench-scale test to industrialization.

The study of positive psychology provides a new perspective for our research in the field of education. The \"New Curriculum Standards for Junior Middle School English\"clearly states: \"Students can only maintain the inner driving force of English learning and achieve results only if they have positive emotions in English learning. Negative emotions will not only affect the effect of English learning, but also affect students\\' long-term development. In English teaching, teachers should pay attention to students\\' emotions from beginning to end, and strive to create a relaxed, democratic, and harmonious teaching atmosphere. Therefore, how to infiltrate the theory of positive psychology into the frontline English teaching of junior high school becomes especially important. With the advancement of science and technology and the advent of the Internet era, various high-tech information technologies have gradually flourished, and the rapid development of information technology has promoted the reform and innovation of the teaching industry. Wearable technology is the current trend and direction of the information technology revolution. It realizes the interconnection and deep integration of people, machines and objects through the functions of collecting, sorting and analyzing mobile Internet and cloud data. The realization of wearable technology-based wearable technology not only can highly integrate educational resources, improve learning interest, but also enhance the pertinence of teaching, cultivate students\\' creativity, and realize personalized teaching in \"full time, all-round, all fields.\"This article explores the integration of wearable devices and junior high school English teaching in the context of positive psychology. First of all, this paper introduces the theoretical basis of the integration of wearable devices with English teaching. Secondly, it introduces the research methods of this paper.

This paper presents an approach used for logical architecture’s automated generation and evaluation, which is the core technique of MBSE method. A kind of architecture representation language is studied to standardize architecture elements and reduce the solution space size of feasible architectures. Two key techniques are developed to generate and evaluate logic architecture of complex products, one is a mapping method based on case, flow and function-base to generate logic architecture set, and the other is called TOPSIS evaluation method to select optimal logical architecture.

This is also true for the livestock domain, in which the technologies developed to sustainably raise animals production are submitted to experiments while preserving their health and wellness. However, since such institutions often conduct several parallel innovation projects, the establishment of an infrastructure to support those experiments can be costly, repetitive, and error-prone. For that purpose, we developed E-SECO, a software ecosystem that encapsulates a lifecycle model for scientific experiments and its supporting platform and actors. The main contribution of this paper is presenting how the E-SECO architecture was successfully applied to create a livestock architecture (named e-Livestock architecture) from which two different (and independent) scientific experiments involving real systems were deployed and executed in the livestock domain. The first experiment involved a Compost Barn production system, i.e., the environment and surrounding technology where bovine milk production takes place; whilst the second experiment involved an automated monitoring environment for aviaries. Preliminary results showed the effectiveness of E-SECO to (i) abstract concepts of scientific experiments for livestock domain, (ii) support reuse and derivation of an architecture to support engineering real systems for different livestock sub-domains, and (iii) support the experiments towards a future transfer of technology to industry.CCS CONCEPTS • Applied computing ?

Due to the exponential rise in malware attacks, malware analysis and detection continue to be a hot research topic. Malware analysis plays a vital role in the malware detection process. Currently, the detection process adopts the malware signatures (static analysis) and behavior patterns (dynamic analysis) that have been proven time-consuming and less effective in identifying unknown malware in real time. Recent malware uses abstraction, packing, encryption, polymorphic, and other cryptic methods to hide and change the malware behavior and its signature which makes the detection process complex. Most of the new malware is the variants of existing malware, where machine learning techniques are effective in identifying such malware. However, the traditional machine learning technique is time-consuming because it requires substantial feature engineering and learning. By using the state-of-the-art learning technique such as deep learning, compel the learning process faster. By utilizing the high-level machine learning techniques, the training stage can be completely avoided. In this paper, first, we analyze the old-style MLAs and profound learning models for malware detection using publicly available datasets. Second, we analyze the deep learning models to examine the accuracy over the traditional machine learning technique. Third, our major commitment is in proposing an efficient and accurate model which combines the capabilities of the machine and deep learning technique which detect the zero-day malware efficiently.

Hence, universities must offer an environment where engineering students develop these soft skills competencies within the scope of, e.g., international project collaboration, with possibilities for intercultural and interdisciplinary contacts. Nevertheless, the reality of organizing an international collaborative project is very challenging. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for organizing international engineering project collaboration to enhance students' soft skills. As an example of applying the framework, an innovation project that could be executed by 10 students from different European universities with different cultural backgrounds will be showcased. Their project team is asked to develop a technical invention which could be a patentable idea, meaning it could potentially develop itself towards an interesting innovation. In such an international project, soft skill competencies are key for successful collaboration. The research question which will guide this paper is: What is a suitable framework for organising an international engineering project collaboration among universities to enhance the soft skills of their engineering students?

Benchmarks seek to tackle both of these challenges by creating common environments, in the form of 'Gyms' to train and compare reinforcement learning techniques, approaches, and algorithms.

Due to the limited study time during college, each student's study habits and learning process are also different, and the degree of connection between tennis lessons is high, so there will be polarization when learning tennis. With the development of science and technology, more and more technological innovations are integrated into the classroom, and traditional teaching methods can no longer keep up with the pace of the times. Tennis teaching is a subject of equal proportion between theory and practice. The traditional teaching method simplifies the theory, which makes students to have some bad phenomena when they practice. Aiming at this series of problems, this paper uses algorithms such as softmax function and threshold function to construct an application model of virtual image technology based on the artificial neural network in tennis teaching.

Although interdisciplinary teams are key to innovation, monodisciplinary programs tend to be divergent in nature and may not expose students to project teamwork. Problems arise when trying to foster effective outcomes for students who are unfamiliar with the skills necessary for self-managed teamwork. The purpose of this study is to share the results of exploratory qualitative research designed to better understand the challenges that senior undergraduates from two separate teams (Fall 2020-Spring 2021 and Fall 2021-Spring 2022) faced in the INCLUDE program at The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).

Using new institutional approaches, the paper examines industrial policy along with the market subsystem and non-market regulated sectors. All these subsystems interact through the intersection of conventions between economic agents. Industrial convention is characterised by continuous production, technology demands compliance, and standards as an information source (as opposed to the market convention that relies on prices). The research shows that the circulation of production means cannot function only based on universal norms of market behaviour, as it happens in the movement of high liquidity consumer goods. Circulation of production means can be determined by long-term agreements, engineering performance specifications and set prices. The paper demonstrates that the inefficient use of market instruments in the innovation sector may lead to state intervention in the circulation of production means. Therefore, by choosing a coordinated, associative management approach, industrial policy can focus on the creation and implementation of relevant strategic documents, as well as on the adjustment of interactions between economic agents and authorities.

Therefore, while medical technologies do relentlessly combat the diseases and disorders of the human eye, long-term innovations of visualization must also account for such users. Yet at the time of this paper, those with imperfect vision are underrepresented in light field research. In this paper, we present the results of the series of subjective tests carried out on light field displays, exclusively with test participants that otherwise would not qualify to assess visualization quality in a regular study. The experiments aim at investigating the most relevant research questions of light field visualization quality, such as spatial resolution, angular resolution and viewing distance. Test participants with imperfect visual acuity are classified by the diopters of their corrective lenses, and correlations between diopters and subjective ratings are addressed.

This longitudinal study builds upon an initial assessment of Lean practices in a company in the Nordics Marine sector starting in 2017. An improvement opportunity identified was defining measures to ensure improved integration of functional areas, especially manufacturing, from the beginning of the PD process. As a follow-up of the assessment, we studied the application of a set of new PD practices outlined for the development stage of a new, optimized tunnel thruster. The purpose of this paper is to share our findings related to the application of these practices and their effect on a Lean transformation in PD. Data collection was done through a participatory approach for observing team activities, including two workshops with key people in the thruster project. The results indicate that early integration of manufacturing competence in PD is important to improve production (integration), reduce time and cost. In addition, the use of design demonstrators and physical testing enable improved cost control and leverage learning throughout the PD process. A re-assessment of company practices relative to Lean, made during the autumn of 2020, identifies that six out of thirteen capabilities are improved in terms of the gap between current and desired future states. However, increased capability gap is identified in utilizing rigorous standardization to reduce variations, since existing company standards are challenged by new project innovations. It is concluded that the effect of introducing new PD practices to reduce capability gaps in Lean Product Development (LPD) is promising, especially for principles that are managed within the project control.\", authkeywords='capability gaps | case study | Lean Product Development | marine sector', citedby_count=3, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85133495844', doi='10.1360/TB-2022-0006', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Ergonomics in built environments: Prospects of human thermal comfort research', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Cao B.', afid='60025278;60001604;116277543', affilname=\"Tsinghua University;Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China;Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control\", affiliation_city='Beijing;Beijing;Beijing', affiliation_country='China;China;China', author_count='6', author_names='Cao, Bin;Zhu, Yingxin;Hou, Yuchen;Wu, Yeyu;Li, Sishi;Liu, Sijing', author_ids='36436721800;57198950567;57207961362;57222137586;57826317500;57560215000', author_afids='60025278-116277543;60025278-60001604;60025278-116277543;60025278-60001604;60025278-116277543;60025278-60001604', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Kexue Tongbao/Chinese Science Bulletin', issn='0023074X', source_id='84932', eIssn='20959419', aggregationType='Journal', volume='67', issueIdentifier='16', article_number=None, pageRange='1757-1770', description='Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, which have been around since the early 20th century, were originally designed to support fine industrial processes and thus pursue the goal of uniform, steady-state environmental control. And the HVAC systems for civil buildings which were widely used later followed such an idea to create uniform and steady-state thermal environments. For decades, a large number of domestic and foreign research results have shown that the uniform and steady thermal environment is not necessarily the most beneficial to people’s comfort and health, but it needs more energy consumption. As one of the earliest scientific theories formed in the field of ergonomics in built environments, the theory of human thermal comfort has effectively guided the development of the building thermal environment control methods, technologies, and products globally during the process of industrialization. In the new era of global warming and low-carbon buildings, the theoretical science of human thermal comfort undertakes the new mission of promoting the discipline of building technology and achieving the goals to develop “low-carbon” and “healthy” buildings. The future development of human thermal comfort research will have two important directions. One is the in-depth scientific understanding of the complex relationship between human and the multi-factor thermal environment, not only for human comfort needs, but also paying more attention to the impact on health. The other is the technological innovation that these new scientific understandings may bring, which can not only enhance personalized thermal comfort of people, but also effectively reduce the energy demand of thermal environment control in buildings. The first development direction above requires the combination of traditional engineering with medicine and public health, that is, the intersection of medicine and industry. The second development direction requires interdisciplinary cooperation between the discipline of built environment and other engineering disciplines such as materials, information, and energy. Based on the review of the development process of human thermal comfort as well as the research practice of our team, we have formed the following prospects centering on the above two future directions. (1) Compared with steady-state thermal environments, the dynamic thermal environment is more in line with people’s thermal comfort needs. The natural outdoor environment is a typical dynamic thermal environment, which is often more pleasant than steady neutral indoor environments. Attention should be paid to the use of suitable outdoor natural conditions, or the technologies to imitate natural conditions when creating indoor environments, so as to enhance people’s pleasure. (2) By providing local heating or local cooling, the human body can achieve thermal comfort in a cold or hot environment, so that the indoor comfortable temperature range can be greatly expanded. Therefore, future HVAC systems should focus on providing individual scale “precise thermal service” for indoor personnel, and develop personalized and wearable individual thermal comfort equipment, which can not only meet the different thermal comfort needs of people, but also help to save building energy. (3) Staying in a neutral thermal environment for a long time could weaken the heat stress ability of the human body, while moderate cold or hot exposure is beneficial to maintain human health. In the future, the indoor thermal environment system should be able to connect sensors to monitor the key thermal physiological indicators of the human body, and then support users to carry out cold or hot exposure exercise in accordance with health needs by adjusting the indoor thermal environment, so as to enhance their heat stress ability and keep healthy.', authkeywords='air conditioning | ergonomics | health | personal comfort system (PCS) | thermal comfort | thermal environment', citedby_count=4, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85133364981', doi='10.1504/IJPLM.2022.123560', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Initial stage of an industrial investigation of the knowledge management practices in a large-scale multinational automotive company', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Saunders T.', afid='60021889;60003310', affilname='University of Greenwich;University of Winchester', affiliation_city='London;Winchester', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;United Kingdom', author_count='3', author_names='Saunders, Timothy;Tite, Caroline;Gao, James', author_ids='56366095300;57223741467;7404476178', author_afids='60021889;60003310;60021889', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='International Journal of Product Lifecycle Management', issn='17435110', source_id='4000149501', eIssn='17435129', aggregationType='Journal', volume='14', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='18-39', description='Automotive systems engineering (SE) design and high-quality manufacturing, are highly reliant on the valuable knowledge and experience embedded within corporate processes, guides, rules, and practitioners.

Young females\\' arm shape has multiple nonlinear features. Since the initial threshold and weight are randomly selected, the single BP neural network is prone to the problems of unstable model and low accuracy when dealing with the complex nonlinear relationship of human body shape. The thought evolution algorithm is a global optimization algorithm, which can optimize the initial threshold and weight of BP neural network through multiple \"convergence\" and \"alienation\" operations, so as to improve the stability of the model and prediction accuracy. In order to quickly and accurately identify a young female arm shape, this paper constructs a MEA optimized BP neural network based arm shape recognition model for young females. Firstly, the arm data of 611 young women aged 18 -25 are obtained by [TC]2 3D body measurement, and the values of 14 measurement items are extracted. SPSS software is used to preprocess the data, and descriptive statistical analysis of the indicators is conducted. Secondly, through principal component factor analysis, five morphological factors affecting young female arm shape arc obtained, namely, arm circumference factor, arm root factor, arm root morphology factor, arm length factor and arm proportion factor. The characteristic factors corresponding to the maximum load of the five factors arc: upper arm circumference, root circumference, root flattening rate, whole arm length and upper arm length/forearm length, which arc selected and divided into five categories by two-step clustering method; long fat arm, middle arm, long thin arm and short flat arm, accounting for 17.4% , 30.7% , 22.4% and 29.5% , respectively. Finally, Matlab software is used to construct a young female arm body shape recognition model based on MEA-BP neural network. MEA optimizes the weight and threshold value of BP neural network, which promotes the learning process of the whole network and improved the stability and recognition accuracy of the model. The innovation of this paper is reflected in the research object and research method. Existing studies arc based on the subdivision and cross combination of typical indicators to obtain the complex arm shape, but there are a large number of body shape subdivisions, and there is a lack of studies on the overall classification and recognition of the arm shape. In this paper, it is an innovation to select the arm shape for the whole classification and recognition research. The MEA-BP neural network has a good application in satellite clock prediction, electric stealing identification, remote sensing image classification, soil nutrient grading evaluation and other fields.

The adoption of digital tools, if designed and implemented appropriately, can reduce the risks of corruption. Areas Covered: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an interdisciplinary systematic review of health/medicine, humanities/social sciences, engineering, and computer science literature, with the aims of identifying technologies used for pharmaceutical supply chain and procurement optimization and reviewing whether they address ACTA mechanisms to strengthen pharmaceutical governance. Our review identified four distinct categories of digital solutions: e-procurement and open contracting; track-and-trace technology; anti-counterfeiting technology; and blockchain technology. Expert Opinion: Findings demonstrate an increase in research of technologies to improve pharmaceutical supply chain and procurement functions; however, most technologies are not being leveraged to directly address ACTA or global health outcomes. Some blockchain and RFID technologies incorporated ACTA mechanisms and mentioned specific policy/governance frameworks, but more purposeful linkage is needed.

These innovations promise to afford rapid Internet connectivity, remote operations or predictive maintenance. As legacy critical infrastructures were traditionally disconnected from the Internet, the prospect of their modernisation necessitates an inquiry into cyber security and how it intersects with traditional engineering requirements like safety, reliability or resilience. Looking at how the adoption of big data technologies in critical infrastructures shapes understandings of risk management, we focus on a specific case study from the cyber security governance: the EU Network and Information Systems Security Directive. We argue that the implementation of Network and Information Systems Security Directive is the first step in the integration of safety and security through novel risk management practices. Therefore, it is the move towards legitimising the modernisation of critical infrastructures. But we also show that security risk management practices cannot be directly transplanted from the safety realm, as cyber security is grounded in anticipation of the future adversarial behaviours rather than the history of equipment failure rates. Our analysis offers several postulates for the emerging research agenda on big data in complex engineering systems. Building on the conceptualisations of safety and security grounded in the materialist literature across Science and Technology Studies and Organisational Sociology, we call for a better understanding of the ‘making of’ technologies, standardisation processes and engineering knowledge in a quest to build safe and secure critical infrastructures.', authkeywords='critical infrastructure | cyber security | expertise | materiality | risk | Safety', citedby_count=14, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr='UKRI', fund_no='EP/S035362/1', fund_sponsor='UK Research and Innovation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85133156699', doi='10.1007/978-3-031-06053-3_4', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on the Development of High-Tech Imported Jewelry Composite Media Creation', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Chen Y.J.', afid='60074388;60022716', affilname='Jinwen University of Science and Technology;National Taiwan University of Arts', affiliation_city='Taipei;Banchiao', affiliation_country='Taiwan;Taiwan', author_count='3', author_names='Chen, Yen Ju;Lin, Rungtai;Lin, Chih Long', author_ids='57772674200;7402887878;14054257000', author_afids='60074388-60022716;60022716;60022716', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)', issn='03029743', source_id='25674', eIssn='16113349', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='13314 LNCS', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='54-66', description='The 21st century belongs to the era of digital technology.

From 1979 to 2019, the land system had faced different problems in different historical periods. The reform of the rural land system, the improvement of land use laws, and the protection and management of land rights and farmland have been given attention in Chinese rural land management practice. The reform of and innovation in the rural land system have been remarkable achievements. Rural land circulation, transfer of agricultural land and land with construction, taking the protection of farmers’ interests as the basic criterion, have been institutionalized, which is not only conducive to the intensive management of the scale of agricultural activity, but also meets the farmers’ social security interests. Land resources’ utilization planning had adapted the balance sheet accounting of land resources and the assessment of land ecological conditions, deepening the research on carbon emissions from the perspective of land use. In rural areas, the goal of returning farmland to forests and grassland had been implemented and consolidated the achievements. The scientific management of farmland had been strengthened. Land use has shown evidence of innovations land use patterns, the construction of a land space planning system and furthering of village level planning.

Research about rural landscapes is currently at an early stage in China, but some risks are already noticeable in relation to the country's cultural landscapes. Rapid and dynamic urbanization has produced some negative impacts on rural landscapes in recent years. Planned investments usually interfere with the environment, sometimes extending to the liquidation of valuable green areas, which constitute a cultural heritage.

We further explored the influence that adopting four types of frame-breaking thinking—constructionist, dialectical, analogical, and exploratory thinking—might have on the way students conducted their projects. We proposed a framework systematically presenting the Janusian nature of innovative thinking, which could serve as an exemplar for designing innovation development courses for engineering students. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a qualitative study featuring theme analyses with theory-driven coding on data (including creative thinking manuals, term reports, and end-of-semester team interviews) collected from 21 students who took the class. We also administered a questionnaire to collect students’ opinions on the course and presented the results of their descriptive statistics. Findings/results Students’ mental calculations determine the meanings of the frames from the external press. Personal experiences on wellstructured problems could negatively influence the efficacy of solving ill-structured problems, at least at the beginning of the process. Using four types of frame-breaking thinking to perturb extant cognitive schema may produce the innovative tensions that breed creativity. In addition, descriptive statistics provide evidence for students' approvals on the course's methods and outcomes. Originality/value Exploring the nature of Janusian thinking in innovation by systematically investigating the nature of the three-layered frames and the impacts of the four types of frame-breaking thinking presents an analytical framework and a research angle new to the literature. Suggestions/implications Innovation development should be driven by systematic operations on diverse or opposing ideas in problem-solving situations rather than activities that manipulate ideas in context-free scenarios.\", authkeywords='Analogical thinking | Box-breaking thinking | Constructionist thinking | Creativity | Dialectical thinking | Engineering education | Exploratory thinking', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85132384932', doi='10.1109/ICSE-Companion55297.2022.9793731', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Lean Software Startup Practices and Software Engineering Education', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Cico O.', afid='60013141', affilname='Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet', affiliation_city='Trondheim', affiliation_country='Norway', author_count='1', author_names='Cico, Orges', author_ids='56429596800', author_afids='60013141', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering', issn='02705257', source_id='19242', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='281-285', description='In the modern economy, software drives innovation and economic growth. Studies show how software increasingly influences all industry sectors. Over the past 5 decades, software engineering has also changed significantly to advance the development of various types and scales of software products. Software engineering education plays an essential role in apprising students of software technologies, processes, and practices popular in industries. Furthermore, approaches to teaching software engineering are becoming more interdisciplinary and team-centered, comparable to startup contexts. In this PhD work, I want to answer the following research questions: (1) To what extent are software engineering trends present in software engineering education research? (2) What set of common software engineering practices employed in lean software startups is transferable to the software engineering education context? (3) What is the impact of lean startup practices on software engineering students and curricula? I utilize (1) a literature review, (2) mixed-methods approaches in gathering empirical evidence, and (3) design-based research. In the first phase of the research, I pinpoint the relevance of the lean startup in software engineering education through an extensive literature review. I gather empirical evidence on lean startup practices and assess their potential transferability to software engineering education during the second research phase. I demonstrate that the lean startup is an emerging trend in software engineering education research. I demonstrate that students can acquire soft, hard, and project management skills in a more realistic context in the introduction of the growth phase of lean startup practices throughout external course activities. I expect software engineering curricula to benefit from the model and framework that I propose and validate, thus facilitating lean startup practice transfer to software engineering curricula.', authkeywords='General and reference → Empirical studies | Social and professional topics → Software engineering education', citedby_count=1, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfree2read', freetoreadLabel='Bronze', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85132328629', doi='10.1155/2022/7011145', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='An Exploratory Study on the Design and Management Model of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Safety Traceability System Based on Blockchain Technology', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Li D.', afid='60121714;60028375;60016424;127647857', affilname='Shanghai Public Health clinical Center;Hebei University of Economics and Business;Beijing University of Chinese Medicine;Hebei Collaborative Innovation Center On Morality and Law-based Social Governance', affiliation_city='Shanghai;Shijiazhuang;Beijing;Shijiazhuang', affiliation_country='China;China;China;China', author_count='4', author_names='Li, Dacan;Gong, Yuanyuan;Zhang, Xianhui;Huang, Min', author_ids='55195442700;55195100500;57211377017;57752496800', author_afids='60028375-127647857;60028375;60016424;60121714', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Security and Communication Networks', issn='19390114', source_id='18000156707', eIssn='19390122', aggregationType='Journal', volume='2022', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='7011145', pageRange=None, description='Aiming at the problems of long life cycle complex roles of participants, diverse risk factors, poor supervision coverage and difficult information traceability of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) supply chain, this paper constructs a TCM quality safety traceability system based on blockchain technology by analyzing the business process and supervision characteristics of TCM supply chain.

The business unit Instrumentation and Test Systems (ITS) is focusing on the development, realization and manufacturing of high-precision measurement, development and test solutions for automotive components and systems. While the focus of in-house production at ITS is on assembly processes, manufacturing of the required components is mainly outsourced to external suppliers. With the foundation of the AVL Additive Manufacturing (AM) Initiative in 2017, manufacturing was partially in-sourced again. Since then, several activities have been conducted to successfully integrate AM as enabling technology. This paper presents how AM was methodically implemented and how AM contributes to the ITS value chain. For research and (pre-) development, Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) enables novel and innovative measurement concepts with advanced functionalities. Feasibility studies, including experimental results on key performance indicators, are described and the proof of concept is discussed. Going further, design departments benefit from rapid realization of prototypes with in-house AM production. Especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, long delivery times from external suppliers influence the development process. This paper shows how AM has contributed during this phase in terms of speed, innovation and costs but also the importance of relevant know-how to start an AM transformation. Besides rapid prototyping, the existing AM machines already produce 65 serial parts for AVL's measurement devices. First results show that not only delivery times were reduced by 80% but also substantial cost savings of up to 40% - compared to the external purchasing - could be achieved. With that in mind, the in-house AM production ecosystem will be further expanded to bring value and manufacturing know-how into the company.\", authkeywords='3D printing | Additive manufacturing | Measuring instruments | Product development | Production engineering', citedby_count=0, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85132274663', doi='10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.169', pii='S221282712200453X', pubmed_id=None, title='Industrial transformation and assembly technology: context and research trends', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Monetti F.M.', afid='60072562;60002014', affilname='University of Luxembourg;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)', affiliation_city='Esch-sur-Alzette;Stockholm', affiliation_country='Luxembourg;Sweden', author_count='3', author_names='Monetti, Fabio Marco;de Giorgio, Andrea;Maffei, Antonio', author_ids='57363090300;36767106400;35727255000', author_afids='60002014;60072562;60002014', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Procedia CIRP', issn='22128271', source_id='21100243809', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='107', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='1427-1432', description='The fourth industrial revolution is based on a few technological advancements that promise an industrial transformation based on achieving sharing and circular economies.

The European Commission has through the Blue Growth objectives for the first time highlighted marine sectors as unique market opportunities with high growth potential which carry socio-economic importance to the development of coastal regions. Particularly marine sectors such as aquaculture, marine robotics, and marine renewable energy which fulfil global needs in food safety and security, enable monitoring and exploration in harsh and remote conditions, and globally growing energy needs were recognized as catalysts to achieve sustainable development. Marine start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) were identified as potential drivers in emerging marine sectors. However, they require support mechanisms tailored to their needs as they are competing for the same business and financial support as land-based SMEs, yet the research and development infrastructure is more difficult to access.ProtoAtlantic, an Interreg Atlantic Area funded project, provided marine-specific support mechanisms to marine start-ups and SMEs in emerging sectors, including business support through the accelerator and mentorship programs, enabling companies to fast track their product development through access to prototyping and testing facilities in all partner regions. The Interreg Atlantic Area encompasses partner regions in France, Ireland, Portugal, Scotland, and Spain. The consortium partners consist of Technopôle Brest Iroise (Brest, France), University College Cork - UCC (Cork, Ireland), County Council Cork (Cork, Ireland), INESC TEC (Porto, Portugal), the European Marine Energy Centre - EMEC (Orkney, Scotland), EMERGE (Canary Islands, Spain), and the lead partner, Innovalia Association (Canary Islands, Spain). The strategic collaboration between the partners provided marine start-ups access to testing facilities in the Atlantic Ocean. The extreme living laboratories provided by EMEC, the LiR National Ocean Testing Facilities at UCC\\'s Centre of Marine and Renewable Energy (MaREI centre), and INESC TEC promise harsh real-life conditions which test the suitability of marine technologies to the limit thereby providing start-ups and SMEs with an extra layer of confidence in developing their technologies. This cross-regional collaboration puts the ProtoAltantic program in a unique position, as it is the first of its kind to dedicate marine-specific support to marine start-ups and SMEs which have benefited from the opportunities that ProtoAtlantic has provided.ProtoAtlantic developed a holistic model for the prototyping and exploitation of innovative ideas in emerging maritime sectors. After the identification of ideas from the research community, start-ups, and SMEs with product innovation capacity in the maritime sector, an acceleration program with a normed and structured process was implemented, thus creating a unique ecosystem in the Atlantic that is addressing a co-creation paradigm with the local European start-ups communities and all the stakeholders.', authkeywords='acceleration program | blue growth | prototyping | regional economic development sustainable development | sustainable blue economy', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='ERDF', fund_no='EAPA_303/2016', fund_sponsor='European Regional Development Fund'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85131695092', doi='10.1155/2022/7931417', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Construction of Virtual Simulation College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Platform Using Internet of Things Technology', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Wang X.', afid='60073731;60029306', affilname='Henan University of Chinese Medicine;Wuhan University', affiliation_city='Zhengzhou;Wuhan', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='2', author_names='Wang, Xiaorui;Li, Jiayu', author_ids='57734663400;57734282300', author_afids='60073731;60029306', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Mobile Information Systems', issn='1574017X', source_id='19700174653', eIssn='1875905X', aggregationType='Journal', volume='2022', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='7931417', pageRange=None, description=\"IoT technology originated from the third scientific and technological revolution, which refers to the connection of objects and networks through information sensor devices according to an agreed protocol.

In comparison, the manufacturing and production industries have been able to successfully integrate computer applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT) into their processes. As a result, their economic progression has received a significant uplift. Digitization and automation in the construction industry is a relatively young sector with a lot of opportunities for research and innovation. An excellent instrument for surveying resources and operations is a digital environment for monitoring the construction supply chain management framework (CSCM). For infrastructure projects, building information modeling and geographic information systems are strongly encouraged for improved productivity and better coordination. The convergence of BIM and GIS creates a complete digital representation of the physical environment. BIM may be used to produce, manage, and exchange operational data of building structures, whereas GIS could be used to handle the logistic aspect of the construction project and store, organize, and analyze data representing the horizontally spread urban environment. As a result, the unified utilization of BIM and GIS is crucial in Urban Sustainability applications that require data from both facilities and the urban environment. Because BIM has only been around for around ten years, and combined BIM and GIS applications have only been around for an even shorter time, there is no solid framework on the latter for individuals who are just getting started with BIM and GIS in Civil Engineering. Review and analysis of previous works are required to have a better grasp of the current condition and future direction of the budding discipline.

The challenge presented in our research, following of this paper results, is to correctly implement an intuitive category method (progressive type) to generate solutions, unifying individual proposals or ideas through virtual platform and real-time communication with software or applications. The objective of this first paper is to identify the implementation impact from the perspective of first-use perception, and experience segmented by study area and gender. Our research begins with the design of an idea generation method, from design professionals experience, various tools are integrated and run-in digital platforms. This method was called ICRI from the acronym in Spanish 'Ideacion, Categorizacion, Reagrupamiento, Ideación'. Subsequently, this method is applied in two university courses, one with students of design, art, urbanism, and the other course with students of chemical engineering. The application of the method was conducting through the MIRO platform and the communication by ZOOM for remote work. The method consists of two main stages, the initial stage is 4 steps where the students define, investigate, and establish findings, including team formation, to move on to a second stage. This second stage is composed by 4 steps where students generate ideas, review, define and group them, finally the final stage is composed by 5 steps to able to bring to a point of re-grouping, discussion, fusion and writing of new ideas. This method was applied to start a product design process or design strategy. The results revealed a high level of acceptance of the method, highlighting its practicality, rapidity, and functionality to generate ideas, as well as an active participation of the students in an equitable way. Also, the acceptance and perception of equity and equality of generation of ideas between gender was found, in addition to spotlight that no academic profile had a negative influence. The creation of the ICRI method is the consequence of the changes that have been created as a result of the need for virtuality for higher education.\", authkeywords='Design | Educational Innovation | Gender | Higher Education | Ideas', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85130472793', doi='10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766731', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Bringing the Industry Expertise to the Classroom for Enhancing Life-Long Learning', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Mounsef J.', afid='60113220', affilname='Rochester Institute of Technology Dubai', affiliation_city='Dubai', affiliation_country='United Arab Emirates', author_count='2', author_names='Mounsef, Jinane;Amer, Muhieddin', author_ids='36562285700;55763509800', author_afids='60113220;60113220', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON', issn='21659559', source_id='21100206205', eIssn='21659567', aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='2022-March', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='884-889', description='This paper presents a didactical concept in bringing the industrial perspective to the classroom through the innovation process adopted in the undergraduate curriculum.

These materials science developments have depended mainly on control of rigid chemical bonds, such as covalent and ionic bonds, in organic molecules and polymers, inorganic crystals and thin films. The recent discovery of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a novel approach to synthesizing materials by controlling their weak out-of-plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Artificial stacks of different types of 2D materials are a novel concept in materials synthesis, with the stacks not limited by rigid chemical bonds nor by lattice constants. This offers plenty of opportunities to explore new physics, chemistry, and engineering. An often-overlooked characteristic of vdW stacks is the well-defined 2D nanospace between the layers, which provides unique physical phenomena and a rich field for synthesis of novel materials. Applying the science of intercalation compounds to 2D materials provides new insights and expectations about the use of the vdW nanospace. We call this nascent field of science ‘2.5 dimensional (2.5D) materials,’ to acknowledge the important extra degree of freedom beyond 2D materials. 2.5D materials not only offer a new field of scientific research, but also contribute to the development of practical applications, and will lead to future social innovation.

Under the inevitable tide of the construction of the new liberal arts, the first step is to develop and promote the role and significance of design abreast of the time. When looking at design discipline from the perspective of interdisciplinary integration, we will find that the interweaving between it and the construction of new liberal arts cannot be ignored. For example, it is found in the film and television industry that design is ubiquitous. For example, the design of posters and scenes is closely related to design discipline. The meaning of the construction of new liberal arts lies in the newness of quality, that is, the newness of innovation. It is innovative to use various methods to broaden the vision of the discipline. Therefore, to eliminate people's doubts, the only way is to inherit fine tradition and take on new perspectives as mentioned in the new liberal arts manifesto. It is necessary to build different humanities and social sciences on the basis of human wisdom, its original intention and temperament, original regulations and original basic spirit. Innovation relies on this basis, and we should strive to infuse more fresh factors and fresh ideas into the discipline, so as to promote its expansion and present a new landscape and a new look. From perspectives of the new engineering, new agricultural, and new medical sciences, it is a discipline with rich technical contents. In fact, the design discipline can also be classified, and it must be combined with more interdisciplinary factors. Innovation has a special meaning. In conclusion, first of all, the training requirement of the new liberal arts is to look forward to cultivating humanistic scientists who can think and analyze. Design shouldbe aimed at the new liberal arts, and enable itself and the entire new liberal arts to design some requirements and rules on how to present a better landscape. Secondly, the new liberal arts strengthen the cross-combination and cross-reference of disciplines. Although it is not too difficult for the design discipline, it is necessary to excavate theoretical summaries and strengthen it. The design discipline itself is intertwined with engineering and art. At the same time, the design discipline can naturally obtain some elements from the construction of the new liberal arts. It absorbs multiple disciplines to make itself have a richer connotation and extension ambition. Design itself as the carrier of the close relationship between engineering and art needs a more rational framework to establish a close correlation with the new liberal arts. Third, the design or the artistic design of the new liberal arts is mainly aboutinheriting fine tradition and taking on new perspectives. If it includes design such as industrial design, product design, garden design, etc., it must be inseparable from the core of adapting to people. Design should meet people's spiritual and emotional needs, that is, practical but in line with the laws of beauty. Design is the embodiment of comprehensive literacy, a collection of interdisciplinary, and a flash of humanistic spirit. People engaged in the design discipline usually place their designs in specific categories and detailed design results. But for us, the reason why the design discipline is so huge and all-encompassing is that we see more in the design of society, even the design of concepts and the more subtle design in the development of the whole art. In other words, design should be regarded both as a microscopic concrete and a macro-level thinking about the entire conceptual form and creative presentation, regardless of material presentation, industrial design, or spiritual presentation. In other words, artistic design has a kind of macroscopic observation power. Therefore, sometimes we think that design seems to be a kind of thought and artistic perception of a person who is inclusive of all things in a certain green space, a certain garden, a certain piece of furniture, and a certain kind of landscape.\", authkeywords='art design | construction of new liberal arts | interdisciplinarity | to inherit fine tradition and take on new perspectives | to take to the future', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85129642721', doi='10.1007/978-3-031-04809-8_63', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='The Application of Artificial Intelligence in Organizational Innovation Management: Take the Autonomous Driving Technology of Tesla as an Example', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Huang G.', afid='60022414;100438043', affilname='Wuhan University of Technology;China Ship Development and Design Center', affiliation_city='Wuhan;Wuhan', affiliation_country='China;China', author_count='2', author_names='Huang, Gubo;Yu, Yan', author_ids='57671930600;57670406600', author_afids='100438043-60022414;60022414', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies', issn='23674512', source_id='21100975545', eIssn='23674520', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='135', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='690-697', description='Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most recent subfields of the young field of computer science, which is widely used in innovation management of organizations.

The industry is rapidly adopting different types of changes. The objective of the study was to determine if certain types of change are harder than others to successfully adopt and implement. An industry-wide approach was taken using an online survey methodology to collect more than 500 cases of organization-wide changes from AEC firms across the United States and Canada.

The results showed that successful adoption rates of different types of change were not significantly different for certain change types than the others.

As a way to lessen the software development and setup onto such complicated surroundings, high speed parallel programming languages exist which have to be encouraged by complex operating techniques. There are numerous advantages for consumers in terms of cost and flexibility that come with Cloud computing's anticipated uptake. Building on well-established research in Internet solutions, networks and utility computing, virtualization et cetera Service-Oriented Architectures and the Internet of Services (IoS) have implications for a wide range of technological issues such as parallel computing and load balancing as well as high availability and scalability. Effective load balancing methods are essential to solving these issues. Since such systems' size and complexity make it impossible to concentrate job execution on a few select servers, a parallel distributed solution is required. Adaptive task load model is the name of the method wesuggest in our article for balancing the workload (ATLM). We developed an adaptive parallel distributed computing paradigm as a result of this (ADPM). While still maintaining the model's integrity, ADPM employs a more flexible synchronization approach to cut down on the amount of time synchronous operations use. As well as the ATLM load balancing technique, which solves the straggler issue caused by the performance disparity between nodes, ADPM also applies it to ensure model correctness.

A recent ground-breaking report of UNESCO reveals that only 35% of STEM students in higher education are women who result in 28% of the STEM workforce across all the world’s researchers. Differences are observed much wider in the hard sciences like mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.\\xa0Other\\xa0international research also shows that women make up just 12–15% of all engineers around the world. However, a recent survey report by the Royal Academy of Engineering revealed that over 80% of female engineers are happy in their job and 98% of women engineers find their job rewarding. Despite these facts, most of the nations are losing potential women engineers at every stage of life, and it starts from a young age because of bias and misconceptions in media. There are societal, cultural, institutional factors, and belief systems which are impediments to women in STEM. Gender stereotypes are part of societal belief and govern the attitudes towards female and male roles, their occupations, and their perception of masculine and feminine work. There are many myths and stereotype in a society which push women back in engineering career like girls are bad in Mathematics, engineering is ‘too difficult’ and require physical strength. Divergent attitudes formed by girls and boys in childhood and systemic biases limit the range of career options and opportunities available to them in adulthood. This study engages with women engineers to record the impact of available myths, unconscious biases, stereotypes, ongoing policies & programs and compare the findings to unfold some of their struggles which is linked to retaining women in engineering professions.

The article analyzes the groups of factors influencing the life cycle of the building and the information models of building systems necessary for the analysis of their changes. It is shown that the genetic method of information modeling allows building systems to adequately and quickly reflect technological and organizational innovations and to increase the overall adaptive resource of the designed building. This will help to increase not only the innovative susceptibility of building subsystems and the adaptive resource of the building, but, as a result, to raise the efficiency of the entire life cycle of the building.', authkeywords='Adaptation resource | Construction project | Full life cycle | Information model | Innovative receptivity | Organizational-technological genesis', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85128720921', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='A Framework for Well-Being Integrated Development Environments (WIDEs): Research Preview', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Hassan S.', afid='60100434', affilname='Birmingham City University', affiliation_city='Birmingham', affiliation_country='United Kingdom', author_count='3', author_names='Hassan, Sara;Wilson, Andrew Sean;Galvin, John', author_ids='57037839300;14824312600;56735692200', author_afids='60100434;60100434;60100434', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='CEUR Workshop Proceedings', issn='16130073', source_id='21100218356', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Conference Proceeding', volume='3122', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='[Context and Motivation] To date there are very few approaches for systematic requirements modelling of software from a mental-well-being-awareness perspective.

Recently, the possibility of producing HA from harmless microorganisms appeared, which offers the opportunity to make HA more economical, without raw material limitations, and environmentally friendly. HA production is mainly reported with Lancefield Streptococci A and C, particularly from S. equi and S. zooepidemicus. Various modes of fermentation such as batch, repeated batch, fed-batch, and continuous culture have been investigated to optimize HA production, particularly from S. zooepidemicus, obtaining a HA yield of 2.5\\xa0g L−1–7.0\\xa0g L−1. Among the different utilized DSP approaches of HA production, recovery with cold ethanol (4°C) and cetylpyridinium chloride is the ideal strategy for lab-scale HA production.

Technological innovation in the context of a circular economy has become a factor of competitiveness, of success in national and European calls for projects, as well as a source of attractiveness for employees. A transition management is operating today in worldwide organisations from innovation intended to only provide additional economic incomes, to innovations that are willing to be sustainable by staying under the planetary boundaries limits and by satisfying some targeted societal needs. The term 'eco-innovation' is among the most cited design for sustainability methods associated with this transformation. The required paradigm shift is a new challenge that technology-intensive organisations must handle with the companies and industries included in this socio-technical system. Such a paradigm shift cannot be achieved without adapting the innovation processes. Moreover, the concept and implementation of eco-innovation remain unclear, lacks in the validation and the experimentation processes are frequent. The overall approach therefore needs to be supported by practical tools and methods for design engineers and applied researchers. This article provides feedback on a project collaboration between a large public-funded research organisation (CEA: Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission) and academic researchers from university (Grenoble Institute of Technology), with the aim of formalising an approach needed to conduct eco-innovation R&D projects. One of the levers in this perspective is the dissemination of applied knowledge (known-how) by providing training materials in order to make R&D engineers aware of the importance of innovation within the circular economy framework. This paper presents the process of development of such educational training conducted in a collaborative way. This training content has the ambition to empower engineers in developing a systemic vision and practical insights in four main topics: sustainability challenges, environmental impact assessment, circular economy vision, and eco-innovation methods.

The objective of this research is to better understand the predictive factors that lead to improved performance during concept generation. In particular, this work focuses on the impact of idea fluency and timing of early-stage design concepts and their effect on overall measures of ideation session success. To accomplish this, we leverage an existing large-scale dataset containing hundreds of early-stage design concepts; each concept contains detailed ratings regarding its overall feasibility, usefulness, and novelty, as well as when in the ideation session the idea was recorded. Surprisingly, results indicate that there is no effect of idea fluency or timing on the quality of the output when using a holistic evaluation mechanism, such as the innovation measure, instead of a single measure such as novelty. Thus, exceptional concepts can be achieved by all participant segments independent of idea fluency. Furthermore, in early-stage concept generation sessions, highest-rated concepts have an equal probability of occurring early and late in a session. Taken together, these findings can be used to improve performance in ideation by effectively determining when and which types of design interventions future design tools might suggest.', authkeywords='conceptual design | creativity and concept generation | design theory and methodology', citedby_count=8, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NSF', fund_no='DGE-1633740', fund_sponsor='National Science Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85127425910', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Tipping Point Leadership Theory to Improve Research Culture in Engineering Education', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Patil J.A.', afid='60104411', affilname='Rajarambapu Institute of Technology', affiliation_city='Urun Islampur', affiliation_country='India', author_count='2', author_names='Patil, Jayashre A.;Adamuthe, Amol C.', author_ids='59428895900;37062955200', author_afids='60104411;60104411', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Journal of Engineering Education Transformations', issn='23492473', source_id='21100890669', eIssn='23941707', aggregationType='Journal', volume='35', issueIdentifier='Special Issue 1', article_number=None, pageRange='227-233', description='—Indian government is aggressively promoting research culture in universities and institutes across nation.

Requirements engineering is one of the main challenges in the public procurement of innovative products. Nevertheless, there is little empirical research on public procurement, particularly managing requirements in the pre-tender dialogue phase between potential suppliers and problem owners. Question/Problem: This paper investigates the market dialogue phase of an innovation partnership project in Norway. We aim to understand critical factors of the dialogue phase that clarify and focus needs and requirements. This leads to the research question: How can we clarify and focus needs and requirements for a new solution in the market dialogue phase? Principal Ideas/Results: We have conducted a case study at a major Norwegian hospital. The objective of this innovation partnership is to make the emergency room in a Norwegian hospital more efficient. The case study illustrates how requirements have been developed by the joint effort of the procurement team, the active engagement of potential suppliers, and the learning and mutual trust between them. By discussing the vision and getting feedback on opportunities and limitations in existing and projected technologies, the procurement team has refined their ambition and focused on the core of the innovation.

The South African National Space Agency (SANSA) was established in 2008 and opened its doors to serve humanity on April 1, 2011. SANSA absorbed the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Satellite Applications Centre (SAC) and the National Research Foundation (NRF) Hermanus Magnetic Observatory (HMO). Two SANSA divisions, Space Operations, and Earth Observation (EO), were created from CSIR SAC at Hartebeeshoek (HBK) and Pretoria, respectively. The SANSA 2015–2020 Strategy identified strategic goal 3 to develop national human capacity and ensure transformation of the South African space sector. SANSA’s EO established the Science Advancement Services (SAS) unit in January 2013 in order to develop and implement the National Space Awareness Programme (NSAP) to stimulate youth interest in science. The DSI established the Science Engagement Strategy (SES) in January 2015 to develop the national science engagement programme. The SANSA NSAP is aligned to the DSI SES objectives. This paper reflects on the national achievements of the SANSA EO SAS NSAP spanning the period of 2013–2014 to 2019–2020. The paper reflects on the impact of the DSI SES on the SANSA EO SAS NSAP activities, the achievement of national footprint during National Science Week 2019, and the importance of developing youth entrepreneurial mindset in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Last, this paper showcases the alternative approach for sustainable space awareness in the 52 districts of South Africa and the Human Capital Development Pipeline Model that forms the connecting bridge between learners in the school system and the professionals in the space industry.', authkeywords='Awareness | Empowerment | Engagement | Science | Space | Youth', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NRF', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='National Research Foundation'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85127070317', doi='10.1007/978-3-030-94628-9_8', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Designing a Console for Future Space Operations', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Seidel A.G.', afid='60001439', affilname='Pennsylvania State University', affiliation_city='University Park', affiliation_country='United States', author_count='1', author_names='Seidel, Alexander Gerald', author_ids='57551913800', author_afids='60001439', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Springer Aerospace Technology', issn='18691730', source_id='21101039061', eIssn='18691749', aggregationType='Book Series', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='187-198', description='The launch of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Demo-2 Capsule generated a wave of new technology and inspiration for innovation within the space industry, especially in function and design. One major difference observed by those that watched the launch was the prominent use of a touch screen console. The question this research addresses: are touch screen consoles superior to those that use mechanical switches and controls? With implementing new technology, concerns have been made about both the safety of the new design and its efficiency. Through the utilization of journal articles and public information released by space agencies, this research focuses in survey of current and past console design through an industrial engineering lens. As there are many factors to consider that are atypical to traditional touch screen when considered for use in a spacecraft including g-forces, vibrations, redundancy requirements and user traditionally wearing multi-layer protective equipment, many aspects of the usefulness were evaluated. Additionally, assumptions about current technological advancements like autonomous navigation are considered being a part of the ultimate spacecraft system. Recommendations on how the console design should be conducted in the future are included in this paper. Ultimately, it is determined that a hybrid solution would be the best path for a dual-fault tolerant system. This would allow for the infusion of technology, enabling a more diverse space traveler, while prioritizing safety in this path of exploration and operations.', authkeywords='Commercial spaceflight | Console design | Mechanical consoles | NASA | Touch screens consoles', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='NASA', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='National Aeronautics and Space Administration'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85127026708', doi='10.1007/978-981-16-9272-7_57', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Corporate Exhibitions and Marketing as a Result of the Integration Project at the University of Cundinamarca', subtype='cp', subtypeDescription='Conference Paper', creator='Castillo E.N.R.', afid='60160789;60113747;60104175;60104009', affilname='Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja - UNIR;Universidad de Cundinamarca;International University of La Rioja;Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas', affiliation_city='Bogota;Fusagasuga;Logrono;Bogota', affiliation_country='Colombia;Colombia;Spain;Colombia', author_count='6', author_names='Castillo, Elber Nicolás Ramírez;Montenegro-Marin, Franklin Guillermo;Farfán, Luis Ignacio López;Rubiano, Érica Fausiya Lancheros;Montenegro-Marin, Carlos Enrique;Crespo, Rubén Arístides González', author_ids='57549602200;57215501434;57549992000;57550383100;54924464100;57221209077', author_afids='60113747;60113747;60113747;60113747;60104009-60160789;60104175', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies', issn='21903018', source_id='21100204111', eIssn='21903026', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='280', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='685-695', description='The academic spaces united with marketing are developed in research processes, centers of creation and innovation by the student body of the University of Cundinamarca, generating strategic learning projects, building forms of access to knowledge, practice, the implementation of better changing environments, the integration of different disciplines, engineering topics and also greater participation and development of individual and group skills, both at work and professional level, as well as the use of technological tools, driven by the benefits of marketing to approach a variable public, with constructivist challenges of business ideals through communication, positioning, having a history in virtuality, where live interaction is becoming increasingly common, changing the space of the classroom, virtual, to a connectivity in remote time, preserving the material of all industrial samples, which have been part of the integrating project semester by semester, becoming resources of foundation and strengthening for future generations aimed at engineering interest.', authkeywords='Collaborative learning | Competencies | Entrepreneurship | Integrative project | Marketing', citedby_count=0, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85127026212', doi=None, pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='28th International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality, REFSQ 2022', subtype='cr', subtypeDescription='Conference Review', creator=None, afid=None, affilname=None, affiliation_city=None, affiliation_country=None, author_count=None, author_names=None, author_ids=None, author_afids=None, coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)', issn='03029743', source_id='25674', eIssn='16113349', aggregationType='Book Series', volume='13216 LNCS', issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange=None, description='The proceedings contain 19 papers.

They are potentially well suited to address key challenges, being as they are knowledge and talent ‘factories’. Beyond their educational mission, HEIs are particularly well placed to convene other actors as well as enable the conscious collision of disciplines in pursuit of solutions. However, academic programs that ostensibly focus on sustainability are in fact too narrow in scope and can stand isolated. The academic custom disciplinary and organizational silos can also exacerbate the intellectual and structural difficulties to fuller immersion in sustainability by the academy. Using a case-study approach, we examine an academic innovation (Master’s Program in Strategies and Technologies for Development), and a structural innovation (Innovation and Technology for Development Centre, itdUPM), two discrete change agency initiatives at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Going on to explore the interactions between the Master’s and itdUPM, the case identifies how the latter structural innovation as a supporting structure enables the development of transformational sustainability at the university-level, generating longterm societal impacts through a transformative learning. Our findings suggest that pan-institutional inter-disciplinary sustainability-oriented programs may serve as a powerful lever for HEIs to contribute to sustainability challenges, representing vehicles for effecting change within an institutional context. Nevertheless, academic innovation is considered a necessary condition, but is not sufficient alone. The case shows that the innovation processes must go beyond the borders of educational programs to promote changes in the internal structure of universities and new multi-stakeholder ecosystems. They may furnish learning and research opportunities for students and staff, and income generating activities for universities.

diagnostics, and to discover and test novel preventive and curative therapies, all of which warrant experimental models that recapitulate human disease. The translation of basic science results to clinical practice is a challenging task, in particular for complex conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, which often result from multiple risk factors and comorbidities. This difficulty might lead some individuals to question the value of animal research, citing the translational 'valley of death', which largely reflects the fact that studies in rodents are difficult to translate to humans. This is also influenced by the fact that new, human-derived in vitro models can recapitulate aspects of disease processes. However, it would be a mistake to think that animal models do not represent a vital step in the translational pathway as they do provide important pathophysiological insights into disease mechanisms particularly on an organ and systemic level. While stem cell-derived human models have the potential to become key in testing toxicity and effectiveness of new drugs, we need to be realistic, and carefully validate all new human-like disease models. In this position paper, we highlight recent advances in trying to reduce the number of animals for cardiovascular research ranging from stem cell-derived models to in situ modelling of heart properties, bioinformatic models based on large datasets, and state-of-the-art animal models, which show clinically relevant characteristics observed in patients with a cardiovascular disease. We aim to provide a guide to help researchers in their experimental design to translate bench findings to clinical routine taking the replacement, reduction, and refinement (3R) as a guiding concept.\", authkeywords='Big data | Bioinformatics | Cardiovascular disease | Comorbidities | iPSC | Multiomics | Network medicine | Tissue engineering', citedby_count=37, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryam', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr='NIH', fund_no='2016T092', fund_sponsor='National Institutes of Health'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85126428441', doi='10.1007/978-3-030-86499-6_7', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Developing Projects for Realizing of the Program “Skopje 2020 Smart Strategy” by Enhancing Citizen Approach, Engineering, Digitalization, and Sensing of the City District Toward Smarter Sustainability Urban Potential in the Small Ring of Skopje', subtype='ch', subtypeDescription='Book Chapter', creator='Sofeska E.', afid='121192839', affilname='Cosmo Innovative Center', affiliation_city='Skopje', affiliation_country='North Macedonia', author_count='2', author_names='Sofeska, Emilija;Sofeski, Edward', author_ids='57203485775;57489831700', author_afids='121192839;121192839', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Advances in Science, Technology and Innovation', issn='25228714', source_id='21101032300', eIssn='25228722', aggregationType='Book Series', volume=None, issueIdentifier=None, article_number=None, pageRange='69-84', description='We live in a world of changes and nowadays our sustainable future becomes our sustainable present.

Not a day goes by without news of how data-centric engineering, algorithm-driven modelling, and biocyber technologies - including the convergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, automated robotics, quantum computing, and genome editing - will change our world. If we are to be better at expecting the unexpected in the world of wine, we need to gain deeper insights into the potential and limitations of these technological developments and advances along with their promise and perils. This article anticipates how these fast-expanding bioinformational and biodesign toolkits might lead to the creation of synthetic organisms and model systems, and ultimately new understandings of biological complexities could be achieved. A total of four future frontiers in wine yeast research are discussed in this article: the construction of fully synthetic yeast genomes, including minimal genomes; supernumerary pan-genome neochromosomes; synthetic metagenomes; and synthetic yeast communities. These four concepts are at varying stages of development with plenty of technological pitfalls to overcome before such model chromosomes, genomes, strains, and yeast communities could illuminate some of the ill-understood aspects of yeast resilience, fermentation performance, flavour biosynthesis, and ecological interactions in vineyard and winery settings. From a winemaker's perspective, some of these ideas might be considered as far-fetched and, as such, tempting to ignore. However, synthetic biologists know that by exploring these futuristic concepts in the laboratory could well forge new research frontiers to deepen our understanding of the complexities of consistently producing fine wines with different fermentation processes from distinctive viticultural terroirs. As the saying goes in the disruptive technology industry, it take years to create an overnight success. The purpose of this article is neither to glorify any of these concepts as a panacea to all ills nor to crucify them as a danger to winemaking traditions. Rather, this article suggests that these proposed research endeavours deserve due consideration because they are likely to cast new light on the genetic blind spots of wine yeasts, and how they interact as communities in vineyards and wineries. Future-focussed research is, of course, designed to be subject to revision as new data and technologies become available. Successful dislodging of old paradigms with transformative innovations will require open-mindedness and pragmatism, not dogmatism - and this can make for a catch-22 situation in an archetypal traditional industry, such as the wine industry, with its rich territorial and socio-cultural connotations.\", authkeywords='minimal genome | pan-genome | Saccharomyces cerevisiae | supernumerary neochromosome | synthetic communities | synthetic genome | wine yeast', citedby_count=2, openaccess=1, freetoread='repositoryvor', freetoreadLabel='Green', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85126370397', doi='10.1155/2022/3076250', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on the Mechanism of the Role of Innovation-Influencing Factors on the Performance of Construction Projects', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Wang S.', afid='60032758', affilname='Liaoning Technical University', affiliation_city='Fuxin', affiliation_country='China', author_count='2', author_names='Wang, Shiming;Li, Caiyun', author_ids='58251542600;57487926700', author_afids='60032758;60032758', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Advances in Civil Engineering', issn='16878086', source_id='19900191852', eIssn='16878094', aggregationType='Journal', volume='2022', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='3076250', pageRange=None, description='At present, innovation has gradually become an inevitable trend of the digital transformation and competitive advantage of enterprises in the construction industry.

However, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still do not know how to effectively realize business model innovation. Exploring the factors affecting the realization of business model innovation or the effective path to promote business model innovation in SMEs has become a hot topic of research. Exogenous growth theory points out that network ties have become an important way for SMEs to obtain external resources and promote enterprise growth. However, the existing research ignores the impact of network ties on the SMEs' business model innovation. Focusing on this theoretical gap, this study constructs a 'network ties - business model innovation - enterprise growth' model to explore the influence mechanism of five network ties of SMEs: customer ties, supplier ties, competitor ties, political ties, and knowledge ties on business model innovation and enterprise growth. Based on a questionnaire survey of 234 SMEs in Chengdu, China, the research hypothesis was tested using PLS-SEM and fsQCA. The PLS-SME results show that the customers, suppliers, competitors, and knowledge ties of SMEs have a significant positive effect on business model innovation, and business model innovation has a significant positive effect on enterprise growth. In addition, business model innovation plays a mediating role between supplier ties, competitor ties, knowledge ties, and enterprise growth. The fsQCA results show that three paths lead to high-level business model innovation of SMEs, among which customer ties, supplier ties, competition ties, and knowledge ties are the necessary conditions, and three paths lead to high-level growth of SMEs, among which business model innovation is the most core necessary condition.

Such policies challenge deeply rooted institutional norms and structures in the construction industry and research shows that they are being championed by a small and largely undefined group of social procurement professionals who suffer significant role conflict and ambiguity. Contributing new insights to this nascent research, this paper traces etymological definitions of champion roles, merging them with organisational theory to present a new typology of social procurement champions in the construction industry. Drawing on a thematic analysis of snowballed interviews with fifteen recognised champions of social procurement in the Australian construction industry, findings highlight four distinct types of social procurement champion: champions of organisations; champions of the concept; champions of people; and champions of a solution. It is found that there is no one pure type of social procurement champion. Rather, champions have to adapt their social procurement roles to the highly dynamic and varied organisation contexts in which they operate. These findings advance the emerging social procurement debate within and outside construction by highlighting the many different roles which are needed to implement social innovations like social procurement into a project-based industry like construction. It is concluded that organisations which see this as one person’s responsibility are likely to fail in implementing these new policy reforms.', authkeywords='champions | corporate social responsibility | professionals | Social innovation | social procurement | social value', citedby_count=9, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85125816862', doi='10.1155/2022/4973875', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Research on Innovative Design of Product Packaging Based on Big Data Technology', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Gan F.', afid='60189642;60000906;127807558', affilname='Guangxi Normal University for Nationalities;Universiti Sains Malaysia;Ltd', affiliation_city='Chongzuo;Minden;Shenzhen', affiliation_country='China;Malaysia;China', author_count='3', author_names='Gan, Fang;Romainoor, Nurul Hanim;Guo, Zhimin', author_ids='57478182700;57221384346;57477419300', author_afids='60000906-60189642;60000906;127807558', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Scientific Programming', issn='10589244', source_id='19926', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='2022', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='4973875', pageRange=None, description=\"Traditional product packaging design mainly relies on the designer's personal experience and intuition, but there are problems such as uncontrollable content and lack of knowledge and guidance in the field of product design. With the development of big data technology, product packaging design in the era of big data is carried out under the support of a large amount of real data, which has high predictability, success rate, and short development cycle. Compared with structured data, unstructured data such as text, images, and audio has a higher value. Among them, text big data and image big data have good application prospects in the field of product packaging design due to their easy data acquisition, mature processing technology, and simple operation. This paper proposes a combination of big data technology and neural style transfer model and proposes an innovative design method for product packaging that can generate high-quality images and controllable content. First, the perceptual engineering theory is used to obtain user needs, to build a mapping model between product modeling elements and product semantics, and to guide the selection of product semantics and style maps; second, use neural style transfer models to reconstruct and combine the color features of style maps. After the integration, it migrated to product packaging design, based on big data product packaging innovation design methods, and developed a product innovation design auxiliary prototype system based on actual needs to improve the company's R&D and innovation capabilities, shorten product development cycles, and reduce R&D costs.

Data mining is a technique to find its regularity from a large amount of data by analyzing each data. It mainly includes three steps: data preparation, regularity search, and regularity representation. Data preparation is to select the required data from relevant data sources and integrate them into a data set for data mining; regular search is to find out the regularity contained in the data set by a certain method; regular expression is to be as user-readable as possible. The way of understanding (such as visualization) will represent the found patterns. This research mainly discusses the improvement of teaching mode based on digital twin-based education big data mining. Through the research on the basic principles of data mining and digital twin technology, the student evaluation tool module based on digital twin and the relevant data analysis tool module of students based on digital twin education big data mining are developed. Data mining is carried out from the data of student performance, personal basic information, and evaluation information to find the correlation between various factors, find the hidden laws, and provide support for teaching decision-making. This paper also solves the problem of frequent communication with remote databases according to the characteristics of the database data required by students and improves the efficiency and scalability of education big data mining technology based on digital twins. The goal of the virtual interactive system of the digital twin-based CNC platform is to have both three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control functions based on a three-dimensional virtual CNC panel. This research integrates the three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control of the virtual interactive system, analyzes the system operation process, develops the system interface, and improves the system sub-functions; it builds an experimental environment, conducts example tests on various functions of the digital twin platform virtual interactive system, and performs virtual interactions system performance indicators are analyzed. 60% of students believe that their innovation ability has been improved after the implementation of the digital twin teaching model; 50% of students believe that their self-evaluation ability has been improved.

Many big data technologies and wireless sensor technologies have brought new changes to people's lives. At present, the functions of communication technology and network transmission have moved from perfection to new innovation and development. 5G mobile network technology has played an important role in various fields. When China's economy and science and technology develop better and better, people pay more and more attention to children's education. The research on children's education has become a hot topic. From the above background, this paper studies the network transmission function and network transmission path of children's education app in 5G era mobile computing technology. First, starting from the development trend and main functions of 5G, this paper briefly describes the functional requirements of children's education app. The efficient data transmission in the 5G mobile wireless sensor network is applied to children's education app. Starting from the distance of network transmission nodes, the data transmission optimization algorithm is adopted, and the network transmission module is composed of the best transmission path of nodes. Combined with the energy-saving effect of mobile computing technology, the problem of excessive consumption of network transmission resources is optimized. Finally, the data transmission path is studied in the 5G mobile network. The results show that 5G mobile computing technology can optimize the network transmission performance, improve the operation efficiency of the server, and has a good effect in solving the problems of delay and low coverage. In the process of children's education app network transmission under 5G mobile computing technology, it can ensure the user's personal information and improve the security of system feedback.\", authkeywords=None, citedby_count=0, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherfullgold', freetoreadLabel='Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85125127887', doi='10.13225/j.cnki.jccs.YG21.1616', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Strategic value and choice on construction of large CMG industry in China', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Qin Y.', afid='60073460', affilname='China University of Mining and Technology', affiliation_city='Xuzhou', affiliation_country='China', author_count='3', author_names='Qin, Yong;Shen, Jian;Shi, Ru', author_ids='55684698100;55726243100;57473890000', author_afids='60073460;60073460;60073460', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='January 2022', publicationName='Meitan Xuebao/Journal of the China Coal Society', issn='02539993', source_id='16430', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='47', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='371-387', description='China is very rich in coal measure gas (CMG) resources. Although the CMG industry has been developed for more than 30 years, the production from surface wells only accounts for 3.07% of the total national natural gas production in 2020, which scale is not satisfactory. To overcome the dilemma, the Chinese Academy of Engineering organized a strategic discussion on the effective CGM development for building a large industry. The authors in this paper look at a broader field, consider other types of natural gas in coal measures, demonstrate the strategic value and possibility of building a large CMG industry in China, deliberate the current difficulties and challenges, and put forward some suggestions on the choice of technical strategy and the improvement of guarantee conditions to overcome the dilemma. By analogy with the development process of coalbed methane (CBM) industry in the United States, it is considered that the formation of a large CMG industry is marked by two aspects, i.e., the annual production of more than 30 billion cubic meters and the contribution of more than 4.5% to the total annual production of natural gas in China. The development of a large CMG industry has three strategic values. Firstly, the large industry is one of the cornerstones of national natural gas security. Secondly, the effective CMG development will continue to help the healthy development of China\\'s main energy industry. Thirdly, the large-scale development and utilization of CMG will help the favorable realization of the national \"double carbon\" goal. China has a feasible foundation for building a large CMG industry, including a strong national demand, a great potential in CMG resources, implemented solid industrial layout and broad scientific and technological basis. China still faces five difficulties and challenges in realizing an effective CMG development and then building a large industry, i.e., losing patience in the industry, the single well production that has still not been doubled overall, the insufficient attention to the utilization rate of proved CBM reserves, the insufficient efforts to explore new fields and new directions, and the separately set mining rights for different types of CMG. The analysis shows that the development of applicable technology is the only way to extract CMG resources under different geological conditions in China with high efficiency and low cost, and the mechanism innovation is the guarantee basis for the rapid development of the industry. It is suggested to continuously tackle key technologies in five aspects, including the low-cost and efficient gas extraction in underground coal mines, the reserves and production enhancement of CBM wells in old areas, the evaluation and development of high-quality deep CMG reservoirs, the exploration and orderly development of thin interbedded CMG resources, and the UCG (underground coal gasification)-CMG combined mining. It is considered that the key to the construction of guarantee conditions lies in two aspects:firstly, continuously implements the national major scientific and technological plan of CMG to promote the formation of the large industry as soon as possible; secondly, tries the integration of CMG mining rights to stimulate the maximum release of CMG resources potential. The relevant understandings and suggestions in this paper may provide reference for strategy formulation and scientific and technological research in the industry.', authkeywords='Challenge | Coal measure gas | Coalbed methane | Effective development | Industrial development | Strategic thinking', citedby_count=99, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85124835674', doi='10.1080/15228835.2022.2036298', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Leveraging App Technology to Measure the Impact of Transportation Disadvantage: The Development of MyAmble', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Fields N.L.', afid='60137461;60018475;60015574;60003467;127727895;127727642', affilname='University of Texas at Arlington College of Engineering;Bowling Green State University;The University of Tennessee, Knoxville;The University of Texas at Arlington;Thryve;Presidio', affiliation_city='Arlington;Bowling Green;Knoxville;Arlington;Dallas;New York', affiliation_country='United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States', author_count='7', author_names='Fields, Noelle L.;Cronley, Courtney;Mattingly, Stephen P.;Miller, Vivian J.;Ramezanpour Nargesi, Saeed Reza;Bharmal, Ebrahim I.;Chace, Moriah', author_ids='36994618800;35301774100;16033300500;57611636900;57214881238;57457717500;57457439400', author_afids='60003467;60015574;60137461;60018475;60137461;127727642;127727895', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='2022', publicationName='Journal of Technology in Human Services', issn='15228835', source_id='19421', eIssn='15228991', aggregationType='Journal', volume='40', issueIdentifier='2', article_number=None, pageRange='157-180', description='Widely used data-collection methods fail to fully capture the lived experiences and un-met travel demands of marginalized populations and those at disproportionate risk of experiencing transportation disadvantage (TD).

In Kazan, there are two distinct cultures: Tatar which is predominantly Muslim and European Russian which is predominantly Orthodox. This situation offers an excellent opportunity to study these questions. Student teams were formed around projects according to their area of interest.

In the Anthropocene, the process of planetary urbanization continues to affect the health of the natural and social environment, and the future of cities has a profound impact on the future of mankind. The concept of Future Cities is based on the scrutiny of the urban evolution process in human history. Future Cities are different from agricultural cities as the containers of human settlement and industrial cities as the center of production. Based on interdisciplinary and rational thinking, research on Future Cities aims to establish a way toward humanity\\'s well-being and sustainable development. From the perspective of a system of systems, Future Cities cannot be regarded as a single system as is usual. They are a much more complex system involving many systems, and this concept needs to be understood and interpreted through systems thinking. The driving force for the change is the information revolution, which has changed the carrier of information from entity to data. Thus, information as a medium has improved its operational efficiency and strengthened the interaction and interoperation between the systems in Future Cities, which emphasizes \"systemhood\" than \"thinghood\", and triggers the formation of a system of systems. When data-based information penetrates the urban space, the \"information space\" emerges, and Future Cities become a combination of physical-information-social space. The \"information space\" also opens a new dimension for systems and people in Future Cities. As for systems, technological inventions take place in the process of digitization and informatization, including human settlement systems, energy systems, traffic systems, health systems, and environmental systems. With regard to individuals, a human being becomes \"human being + information terminals\", which in turn gives birth to new lifestyles and brings social innovation. Furthermore, because of the flow of information, the boundaries of different systems will blur and the gap between the systems and inhabitants will be bridged, and the well-being of humankind can be guaranteed through the precise matching of supply and demand. The creation of Future Cities requires not only bottom-up strength and self-organization but also top-down guidance and effective regulation. Urban problems need to be solved in stages from the aspects of technology invention and social innovation. When Future Cities revolve around the people themselves, people\\'s creation of the city will return to normal life, enhancing the sense of happiness and belonging. How to stimulate the vitality of people\\'s creativity, form a cooperative power distribution mechanism, and improve the city\\'s ability to self-organize and operate will be important issues for future urban society. Future Cities research is a combination of theory and practice, which should adapt to the characteristics of a system of systems. Based on the practical experience of urban strategic planning and system engineering, the research can form an \"overall strategic group\" for the design of the system of systems, to make full use of multidisciplinary advantages and diversified perspectives. The integration of future urban research will be an iterative process of resolving conflicts; this integration requires a long-term cycle of four main steps, including reaching consensus on basic concepts, revealing the formation mechanism, refining the characteristics of different systems, and integrating the system of systems. In conclusion, the concept of Future Cities explores how the city meets people\\'s needs for a better life. Against the backdrop of the information revolution, it is urgent to discard reductionist thinking, use systems thinking to understand the future city instead, plan and build Future Cities through continuous iterative practice, and realize the sustainable development of mankind.', authkeywords='Future Cities | System of systems | Systems thinking | Urban planning', citedby_count=3, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85123285599', doi='10.3390/buildings12010032', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Seismic Design of Bolted Connections in Steel Structures—A Critical Assessment of Practice and Research', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Ribeiro T.', afid='60011576;60008088;60001002;101716828', affilname='Università degli Studi di Messina;Universidade de São Paulo;Universidade da Beira Interior;Tal Projecto Lda', affiliation_city='Messina;Sao Paulo;Covilha;Lisbon', affiliation_country='Italy;Brazil;Portugal;Portugal', author_count='4', author_names='Ribeiro, Tiago;Bernardo, Luís;Carrazedo, Ricardo;De Domenico, Dario', author_ids='57206671161;8070435300;57195694957;54415516300', author_afids='101716828-60001002;60001002;60008088;60011576', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='January 2022', publicationName='Buildings', issn=None, source_id='26980', eIssn='20755309', aggregationType='Journal', volume='12', issueIdentifier='1', article_number='32', pageRange=None, description='The importance of connections in steel structures is paramount, not only because it greatly influences the cost of construction and provides room for innovations, but also due to the connections’ impact on global structural behaviour.

Materials and Methods: A search of PubMed database was performed, using the search terms \"vaginal microbiome\"with \"treatment,\"\"diagnosis,\"and \"research.\"Full article texts were reviewed. Reference lists were screened for additional articles. Results: The currently available approaches for treating vaginitis or attempting to modulate the VMB are often insufficient. It has traditionally relied on the use of antibiotics, antiseptics, and antifungals. The fifth and last article of this series discusses the new and/or alternative therapeutic modalities. It addresses the role of probiotics, prebiotics and symbiotics, activated charcoal, biofilm disrupting agents, acidifying agents, phage therapy, and the concept of vaginal microbiome transplant. The challenges facing the research of VMB, including the clinical impact of microbiome manipulation, classification, and new diagnostic approaches are discussed. Conclusions: Microbiome research has grown dramatically in recent years, motivated by innovations in technology and decrease in analysis costs. This research has yielded huge insight into the nature of microbial communities, their interactions, and effects with their hosts and other microbes. Further understanding of the bacterial, fungal, phage, and viral microbiomes in combination with host genetics, immunologic status, and environmental factors is needed to better understand and provide personalized medical diagnostics and interventions to improve women\\'s health.', authkeywords='future research | pH modifying agents | phage therapy | prebiotics | probiotics | vaginal microbiome | vaginal microbiome transplantation', citedby_count=17, openaccess=1, freetoread='publisherhybridgold', freetoreadLabel='Hybrid Gold', fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85122806484', doi='10.2337/db21-0777', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Heterogeneity of Diabetes: b-Cells, Phenotypes, and Precision Medicine: Proceedings of an International Symposium of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes and the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Cefalu W.T.', afid='60085584;60028706;60021600;60019991;60016849;60014468;60010884;60010365;60008667;60008438', affilname=\"SickKids Research Institute;Canadian Institutes of Health Research;University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine;Toronto General Hospital Research Institute;University of Toronto;University Health Network;Western University;The University of British Columbia;BC\\u200b Children\\u200b'\\u200b\\u200bs Hospital;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\", affiliation_city='Toronto;Ottawa;Toronto;Toronto;Toronto;Toronto;London;Vancouver;Vancouver;Bethesda', affiliation_country='Canada;Canada;Canada;Canada;Canada;Canada;Canada;Canada;Canada;United States', author_count='8', author_names='Cefalu, William T.;Andersen, Dana K.;Arreaza-Rubın, Guillermo;Pin, Christopher L.;Sato, Sheryl;Verchere, C.

This qualitative study analyses the current patent systems in key jurisdictions, particularly, the U.S. and the EU, and their applicability, as well as effectiveness, in the context of 3D bioprinting. The study argues that the main reason for the apathy of existing patent systems towards bio-inventions is that they were designed to deal with mechanical inventions.

Recent research has led to rapid improvement in all performance parameters of OPDs, which are now on-par or better than their inorganic counterparts, such as silicon or indium gallium arsenide photodetectors, in several aspects. In particular, it is possible to directly design OPDs for specific wavelengths. This makes expensive and bulky optical filters obsolete and allows for miniature detector devices. In this review, recent progress of such narrowband OPDs is systematically summarized covering all aspects from narrow-photo-absorbing materials to device architecture engineering. The recent challenges for narrowband OPDs, like achieving high responsivity, low dark current, high response speed, and good dynamic range are carefully addressed. Finally, application demonstrations covering broadband and narrowband OPDs are discussed.

Combining load-bearing with energy storage capabilities to create multifunctional structural batteries is a promising way to minimize the detrimental impact of battery weight on the aircraft. However, despite the various concepts developed in recent years, their viability has been demonstrated mostly at the material or coupon level, leaving many open questions concerning their applicability to structural elements of a relevant size for implementation into the airframe. This review aims at providing an overview of recent approaches for structural batteries, assessing their multifunctional performance, and identifying gaps in technology development toward their introduction for commercial aeronautic applications. The main areas where substantial progress needs to be achieved are materials, for better energy storage capabilities; structural integration and aircraft design, for optimizing the mechanical-electrical performance and lifetime; aeronautically compatible manufacturing techniques; and the testing and monitoring of multifunctional structures.

The results of the structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS showed that technopreneurial self-efficacy had a positive and significant impact on technopreneurial intentions. Academic self-efficacy had both a direct and indirect positive effect on technopreneurial intention. The indirect effect occurred through increased technopreneurial self-efficacy. Innate innovativeness had a direct effect on technopreneurial intentions, but it did not have a significant indirect effect through technopreneurship self-efficacy as was initially hypothesized.

This study aimed to identify risk factors for post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the characteristics of post-vaccination illness. Methods: This prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study used self-reported data (eg, on demographics, geographical location, health risk factors, and COVID-19 test results, symptoms, and vaccinations) from UK-based, adult (≥18 years) users of the COVID Symptom Study mobile phone app. For the risk factor analysis, cases had received a first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021; had either a positive COVID-19 test at least 14 days after their first vaccination (but before their second; cases 1) or a positive test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (cases 2); and had no positive test before vaccination. Two control groups were selected (who also had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination): users reporting a negative test at least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (controls 1) and users reporting a negative test at least 7 days after their second vaccination (controls 2). Controls 1 and controls 2 were matched (1:1) with cases 1 and cases 2, respectively, by the date of the post-vaccination test, health-care worker status, and sex. In the disease profile analysis, we sub-selected participants from cases 1 and cases 2 who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3 and cases 4, respectively). Controls 3 and controls 4 were unvaccinated participants reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 test who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after the test, and were matched (1:1) with cases 3 and 4, respectively, by the date of the positive test, health-care worker status, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and age. We used univariate logistic regression models (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) to analyse the associations between risk factors and post-vaccination infection, and the associations of individual symptoms, overall disease duration, and disease severity with vaccination status. Findings: Between Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021, 1 240 009 COVID Symptom Study app users reported a first vaccine dose, of whom 6030 (0·5%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 1), and 971 504 reported a second dose, of whom 2370 (0·2%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 2). In the risk factor analysis, frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults (≥60 years) after their first vaccine dose (odds ratio [OR] 1·93, 95% CI 1·50–2·48; p<0·0001), and individuals living in highly deprived areas had increased odds of post-vaccination infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 1·11, 95% CI 1·01–1·23; p=0·039). Individuals without obesity (BMI <30 kg/m2) had lower odds of infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 0·84, 95% CI 0·75–0·94; p=0·0030). For the disease profile analysis, 3825 users from cases 1 were included in cases 3 and 906 users from cases 2 were included in cases 4. Vaccination (compared with no vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more than five symptoms in the first week of illness following the first or second dose, and long-duration (≥28 days) symptoms following the second dose. Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older. Interpretation: To minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection, at-risk populations must be targeted in efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness and infection control measures. Our findings might support caution around relaxing physical distancing and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if these individuals are vaccinated, and might have implications for strategies such as booster vaccinations.

Over the past 50 years, the average temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history due to uncontrolled generation of greenhouse gases. Nuclear power is low carbon energy, and it is contributing on a large scale to a low carbon economy and a green energy grid. 442 nuclear power reactors are operating worldwide generating 393 GWe of electricity providing continuous and reliable low carbon power. Nuclear electricity accounts for 11% of total global electricity generation, and this amounts to a third of the low-carbon electricity produced in the world. New innovations are taking place which make nuclear power a more affordable and attractive energy option. These include advances in large reactors, emerging technologies such as advanced fuel and small modular reactors, engineering breakthroughs extending the operational lifetime of existing reactors, and new developments in materials and better waste management. Fast breeder reactor technology has become a commercial reality and it helps not only in generating electricity, but also in producing more fuel than it consumes, besides burning nuclear waste more efficiently compared to any of the existing commercial reactor technologies. The Sun's energy is generated by nuclear fusion. Mastering nuclear fusion technology can guarantee energy security in terms of clean, safe and affordable energy. Nuclear fusion, and plasma physics research of very complex nature are being carried out in many countries. Fusion reactions have been successfully demonstrated although for a fraction of a second and without demonstrating a net gain of electric power. The world's largest international fusion reactor facility called ITER is in an advanced stage of construction with the aim of demonstrating the scientific and technological success of fusion energy research for commercial production. Fusion fuel is plentiful and easily accessible. It is expected that fusion energy is the pathway towards energy security for thousands of years.

The empirical analysis employs a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model using a panel of Chinese provinces during the 2000–2010 time period. In support of a partial crowding-out view, public R&D subsidies allocated to large and medium-sized enterprises (LMEs) are found to increase total R&D inputs proxied by total R&D personnel, despite reducing privately-financed R&D inputs. Specifically, we find that an increase of R&D subsidies by one standard deviation decreases private R&D expenditures in LMEs by 6.5%, but increases total R&D personnel in LMEs by 2.6%. We also find evidence that the effects of R&D subsidies extend beyond their main effect on corporate R&D, promoting technological upgrading, capital deepening, and economic growth. We further find evidence suggesting some misallocation of research-oriented public funds.

For cultivated meat to fully mimic conventional meat's organoleptic and nutritional properties, innovations in scaffolding technology are required. Many scaffolding technologies are already developed for use in biomedical tissue engineering. However, cultivated meat production comes with a unique set of constraints related to the scale and cost of production as well as the necessary attributes of the final product, such as texture and food safety. This review discusses the properties of vertebrate skeletal muscle that will need to be replicated in a successful product and the current state of scaffolding innovation within the cultivated meat industry, highlighting promising scaffold materials and techniques that can be applied to cultivated meat development. Recommendations are provided for future research into scaffolds capable of supporting the growth of high-quality meat while minimizing production costs.

To explain such cases, we suggest integrating product and user innovation paradigms into the Producer-User Social Innovation (PUSI) Model that demonstrates how infrastructure and enabling technology is provided either by producer or user to introduce new market product or service. To provide face validity and illustrate the versatility of the proposed approach we consider five very different cases. These illustrative examples allowed to provide evidence that user-driven innovation is socially oriented in its nature as it implicitly addresses community or societal needs.

It initiates a discussion on the positioning of the Industry Commons Ecosystem (ICE) with respect to current research directions in advanced manufacturing and production systems that shape advances in engineering and technology, novel business models and innovation breakthroughs. The potential value of data sharing across industrial domains is estimated at over $100 billion, particularly in view of optimising manufacturing processes. Data sharing across domains however faces a series of well-documented challenges associated with the lack of semantic interoperability and related standards, management of trust and sustainability. Solving bottlenecks in data sharing requires a systemic approach to data management, which can account for all aspects of data use, levels of application, attribution and dynamic exchanges. In this paper we propose a high-level ecosystem approach that integrates societal values with digital affordances of industry’s cognitive-assisted processes, remote interfacing, hybrid applications and large-scale value networks. Early development of an Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES) is presented as the key enabling framework for Industry Commons interoperability and a series of enabling frameworks form the basis of future research directions in Trusted Data Sharing and Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management for greater sustainability.

The buckling-restrained brace (BRB) is one of these exciting innovations that are employed to increase the ductility capacity of traditional steel braced frames. Understanding the nonlinear response of these novel systems in estimating maximum displacements due to an earthquake has been of significant importance for structural designers. Accordingly, this research is carried out to study of deflection amplification factor (Cd) in BRBs, which have recently been presented in seismic design provisions as one of the seismic lateral-resisting systems. To this end, five 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15-story BRBs are modeled in the software framework of OpenSees. Ground motion simulation is performed by selecting several scaled earthquake records, and the values of elastic and ultimate displacements of structural systems are computed through pushover and nonlinear time-history analyses. The results showed that the deflection amplification factor suggested within famous building codes (such as ASCE-7-16) compared to the obtained values is, in some cases, for certainty; conversely, it is underestimated under some conditions.

In recent years, EWN researchers, in partnership with landscape architects (LAs) affiliated with the Dredge Research Collaborative (DRC), have championed an innovative, collaborative strategy that offers traditional planners an opportunity to participate in visioning exercises during the initial phases of coastal storm risk management projects. This has resulted in the identification, development, and incorporation of design concepts that prioritize NBS and the placement of natural and nature-based features (NNBF). These concepts, and their development process, have been documented in reports for the use of both the participating planners and other audiences interested in innovative NNBF. Upon observing these favorable outcomes, it has become clear that the integration of disciplines—landscape architecture, applied science, and engineering—has increased our ability to process, utilize, and communicate complex information. Both groups (i.e., DRC's LAs and EWN engineers and scientists) have considerable experience related to infrastructure design and performance; they elucidate ways to achieve functional engineering criteria while also maximizing ecological value and/or promoting more recreational opportunities. However, this partnership also produces a complementary set of uniquely acquired skills and expertise, which advances the development of NBS through accelerated and more meaningful communications. This study will offer insight into the partnership, collaborative techniques, and resulting products that have fostered innovation as well as advocacy for more sustainable infrastructure.

CoPS are defined as high-cost, engineering, and software-intensive goods, systems, networks, infrastructure, engineering constructs, and services. However, many differences between these two categories of industries have been reported by a large number of scholars. To address this shortcoming, this paper intends to study the evolution of Iran’s gas turbine sectoral innovation system as a CoPS industry. To this end, a qualitative approach and a case study research design were employed. To do this, we conducted 17 in-depth interviews, participated in different conferences and conventions, as well as studied various documents as secondary data. Our findings suggest that: firstly, technological capabilities in Iranian gas turbine producers have evolved from assembling to manufacturing, and re-designing existing gas turbines; Secondly, diverse and dynamic governmental policies associated with the gas turbine industry over the last two decades have played a key role in encouraging domestic firms to acquire technological capabilities; and thirdly, the large and growing domestic market not only justified investing in R&D and building infrastructure by the government but also contributed to improved interaction and collaboration between domestic and overseas’ companies. As the main policy implication, our paper suggests that the transition from product-using to product-manufacturing in CoPS industries is not an automatic process. It is important to design the corresponding policies and institutional arrangements following the evolving technological capabilities and demand conditions. Finally, this paper has contributed to sectoral innovation systems and CoPS literature by shedding light on the evolution of the gas turbine industry as CoPS in the context of Iran as a developing country with some restrictions in global technology collaborations.', authkeywords='co-evolution | complex product systems | gas turbine | Iran | sectoral innovation system', citedby_count=2, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85110850867', doi='10.1002/esp.5181', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Physical modelling of large wood (LW) processes relevant for river management: Perspectives from New Zealand and Switzerland', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Friedrich H.', afid='60140949;60025858;60005686', affilname='MIT School of Engineering;ETH Zürich;The University of Auckland', affiliation_city='Cambridge;Zurich;Auckland', affiliation_country='United States;Switzerland;New Zealand', author_count='7', author_names='Friedrich, Heide;Ravazzolo, Diego;Ruiz-Villanueva, Virginia;Schalko, Isabella;Spreitzer, Gabriel;Tunnicliffe, Jon;Weitbrecht, Volker', author_ids='23012109000;55332323300;35604536100;57193629497;57203956871;6601983479;6506786544', author_afids='60005686;60005686;60025858;60140949-60025858;60005686-60025858;60005686;60025858', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='January 2022', publicationName='Earth Surface Processes and Landforms', issn='01979337', source_id='25751', eIssn='10969837', aggregationType='Journal', volume='47', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='32-57', description='In the last 30 years, work on large wood (LW) has expanded and matured considerably, and river scientists, managers and practitioners now have a better appreciation of the role of LW in maintaining ecosystems, forming or stabilizing riverine landforms, and interacting with river morphodynamics. We have gained a better understanding of the hazards posed by the recruitment and transport of LW in the river channel and associated infrastructure. While LW dynamics have traditionally been studied in the natural river environment, innovations in laboratory techniques have enabled important advances in understanding LW process dynamics, using physical scale models, new sensors, scanners and sophisticated model boundary conditions. Current trends in LW laboratory research focus on (1) mobilization and transport of logs, (2) trapping and deposition of sediment in the presence of LW and (3) LW contribution to hydraulic flow resistance. Ultimately, a combined process understanding is needed to assess impacts upon infrastructure with erodible boundaries, such as bridge piers and LW retention racks. In this review, we present a critical analysis of emerging experimental work on LW obtained through physical modelling studies. We put recent experimental work in context with global LW management challenges. In particular, we set our work in context with the present environmental and engineering issues that confront catchment and natural resource managers in Switzerland and New Zealand.

The literature on the process of anthropogenic risk creation is limited and piecemeal, and there has been far greater emphasis on using reactive approaches to deal with anthropogenic risks (e.g. risk management) rather than on employing proactive approaches to avert further risk creation (e.g. responsible innovation). An obvious starting point for averting or reducing future anthropogenic risk creation is to understand better the generic features of the risk creation process and to identify points at which the creation process might be better controlled or averted. To this end, this paper presents a simplified conceptual Model of Anthropogenic Risk Creation (MARC) that provides a broad descriptive overview of the sequential stages that appear to have been evident in several historic and contemporary instances of anthropogenic risk creation. By explicating the stages in the risk creation process, MARC highlights the key points at which more attention could be given (e.g. by innovators, policymaker, regulators) to implementing or encouraging greater risk prevention or limitation. Moreover, MARC can help to stimulate critical debate about the extent to which humanity inadvertently creates adverse conditions, such as those that inhibit human prosperity and sustainability, and the extent to which anthropogenic risk creation is adequately understood, researched and managed. This paper also critically reflects upon related issues, such as risk creation as a learning process and the relative merits of initiatives to promote greater responsibility in research and innovation.

Purpose & Method: The aim of this literature review is to provide insight into Learning Progressions (LPs) published globally for primary and secondary school level. In setting out the context and parameters for the study the paper identifies and compares definitions for LPs. It synthesises emergent themes from 25 academic papers. Findings: Four main findings were deducted from the data papers. Firstly, UK curricular were not discussed. Secondly, within the dataset near parity between science and engineering-focused papers was revealed. Thirdly, of the data papers reviewed nearly the same number used pre-existing definitions of LPs to those that did not offer any definition or description of LP. Furthermore, around half this number created their own, or used a generalised description of LPs. Finally, the data papers highlighted a lack of common definition for engineering education LPs, unlike science LPs. None of the data papers provided an LP specific to engineering education aligned to the National Curriculum (NC) in England. Conclusions: Four recommendations emerge: i) engineering education should be recognised as a distinct subject within the NC for England; ii) more academic research and curriculum development is required within the field of engineering education LP specifically aligned with the NC in England; iii) industry and education would benefit from further collaboration to ensure that their respective needs and positions are adequately met through schools; iv) teacher professional development and resources need focused auditing and investment.', authkeywords='engineering curriculum | Engineering learning progression | primary school | secondary school', citedby_count=1, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr='RAENG', fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor='Royal Academy of Engineering'), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85089902661', doi='10.1177/0306419020950751', pii=None, pubmed_id=None, title='Implementing a joint learning method (PBL and EBL) to innovate the development of mechanical engineering technical and non-technical skills', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Sanchez-Gomez C.A.', afid='60052106', affilname='Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia', affiliation_city='Bogota', affiliation_country='Colombia', author_count='1', author_names='Sanchez-Gomez, Carlos A.', author_ids='57188836280', author_afids='60052106', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='January 2022', publicationName='International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education', issn='03064190', source_id='12387', eIssn='20504586', aggregationType='Journal', volume='50', issueIdentifier='1', article_number=None, pageRange='176-196', description='In engineering education, traditional teaching practices continue to be replaced by inquiry-based learning methods such as problem-based learning, which is now a ubiquitous practice in engineering schools.

This research proposes a pedagogical innovation by using a joint learning method, example-based learning (EBL) and problem-based learning (PBL), to improve learning outcomes. Using a posttest-only quasi-experimental design, machining laboratory practices in mechanical engineering were designed to use EBL only (control group) in one academic semester and both PBL and EBL (quasi-experimental group) the next academic semester. To account for the difference in cohorts, the difference-in-differences method was used to determine the impact of the addition of PBL. Students provided qualitative data to ascertain their perceptions using the joint method. The addition of the PBL method to the EBL method has a positive but statistically insignificant impact on posttest scores. PBL fosters the acquisition of non-technical skills such as communication, coordination, and teamwork, even when such skills are not taught. The combination of PBL and EBL works in synergy and fosters the development of technical and non-technical skills in engineering educational practice.', authkeywords='engineering education | Example-based learning | pedagogical practice | problem-based learning', citedby_count=8, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None), Document(eid='2-s2.0-85088588391', doi='10.1016/j.technovation.2020.102162', pii='S0166497218306023', pubmed_id=None, title='Crossing the valley of death: Five underlying innovation processes', subtype='ar', subtypeDescription='Article', creator='Ellwood P.', afid='60116446;60012070;117141394', affilname='University of Liverpool Management School;University of Leeds;Technical Products Ltd', affiliation_city='Liverpool;Leeds;London', affiliation_country='United Kingdom;United Kingdom;United Kingdom', author_count='3', author_names='Ellwood, Paul;Williams, Ceri;Egan, John', author_ids='57516745200;57216793720;57218398095', author_afids='60116446;60012070;117141394', coverDate='2022-01-01', coverDisplayDate='January 2022', publicationName='Technovation', issn='01664972', source_id='14726', eIssn=None, aggregationType='Journal', volume='109', issueIdentifier=None, article_number='102162', pageRange=None, description='The aim of this paper is to elucidate the innovation processes of technology development across the Valley of Death.

When implemented to deal with risks from new technologies, it must also contribute to enhancing innovation, rather than constraining it, in such a way that innovation itself can also contribute to reducing risks. To increase its relevance to some of the challenges that managers face, RG must constantly adapt to the objectives and priorities of organisations, as well as their supporting values. One of these priorities in Europe and elsewhere is that organisations develop research and innovation in a way that is 'responsible'. Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is thus defined by the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme as ‘an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and innovation’. This article addresses the difficulties of implementing RRI principles in the practice and suggests that an analogy can be made between processes in place for RG and processes that could be developed for RRI. It further suggests that RG could be used to support the development of RRI. The practice of RG can offer relevant ways to assess and manage RRI and provide guidance for the development of procedural and normative RRI. Embedding RRI in practice is a challenge that requires considerations at the organisational and individual level. This article concludes by suggesting questions that researchers can consider to ensure that their work is in line with expectations from both effective RG and RRI.\", authkeywords='responsible research and innovation | Risk governance | RRI', citedby_count=7, openaccess=0, freetoread=None, freetoreadLabel=None, fund_acr=None, fund_no='undefined', fund_sponsor=None)]\n"
